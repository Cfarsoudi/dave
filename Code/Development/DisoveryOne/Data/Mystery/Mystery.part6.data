	INT. BASEMENT - EVENING

	A NAKED LIGHTBULB SPARKS TO LIFE.  It dangles from the ceiling of
	a basement.

	LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS AS ANNA CROWE moves down the stairs.

	Anna is the rare combination of beauty and innocence.  She stands
	in the chilly basement in an elegant summer dress that outlines
	her slender body.  Her gentle eyes move across the empty room and
	come to rest on a rack of wine bottles covering one entire wall.

	She walks to the bottles.  Her fingertips slide over the labels.
	She stops when she finds just the right one.  A tiny smile as she
	slides it out.

	Anna turns to leave.  Stops.  She stares at the shadowy basement.
	It's an unsettling place.  She stands very still and watches her
	breath form a TINY CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR.  She's visibly
	uncomfortable.

	Anna Crowe moves for the staircase in a hurry.  Each step faster
	than the next.  She climbs out of the basement in another burst
	of LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS.

	WE HEAR HER HIT THE LIGHT SWITCH.

	THE LIGHTBULB DIES.  DRIPPING BLACK DEVOURS THE ROOM.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING

	Two place settings are arranged on the living room coffee table.
	Take-out Chinese food sits half eaten on good china.  An empty
	bottle of red wine sits between boxes of Chinese food.

	Anna arrives with the backup bottle and is now wearing a sweater.
	She hands a collegiate rowing team sweatshirt to Malcolm.

			     ANNA
		It's getting cold.

	MALCOLM CROWE sits on the floor at the coffee table, his vest and
	tie on the sofa behind him.  A jacket and an overcoat lay on a
	brirfcase next to him.

	Malcolm is in his thirties with thick, wavy hair and striking,
	intelligent eyes that squint from years of intense study.  His
	charming, easy-going smile spreads across his face.  He points.

			     MALCOLM
		That's one fine frame.  A fine
		frame it is.

	Malcolm points to the HUGE FRAMED CERTIFICATE propped up on a
	dining room chair.  It's printed on aged parchment-type paper.
	The frame is a polished mahogany.

	He slips on the sweatshirt.

			     MALCOLM
		How much does a fine frame like
		that cost, you think?

	Anna hands the backup bottle over to Malcolm.

			     ANNA
			(smiling)
		I've never told you...  but you
		sound a little like Dr. Seuss when
		you're drunk.

	Malcolm uncorks the wine and starts pouring in the empty glass.

			     MALCOLM
		Anna, I'm serious.  Serious I am,
		Anna.

	Anna giggles.  She's clearly buzzed herself.  Malcolm doesn't get
	it.  Anna takes a few calming sips of her wine.  Her attention
	slowly moves to the framed certificate.

			     ANNA
		Mahogany.  I'd say that cost at
		least a couple hundred.  Maybe
		three.

			     MALCOLM
		Three?  We should hock it.  Buy a
		C.D. rack for the bedroom.

			     ANNA
		Do you know how important this is?
		This is big time.
			(beat)
		I'm going to read it for you,
		doctor.

			     MALCOLM
		Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?

	Anna ignores Malcolm and clears her throat.  She leans forward
	her seat and reads the certificate out loud as Malcolm tries to
	tickle her.

			     ANNA
		In recognition for his outstanding
		achievement in the field of child
		psychology, his dedication to his
		work, and his continuing efforts to
		improve the quality of life for
		countless children and their
		families, the City of Philadelphia
		proudly bestows upon its son Dr.
		Malcolm Crowe...  That's you...
		the Mayor's Citation for
		Professional Excellence.

	Beat.  The power of the words sobers the two of them.

			     ANNA
		Wow.  They called you their son.

			     MALCOLM
		We can keep it in the bathroom.

	Anna turns to Malcolm.  He smiles.

			     MALCOLM
		It's not real, Anna.  Some
		secretary wrote that up.  Don't
		tell me you thought it was real?

	Anna's expression becomes serious.


			     MALCOLM
		What?

	She just keeps staring.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Don't do the quiet thing.  You know
		I hate it.

	Beat.

			     ANNA
		This is an important night for us.
		Finally someone is recognizing the
		sacrifices you made.  That you have
		put everything second, including me,
		for those families they're talking
		about.

	Malcolm plays softly with her face.  Anna takes his hands and
	holds them steady.

			     ANNA
		They're also saying that my husband
		has a gift.  Not an ordinary gift
		that allows him to hit a ball over a
		fence.  Or a gift that lets him
		produce beautiful images on a
		canvas...  Your gift teaches
		children how to be strong in
		situations where most adults would
		piss on themselves.
			(beat)
		Yes, I believe what they wrote
		about you.

	Anna lets go of his hands.  Anna's eyes are emotional.  Malcolm
	smiles softly.

			     MALCOLM
		Thank you.

	Anna leans towards him.  They hold each other tight.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		What are we hugging about again?

	Anna laughs as she wipes her eyes.

			     ANNA
		Nothing.  There wasn't supposed to
		be any crying at this celebration.
		Just a lot of drinking and sex.

	Malcolm's charming, easy-going smile returns.

			     MALCOLM
		I would like some red wine in a
		glass.

	Anna hands him his glass.  He stares at it.

			     MALCOLM
		I would not like it in a mug.  I
		would not like it in a jug.

	Malcolm looks at Anna surprised at what he said.  They crack up
	laughing.  THEIR SWEET LAUGHTER FILLS THE HOUSE.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	TWO GIGGLING SHADOWS APPEAR IN THE BEDROOM DOORWAY.  They try to
	turn on the light.  It doesn't come on.

			     MALCOLM
		Bulb's out.

	Anna giggles some more as Malcolm's shadow stumbles across the
	bedroom.

	MALCOLM TURNS ON THE BATHROOM LIGHT.

	A SHAFT OF LIGHT falls on Anna as she stands in the corner of the
	room.

	Anna smiles playfully and pulls off her sweater.  She sways to a
	pretend striptease song.

	Malcolm can't hold back his grin.  He joins in -- slowly peeling
	off the sweat-shirt.  He looks back to Anna.  She's stopped her
	playful dance.  She's facing away from him.

	He walks towards her.  HIS GRIN QUIETLY DISAPPEARS.  Malcolm's
	face turns to rock as his attention is drawn to the SHATTERED
	WINDOW in their bedroom.  The wind moves through the room.  A
	lamp lays broken on the ground by the window.

	Malcolm kneels down.  Beat.  Anna's eyes fill with a quiet
	awareness.

			     ANNA
		He's still in the house.

	A SHADOW FROM THE BATHROOM FLATS OVER BOTH OF THEM.

	ANNA SCREAMS.

	Malcolm spins around.  His heart stops.

	Malcolm and Anna stare at the bathroom doorwary.  They know
	someone is inside.  Beat.

	Malcolm slowly starts towards the door.  The first thing that
	comes into view are the clothes on the bathroom floor.  Then the
	figure of a man comes into view.  A STRANGER stands bare chested
	in the back of the bathroom.

	NO ONE MAKES A SOUND.

	The STRANGER is about nineteen.  Drugged out.  Pitch black eyes
	bulging.  His body is covered in scars and bruises.  His hands
	are folded in front of him.  He shakes ever so slightly.  He has a
	patch of white in his hair.

	Malcolm speaks in a very calm voice.  Never takes his eyes off
	the stranger.

			     MALCOLM
		Anna, don't move.  Don't say a word.

	Anna barely nods her understanding.

			     MALCOLM
			(to the stranger)
		This is forty-seven Locust Street.
		You have broken a window and
		entered a private residence.  Do
		you understand what I'm saying?

	The stranger slowly looks up for the first time.  His eyes lock
	on Malcolm.

			     STRANGER
		You don't know so many things.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		There are no needles or
		prescription drugs of any kind in
		this house.

	The stranger suddenly comes forward into the doorway.  Malcolm
	stumbles back onto the edge of the bed.

	Anna sees the stranger for the first time.  Her face drains of
	color.

	The stranger looks at Malcolm.  He half grins.

			     STRANGER
		Are you drunk?

	The stranger's stare slides to Anna.

			     STRANGER
		Did you get him drunk?

	The stranger gazes at Anna.  Gazes directly into her eyes.  A
	penetrating, unwavering stare.


			     STRANGER
		Do you know why you're scared when
		you're alone?

	Anna's expression instanly changes.

			     STRANGER
		I know.

	BEAT.  THE ROOM GOES SILENT.

			     MALCOLM
		What do you want?  I don't
		understand what you want.

	The stranger turns and glares at Malcolm.

			     STRANGER
		What you promised.

	Malcolm stops all movement.

			     ANNA
		--My God.

			     MALCOLM
		--Do I know you?

			     STRANGER
		Let's all celebrate, Dr. Malcolm
		Crowe. Recipient of awards from the
		Mayor on the news.  Dr. Malcolm
		Crowe, he's helped so many children...
		And he doesn't even remember my
		name?

	Malcolm can't speak.  Beat.  The stranger's face starts to
	tremble.

			     STRANGER
		I was ten when you worked with me.

	Beat.  Malcolm's intelligent eyes race for answers.

			     STRANGER
		Downtown clinic?  Single parent
		family?
			(beat)
		I had a possible mood disorder...
			(beat)
		I had no friends... you said I was
		socially isolated.
			(beat)
		I was afraid -- you called it acute
		anxiety...
			(beat)
		You were wrong.
			(beat)
		Come on, clear your head...  Male,
		nine...  Single parent...  Mood
		discorder... Acute anxiety.

	Malcolm looks like someone hit him with a sledgehammer.

			     STRANGER
		I'm nineteen.  I have drugs in my
		system twenty-four hours a day...
		I still have no friends.  I still
		have no peace.  I'm still afraid.

	Tears jump into the stranger's eyes.

			     STRANGER
		...I'm still afraid.

	Malcolm stands.

			     MALCOLM
		Please give me a second to think.

	Malcolm's shaking hands touch his mouth as he stares at the
	stranger.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Bed Freidken?

			     STRANGER
		Some people call me freak.

			     MALCOLM
		...Ronald...  Ronald Sumner?

	Tears fall down the stranger's face.

			     STRANGER
		I am a freak.

	Malcolm looks up at the sound of those words.  Something clicks
	in his head.

			     MALCOLM
		--Vincent?

	THE ROOM GOES SILENT AGAIN.

			     MALCOLM
		Vincent Gray?

	VINCENT GRAY stares with surprise through his tears.

	Malcolm lets out a deep breath like he just emerged from deep
	waters.

			     MALCOLM
		I do remember you, Vincent.  You
		were a good kid.  Very smart...
		Quiet...  Compassionate...
		Unusually compassionate...

	Vincent's eyes burn at Malcolm.

			     VINCENT
		You forgot cursed.

	VINCENT is fully crying now.

			     VINCENT
		You failed me.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		Vincent...  I'm sorry I didn't help
		you...  I can try to help you now.

	Vincent turns to the sink.  His hand goes in.  He turns arund and
	raises a gun at Malcolm.  He FIRES.  A VIOLENT, EAR-SHATTERING
	ECHO.  Malcolm clutches his stomach and folds like a rag doll
	onto the bed.

	Vincent instantly moves the gun to his own head.  ANOTHER
	HORRIFIC BLAST SPIKES THE AIR.  Vincent crumples onto the
	bathroom floor.

	ANNA'S CHILLING SCREAMS FILL THEIR HOME.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BENCH - AFTERNOON

	The legend, "Two Years Later" appears.

	A man flips open a worn file folder on his lap.  Handwritten
	notes fill every line.  At the top of the first page reads,
	"Vincent Gray, age 10, Referred January 19, 1989."

	The man's hand touches the name almost reverently.

	He glances through the page.  Words and phrases are circled
	throughout the file.

	"...Acute anxiety"
	"...Socially isolated"
	"...Possible mood disorder"
	"...Parent status -- Divorced"
	"...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad"

	The man's hands flip the page.  At the top of this new page
	reads, "Cole Sear, age 8, Referred September 1998."

	As the man's fingers move through the notes we again see words
	and phrases circled throughout this new case history.

	"...Acute anxiety"
	"...Socially isolated"
	"...Possible mood disorder"
	"...Parent status -- Divorced"
	"...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad"

	The hands close the notepad.  The hands are slightly shaking now.

	WE PULL BACK to reveal the shaking hands belong to Dr. Malcolm
	Crowe.

	Malcolm sits on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes
	across the street.  He gazes blankly at the brownstones.  Beat.

	A door opens.  Malcolm is brought out of his trance.

	COLE SEAR steps out his front door.  Cole is a munchkin of a boy
	with large, black eyes that seem to take in everything around
	him.

	His hair is dark, with a small patch of jet white on the side.
	Cole carefully locks the door behind him.

	He moves to the bottom of the stairs and looks around nervously.
	Anxiously.

	The eight-year-old child reaches into his pocket and slips on a
	pair of VERY LARGE GLASSES.  They look comical on him.

	Malcolm rises to his feet.  He smooths out his shirt.  Looks down
	and buttons his jacket.

	When he looks up, Cole is gone.

	Malcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy.  Cole runs at full
	speed down the street and turns the corner.  TINY SNEAKERS
	SCREECHING ON THE SIDEWALK.

	For a second, Malcolm doesn't react.  The second passes.  He
	stuffs the file in his bag and starts running too.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Malcolm hauls down the sidewalk.  He comes to a hard stop at a
	street intersection.  Searches.  Spots Cole running into a
	parking lot.

	COLE sprints across the empty lot and reaches the doors of a
	building.  He has to use all his strength to push open the highly
	ornate doors.  He slips inside.

	Malcolm jogs into the parking area.  His pace slows to a walk and
	then to stillness as he gazes up at the building.  Its old stone
	and huge towers make it stand out from the modern buildings all
	around it.  Malcolm stares up at the historic Philadelphia church
	quietly.

	A SHOOTING PAIN PIERCES HIS SIDE.  Malcolm's hand goes to it
	quickly.  He waits for it to pass before starting for the ornate
	doors.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CHURCH - DAY

	Only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews.

	Malcolm scans the majestic room and finds what he's looking for
	in the last row of the church.

	He moves down the center aisle towards the back.

	Malcolm finds Cole playing in his pew with a set of green and
	beige plastic soldiers.  Cole makes the soldiers talk to each
	other.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		Pro... Fun... Add...

	The words are unintelligible.

	Cole senses someone.  He looks up and sees Malcolm staring at
	him.  The boy immediately goes white.  Every cell of his body
	still with fear.

			     MALCOLM
		It's okay, Cole.  Don't be
		frightened.

	Cole stays rigid.  Hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen.

			     MALCOLM
		My name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe.  I
		was supposed to meet you today.
		Sorry I missed our appointment.

	Malcolm waits for a response.  None comes.

			     MALCOLM
		Do you mind if I sit down?  I have
		this injury from a couple of years
		ago and it flares up every once in
		a while just so I won't forget it.

	Beat.  Cole slowly slides down the pew, giving Malcolm most of
	the seat.  Malcolm sits.

	Cole fidgets with his soldiers.  Beat.  Malcolm looks over and
	stares at Cole's glasses.  He leans forward to inspect them more
	carefully.

			     MALCOLM
		Your eye frames.  They don't seem to
		have any lenses in them.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		They're my dad's.  The lenses hurt
		my eyes.

			     MALCOLM
		I knew there was a sound explanation.

	Malcolm returns to staring at his lap.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		What was that you were saying
		before with your soldiers?  Day pro
		fun.

			     COLE
		...De profundis clamo ad te domine.

	Malcolm stares surprised.

			     COLE
		It's called Latin.  It's a
		language.

	Malcolm nods at the information.

			     MALCOLM
		All your soldiers speak Latin?

			     COLE
		No, just one.

	Malcolm smiles at Cole.  His eyes drift down to Cole's arms.
	Malcolm's smile slowly disappears.

	Cole's arms are covered in TINY CUTS AND BRUISES.  Some almost
	healed.  Some fresh.  Malcolm looks around to gather himself.
	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		I like churches, too.
			(beat)
		In olden times, in Europe, people
		used to hide in churches.  Claim
		sanctuary.

	Cole looks up.

			     COLE
		What were they hiding from?

			     MALCOLM
		Oh, lots of things, I suppose.  Bad
		people for one.  People who wanted
		to imprison them.  Hurt them.

			     COLE
		Nothing bad can happen in a church,
		right?

	Malcolm studies Cole's anxious face.

			     MALCOLM
		Right.

	Malcolm and Cole just stare at each other.

			     COLE
		I forgot your name.

			     MALCOLM
		Dr. Crowe.

			     COLE
		You're a doctor.  What kind?

			     MALCOLM
		I work with young people who might
		be sad or upset or just want to
		talk.  I try to help them figure
		things out.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Are you a good doctor?

	Malcolm smiles.

			     MALCOLM
		I got an award once.  From the
		Mayor.

			     COLE
		Congratulations.

			     MALCOLM
		Thank you.  It was a long time ago.
		I've kind of been retired for a
		while.
			(beat)
		You're my very first client back.

			     COLE
		You use needles?

			     MALCOLM
		No.

			     COLE
		Not even little ones that aren't
		supposed to hurt?

			     MALCOLM
		No.

			     COLE
		That's good.

	Cole pockets his soldiers and rises from his pew.

			     COLE
		I'm going to see you again, right?

			     MALCOLM
		If it's okay with you?

	Cole thinks it over carefully.

			     COLE
		It's okay with me.

	Cole and Malcolm just stare at each other.

			     MALCOLM
		And Cole, next time I won't be late
		for you.

			     COLE
		Next time I won't be scared of you.

	Cole turns and starts to the rear of the church.  Malcolm loses
	himself in his thoughts.

	When Malcolm looks back, he sees Cole stop by the exit doors and
	take a tiny STATUE OF JESUS off the back table.  Cole pockets the
	statue and quietly leaves the church.

	Malcolm just sits and stares.

							CUT TO:

	INT. MALCOLM'S HOME - EVENING

	The house is dimly lit.  Malcolm has to turn on the HALLWAY LIGHT.

			     MALCOLM
		It's me.

	He stops before a pile of mail collecting on a thin table.  He
	stares at it blankly.  Almost every envelope has "Over Due" or
	"Final Notice" stamped on it.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DINING TABLE - EVENING

	Malcolm stares down at the remains of a meal on the only place
	setting on the table.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - EVENING

	Malcolm quietly walks into his bedroom.  Only A READING LIGHT IS
	ON.  THE SOFT LIGHT FALLS ON ANNA AS SHE SLEEPS.

	Malcolm moves to her side.  The sight of her stops him.

	He stares at his wife...

	She huddles under a blanket, a wad of tissues in her hand.  He
	takes it in silently.

	His eyes move to her face...  One wisp of hair falls over her
	soft lips.  OUTLINED IN THE SOFT READING LIGHT, Anna Crowe truly
	looks like an angel.

	Malcolm forms a tiny smile.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	Malcolm turns and moves for a narrow door in the hallway.

	THE DOOR KNOB.  He tries to open it.  IT'S LOCKED.  Malcolm
	reaches into his pockets.  Searches for his keys.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

	The empty basement is no longer empty.  It's piled with file
	cabinets and boxes of psychology and medical books.  A desk sits
	in the corner next to the wine racks.

	The room still feels unsettling.

	Malcolm hunches over one of the books.  Rifles through a stack of
	dusty books.  Pulls out a thick text.

	The spine of the text reads, "The Meridian Latin Dictionary."

	Malcolm sits back at his desk and opens Cole's file.  Handwritten
	on the first page are the words,

		"De profundis calms ad te, domine"

	Malcolm starts working through the Latin text.  As he comes to
	each word, he jots it down underneath the Latin.

	Malcolm translates the last word.

	He stares quietly at the paper.  The new words reads...

		"Out of the depths, I cry to you Lord."

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		...The mass for the dead.

	The words seem to hang in the air forever.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. PHILADELPHIA - DAWN

	Old Philadelphia awakens...  For a moment, it's like we're back
	in time.

	A golden sun dances on the waters of Penns Landing.  Historical
	old ships sit docked in its harbor...  The dark bronze surface of
	the Liberty Bell reflects the dawn...  A majestic Independence
	Hall stands watch as its city begins to stir...  A thirty foot
	statue of Ben Franklin makes a proud silhouette against the
	morning sky...

	AND THEN 1997 COMES CRASHING IN.

	FLUORESCENT HOUSE LIGHTS COME ON IN WINDOWS...  Jeeps and
	hatchbacks start roaming the cobblestone streets...  Neon
	restaurants signs flicker to life...  Traffic helicopters make
	their rounds...  CAR ALARMS PIERCE THE AIR.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING

	A hand turns off a radio, shutting off the morning news.

	A small dog with two different colored eyes sticks his head out
	of the dryer, where he plays with the newly-dried clothes.

	LYNN SEAR reaches in and pulls out a blouse.

	She shakes it in the air and slips it on as she dresses hurriedly
	for work.

	Lynn is a woman in her late twenties.  One hundred percent South
	Philly.  Hair teased.  She chews on an early morning piece of
	Trident.  Under all of it, Lynn Sear is an attractive and
	sweet-looking young woman.

	Lynn enters THE KITCHEN through a swinging door.

	A bowl of cereal and milk sit on a table in an empty kitchen.

	Lynn stares at a handful of kitchen CABINETS and DRAWERS that are
	open.

	Lynn shakes her head.

			     LYNN
		Cole.

	She closes them one at a time before moving to the coffee machine.

	Lynn shivers a little.  She leans over the thermostat and raises
	the heat.  She returns to her post at the coffee machine.

	TINY FOOTSTEPS.

	Lynn turns to see Cole standing in his private school uniform.

			     LYNN
		Your Cocoa Puffs are getting soggy.

	Lynn walks over to Cole.  Checks his tie.

			     LYNN
		You got a spot.

	Lynn unclips the tie.  Cole takes a seat at the kitchen table as
	Lynn walks back into the laundry room.

	The dog is gone now.  Lynn reaches into the dryer, digging for a
	new tie.  She finds one, then turns and steps back into the
	kitchen and SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS.

	Every cabinet and every drawer is wide open.

	Cole sits at the kitchen table.  His hands are pressed flat on
	the tabletop.

	He looks shaken.

	Neither says anything for a beat.

			     LYNN
			(shaken)
		Something you were looking for,
		baby?

	Beat.

			     COLE
			(shaken)
		Pop Tarts.

	Lynn looks over to the open cabinet near the sink.  The pop tarts
	are clearly visible.

			     LYNN
		They're right here.

			     COLE
		Oh.

	Cole gets up from the table.  Takes his pop tarts.  Doesn't make
	eye contact.

			     COLE
		What are you thinking, Momma?

			     LYNN
		Lots of things.

			     COLE
		Anything bad about me?

	Lynn leans down.

			     LYNN
		Look at my face.

	Cole does.

			     LYNN
		I wasn't thinking anything bad
		about you, got it?

	He looks at her eyes.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Got it.

	THE DOOR BELL RINGS.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		That's Tommy, Momma.

	Cole quietly kisses his mother on the cheek and starts out.

			     LYNN
		Don't you want this?

	Cole turns to see Lynn holding the pop tarts.  He walks back and
	takes them from her before leaving.

	Beat.  Lynn glances to the kitchen table.  Her gaze stops on the
	TWO TINY HAND PRINTS OF SWEAT formed on the table's surface.

	Lynn stands motionless in the kitchen.  She looks up and wraps
	her arms around her shivering shoulders.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BROWNSTONE STREET - MORNING

	TOMMY TAMMISIMO is a tough-looking, eight-year-old Italian kid
	who waits at the bottom of Cole's brownstone stairs in his school
	uniform.

	Cole emerges from the brownstone and moves down the steps.
	Lynn's face appears in the kitchen window.

	The two boys begin their walk down the street to school.  Tommy
	puts his arm around Cole.  Lynn waves.  Cole waves back.

	When the two boys turn the corner and are out of Lynn's sight,
	Tommy rips his arm away.

			     TOMMY
		Hey freak, how'd you like the "arm
		around your shoulder" bit.  I just
		made it up.  Went with it.  That's
		what great actors do.  It's called
		improv.

	Tommy starts to run ahead, he turns and back pedals.

			     TOMMY
			(taunting)
		Be careful...  I hope no one jumps
		out and gets you.

	Tommy runs away.

	Beat.  Cole looks around nervously.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. ST. ANTHONY'S ACADEMY - MORNING

	The last uniformed boys and girls rush into the front doors of
	St. Anthony's Academy as the FINAL BELL SOUNDS.

	Cole is the last one to go in.  He stands alone on the sidewalk.
	He looks like he'd rather be anywhere but there.

	Beat.

	He buries his hands in his pockets and begins a quiet walk by
	himself into the school.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. COLE'S HOME - AFTERNOON

	The front door CREAKS open as Cole walks in after school.  He
	looks around before closing the door.  His eyes stop on Lynn
	seated in the open doorway of the den.  Malcolm is seated with
	her.  They both look up.

	Lynn comes out.  She reaches Cole -- kneels down in front of him.

			     LYNN
			(whispers)
		How was school, baby?

	Cole shrugs.

			     LYNN
			(whispers)
		You know, you can tell me things if
		you need to.

	Cole doesn't respond.  Beat.

			     LYNN
			(whispers)
		Well, you know what I did today?

	Cole shakes his head "No."

			     LYNN
			(whispers)
		I won the Pennsylvania Lottery in
		the morning.  I quit my jobs.  Ate
		a big picnic in the park with lots
		of chocolate mouses pie and then
		swam in the fountain all afternoon...
			(smiling)
		What did you do?

	Cole starts to smile too.  He thinks.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		I was picked first for kickball
		teams at recess.  I hit a grand
		slam to win the game and everyone
		lifted me up on their shoulders and
		carried me around cheering.

	Cole and Lynn smile at each other.  Beat.

	Lynn tries to hide the utter sadness behind her smile.

			     LYNN
		I'll make triangle pancakes.  You
		got an hour.

	Lynn takes Cole's school bag and jacket before moving to the
	kitchen.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DEN - AFTERNOON

	The den doubles as a playroom.  Boxes of old toys sit in the
	corner.  A small, plastic, multi-colored table sits on the rug.

	Cole appears in the doorway.  Malcolm sits up and smiles.

	He points to the chair on the other side of the coffee table.

			     MALCOLM
		You want to sit?

	Cole nods very softly, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		Don't feel like talking right now?

	Cole nods again very softly, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		How about we play a game first?

	Cole looks a little more interested.

			     MALCOLM
		It's a mind-reading game...  Did I
		mention I could read minds?

	Cole nods, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		Here's the game.  I'll read your
		mind.  If what I say is right, you
		take a step forwards the chair.  If
		I'm wrong, you take a step
		backwards the doorway.  If you
		reach the chair, you sit.  If you
		reach the door, you can go.  Deal?

	Cole tilts his head, then nods, "Yes."

	Malcolm presses his fingers to his temples like a vaudeville
	magician.  He closes his eyes tight.

			     MALCOLM
		Just after your mom and dad were
		divorced, your mom went to a doctor
		like me and it didn't help her.
		And so you think I'm not going to
		help you.

	Beat.  Cole, surprised, takes a small step forward.

			     MALCOLM
		You're worried because she said she
		told him things.  Things she
		couldn't tell anybody else.
			(beat)
		Secrets.

	Cole takes a step.  Malcolm opens his eyes.  He looks right at
	Cole.

			     MALCOLM
		You have a secret.  But you don't
		want to tell me.

	Beat.  Cole takes another step.  The next step will put him at
	the chair.  Malcolm lowers his fingers from his temple.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		You don't have to tell me your
		secret if you don't want to.

	Malcolm smiles.  Returns his fingers to the mind-reading
	position.  Malcolm looks to Cole's arm.  Cole is wearing A LARGE
	SILVER WATCH.  It swims on his thin wrist.  It could probably
	slide up to his shoulder.  Malcolm closes his eyes.

			     MALCOLM
		Your father gave you that watch as
		a present before he left.

	Cole takes a step BACK.  Beat.  Malcolm lowers his hands
	surprised.

			     COLE
		He forgot it in a drawer.  It
		doesn't work.

	Beat.  Malcolm puts his fingers to his temple.  This time a
	little bit slower.  He gazes at Cole's school uniform.

			     MALCOLM
		You don't like to say much at
		school.  You're an excellent
		student however.  You've never been
		in any kind of serious trouble.

	Beat.  Cole takes a slow step back.  Beat.

			     COLE
		We were supposed to draw a picture.
		Anything we wanted...  I drew a man.
		He got hurt in the neck by another
		man with a screwdriver.

	AN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE OVERTAKES THE DEN.

			     MALCOLM
		You saw that on T.V., Cole?

	Cole answers by taking a small step back.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Everybody got upset.  They had a
		meeting.  Momma started crying.
			(beat)
		I don't draw like that anymore.

			     MALCOLM
		How do you draw now?

			     COLE
		I draw people with smiles, dogs
		running, and rainbows.
			(beat)
		They don't have meetings about
		rainbows.

			     MALCOLM
			(soft)
		I guess they don't.

	Malcolm looks down at Cole's feet.  They're almost at the
	doorway.  One more step and he's there.  Cole is very still.  He
	doesn't move at all.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		What am I thinking now?

	Malcolm takes his time before speaking.  He just stares.  No
	fingers to the temple.  No games.  He just stares.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		You're thinking...
			(beat)
		I don't know what you're thinking,
		Cole.

	Cole quietly takes a step back into the doorway of the other room.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		I was thinking...  you're nice.
			(beat)
		But you can't help me.

	Cole's tiny figure steps away.  Malcolm stares helplessly at the
	empty doorway where his client used to stand.

	THE DEN IS SUFFOCATED WITH SILENCE.

							CUT TO:

	INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING

	Malcolm hurriedly enters a spacious, dimly-lit Italian
	restaurant.  He stops in the dining room and searches the many
	candle-lit tables.  He finds Anna.

	Anna sits alone at a corner table.  The remains of her half-eaten
	dinner lay on the only place setting on the table.  A small PIECE
	OF CAKE WITH A CANDLE in it sits untouched.

	Anna stirs sugar in her coffee as Malcolm sits in the seat across
	from her.  She gently stops stirring, but doesn't look up.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		I thought you meant the other
		Italian restaurant I asked you to
		marry me in.

	Anna isn't laughing.  Not even close.

			     MALCOLM
		I'm so sorry.
			(beat)
		I can't seem to keep track of time.

	Anna quietly takes a sip from her coffee.

			     MALCOLM
		It didn't go well today.  Spent
		some time after trying to get my
		head together.

	Anna looks around for the waiter.

			     MALCOLM
		They're so similar, Anna.  They
		have the same mannerisms.  The same
		expressions.  The same thing
		hanging over them.
			(beat)
		It might be some kind of abuse.

	That makes Anna turn back.  She glances across the table, then
	looks down.

			     MALCOLM
		There are cuts on Cole's arms.
		Fingernail marks, I think.  Looks
		like defensive cuts.

	Malcolm demonstrates by holding up his arm to shield his face.

			     MALCOLM
			(beat)
		Possibly a teacher, neighbor.
			(beat)
		I don't think it's the mother.
		Just a gut thing.  The way she
		deals with him.  It doesn't fit.
			(beat)
		Hard to say this early.  Could
		just be a child climbing a lot of
		trees.

	Malcolm loses himself in his thoughts.  The waiter drops off the
	check on the table.  Anna grabs it before Malcolm and quickly
	signs it.

			     MALCOLM
		I know I've been kind of out of it
		for a long while and you resent it.
		You do.  I know you're mad.  I know
		it's put some distance between us.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		But I'm getting a second chance
		here.  I can't let it slip away.

	Anna waits till he's done and rises from the table.  She pushes
	her chair in hard and walks away without a word.  Malcolm sits
	alone and stares at the piece of cake with a candle on it.

			     MALCOLM
			(soft)
		...Happy Anniversary.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. FRONT STEPS - AFTERNOON

	Cole is seated on the front stoop of his brownstone.  On the
	steps and on the landing are his plastic soldiers in the grips of
	a war.

	Malcolm sits with his bag and overcoat on the step next to him.
	Malcolm just observes quietly.  Beat.

	Cole glances up as he plays.  Sees Malcolm's expression.

			     COLE
		You want to ask me a question?

			     MALCOLM
		See, this is why I lose at poker.
		Yes, I do have a question.

	On the step are two rows of soldiers facing each other.  To one
	side are a couple soldiers covered by a tissue.  Malcolm points
	to them.

			     MALCOLM
		What happened to those two?  Being
		under tissue paper can't be a good
		thing.

	Cole removes the tissue.

			     COLE
		That's Private Jenkins and Private
		Kinney.  They got killed.  Private
		Jenkins has a baby girl that was
		born seven pounds, six ounces.
		He's never seen her.  He wanted to
		get back to Blue Bell, Pennsylvania
		and hold her...

	Cole points to the other soldier.

			     COLE
		Private Kinney's wife is really
		sick -- she has something called a
		brain anism.

			     MALCOLM
			(soft)
		You mean aneurysm.

			     COLE
		Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get
		back safe to take care of her.

	Beat.  Cole's face becomes emotional.  Tears fill his eyes.

			     COLE
		It's sad they died, isn't it?

	Malcolm falls into silence and stares at his client.  Beat.  Cole
	wipes his eyes quickly.

			     COLE
		Don't look at me.
			(beat)
		I don't like people looking at me
		like that.

	Malcolm takes in Cole's gesture and expression.

			     COLE
		Stop looking at me.

	Malcolm looks down.

			     MALCOLM
		Where should I look then, Cole?

			     COLE
		Look over there.

	Cole points to the corner of the street.  Malcolm slowly turns.
	He sits in profile to Cole.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		It's very unusual for someone your
		age to understand the kind of
		problems that Private Jenkins and
		Private Kinney have or even to be
		thinking about them at all...

	Malcolm continues to stare at the street.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		It is okay if I look back now?

	Cole doesn't answer.

			     MALCOLM
		Tap the foot once for "No" and
		twice for "Yes."

	Cole taps his foot once.

	Malcolm sits patiently.  Beat.  They don't say anything for a
	while.

			     MALCOLM
		You wouldn't want to take a walk,
		would you?

	Cole looks up from his soldiers.  Malcolm stares at the far side
	of the street.

	Cole taps his foot twice.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

	The two of them walk down a row of brownstones across from a park
	where children Cole's age are playing.

			     COLE
		I walk this way to school with
		Tommy Tammisimo.

			     MALCOLM
		He your best buddy?

	Cole almost smiles.

			     COLE
		He hates me.

			     MALCOLM
		You hate him?

	Cole shakes his head, "No.!

	Malcolm thinks for a bit.

			     MALCOLM
		Your mom set that up?

	Cole nods "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		You ever tell her about how it is
		with Tommy?

			     COLE
		I don't tell her a thing.

			     MALCOLM
		Why?

			     COLE
		Cause she doesn't look at me like
		everybody and I don't want her to.
		I don't want her to know.

			     MALCOLM
		Know what?

			     COLE
		That I'm a freak.

	Malcolm stops walking.  The words hit him hard.  He stares at
	Cole.

			     MALCOLM
		Listen to me.  You are not a freak.
		Don't you believe anybody that
		tells you that.  It's bullshit and
		you don't have to grow up believing
		that.

	Beat.  Cole is surprised.

			     COLE
		You said the "s" word.

			     MALCOLM
		Yeah.  Sorry.

	Malcolm's face is filled with emotion.  Cole is suddenly hit by
	Malcolm's passion.  Beat.  Cole nods slowly as he looks at
	Malcolm with different eyes.

	They start walking again in silence.  They turn a corner and move
	down another street.  Cole spots an old man with a cane standing
	at the gate of a brownstone.

			     COLE
		Is it okay if I do something?  I
		have to do something.

	Malcolm nods "yes" as they continue walking.  Cole slows as they
	approach the old man.  As we get closer, we make out the man can
	barely see.

			     COLE
		Hi, Mr. Marschal.

	MR. MARSCHAL leans over his gate and stares at Cole for a few
	seconds.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Guten Tag, Cole.

	Mr. Marschal has a thick German accent.  The old man squints down
	the block with a concerned expression.

			     COLE
		What's wrong?

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Mrs. Marschal.  She went food
		shopping.  She's running late.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Ich Habe Durst.

	Malcolm's eyes dart to Cole.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Wunderbar!  Where did you learn to
		speak German?

			     COLE
		I just know a couple lines.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Yes, you may have a drink.  What
		would you like?

			     COLE
		Lemonade, please.

	Mr. Marschal smiles at Cole before walking back inside his house.
	Cole turns back to Malcolm.

			     COLE
			(sad)
		Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.

			     MALCOLM
		What about Mrs. Marschal?

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		She died a long time ago.

							CUT TO:

	INT. MR. MARSCHAL'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

	This brownstone has been home to the Marschal's for many, many
	years.  It's filled with a lifetime of memories.  Memories shared
	by two people.

	Two rocking chairs sit side by side near the windows that
	overlook the street...  A corner table displays fancy wooden
	chess set.  The game half-finished, frozen in a layer of dust...
	An easel stands before a piano.  The incomplete water color
	painting of a smiling elderly woman sitting on the piano bench
	sits sadly on the faded yellow paper.

	Malcolm takes in the living room silently.  He stands near the
	open door.

	Cole walks through the room.  Tiny eyes searching carefully.  He
	leans behind the sofa looking for something.  Malcolm watches
	Cole with a crinkled brow.

	Cole peeks behind the old piano crammed against the wall.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Maybe Jill will play for us when
		she gets back.

	Cole turns to find Mr. Marschal standing with a glass of
	lemonade.  Cole takes it from his shaking hands.

			     COLE
		Thank you.

	Mr. Marschal shuffles over to the sofa.  Takes a seat.

	Cole begins surveying the room again.  Beat.  His eyes finally
	come to rest on a plant seated in the corner.  He stares at it...
	THE LEAVES OF THE PLANT SHAKE SLIGHTLY FROM A BREEZE.

	Cole puts down his glass on a table and walks over to the plant.
	Cole kneels down and starts to push the potted plant aside.  THE
	POT SCREECHES ON THE WOODEN FLOOR.

	Malcolm calls to Cole under his breath.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole--

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		What's going on there?

	Mr. Marschal strains to see across the room.

	Cole doesn't answer either of them.  Instead, he continues to
	push the plant aside revealing AN AIR VENT.  Cole gently reaches
	over and takes off the metal face.  It slips right off.

	Cole's hands disappear into the darkness of the vent.  They
	reemerge holding a STACK OF NOTEBOOKS.

	Malcolm becomes very still.

	Cole rises to his feet and carries the notebooks over to Mr.
	Marschal.  Cole carefully places them on his lap.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Is this for me?

	Mr. Marschal fingers the notebooks then reaches for his thick
	glasses hanging from his neck.  He places them on the tip of his
	nose and inspects the notebooks six inches from his face.

			MR. MASCHAL
		What's this?  Jill's keeping a
		diary.

	Malcolm takes an involuntary step forward.

	Mr. Marschal starts flipping through the notebooks.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		She's full of surprises...

	He gets to the last book.  His hands become still as he stares at
	the final page of writing.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
			(whispers)
		She hasn't written anything for
		some time.

	Beat.  Mr. Marschal slowly looks up from the notebooks.  Looks up
	to Cole.  Cole just stands quietly.

	Mr. Marschal's eyes slowly fill with tears of realization.  They
	gently spill down his weathered face.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Oh no...

	Cole takes a deep breath.  Trying hard not to cry himself.  The
	sight of Mr. Marschal weeping shakes Cole.

	Cole softly lays his hand on Mr. Marschal's silver hair.  Mr.
	Marschal reaches up and clutches his small hand.

	They stay like that for a while.  Beat.  Mr. Marschal lets go and
	brings the notebooks tighter to his body.

	Cole quietly walks to Malcolm who stands motionless.  He stares
	down at Cole in a daze.

	Cole turns his head, crying.

			     COLE
			(softly)
		Stop looking at me.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT OFFICE - NIGHT

	Malcolm sits still in his office chair.  His eyes are fixed at a
	point in space.  He brings a slim, black tape recorder to his
	mouth.

	CLICK.

			     MALCOLM
		April or March of Eighty-seven.
		Two weeks into sessions with
		Vincent Gray.  I was treating a
		couple, Donald and Robin Wagner,
		who had lost their child to
		Leukemia.  They were waiting with
		Vincent in the reception room of
		the downtown clinic.  They were
		alone together maybe fifteen
		minutes.  When I entered the room,
		all three were crying.  The
		Wagner's progress from that
		afternoon was dramatic and sudden
		....  As if some door had been
		opened for them.
			(beat)
		I'm not at all clear what happened
		in those fifteen minutes.  But I
		now believe Vincent tried to tell
		me something, show me something and
		I didn't listen.
			(beat)
		Cole Sear allowed me to witness
		something today.
			(beat)
		This time I'm going to listen.

	A long silence.  CLICK.  The tape recorder turns off.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

	Lynn holds a laundry basket on her hip as she fiddles with the
	thermostat in the hall.  The house is cold.  Lynn wears a winter
	jacket in the house.

	Lynn turns and moves into the shadowy hallway.  No lights.  The
	house seems somewhat ominous.  Beat.

	Lynn's eyes dart to an open guest room like she just saw
	something.  She stares in the doorway until a SOUND TURNS HER IN
	THE DIRECTION OF THE FAMILY ROOM.

	She picks up balled-up boy's sweat socks and dirty T-shirts
	laying on the carpet.  When she reaches the end of the hall, she
	HITS A LIGHT SWITCH.  The hall LIGHTS UP REVEALING A WALL OF
	PHOTOS.  Lynn forms a tiny smile.

	Snapshots of Cole and Lynn's life hang before her eyes.

	Cole's birthday parties...  Lynn and Cole at an amusement park...
	Cole under the Christmas tree...  Cole on Lynn's shoulders in a
	pool...  Cole with a group of neighbors at a barbecue...

	Lynn takes a step forward.  Lynn's face betrays the fact that she
	notices something she never noticed before.  She touches a photo
	of three-year-old Cole.

	WE MOVE INTO THE PHOTO -- COLE'S FACE SMILES AT US.  LYNN'S
	FINGER GENTLY BRUSHES A THIN STREAKS OF LIGHT THAT CURVES IN THE
	BACKGROUND BEHIND COLE.  THE STREAK OF LIGHT IS BLURRED, LIKE
	SOMETHING CAUGHT IN MOTION.

	Lynn looks to the adjacent photo -- the barbecue photo --
	Everyone stands with hot dogs and sodas.  Lynn searches the
	picture.  Her eyes suddenly stop at the TINIEST BLUR OF WHITE
	LIGHT STREAKING AROUND COLE.

	WE MOVE FROM FRAMED PHOTO TO FRAMED PHOTO -- EACH THE SAME --
	SOMEWHERE HIDDEN IN THE FRAME, SOMEWHERE NOT EASILY SEEN, LYNN
	FINDS A BLUR.

	Lynn takes it all in curiously.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COLE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

	Lynn moves into Cole's room with the laundry basket balanced on
	her hip.  The Walkman headphones on her head blares A MUFFLED
	TECHNO DANCE BEAT.  Lynn starts picking clothes up around Cole's
	room.

	This bedroom is an eerie place.  The shadows seem to make shapes
	and figures.  All the furniture is wood -- old fashioned.  The
	lamps, the paintings on the wall -- antiques as well.

	The most striking feature of the room, however, is the homemade
	tent created from bedsheets and blankets tied to chairs and
	bureaus.  It takes up a large corner of the room.

	A sign hangs over the bedsheets.

		"DO NOT ENTER"

	Lynn grabs the spiderman P.J.s that drape over the tent.

	A German Shepherd Puppy sleeps on the pillow.  SEBASTIAN lifts
	his head sleepily and peers at Lynn before returning to his
	slumber.

	Lynn slowly reaches for a picture frame that peeks out from under
	Cole's pillow.  Slides it out...  It's a VACATION PHOTO of a
	couple.  Lynn and Cole and a man.  The man looks in every way a
	larger version of Cole.

	The picture has a visible effect on Lynn.  She lets out a shaky
	breath before returning the photo to its hiding place.

	Lynn pulls a pair of school uniform pants off the wooden roll
	cover desk next to the bed.

	The desk is covered with loose leaf papers filled with writings.
	Lynn's eyes are drawn to the papers.

	Her curious gaze turns serious.  Her mouth opens a tiny bit
	involuntarily.

	THE PAPERS are strewn with lines of handwriting.  Countless
	lines.  Thousands of words...  Some horizontal, some vertical...
	The writing moves in arcs and flows in various size -- written at
	great speed -- every word connected by a single pen stroke --
	everything written in one continuous motion.

	Lynn slowly spins the papers, taking in some of the phrases...

	...Christ break the freaking glass oh no God no what the hell is
	going on Quiet the damn baby I'll cut you I swear it someone stop
	the burning I'll kill you I'll kill all you bastard...

	The words go on and on.

	Lynn removes her hands from the paper.  She pulls her headphones
	off slowly.

	THE MUFFLED TECHNO DANCE BEAT FILLS THE DEAD SILENCE OF THE EERIE
	ROOM.

	INT. DEN - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm stares as the rain pelts the windows of the den.

			     MALCOLM
		...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh
		with a lady who works in a toll
		booth.

			     COLE (o.s.)
		What if she has to pee when she's
		working?  You think she just holds
		it?
			     MALCOLM
		I don't know.  I was just thinking
		the same thing.

	Beat.

			     COLE (o.s.)
		You ask a lot of questions about my
		dad today.  How come?

	Cole is playing behind the couch.  All we see is the top of his
	head.

			     MALCOLM
		Sometimes, we don't even know it,
		but we do things to draw attention.
		Do things so we can express how we
		feel about issues...  Divorce or
		whatever.

	Every now and then we get glimpses of things Cole is playing with
	peeking over the back of the couch, but we can't quite make out
	what he's doing.

			     MALCOLM
		One night, as an example...  leave
		something on a desk for someone to
		find.

	The top of Cole's head stops moving.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole, have you ever heard of
		something called free-writing?  Or
		free-association writing?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		It's when you put a pencil in your
		hand and put the pencil to a paper
		and you just start writing...  You
		don't think about what you're
		writing...  You don't read over
		what you're writing...  You just
		keep your hand moving.

	Cole has become very still.  He looks right at Malcolm.

			     MALCOLM
		After awhile if you keep your hand
		moving long enough, words and
		thoughts start coming out you
		didn't even know you had in you...
		Sometimes they're things you heard
		from somewhere...  Sometimes
		they're feelings deep inside...
			(beat)
		Have you ever done any free-
		association writing, Cole?

	Beat.  Cole nods, "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		What'd you write?

			     COLE
		Words.

			     MALCOLM
		What kind of words?

			     COLE
		Upset words.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Did you ever write any upset words
		before your father left?

	Beat.

			     COLE
		I don't remember.

	Malcolm watches him carefully.  Beat.  Malcolm waves the question
	off casually.

			     MALCOLM
		Can you do something for me?

	Malcolm smiles.  He rises and grabs his coat.

			     MALCOLM
		Think about what you want from our
		time together.  What our goal
		should be?

			     COLE
		Something I want?

			     MALCOLM
		If we could change something in
		your life, anything at all, what
		would you like that to be?

	Cole's brow furrows as he thinks about it carefully.

			     MALCOLM
		You don't have to answer now.

	Malcolm heads for the door, stops when Cole emerges from behind
	the couch.  Cole is wearing his father's jacket, it hangs to the
	ground like a dress.

			     COLE
		Instead of something I want, can I
		have something I don't want?

	Malcolm turns back to Cole.  Malcolm nods "Yes."  Beat.

			     COLE
		I don't want to be scared anymore.

	Cole's sad eyes stare up at Malcolm.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT OFFICE - NIGHT

	The surface of Malcolm's desk is covered with open texts.
	Malcolm pours over a thick reference book.

	He circles a phrase...

	"...resulting bruises and abrasions on arms and legs may, in
	fact, be self-inflicted."

	Malcolm appears disturbed by the thoughts running through his
	head.

	ANNA'S MUFFLED VOICE CARRIES DOWN THE STAIRS.

	His face turns up to the ceiling.

			     MALCOLM
			(loud)
		Are you calling me?

	WE HEAR ANNA'S FOOTSTEPS MOVE ACROSS THE BASEMENT CEILING.  WE
	HEAR THE FRONT DOOR OPEN.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		What?  You don't see enough of me
		at the store?

	Malcolm gets up and moves closer to their voices as he stretches
	his legs.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		On my way to the flea market in
		Amish country.  Thought maybe you
		want to come.  Show me how to buy
		at these things.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		I trust you...  Besides, I don't
		know if I'm up for the Amish today.
		You can't curse or spit or anything
		around them.

	Malcolm smiles at Anna.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		I thought you'd want to get out.
		You've been kind of down.

	Malcolm slowly stops smiling.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		That's very sweet.  I'm okay.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Do you think I should stop by on my
		way back?  Show you what I got?
		It's not a problem.

	Malcolm shakes his head in disbelief.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		You know that's probably not the
		best idea.  I'll just wait to see
		them in the store.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Okay.  Fine.  Understood.
			(beat)
		I'm off then.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		Don't step in the horse manure.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Thanks.

	WE HEAR THE FRONT DOOR SHUT.

	Malcolm moves to the narrow basement window.

	INT./EXT. MALCOLM'S HOUSE - DAY

	We see SEAN, an attractive young man in his late twenties.

	He gets into his car across the street.  He just sits there for a
	moment before putting his forehead to the steering wheel.

			     MALCOLM
			(under his breath)
		Give it up, kid.

	Malcolm turns away from the window as Sean's car starts up and
	pulls away from Malcolm's house.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

	STANLEY CUNNINGHAM is a teacher in his late forties.  He writes a
	question on the board.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Can anyone guess what city was the
		capital of the United States of
		America from 1790 to 1800?

	Mr. Cunningham turns and stares at his class of eight and nine
	year old private school students.  They stare back at him blankly.

	Cole rests his chin on his desk and watches the class with big
	eyes.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		...I'll give you a hint, it's the
		city you live in.

	The class says the answer in unison.

			     CLASS
		Philadelphia.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Right...  Philadelphia is one of
		the oldest cities in the country.
		A lot of generations have lived and
		died in this city...  Almost every
		place you visit has a history and a
		story behind it.
			(beat)
		Even this school and the grounds
		they sit on...  Can anyone guess
		what this building was used for a
		hundred years ago, before you went
		here, before I went to this school
		even?

	Stanley Cunningham looks over the class of blank faces.  He's
	just about to answer his own question when he sees a hand go up.
	Mr. Cunningham looks surprised to see who it is.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Yes, Cole?

			     COLE
		They used to hang people here.

	Mr. Cunningham furrows his brow.  Beat.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		That's not correct.  Where'd you
		hear that?

			     COLE
		They'd pull the people in crying
		and kissing their families bye...
		People watching would spit at them.

	Beat.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Cole, this was a legal courthouse.
		Laws were passed here.  Some of the
		first laws of this country.  This
		building was full of lawyers.
		Lawmakers.

			     COLE
		They were the ones who hanged
		everybody.

	Mr. Cunningham chuckles.  Cole's face turns cement grey.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		I don't know which one of these
		guys told you that, but they were
		just trying to scare you, I think.

	Tommy Tammisimo leads the class in a wave of snickering.

	Cole glances up.  Sees all the eyes on him.  He glances at the
	teacher who is still staring.

			     COLE
		I don't like people looking at me
		like that.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Like what?

			     COLE
		Stop it!

	Mr. Cunningham sees the traumatized expression on Cole's face and
	instantly stops smiling.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		I don't know how else to look--

			     COLE
		You're a stuttering Stanley!

	Mr. Cunningham's face becomes still.  So does the classroom.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Excuse me?

			     COLE
		You talked funny when you went to
		school here.  You talked funny all
		the way to high school!

	The class falls into stunned silence.  Mr. Cunningham takes an
	involuntary step towards Cole's desk.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		What--

			     COLE
		You shouldn't laugh at people.  It
		makes them feel bad.

	Mr. Cunningham moves closer to Cole.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		How did you--?

			     COLE
		Stop looking at me.

	Cole covers his eyes with his hands.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Who have you been s-speaking to?

	We see Cole's mouth under his covered eyes.

			     COLE
		Stuttering Stanley!  Stuttering
		Stanley!

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Who!

	Mr. Cunningham is standing right over Cole's desk now.

			     COLE
		Stuttering Stanley!

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		S-ssstop that!

			     COLE
		Stuttering Stanley!  Stuttering
		Stanley!

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		S-ssssstop it!

			     COLE
		Stuttering--

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!

	MR. CUNNINGHAM SLAMS HIS HAND ON COLE'S DESK.  Cole's hands drop
	from his eyes.  The teacher's face is burning red.

	The children in the room are frozen.  Completely startled.

	Cole's eyes are filled with tears.

	Mr. Cunningham's expression drains of anger as Cole Sear begins
	to cry.

							CUT TO:

	INT. ANTHONY'S LIBRARY - SAME AFTERNOON

	Cole is seated in the school library by himself.  He sits at a
	long center table near the windows.  His head is laying on his
	folded arms on the table.

	Malcolm peeks his head in the door -- unsure if he's in the right
	place.  He spots Cole and enters the room.  He silently takes a
	seat across from Cole.  The eight-year-old looks up.  Cole's eyes
	are hard -- filled with anger.

			     MALCOLM
		Hey, big guy.

	Cole stares for a second.

			     COLE
		I don't want to talk about anything.

	Cole lowers his head.  Malcolm just sits and thinks.

	THE SOUND OF BOYS PLAYING SPORTS ON THE FIELD OUTSIDE FILTER IN
	THROUGH THE LIBRARY WINDOWS.

	Cole turns his head and stares at the windows.  Malcolm takes in
	the sad vision of this boy.  It affects him.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Do you like magic?

	Cole's face softens a bit.  He turns from the windows and looks
	to Malcolm.  Beat.  Cole nods, "Yes."

	Malcolm pulls out a penny from his pocket.  He places it in his
	right hand.

			     MALCOLM
		Watch the penny closely.

	Malcolm closes his hand around the penny.

			     MALCOLM
		I do the magic shake...

	Malcolm shakes his hand in circles.  Cole watches his hand
	carefully.

			     MALCOLM
		And suddenly the penny has
		magically traveled to my left hand...

	Cole looks to Malcolm's closed left hand.  Malcolm doesn't open
	it.

			     MALCOLM
		But that's not the end of the trick.
		With another magic shake, the penny
		travels into my shirt pocket...

	Cole's eyes lock on Malcolm's shirt.  Malcolm taps the pocket but
	doesn't open it.

			     MALCOLM
		But that's still not the end!...  I
		do a final magic shake...  and
		suddenly...  The penny returns to
		the hand where it started from.

	Malcolm opens his right hand.  The penny sits quietly in the
	center of his palm.

	Cole looks at the penny and then up to Malcolm's face.  Beat.
	Cole cracks a smile.

			     COLE
		That isn't magic.

			     MALCOLM
		What?

			     COLE
		You just kept the penny in that
		hand the whole time...

			     MALCOLM
		Who me?

	Malcolm smiles a mischievous smile.  He places the penny on the
	table.  Cole stares at it and then looks to Malcolm.

			     COLE
		I didn't know you were funny.

			     MALCOLM
		I forgot myself.

	Malcolm and Cole share a warm look.

	THE SOUNDS OF KIDS LAUGHING AND PLAYING OUT ON THE FIELD COME
	POURING INTO THE ROOM AGAIN.

	Cole's expression changes back to sadness as he looks to the
	windows.  Malcolm leans across the table and whispers.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole...

	Cole looks at Malcolm.

			     MALCOLM
		One day...
			(beat)
		You're going to sound just like
		them.

	Beat.  Cole's chin starts to tremble.  His voice cracks.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Promise?

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		Promise.

	Malcolm and Cole sit in silence and listen to THE SOUND OF
	CHILDREN PLAYING.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY - EVENING

	Malcolm sorts through the many bills on the mail table.

			     WOMAN (o.s.)
		Malcolm, sit your cute butt down
		and listen up.
			(beat)
		Are you listening?

	Malcolm turns AT THE SOUND OF THE WOMAN, and moves into the empty
	living room where the T.V. is on.  A blanket lays crumpled on the
	sofa.

	THE WOMAN'S VOICE IS COMING FROM A VIDEO PLAYING ON THE VCR.
	IT'S A WEDDING VIDEO.  A LARGE WOMAN IN A BRIDESMAID DRESS STANDS
	HOLDING THE MICROPHONE.   IN THE BACKGROUND, WE CAN SEE THE DANCE
	FLOOR.

			     BRIDESMAID
			(T.V.)
		No doubt about it.  Anna's like my
		sister.  You better make her happy...
		And I'm not talking about -- mmm
		this tastes like real butter --
		kind of happy...  I'm talking about
		Julie Andrews twirling around like
		a mental patient on a mountain top
		-- kind of happy.

	THE LARGE BRIDESMAID BECOMES VERY EMOTIONAL.

			     BRIDESMAID
			(T.V.)
		You're really lucky.  She's got so
		much love for you.  Don't tell her
		I told you, but she said she loved
		you from the first time she met you
		on the street.  She'd do anything
		for you.
			(crying)
		I love you guys.
			(more crying)
		My nose is running.  Why isn't
		someone getting me a tissue?

	THE WOMAN HANDS THE MICROPHONE TO SOMEONE OFF SCREEN.  THE CAMERA
	PANS AWAY FROM HER AND ZOOMS IN ON THE DANCE FLOOR.  MALCOLM AND
	ANNA ARE SLOW DANCING.  THEY'RE WHISPERING AND LAUGHING WITH EACH
	OTHER.  THE HAPPINESS FROM THEM IS TANGIBLE.

	Malcolm can't help smiling as he stares at the flickering images.
	He turns and looks down the hall to their bedroom.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - EVENING

	Malcolm moves into their bedroom.

	THE SOUND OF A SHOWER CAN BE HEARD FROM THE BATHROOM.

	Malcolm moves to the bathroom door and opens it slowly.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BATHROOM - EVENING

	Malcolm steps into the bathroom quietly.  He stares at the
	silhouette of Anna's body through the smoked glass of the shower.
	Anna stands still, her head tilted back.

	Malcolm watches quietly.  By his experience, it's clear he's
	taken by his wife's beauty.

	Malcolm starts towards the shower when his eyes glance to the
	sink.  Malcolm locks on a tiny bottle resting on the marble
	surface.

	He reaches out and picks it up.  The label on the plastic bottle
	reads,

		"Zoloft Anti-depressant"
		"To be taken twice daily"

	Malcolm gently puts down the plastic bottle.  He gazes at the
	still figure of his wife as the water covers her.

	Malcolm leaves the bathroom.  He makes sure not to make a noise
	with the door as he closes it shut.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. DARREN'S HOUSE - DAY

	Colorful balloons flutter in the wind in front of an old grey
	stone home.

	INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

	Cole and an overweight boy named BOBBY are seated at a dining
	table covered in colorful paper.  A stack of birthday presents
	are sitting on the table next to a cake.

	The house is filled with the SOUND OF CHILDREN PLAYING AND
	LAUGHING.

	Cole and the overweight boy are the only ones in the dining room.
	Bobby watches with a dull expression as Cole moves his hand in
	circles in the air.

			     COLE
		...Then you do the magic shake.
		And now the penny moves from my
		pocket all the way to the hand it
		started in.

	Cole smiles and holds out his hand.  His fingers open to reveal
	the penny.

	Bobby stares.

			     BOBBY
		That's stupid.

	Cole loses his smile.

			     COLE
		It's supposed to be funny.

			     BOBBY
		It's stupid.

	Cole and the overweight boy stare at each other.

			     BOBBY
		Give me my penny back.

	Cole gives the boy his penny.  Beat.  Cole gazes at Bobby.

			     COLE
			(almost inaudible)
		...Don't be sad.

	Bobby looks up sharply.

			     BOBBY
			(hard)
		What'd you say?

			     COLE
			(shaken)
		...Nothing.

	Bobby stares down at him before returning his attention to his
	tattered napkin.

	The two boys sit in silence.

							CUT TO:

	INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

	Cole sits alone in the corner of the living room.  The open
	kitchen doorway is next to him.  Inside the kitchen are Lynn and
	DARREN'S MOM speaking.  It's clear they're from different worlds.
	Lynn is wearing tight clothes with hair teased to dramatic
	heights.  Darren's mom is in a designer suit.

			     LYNN
		...He doesn't get invited places.

			     DARREN'S MOM
		It's our pleasure.

			     LYNN
		The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese
		party a year ago.  He hid in one of
		those purple plastic tunnels and
		didn't come out.

			     DARREN'S MOM
		Chuck E. who?

			     LYNN
		Cheese.  It's a kid's place.

	Darren's mom smiles formally and turns to give the catering
	people instructions on how to lay out the food on her sterling
	silver trays.

			     LYNN
		He's my whole life.

	Darren's mom turns back to Lynn, the forced smile on her face.

			     LYNN
		I work at an insurance place and at
		Penny's, so Cole can go to that
		good school.

			     DARREN'S MOM
		J. C. Jenny's?

	Lynn nods "Yes."

			     DARREN'S MOM
			(bullshit)
		Good for you.

			     LYNN
		I wish I could be like my momma
		though.  She always knew what was
		wrong.  Knew just what to say.

	Darren's mom glances at her expensive watch.

			     LYNN
		Cole's going through something bad.
		He won't talk to me.
			(beat)
		I'm his momma.
			(emotional)
		And I don't know what's wrong and
		I don't know what to say.

	Lynn drowns in her thoughts.  Cole moves away from the kitchen
	with sad eyes.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - AFTERNOON

	Cole walks past two expensively-dressed mothers eating hors
	d'oeuvres as they move down the hallway.

			     MRS. WESTON
		Did you have the Brie?

			     MRS. SAUNDERS
		It tasted like cheese whiz.

	They pass when Cole moves down the shiny mahogany wood hallway.
	The women's conversation FADES AWAY behind him.

	Cole turns a corner and comes to a dead stop.  He turns white as
	he stares at an open CRAWL SPACE CLOSET a few feet away.  Cole's
	eyes are riveted in the darkness of the closet.  Beat.

	THE HALLWAY ERUPTS WITH NOISE AS THE CHILDREN RUN IN FROM THE
	BACKYARD.

	Tommy Tammisimo is one of the children.  He talks with the
	birthday boy, DARREN, a skinny kid in a party hat.

			     TOMMY
		I even got a trailer.

			     DARREN
		For what?  You only had one line.

			     TOMMY
		You're slow, you know that.  The
		star of the commercial always has
		his own trailer.  You need to think
		about your character alone.

	Tommy glances down the hall and sees Cole standing frozen staring
	at the crawl space closet.

	Tommy grabs Darren.

			     TOMMY
		Darren, check it out.

	     DARREN looks down the hall to Cole.

			     DARREN
		My dad made me invite him.

	Tommy nudges Darren to move down the hall.  Cole breaks from his
	trance as Tommy and Darren walk up.

			     COLE
		Happy birthday, Darren.

			     TOMMY
		Something you want to see in there?

	Tommy points to the crawl space.

			     COLE
			(too quick)
		--No.

	Beat.  Tommy looks to Darren and then back to Cole.

			     TOMMY
		We're going to put on a pretend
		play.  You want to be in it?

	Beat.

			     COLE
		...Okay.

			     TOMMY
		It's called, "Locked in the Dungeon."

	Tommy stares at Darren.  Darren finally gets it.

			     DARREN
		Yeah, Cole...  you get to be the
		one locked in the dungeon.

	It happens too quick for Cole to react.  Darren and Tommy shove
	Cole backwards.  He stumbles into the darkness of the crawl space.

			     COLE
		Don't!

	Tommy slams the door closed.  Darren turns the lock.  They crack
	smiles at each other as Cole bangs on the door.

	The BANGING GOES ON FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN IT JUST STOPS.

	SILENCE.

	Darren and Tommy look at each other and then back at the crawl
	space door.

	Then THE SCREAMING BEGINS.

	Darren and Tommy back away from the door as COLE SCREAMS IN
	TERROR at the top of his lungs.  He CRASHES OVER AND OVER against
	the door.  HIS BODY SLAMMING AGAINST THE WOOD.  The DOOR RATTLES
	like it's going to break off its hinges.

	The two boys are statues as Cole's BLOOD-CHILLING YELLS FILL THE
	HALLWAY.

	FOOTSTEPS SPIKE THE AIR AS children and mothers come running down
	the hall.  Lynn is one of them.

	Darren's mother turns the corner.

			     DARREN'S MOTHER
		Who's making that noise?

	She looks to the closet.  THE HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMS CUT THROUGH
	THE HALL.

			     LYNN
		Cole!

	Lynn and Darren's mom rush to the door and turn the knob...  The
	door flies open.  Lynn reaches in and pulls out Cole.  He's
	UNCONSCIOUS.

	Darren's mom looks into the crawl space -- there's nothing inside
	except a couple packing boxes in the back.  She looks to Lynn.
	She turns around with Cole in her arms.

			     LYNN
			(desperate whispers)
		Help me get him in the car.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION AREA - AFTERNOON

	Colorful murals don the curved walls of the pediatric reception
	area.

	A spattering of children accompanied by adults sit and wait.

	Lynn and Malcolm are seated at a children's play table.  A game
	made of a maze of wires sit on the table in front of them.

	A young resident DR. HILL takes a seat at the table with them.
	He opens up his notes.

			     LYNN
		What's wrong with Cole?

	Beat.

			     DR. HILL
		The tests indicate he did not have
		a seizure.  In fact he's doing fine.
		After some rest, he could go home
		tonight.

	Lynn closes her eyes.  Lets out a tense breath.  Beat.  Malcolm
	eyes the doctor as he glances back to an academic-looking woman
	standing at the reception room door.

			     MALCOLM
		There's something else going on,
		Lynn.

	Lynn opens her eyes and catches the doctor's expression.

			     LYNN
		What is it?

			     DR. HILL
		There are some scratches and
		bruises on your son that concern me.

			     MALCOLM
		Oh, man.

			     LYNN
		Those are from sports, from playing.
		He's not the most coordinated kid,
		but I don't want him to stop trying,
		you know what I mean?

	Doctor Hill gestures to the woman standing near the doorway.

			     DR. HILL
		Mrs. Sloan over there is our social
		worker at the hospital.  She's
		going to ask you some procedural
		questions.

			     LYNN
		You think I hurt my child?
			(emotional)
		You think I'm a bad mother?

			     DR. HILL
		At this point it's just procedure.
		And you should probably calm down.

			     MALCOLM
		How do you expect her to react?

			     LYNN
		You want me to answer your
		questions?

			     DR. HILL
			(sarcastic)
		I'm sorry if I was being vague --
		yes, I do.

			     LYNN
		Who's going to answer mine, you
		dick.

	Dr. Hill stares at her before closing up his files.

			     LYNN
			(raising voice)
		What happened to my child today?

	Dr. Hill gets up.

			     LYNN
		Something was happening to him --
		physically happening.  Something
		was very wrong.

	Dr. Hill hands his files to MRS. SLOAN and exits the reception
	room without looking back.

	Everyone in the reception room stares at Lynn.  Mrs. Sloan walks
	up to the table and waits.

	Lynn takes a second.  Wipes her eyes.  Gathers her considerable
	strength.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		How long will these questions take?

							CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

	Cole lays rigid in the hospital bed.  Blankets bundled around him
	as if to shield him.  Cole's eyes fixed out the window.

	Malcolm quietly enters through the half-opened door to the room.
	Cole spots him.  Visibly relaxes.

			     MALCOLM
		I've decided we shouldn't schedule
		sessions anymore.  I'll just follow
		you around.

	Cole smiles weakly as Malcolm takes a seat on a rolling metal
	chair.

	Malcolm notices Cole's legs emerging from under the hospital
	gown.  Cole is wearing A MAN'S DRESS SOCK.  The baggy folds ride
	up all the way to his knees.

			     MALCOLM
		Your father ever tell you bedtime
		stories?

			     COLE
		Yes.

	Malcolm looks at Cole.  Malcolm makes a decision.  He rolls in
	the chair across the room as he thinks.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Once upon a time there was a prince,
		who was being driven around...  He
		drove around for a long, long time...
		Driving and driving...  It was a
		long trip...  He fell asleep...
			(beat)
		When he woke up, they were still
		driving...  The long drive went on--

			     COLE
		Dr. Crowe.

			     MALCOLM
		Yes.

			     COLE
		You haven't told bedtime stories
		before?

			     MALCOLM
		No.

			     COLE
		You have to add some twists and
		stuff.  Maybe they run out of gas.

			     MALCOLM
		No gas...  Hey, that's good.

	They sit in silence.  Malcolm works on a new plot in his head.

			     COLE
		Tell me a story about why you're
		sad.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Do you think I'm sad?

	Cole nods, "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		What makes you think that?

			     COLE
		Your eyes told me.

	Beat.  Malcolm's affected by his client.

			     MALCOLM
			(rote)
		I'm not supposed to talk about
		stuff like that.

	Cole smiles softly.

	Malcolm stares at the tired child sitting before him in the
	hospital bed.

	Malcolm rolls his stool away from his client as he thinks.

	Beat.  He slowly moves the rolling chair closer to Cole's bed.

			     MALCOLM
		...Once upon a time there was this
		person named Malcolm.  He worked
		with children.  Loved it more than
		anything.
			(smiles)
		Then one night, he finds out he
		made a mistake with one of them.
		Didn't help that one at all.  He
		thinks about that one a lot.  Can't
		forget.
			(beat)
		Ever since then, things have been
		different.  He's become messed up.
		Confused.  Angry.  Not the same
		person he used to be.
			(beat)
		His wife doesn't like the person
		he's become.  They don't speak
		anymore.  They're like strangers.

	Malcolm breaks from his thoughts and looks at Cole who watches
	him with unwavering attention.  Malcolm smiles.

			     MALCOLM
		And then one day this person
		Malcolm meets a wonderful boy who
		reminds him of that one.  Reminds
		him a lot of that one.  Malcolm
		decides to try to help this new boy.
		He thinks maybe if he can help this
		boy, it would be like helping that
		one too.

	Malcolm leans forward, whispers with emotional eyes.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't know how the story ends.
		I hope it's a happy ending.

			     COLE
		Me too.

	Cole looks at Malcolm's caring eyes.  Cole stares at Malcolm a
	long time.

	EVERYTHING THAT'S SAID FROM THIS POINT ON IS WHISPERED.

			     COLE
		I want to tell you my secret now.

	Malcolm blinks very slowly.

			     MALCOLM
		Okay.

	Cole takes an eternal pause.  A silent tension engulfs them both.

			     COLE
		...I see people.

	Malcolm just gazes quietly.

			     COLE
		I see dead people...  Some of them
		scare me.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		In your dreams?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		When you're awake?

	Cole nods, "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		Dead people, like in graves and
		coffins?

			     COLE
		No, walking around, like regular
		people...  They can't see each
		other.  Some of them don't know
		they're dead.

			     MALCOLM
		They don't know they're dead?

	Beat.

			     COLE
		I see ghosts.

	Malcolm becomes completely motionless.  Works to hide his shock.
	He and Cole stare at each other a long time.

			     COLE
		They tell me stories...  Things
		that happened to them...  Things
		that happened to people they know.

	Beat.  Malcolm's words are extra-controlled.  Revealing nothing.

			     MALCOLM
		How often do you see them?

			     COLE
		All the time.  They're everywhere.
			(beat)
		You won't tell anyone my secret,
		right?

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		...No.

			     COLE
		Will you stay here till I fall
		asleep?

	Malcolm nods, "Yes."  Cole pulls the covers up to his chin and
	turns to the window in the room.  Malcolm is very still and
	stares at Cole.

	MALCOLM'S EYES -- slowly turn and survey the room.  They find
	nothing.  Malcolm returns to watching Cole.

	COLE'S EYES LOOK AROUND THE ROOM WARILY...  WE MOVE IN ON THEM --
	TILL HIS EYES FILL THE FRAME.

	Beat.

	And then we see what he's staring at.  Through Cole's hospital
	room window we see the adjacent wing of the hospital building.
	Rows of hospital room windows are visible.  In the windows are
	patients...  SOME OLD, SOME YOUNG...  SOME ARE DRESSED IN MODERN
	HOSPITAL GOWNS...  SOME FROM DECADES PAST.

	THEY STAND UNNATURALLY STILL IN THEIR WINDOWS...  WATCHING,
	WAITING.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT

	Malcolm hails a cab.  He steps off the sidewalk lost in his
	thoughts. Steam rises from a street vent.  HEADLIGHTS.  A CAR
	SUDDENLY EMERGES FROM THE STEAM, NARROWLY MISSING MALCOLM.

	Malcolm jerks out of the way.  His briefcase falls to the ground.
	His tape recorder falls to the sidewalk.  Beat.  Malcolm reaches
	down and picks it up.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole...
			(beat)
		His pathology is more severe than
		initially assessed.
			(beat)
		He's suffering from visual
		hallucinations, paranoia --
		Symptoms of some kind of school age
		Schizophrenia.
			(beat)
		Medication and hospitalization may
		be required.

	CLICK.  Malcolm's hand with the tape recorder drops to his side.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		I'm not helping him.

	Malcolm stares into the night.  He stands alone as thoughts crash
	like thunder in his head.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CAR - NIGHT

	The STREETS TURN RED as Lynn drives home from the hospital in
	silence.  She glances down to her right.

	Cole is curled up asleep on the passenger seat, back in his
	regular clothes, a tiny party hat clutched in his hand.  He looks
	like a four-year-old.

	The sight of him exhausted and still, hits Lynn hard.

	Lynn's face drowns in deep concern.  She lays a hand on Cole's
	head as she drives.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	The front door opens, Lynn carries Cole in.  He's asleep on her
	shoulder.  She carries him down the hall to his BEDROOM.

	Lynn lays Cole gently on his bed next to his German Shepherd
	Puppy.  Cole curls up with Sebastian.

	Lynn watches the two youngsters sleep for a moment.  Cole is
	curled up asleep with a tiny party hat clutched in his hands.  He
	looks like a four-year-old.  Lynn has been carrying Cole's
	sweater from over her shoulder.  She pulls it off and begins to
	fold it.  Her attention is drawn to the sweater.  She fingers the
	fabric of the back.  IT'S RIPPED.  Her eyes move to Cole.  In the
	middle of the back of his T-shirt are THREE SMALL TEARS.  Lynn
	pushes the fabric open with her fingers and sees DEEP FINGERNAIL
	LIKE SCRATCHES on his skin.

	Lynn looks around helplessly, fear creeping into her eyes.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	Lynn emerges from Cole's room.  She turns OFF THE HALL LIGHTS as
	she moves into her room and closes the door.

	WE HEAR LYNN PICK UP A PHONE AND DIAL.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		Hi, this is Lynn Sear, Cole's
		mother.  I wonder if we could
		talk about your son and his
		friends keeping their goddamn
		hands off my boy?

	The thermostat on the wall reads seventy-eight degrees.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	A few hours later.  The house seems threateningly still.  Too
	still.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT


	An unnatural silence fills each room of the house.

	The thermostat on the wall now reads, fifty-two degrees.

	A LIGHT TURNS ON FROM UNDER COLE'S DOOR.

	The door opens a crack.  Cole's tiny face peeks out.  Eyes scan
	the darkness.

	The door opens a little bit more.  Cole's knees are pressed
	together.  His body dances a little.  Cole has to pee.  He moves
	cautiously into the hall.

	Cole moves briskly to a door halfway down the corridor.  Opens
	it.  Cole turns on the LIGHT IN THE BATHROOM.

	He checks behind the shower curtain, before he turns his back and
	pees into the toilet.

	A LARGE FIGURE MOVES PAST THE DOORWAY.

	Cole instantly stops peeing.  His body becomes very still.  He
	slowly reaches for the toilet handle and flushes.  He closes his
	pants and turns.  He doesn't come out of the bathroom at first.
	He just stands there and stares into the darkness of the hall.
	HIS BREATH FORMS TINY CLOUDS IN THE COLD AIR.

	Beat.  Cole finally steps out into the hallway.  His eyes catch a
	SLANT OF LIGHT now coming from the kitchen.

	Cole hesitates before being drawn to the kitchen.  He moves down
	the hall and turns the corner -- coming to a stop in the doorway
	of the kitchen.

							CUT TO:

	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Cole stares at the back of a person cooking food on the stove.
	Cole's fear slowly fades away.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Momma?
			(beat)
		Dream about daddy again?

	The person turns.  It's not Lynn.  It's a strange woman.  The
	woman's face is demented.  A purple gash cuts across her
	forehead.  ALL THE CABINETS AND DRAWERS ARE OPEN BEHIND HER.

			     WOMAN
		DINNER'S -- NOT -- READY!

	Cole's face turns the color of ash.

			     WOMAN
		What are you going to do?

	Cole backs up to the doorway.

			     WOMAN
		You can't hurt me anymore!


	The woman smiles menacingly as she thrusts her wrists forward...
	They've been savagely cut.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Cole turns and runs down the hall.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Cole runs across his room.

	He heads right for the homemade tent seated in the corner with
	the "DO NOT TOUCH" sign on it.  He scurries in.  His legs
	disappear as the bedsheets flap closed behind him.

	The crazed woman stands at the end of the hall.  Doesn't come any
	closer.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TENT - NIGHT

	Cole is curled up in the tent.  He lays still for a moment
	reaching over and FLICKING ON A FLASHLIGHT.

	The red interior of the tent gets LIP UP.

	It's a striking sight.  The bedsheet walls of the tent are lined
	with religious pictures taped to the walls.  Tiny statues of
	saints surround the interior perimeter.  We see the statue Cole
	stole from the church is in here...  This tent is a sanctuary
	made by an eight-year-old to hide in.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. AUDITORIUM STAGE - AFTERNOON

	THE LIGHTS IN THE GYM GO DOWN.  THE SPOT LIGHT OPENS ON THE STAGE
	AS THE CURTAINS MOVE TO THE SIDES...

	A sign to the side of the stage reads, "The third and fourth
	grade presents -- Rudyard Kipling's "The Jungle Book."

	The parents APPLAUD AS TOMMY TAMMISIMO WALKS OUT ON STAGE in a
	villager's outfit.

			     TOMMY
			(Decent British accent)
		There once was a boy, very
		different than other boys.  He
		lived in the jungle, and he could
		talk with the animals.

	BACKSTAGE, Mr. Cunningham cues the rest of the children.

	THE AUDIENCE APPLAUDS AS THE FULL CAST OF THE ACTORS COME OUT.
	Some are villagers, others are dressed as trees and animals.

	Cole comes on stage holding a painted cardboard monkey.

	MALCOLM APPLAUDS FROM THE BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM.

							CUT TO:

	INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON

	The arched halls of the private school are lined with posted
	drawings and test papers.

	Cole and Malcolm walk down an empty hall.

			     COLE
		Did you think the play sucked big
		time?

			     MALCOLM
		What?

			     COLE
		Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough
		syrup commercial.  He thought
		everybody was self-conscious and
		unrealistic.  He said the play
		sucked big time.

			     MALCOLM
		I know every child is special in
		their own way, but Tommy sounds
		like a punk.
			(Cole smiles)
		I thought the play was excellent.
		Better than Cats.

			     COLE
		Cats?

			     MALCOLM
		Never mind.

	Beat.  They continue down the hall in silence.  Malcolm takes his
	time.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole, I was really interested in
		what you told me in the hospital,
		I'd like to hear more about it.

	Malcolm stops at a set of doors at the end of the hall --
	realizes Cole is no longer next to him.  Malcolm turns to find
	Cole frozen about ten feet back.

	Malcolm walks to him.  He notices Cole's expression as he gets
	closer.

			     MALCOLM
		What's wrong?

	Cole points to the doors.

			     MALCOLM
		Is something in there?

	Cole doesn't say anything.  Beat.

							CUT TO:

	INT. GYMNASIUM - AFTERNOON

	It's a large shadowy GYM.  Climbing ropes hang from the wood
	beamed ceiling.

	Cole is trembling slightly as he stands next to Malcolm.

			     MALCOLM
		What is it?

	Malcolm follows the child's gaze to the ceiling of the gym.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't see.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Be real still.

	Malcolm looks to Cole and then turns back to the ceiling.
	Malcolm's body becomes very still.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Sometimes you feel it inside.
		Like you're falling down real fast,
		but you're really just standing
		still.

	Malcolm looks at the wood beams and climbing ropes.

			     COLE
		You ever feel prickly things on the
		back of your neck?

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Yes?

			     COLE
		And the tiny hairs on your arm.
		Are they all standing up?

	Malcolm glances at Cole.  Surprise on his face.

			     MALCOLM
		-- Yes.

	Beat.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		When they get mad, it gets cold.

			     MALCOLM
		Them?

	Malcolm looks at the empty stairwell and then back to Cole.

	Nothing is said for a few moments.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't see anything.
			(beat)
		Are you sure they're there?
			(beat)
		Cole?

	Malcolm turns back to Cole, he finds the child with tears in his
	eyes.  Cole looks at Malcolm desperately.

			     COLE
		Please make them leave.

	Malcolm stares helplessly.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		I'm working on it.

	Malcolm gently leads Cole away from the stairs.

	COLE GLANCES BACK AS HE MOVES OUT OF THE STAIRWELL.

	COLE'S P.O.V. -- The ropes and school banners dangling at the top
	of the stairs sways a little...  But so do THE THREE BODIES
	HANGING BY THEIR NECKS FROM A WOODEN BEAM.

	It's a truly horrific sight.  A BLACK MAN in britches and no
	shirt, face beaten to a pulp, hangs in the center.  A WHITE WOMAN
	in a torn white frilly dress -- tears soaking her face, hangs to
	the right.  A small MIXED RACE CHILD in half pants, hangs to
	their left.  The family stares at Cole.  They follow Cole with
	their tortured eyes as he exits the stairwell.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HISTORIC PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

	Malcolm walks from the bus stop over the cobblestone streets in
	front of Head House Square.  The streets are quiet and dark.
	Night time has fallen over the city.

	He slowly comes to a stop in front of an old building.  He holds
	his arm up.  Uses his other hand to gently touch his hairs on his
	arm's surface.

	Malcolm looks up slowly.  Looks around.  The dark shadows fill
	the corners of the historic building...

	Malcolm stares into the darkness...  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		...Is anyone there?

	A long moment as he waits.  The shadows seem to move, then
	becomes still.

	Malcolm shakes off the moment.  He returns his hands to his
	pockets as he moves through the dark streets of Philadelphia to
	his home.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	The doorway to Malcolm and Anna's bedroom is open.  STRAINED
	VOICES SPILL OUT INTO THE HALLWAY.

			     MALCOLM (o.s.)
		Look, he's an eight-year-old child.
		He's my only client.  If he invites
		me to his play, I'm not thinking
		about how late I get back...  I go.
		I have to go.  You know that.
		That's the only way I know how to
		work.
			(beat)
		Vincent said I failed him.
			(raising his voice)
		I WON'T GIVE COLE A CHANCE TO SAY
		THOSE WORDS TO ME!  I WON'T!

	Beat.  THE PORTABLE PHONE RINGS OUT IN THE HALL.

			     MALCOLM (o.s.)
		Please let it ring.

	WE HEAR MOVEMENT.  Anna emerges from the bedroom.  Eyes raw.  She
	wipes her tears.

	She picks up the phone and moves down the stairs.

	Malcolm walks out into the hall.  Stops at the top of the stairs.

	ANNA'S VOICE CAN BE HEARD SPEAKING ON THE PHONE from downstairs.

			     ANNA
		I can't talk now.

	Malcolm doesn't hear anything as Anna listens to the person on
	the phone.  She smiles as she wipes her tears.  He starts for the
	basement door again.

			     ANNA
			(whispers)
		I thought about you too.

	Malcolm turns.  He stands frozen at the top of the stairs.
	Anna's HUSHED WORDS RISING IN THE AIR LIKE A GUN BLAST.

							CUT TO:

	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Lynn adjusts the thermostat as she tries to keep herself warm.

			     LYNN
		I don't care what they say, this
		thing is definitely broken.

	Lynn fiddles with the dials.  Cole is standing before the beat-up
	twelve inch kitchen T.V.

	ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN is Tommy Tammisimo.  He stands in his
	pajamas in a doorway.  He coughs.

			     TOMMY
			(on T.V.)
		Mommy, my throat hurts.

	Cole watches as Tommy's T.V. mother and father give him a
	spoonful of medicine.

			     NARRATOR
			(on T.V.)
		Pediaease Cough Suppressant...
		gentle, fast, effective.

	Cole watches Tommy running around in his T.V. background, the
	very next T.V. morning.  He's not sick anymore.  Tommy waves to
	the camera smiling and healthy.  The T.V. goes BLACK as Cole
	throws his shoe at the power button.

	He moves to the dinner table where Lynn is seated.  Cole sits.
	His hands go on the table.  He's wearing a pair of his father's
	extra large LEATHER GLOVES.  Cole's small hands don't even fill
	the palm area.  Cole has difficulty trying to pick up his milk
	glass with the gloves.

			     LYNN
		Take 'em off.

	Cole removes the gloves from his hand and places them next to his
	plate.

			     LYNN
		I don't want them on my table.

	Cole moves them to the floor.

	Lynn is irritated, this is a sore point between them.

	Lynn and Cole eat quietly.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		I saw what was in your bureau
		drawer when I was cleaning.

	Cole looks up.  An anxious expression on his face.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		You got something you want to
		confess?

	Cole just stares.

			     LYNN
		The bumble bee pendant.  Why do you
		keep taking it?

	Cole looks down at his lap.

			     LYNN
		It was Grandma's.  It's not for
		playing.
			(beat)
		What if it broke?  You know how sad
		I'd be.

			     COLE
		You'd cry.  Cause you miss grandma
		so much.

			     LYNN
			(soft)
		That's right.  So why do you take
		it, sweetheart?

			     COLE
		Sometimes people think they lose
		things and they didn't really lose
		them.  It just gets moved.

			     LYNN
		Did you move the bumble bee pendant?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."  Lynn just stares.

			     LYNN
		You didn't take it before.  You
		didn't take it the time after that.
		And now, you didn't take it again?

			     COLE
		Don't get mad.

			     LYNN
		So who moved it?

	Cole doesn't answer.

			     LYNN
		There's only two of us.
			(beat)
		Maybe someone came in our house --
		took the bumble bee pendant out of
		my closet, and then laid it nicely
		in your drawer?
			(beat)
		Is that what happened?

			     COLE
			(soft)
		Maybe.

	Lynn just stares at Cole.

			     LYNN
		I'm so tired, Cole.  I'm tired in
		my body.  I'm tired in my mind.
		I'm tired in my heart.  I need a
		little help here.
			(beat)
		I don't know if you noticed -- but
		our little family isn't doing so
		good.

	Lynn folds her napkin quietly.

			     LYNN
		I'm praying for us, but I must not
		be praying right.
			(beat)
		It looks like we're just going to
		have to answer each other's prayers.
		If we can't talk to each other --
		we're not going to make it.
			(beat)
		Now baby, tell me...  I won't be
		mad, honey...  Did you take the
		bumble bee pendant?

	Beat.  Cole's eyes start to water up.

			     COLE
		No.

	Lynn goes cold.

			     LYNN
		You've had enough roast beef.  You
		need to leave the table.

	Cole just stares at his mother's expression.

			     LYNN
			(yells)
		Go!

	Cole gets up -- never taking his eyes off his mother -- and
	leaves the room.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	Cole enters the DARK HALLWAY.  He gets startled by the SOUND OF
	HIS PUPPY GROWLING.

	Sebastian comes racing down the hall and scurries past Cole.
	Cole watches his puppy dart into the living room and under a
	couch.

	Cole slowly turns back and looks down the hall.

	THE DOOR TO COLE'S ROOM SITS AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR.  IT'S
	ALMOST SHUT.  COLE WATCHES AS THE DOOR BEGINS TO OPEN VERY
	SLOWLY.  IT OPENS WIDE.  COLE DOESN'T MOVE AN INCH.

	SUDDENLY IN THE STILLNESS AND THE DARKNESS, A SMALL FIGURE
	SCURRIES FROM ANOTHER BEDROOM INTO THE BLACKNESS OF COLE'S ROOM.
	IT HAPPENS LIKE A FLASH.

	Cole stops breathing.

	THE FIGURE SLOWLY STEPS OUT FROM COLE'S DOORWAY.

	IT'S A BOY.  A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN COLE.

	THE BOY WHISPERS IN A LOW, HOARSE VOICE.

			     BOY
		Come on...  I'll show you where my
		dad keeps his gun...  Come on.

	THE BOY TURNS.  WE SEE THAT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD IS MISSING AS HE
	DISAPPEARS INTO THE DARKNESS OF COLE'S ROOM.

	Cole is too terrified to move.

							CUT TO:

	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Lynn is kneeling on the kitchen floor trying to coax the puppy
	out of the broom closet.

			     COLE (o.s.)
		Momma.

	Lynn turns -- surprised to hear her son's voice.  Lynn's eyes are
	red from crying.  She wipes them quickly with the back of her
	hand.

	Mother and son look at each other.  Beat.

			     COLE
		If you're not very mad...  Can I
		sleep in your room tonight?

	Lynn fights back some tears.

			     LYNN
		Look at my face, Cole.

	Cole does.  Lynn smiles at her son.

			     LYNN
		I'm not very mad.

	Lynn hugs him.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		Baby...  Why are you shaking?

	Cole doesn't answer.

			     LYNN
		Cole, what's wrong?

	Cole just closes his eyes and holds his mom tight.

			     LYNN
			(desperate)
		...Please tell me.

	Cole doesn't say a word.

			     LYNN
			(crying)
		Please.

							CUT TO:

	INT. ANTIQUE STORE - DAY

	We are in an antique store.  Filled floor to ceiling with
	furniture and knickknacks.

	Anna stands with a YOUNG COUPLE.  All three lean over and peer
	into a glass cabinet.

	An antique engagement ring sits on a velvet stand.

			     ANNA
		It's Edwardian.  Beautifully worked.
		Entirely platinum with a mine cut
		diamond and an actual color Burmese
		Sapphire...  It's timeless.

			     YOUNG MAN
		You got anything a little plainer?

	The young woman looks at her beau.

			     YOUNG WOMAN
		Plainer?  You want a plain ring to
		go with your plain fiance.  Is that
		how it is?

			     YOUNG MAN
		No, baby.  Don't get in a tizzy.
		It's just...  you're so beautiful...
		you're like a Burmese Sapphire all
		by yourself.  You don't need all
		that.

			     YOUNG WOMAN
			(disbelief)
		Uh-huh.

	Anna smiles as she takes the ring out of the cabinet.

			     ANNA
		Why don't you two hold it?

	She places it in their hands.

			     ANNA
		Do you feel longing?

			     YOUNG WOMAN
		Excuse me?

			     ANNA
		When I touch this piece I feel a
		longing.  I imagine the woman who
		owned this, loved a man deeply she
		couldn't be with.

	The young woman looks at Anna with great intrigue.

			     YOUNG WOMAN
		Did he have wavy hair and broad
		shoulders?

	The young man throws an odd glance at his fiance.

			     ANNA
		I don't know...  But maybe...
			(beat)
		A lot of the pieces in this store
		give me feelings.  I think maybe
		when people own things and then
		they pass away -- a part of
		themselves gets printed on those
		things -- like fingerprints.

	Beat.  The young man and the young woman gaze at Anna silently.

	They look down at the ring.  They place their hands on it
	reverently, delicately -- like checking for a pulse.

	Anna can't hold back her sweet smile.

							CUT TO:

	INT. ANTIQUE STORE - DAY

	Anna moves to the back desk where SEAN comes out.  He's carrying
	an antique bench in his arms. He places it down and takes a much
	needed seat.

			     SEAN
		You don't need someone with a
		masters.  You need a wrestler guy
		whose neck is larger than his head.

			     ANNA
		I need a wrestler with a masters.

	Anna fills out the paperwork for the ring.

			     SEAN
		What's this?

	Anna looks over to find Sean standing at his desk where a
	BIRTHDAY PRESENT sits on his tabletop.  Sean looks at her.

			     SEAN
		From you?

	Anna nods, "yes."

			     SEAN
		Is it wrestling tights?

	Anna smiles as she moves to his desk.  Sean begins to tear off
	the wrapping paper like a kid at Christmas.

	Anna laughs.  Sean holds up a weathered hardback copy of "THE
	GREAT GATSBY."  Beat.

			     ANNA
		It's a first edition.

			     SEAN
		Wow, this is too much.  It's
		perfect, Anna.

	Sean puts down the book and hugs her.  He pulls back a little,
	still holding her.  They smile at each other.

	Beat.  The moment goes on just that crucial fraction of a second
	too long.  Their smiles slowly melt away as they continue to hold
	each other.  Nothing happens for the longest time.


	CRASH!  A SHATTERING DOOR SLAM ECHOES THROUGH THE STORE.  Anna
	and Jeffery pull apart.  They rush past the young man and the
	young woman to the front of the store.  They find the glass front
	door cracked in a spider web pattern.

	They carefully push open the door and step out onto the sidewalk.
	Look around.   No one in sight.

	Anna stares down the empty street.  A concerned expression on her
	face.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Malcolm walks angrily down the sidewalk.  He stops as his hand
	goes to his side.  He winces with pain as he keeps walking.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

	Lynn and Cole emerge from the supermarket.

	Cole rides inside the shopping cart tucked between bags of food.

	Mother and son are quiet as they move towards their car.

	Beat.

	Lynn leans over, looks at the side of her son's pensive face.

	She starts pushing the cart faster.  Cole wakes from his thoughts
	as his hair flutters in the wind.  He looks back.  Lynn is
	smiling as she pushes.  Cole turns and raises his hands in the
	air like he's on a roller coaster.

	Beat.

	They slow and come to a rest at the bumper of their car.  Lynn
	leans over -- sees the side of Cole's face smiling.

	Lynn's face shows a little happiness for the first time.  A
	little hope enters her eyes as she starts to load the groceries
	into the car.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CAR - DAY

	Cole and Lynn ride home with a back seat full of groceries.

	Cole finishes off a cherry popsicle as he watches out the window.

	Lynn looks over.

			     LYNN
		Let's rent a movie.

	Cole bites off the last of the popsicle and glances at his mom.

			     LYNN
		Your pick.

	Cole stares at his mom quietly.

			     LYNN
		It can even have Jean Claude Van
		Damme in it if you want.

	Cole smiles at that.  He nods, "Yes" joyfully.

	His smile fades away as he notices his mother fiddling with the
	HEATER controls.

	Cole gazes out the front windshield as the car moves towards home.

	Suddenly a piece of paper sticks to the windshield.  It's a page
	from a Playbill.  A 1941 Playbill.  It flies away revealing a
	woman in a flowing flowery dress from the 40's suddenly walks
	into the middle of the street as the pages of her Playbill swirl
	in the air.

			     COLE
			(yells)
		Momma, look out!

	The woman in the flowery dress turns.  Her hand rests on her
	stomach.  WE SEE SHE IS PREGNANT.

	Playbills stick to the windshield obstructing the view.

	Lynn slams the brakes...  Too late.

	THE WOMAN SMASHES INTO THE FRONT GRILL OF THE CAR...  HER TERROR-
	STRICKEN FACE COMES OVER THE HOOD AND CRASHES RIGHT THROUGH THE
	WINDSHIELD IN A SHOWER OF BLOOD AND GLASS...

	COLE SCREAMS.  LYNN SCREAMS...  THE CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP IN
	THE MIDDLE OF A CONGESTED INTERSECTION.

	The line of cars behind them suddenly hit their brakes and swerve
	to one side avoiding a mass collision.  After a few seconds, the
	entire intersection has come to a halt.

	Cole who has shut his eyes...  slowly opens them.

	He looks around fearfully.  His eyes move to the windshield.  No
	broken glass.  No blood.  And no woman.  Cole looks out through
	the pristine windshield onto the street where cars are stopped
	and staring all around them.

	Cole slowly looks over to his mother.  He finds her staring at
	him in complete and utter disbelief.  Her hands clutch the wheel.
	The whites of her knuckles showing her fear.  She has no idea why
	he screamed.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DEN - AFTERNOON

	The den is very quiet.  Cole and Malcolm sit around the multi-
	colored table.  Malcolm leans back in his small plastic chair --
	arms folded over his chest.  Cole sits slumped over the table --
	eyes peering out over his arms.

	They both look like shit.

			     COLE
		You don't wanna ask me questions
		today?

	Malcolm nods, "No."  Beat.

			     COLE
		Can I ask you then?

			     MALCOLM
		Yes.

			     COLE
		What do you want more than anything?

			     MALCOLM
		I don't know.

			     COLE
		I told you what I want.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't know, Cole.

			     COLE
		Why don't you think about it for a
		while?

	Malcolm doesn't respond.  Cole watches him.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		I know what I want.
			(beat)
		My goal is to speak to my wife.
		The way she and I used to speak.
		Like there was no one in the world
		but us.

	Beat.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		How are you going to do that?

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		I can't be your doctor anymore.
			(beat)
		I haven't given my family enough
		attention.  Bad things happen when
		you do that.  Do you understand?

	The room falls into silence again.  Cole speaks extra soft.

			     COLE
		You want to go home?

	Malcolm stares across at Cole.

			     MALCOLM
		I have to.

			     COLE
		When?

			     MALCOLM
		Soon.  One week.

	Malcolm looks down at his eyes full with emotion.

			     MALCOLM
		I'm going to transfer you.  I know
		two psychologists that are
		exceptional--

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Don't fail me.

	Malcolm looks up sharply.

			     MALCOLM
		--What?

			     COLE
		Don't give up.  You're the only one
		who can help me.  I know it.

	Beat.  Malcolm tries to stay composed.  It doesn't work.

			     MALCOLM
		You want to know a secret?...  I
		was a paper champion.
			(beat)
		Do you know what that means?

	Cole shake his head, "No."  Tears fall down Malcolm's cheeks.

			     COLE
		Don't cry.

			     MALCOLM
		I means I wasn't what everyone
		thought I was...
			(beat)
		I was a fake.

			     COLE
		You weren't a paper champion.

			     MALCOLM
		Someone else can help you.  Someone
		else can make you happy.

	Cole is crying now.

	Cole wipes his eyes with his sleeve.  They sit quietly and stare
	at each other.  Beat.

	Cole whispers.

			     COLE
		Dr. Crowe?

			     MALCOLM
		Yes.

			     COLE
		You believe me, right?

	A long pause.

			     COLE
		Dr. Crowe, you believe my secret,
		right?

	They both just stare.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't know how to answer that.

	Cole searches for the answer in Malcolm's eyes...  He finds it.
	It's not the one he wanted.  Malcolm looks down.

			     COLE
		How can you help me if you don't
		believe me?

	Cole reaches into his pocket.  Pulls out a PENNY.

	Cole pushes it across the table.

	Malcolm gazes at it, then looks up at Cole's pained eyes.

	Beat.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Some magic's real.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm sits stoically at his desk in his basement.  His eyes
	gaze at the dusty FRAMED CERTIFICATE FROM THE CITY OF
	PHILADELPHIA shoved between two packing boxes.

	Malcolm leans his head back against the chair.  Stares into the
	shadows.  Drowns in his thoughts.

	Beat.  THE CHAIR CREAKS as he slowly sits up again.  Malcolm's
	eyes scan the room and come to a stop on a box marked with the
	label...

	"SESSION TAPES -- VINCENT GRAY"

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

	A tape slides into the tape player seated on Malcolm's desk.
	Malcolm hits play.

	THE SOUND OF A DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING IS HEARD.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		Sorry about that.  Hope I didn't
		leave you alone too long...  Wow,
		it's cold in here.

	WE HEAR A CHAIR MOVE AS MALCOLM SITS DOWN.  And then SILENCE.
	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		Vincent...  Why are you crying?
			(beat)
		Vincent?

	A TEN-YEAR-OLD'S VOICE ANSWERS.

			     VINCENT
			(on tape crying)
		Yes?

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		What happened?
			(beat)
		Did something upset you?

	Beat.  VINCENT SNIFFLES.

			     VINCENT
			(on tape)
		You won't believe.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		I won't believe what?

	Beat.

			     VINCENT
			(on tape)
		I don't want to talk anymore.  I
		want to go home, okay?  I want to
		go home.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		Okay, Vincent, you can go home.

	CLICK.  THE TAPE GOES TO SILENCE.

	Malcolm just sits in the shadowy basement.  He doesn't move for a
	while.

	Then he hits the rewind button.  Stops it.  Presses play.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		--about that.  Hope I didn't leave
		you too long...  Wow, it's cold in
		here--

	Malcolm hits the rewind button again.  Lets it rewind for a
	while.  Presses play.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		--like needles either.  When I was
		a kid, I had this blood test down --
		threw up chill cheese fries all
		over this male nurse.

	WE HEAR VINCENT CHUCKLE SOFTLY.

	THE SOUND OF A DOOR OPENING IS HEARD.

			     SECRETARY
			(on tape)
		Excuse me, Doctor Reed is on line
		two.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		Vincent, I have to take this.  Give
		me a minute.

			     VINCENT
			(on tape)
		Okay.

	FOOTSTEPS AS MALCOLM AND THE SECRETARY LEAVE THE ROOM.  THE DOOR
	CLOSES.  AND THE SILENCE.

	Nothing happens for a long time.  AND THEN WE HEAR A SUDDEN CHAIR
	SCREECH ACROSS THE FLOOR.  VINCENT'S BREATHING QUICKENS.

	A SLIGHT STATIC STARTS TO FILTER IN ON THE TAPE.

	Malcolm's eyes are locked on the spool of audio tape as it spins
	in the player.

	Malcolm's fingers move to the volume dial.  He turns it way up.
	THE STATIC NOISE FROM THE TAPE FILLS THE BASEMENT.

	Malcolm leans closer to the tape player.  Closes his eyes and
	listens...  Beat.

	DEEP IN THE STATIC...  ANOTHER SOUND EMERGES, WHISPERING.

	A MAN'S VOICE IS HEARD IN THE ROOM WITH VINCENT

			     MAN'S WHISPERING
			(on tape)
		Familia...  No dejen que esto me
		pase...  Mi familia...  Yo no
		quiero morir...  Familia...

	Malcolm's mouth opens in disbelief.

			     MALCOLM
		...Jesus Christ.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm stands on a familiar sidewalk.  He stares into the bay
	window of Mr. Marschal's brownstone.

	Inside the window we see Mr. Marschal seated with a group of
	older gentlemen his age.  They sit around a table eating
	sandwiches and talking.  Malcolm watches as Mr. Marschal tells a
	story to his friends.  WE CAN'T HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING, but when
	he finishes everyone at the table laughs.  Mr. Marschal smiles.

	Malcolm can't help smiling as well.  This is not the same man he
	saw before.  Life has returned to this house.  Beat.

	Malcolm turns and moves down the street.  Each step faster than
	the next.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CHURCH - LATE AFTERNOON

	Malcolm moves to the front of the church down the center aisle.
	His eyes scan the empty seats.  No one in sight in any direction.

	Malcolm stands in the aisle a little out of breath.  He holds his
	hand to his side as he winces a bit.

	Malcolm's eyes float up to the balcony where toy soldiers sit on
	the bannister.  Cole's head pops up.

			     MALCOLM
		Hello again.

	He looks down and studies Malcolm.

			     COLE
		You been running around?

	Malcolm nods, "Yes."

			     COLE
		It makes you feel better?

	Malcolm nods, "Yes" again.

			     COLE
		I like to run around.  It's good
		exercise.
			(beat)
		You want to ask me questions now?

	Malcolm shakes his head, "No."

			     COLE
		You want to be a lance corporal in
		Company M, 3rd Battalion, 7th
		Marines?  We're being dispatched to
		the Quang Nam province.

	Cole holds up his plastic rifleman.  Malcolm's eyes show he
	understands now.


			     MALCOLM
		Maybe later.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Something happened, didn't it?

			     MALCOLM
		Yes, it did.

			     COLE
		Are you wigging out?

			     MALCOLM
		Yes, I am.

			     COLE
		We're not gonna start crying again,
		are we?

			     MALCOLM
		No, we're not.

			     COLE
		What happened?

	Beat.

	Malcolm glances around the empty church before looking back up to
	Cole.

			     MALCOLM
		These people...  People that died
		and are still hanging around.
		Maybe they weren't ready to go.

	Cole studies Malcolm's passionate face.  A new face.

			     COLE
		You really look better.

			     MALCOLM
		 Maybe they wake up that morning
		 thinking they have a thousand
		 things to do and a thousand days
		 left to do them in...  And then
		 all of a sudden, it's all taken
		 away.  No one asked them.  It's
		 just gone...

			     COLE
		You have nice red in your cheeks now.

			     MALCOLM
		Do you know what 'Yo no quiero
		morir' is?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		It's Spanish.  It means...  'I
		don't want to die.'
			(beat)
		Not all the ghosts are scary, are
		they?  Like Mrs. Marschal?

			     COLE
		No.

			     MALCOLM
		What do those ghosts want when they
		talk to you?  Think real careful
		now, Cole...

	Cole stops moving.  He looks over the balcony railing at Malcolm.

			     COLE
		Just help.

			     MALCOLM
		Yes!  I think that's right!...  I
		think they all want that.  Even the
		scary ones...

			     COLE
		You believe now?

	Malcolm's stare is unwavering.

			     MALCOLM
		I believe both of you now.
			(beat)
		And I think I might know how to
		make them go away.

			     COLE
		You do?

	Malcolm nods "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		I think they know you're one of
		those guys rare people can see them.
			(beat)
		You need to help them.  Each one of
		them.
			(beat)
		Everyone wants to be heard.
		Everyone.

	Cole takes a big sigh.  Fiddles with his riflemen.

			     COLE
		What if they don't want help?  What
		if they're just angry and they want
		to hurt somebody?

			     MALCOLM
		I don't think that's the way it
		works, Cole.

	Cole looks nervous.

			     COLE
		How do you know for sure?

	Malcolm's eyes are drawn to Cole's arm.  Peeking out from under
	his shirt sleeve are a set of cuts.  Malcolm gazes at them.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't.

	Cole and Malcolm stand silently in the center aisle of the back
	of the church.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	Malcolm moves around the corner on his street.  His mind surges
	with thoughts.  And then he glances up.  His steps slow to a
	complete stop.

	Further down the sidewalk, coming out of the front door of his
	house is SEAN.

	Malcolm's face turns to stone.  He watches as Sean comes down the
	front stairs and starts across the street.

	A sudden rage surges up.  Malcolm moves towards Sean fast.

	Sean reaches his car and enters it.  He doesn't notice the figure
	closing in on him.

	THE ENGINE STARTS.  Malcolm reaches the car a second late.  Sean
	pulls away into traffic almost hitting another car as he does.

	Malcolm watches the car disappear down the next street.  Beat.

	Malcolm turns and looks up at his home with unchecked anger and
	overwhelming pain erupting his eyes.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	Malcolm stands in his foyer.

	Anna is sitting on the stairs, phone in her hand.  She faces away
	from the front.

	Malcolm's a ball of tension as he listens to Anna talk into the
	phone.

			     ANNA
		...You just walked out.  You're
		probably on your way home.  I'm
		leaving this message...  I just
		didn't get to say what I meant...
			(beat)
		I know you're confused.  It's just...
		I'm not prepared to do this, Sean.
			(beat)
		I don't want to be ashamed of that.
		I don't want to have to make
		excuses for that.
			(beat)
		And I wanted to tell you...  I
		bought your present wholesale from
		a friend.  I didn't even pay tax on
		it.  You don't need someone cheap
		like that.
			(beat)
		By the way, it's a non-refundable
		item, it's scratched on the bottom.
			(beat)
		Are you smiling?...  I hope you're
		smiling.
			(beat)
		I'll see you at the store.

	Beat.  A long silence.  Then WE HEAR ANNA GENTLY HANG UP.

	Malcolm leans back against an old radiator.  Beat.

	His eyes close as the SOUND OF HIS WIFE'S FOOTSTEPS RISES UP THE
	STAIRS.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

	The house is silent.  No movement.

	Cole is in his pajamas asleep on the floor of the TENT.

	Curled up next to him is Sebastian.  They sleep surrounded by
	statues and pictures.

	Cole's eyes open as he hears HIS MOTHER'S DISTANT VOICE.

			     LYNN
		Cole...
			(beat)
		Cole, what's happening...

	Cole quickly gets up and rushes out of the tent.  His foot
	catches one of the chairs the tent is fastened to.  He stumbles
	out.  He doesn't realize one of the bedsheets comes loose.  It
	folds to the ground.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	He doesn't stop as he moves through the shadowy hall and pushes
	open his mother's bedroom door.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LYNN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Cole stands in the doorway to his mother's bedroom.  He looks
	over the room carefully.  Everything is still.

	Lynn's room is sparse.  No paintings, no accessaries.  A bed
	without a frame sits in the corner.  A table with a sewing
	machine fills the other side of the room.

	HIS MOTHER'S VOICE turns his attention back to the bed.

			     LYNN
		Cole, what's happening to you?

	Cole looks down and finds his mother laying in her bed.  Her face
	contorted in deep sadness as she speaks in her sleep.

			     LYNN
		Is someone hurting you?...  I'll
		beat their asses.

	Cole smiles at his mother as he moves to her side.  Touches her
	face with his tiny fingers.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Momma, you sleep now.

	His touch seems to have an effect.  Lynn becomes still in her
	sleep.  Cole watches her carefully.

							COT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	Cole closes the door to his mother's bedroom shut.  He stands
	still in the hallway.  Lets out a heavy sigh...

	HIS BREATH ROLLS IN A TINY CLOUD IN FRONT OF HIM.

	Cole's brow furrows.  He breathes again.  This time
	intentionally.  Watches as his breath materializes in the
	suddenly ice cold air.

	Every muscle in Cole's eight-year-old body becomes rigid.  He
	takes a second before moving through the inky darkness of the
	hall.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Cole hurries to fix his tent.  He ties the collapsed bedsheet in
	a knot on the edge of the chair.  He checks it carefully before
	entering the tent.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TENT - NIGHT

	When Cole turns around, he stops breathing.

	AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GIRL VOMITS ON HERSELF IN HIS TENT.  She
	finishes and looks up at Cole with drawn eyes.

			     GIRL
		I'm feeling much better now.

	The girl reaches out with her withered and emaciated hands --
	tiny tubes hang from her wrists.  She scratches Cole as he
	tumbles back terrified out of the tent.  The whole tent collapses --

							CUT TO:

	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Cole runs hard out of his bedroom and down the hall to the living
	room.  He gets down to the ground and slides under the wooden-
	legged couch.

	Sebastian is already huddled in fear under the couch.  Cole
	presses as far back as he can and waits.

	COLE'S P.O.V. -- is of the living room floor.  Chair legs.
	Coffee table base.  Rugs...  Everything is still.

	Cole holds his breath.  He waits.  Beat.  Nothing happens.  He
	takes his first short breaths and watches the room for any sign
	of movement.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	A few minutes later.  Cole is now standing in his doorway.  He
	stares at the hunched figure covered by the collapsed tent.

	BEAT.  Cole makes a decision.  He looks like he is going to cry --
	fights it back.

	He walks towards it.  Reaches down and slowly pulls the sheet off
	the figure.  The girl vomits one more time before looking up at
	Cole.

			     GIRL
		I'm feeling much better.

	Cole and the little girl stare silently at each other.  Cole
	holds her stare with trembling eyes.

	He opens his mouth -- it takes a while before the words come out.

			     COLE
		Do you want to tell me something?

							CUT TO:

	INT. PUBLIC BUS - DAY

	A downtown Septa public bus.  Malcolm and Cole are among the
	spattering of passengers.

	They're both wearing suits.

	Cole leans his head against the glass of the scratched window.
	Cole's large eyes drink in the passing scenery.

	COLE'S P.O.V. -- A dark, abandoned building stretches for an
	entire block on one side.  A MAN IN A GREY, FULL-BODIED UNIFORM
	WITH NUMBERS PRINTED ACROSS HIS CHEST...  RISES OUT OF THE TALL
	WEEDS IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING.  HE HOBBLES HIS WAY DESPERATELY
	TOWARDS THE BUS.  HIS HANDS AND LEGS ARE SHACKLED...  HE LUNGES
	OUT FOR COLE IN THE PASSING WINDOW.

			     SHACKLED MAN
		My name's not Sullivan!

	A GUNSHOT ECHOES IN THE AIR.  THE MAN'S CHEST EXPLODES IN RED AS
	HE FALLS TO HIS KNEES SCREAMING.

	Cole jerks back from the window.

	The bus quietly drives past THE OLD PRISON BUILDING.

	Cole stares down at his lap and tries not to look up anymore.
	Beat.

			     COLE
		She came a long way to visit me,
		didn't she?

			     MALCOLM
		I guess she did.

	Cole falls into deep thoughts as he stares down at his dress
	shoes.  Malcolm slips back into silence.

	The city bus slithers through the old Philadelphia streets
	working its way downtown.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HOME - AFTERNOON

	A modest home sits on a corner.  Its small lawn, groomed
	carefully.  Rows of parked cars spill out from the driveway onto
	the streets.

	People in suits and dark dresses move somberly in and out of the
	front door of the home.

	Cole and Malcolm join the visitors as they walk slowly towards
	the doors.

	A frail, little girl about four years of age sits in a dark dress
	on the swings in front of the house.  Visitors say hello to her
	as they pass.  She doesn't say anything back.

			     MALCOLM
		Her little sister?

	Cole nods, "Yes."

	Malcolm and Cole watch her for a moment before following others
	into the modest corner home.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HOME - AFTERNOON

	The home is packed with people.  The gathering of mourners is
	standing room only.  The AIR IS FILLED WITH DOZENS OF HUSHED
	CONVERSATIONS.

			     VISITOR #1
		...can you imagine being a child in
		a bed for two years?

	We move to.

			     VISITOR #2
		...I think it was six.

	We move to.

			     VISITOR #3
		...Six separate doctors?

	We move to.

			     VISITOR #4
			(whispers)
		...the little one's falling ill now...

	We move to.

			     VISITOR #5
		...God help them...

	A FAMILY PORTRAIT HANGS NEAR THE FRONT DOOR.  Two girls, one
	bigger, one smaller sit on the ground in front of their mother
	and father.  Their smiling faces welcome the mourners.

	Malcolm and Cole are standing at the bottom of a staircase.
	Waiting.

	The front door opens as another group arrives.  Malcolm nods to
	Cole as the foyer fills up.  The two of them quietly disappear
	upstairs.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

	The narrow hall is lined with boxes of medical supplies.  I.V.
	stands, sterile needles and pads are in the process of being
	taken away.  The boxes are piled outside a closed bedroom door.

	Cole stares at the shut door like he doesn't want to go in.  His
	eyes move to the large, colorful map of the world that dons the
	hallway wall.  He gazes at the many countries and continents.
	Beat.

			     COLE
		I wish I were somewhere else.

			     MALCOLM
			(soft)
		Where will you go, where no one has
		died?

	Cole stares at the map and then turns to Malcolm.

			     COLE
		Don't go home, okay?

			     MALCOLM
		I definitely won't.

	Cole turns and stares quietly at the door.  He waits a long time
	before reaching for the doorknob.

							CUT TO:

	INT. GIRL'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

	Cole closes the door behind him.  He turns and gazes at the
	girl's bedroom.  There's a hospital bed near the window.  The
	walls are covered with get-well cards and drawings from family,
	friends, and school children.

	Her shelves are filled with puppets.  All shapes and sizes of
	puppets.  Next to the shelf is a puppet stage and a camcorder on
	a mini tripod sitting next to it.

	Cole walks to the shelf and picks up a FINGER PUPPET DANCER.  He
	places it in his pocket.

	On the girl's desk, is a large collection of video cassettes.
	The labels read, "Puppet Show Christmas 96," "Puppet Show
	Birthday party," "Puppet Show class trip"...

	Cole reads the labels carefully before moving towards the
	closets.  He passes the bed.

	AN EMACIATED HAND REACHES OUT FROM BENEATH THE BED AND GRABS
	COLE'S ANKLE.

	Cole jerks back startled.  He watches as the girl's hand slips
	back under the bed.  Cole stays very still.  Waits.  Nothing
	happens.

	He slowly bends down.  His hands touch the floor.  He tilts his
	head and looks under the bed.

	The emaciated little girl who came to his tent lays curled on the
	floor.  Her bulging eyes glare at Cole.  She moves suddenly.
	Thrusts a jewelry box forward.  It slides across the wooden floor
	and stops just before Cole.  Cole and the sickly girl stare at
	each other.  Neither of them say a word.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

	The room is thick with mourners.  Most are gathered around the
	GIRL'S MOTHER, a young woman in her late twenties.  As she moves
	through the room to the kitchen, she receives the many cards,
	hugs, and flowers that are offered as condolence.  Mrs. Collins
	leaves the living room.

	Malcolm watches breathlessly from the doorway as Cole moves
	through the many adults across the room.

	The girl's father, MR. COLLINS, a thin man in his late twenties,
	is seated on the reading chair next to a T.V.  His face is
	granite.  No one in the room dares to talk to him.  He stares
	statue-like at an abstract point in the room.

			     COLE
		Mister?

	The man doesn't react.  Some of the guests look oddly at the
	little boy standing before the man.

			     COLE
		Excuse me, Mister.

	Beat.  The man slowly turns and looks down at the boy standing
	next to him.  Cole is very shaky.

	Malcolm watches everything anxiously.

	Cole stares at Mr. Collins.

			     COLE
		Are you Kyra's daddy?

	The man's face begins to crumble.  Beat.  He nods, "yes" softly.

	Cole holds out the jewelry box.  It trembles with his hands.

	The father just stares at it.  Beat.

			     COLE
		It's for you...
			(beat)
		She wanted to tell you something.

	The father becomes very still.  His eyes fill with a storm of
	confusion and pain.  After the longest time, the father reaches
	and gently takes the box out of Cole's small hands.

	Cole begins to back away...

	The father gazes at Cole as he melts into the crowd.  Cole
	reaches Malcolm and the two then slip out of the house.

	The father looks down in a daze.  He goes to open the jewelry
	box.  His movements are slow and strained.  He lifts the latch
	and open the box.

	Mr. Collins stares at an unlabeled video cassette.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

	People in the room start to turn as the T.V. comes on.  Mr.
	Collins is seated now.

	THE STATIC SNOW ON THE SCREEN IS QUICKLY REPLACED BY AN IMAGE.
	TWO PUPPETS DANCE ON STAGE.  WE HEAR KYRA'S VOICE SING FOR THE
	PUPPETS AS THEY DANCE AROUND.

	Her father's face forms the most heartbreaking of smiles as he
	watches the performance.

	The entire room has stopped what they were doing.

	T.V. SCREEN

	WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE STAIRS.  The puppets go limp.
	The entire stage gets lifted up.  We see it carried away by Kyra.
	We can view the whole bedroom now.  The camera is seated on her
	desk in the corner.

	Kyra climbs in bed and pretends to be sleeping when the door
	opens.  It's Mrs. Collins.  She carries in a tray of soup and a
	sandwich.

	LIVING ROOM

	The crowd watches in riveted silence.  The father never takes his
	eyes off of the screen.

	The image of the mother prepares the meal.  She uncovers the
	fruit and the soup.  Places a straw into the drink.

	And then it happens.

	The image of the mother walks to a closet.  Opens it.  An
	assortment of household cleaners and sponges are kept inside.
	She pulls out a bottle of floor cleaner.  Reads the label for the
	ingredients.  Walks back to the food tray, where she unscrews the
	cap on the floor cleaner.  The mother pours some into the cap.
	Checks it.

			     MRS. COLLINS
			(video tape)
		That's too much.

	The mother pours some into the bottle.  The remainder goes into
	the child's soup.  She replaces the cap and puts the bottle back
	in the closet.

	The image of the mother turns to the bed carrying the tray.  She
	places the food on a metallic rolling table and swings it over
	the bed.

			     MRS. COLLINS
			(video tape)
		Kyra, time for lunch.

	Kyra pretends to wake from a deep sleep.

			     KYRA
			(video tape)
		I'm feeling much better now.

	The image of the mother smiles.

			     MRS. COLLINGS
			(video tape)
		I'm glad, honey.
			(beat)
		Time for your food.

			     KYRA
			(video tape)
		Can I go outside, if I eat this?

			     MRS. COLLINS
			(video tape)
		We'll see.  You know how you get
		sick in the afternoon.

	Kyra picks up the spoon and takes a sip.  Her face crinkles at
	the taste.  She looks up at her mother.

			     MRS. COLLINS
			(video tape)
		Don't say it tastes funny.  You
		know I don't like to hear that.

	Kyra slowly brings the spoon to her mouth and swallows another
	spoonful.

	The father SHUTS OFF THE TELEVISION with his trembling hands.  He
	presses his hands to his eyes like they're burning.

	The ROOM IS UTTERLY SILENT.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Mrs. Collins is seated at the dining room surrounded by friends
	and family.  She fixes one of the many bouquets of flowers on the
	table.  It takes her a beat before she feels the stare.

	She looks up.

	Standing in the doorway to the dining room is Mr. Collins.  A
	group of ashen faced guests stand in the distance behind him.

	Husband and wife's eyes meet.  Mrs. Collins smiles softly.

	Mr. Collins' eyes tremble with tears.

			     MR. COLLINS
			(soft)
		You were keeping her sick...

	The whole world stops.

	The mother's face registers confusion at first.  Then slow
	realization.  Her eyes glace at the many faces around her.

	She looks back at her husband.  His glare is painful.  Rage
	filling every cell of his body.  Tears falling faster down his
	cheeks.

	Mrs. Collins turns her attention back to the flowers.  She
	concentrates with all her strength.  Beat.  Her hands begin to
	shake.


			     MRS. COLLINS
			(to no one)
		I took care of her...

	Her words are met with ice cold stares.  The first tears stream
	down her face.  The pretty flowers of consolation in her hand
	tumble to the floor.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HOUSE - AFTERNOON

	Cole sits on the swings next to Kyra's four-year-old sister.  She
	doesn't look up.

	Malcolm waits in the driveway.  Watches them from a distance.

	Cole reaches into his pocket and pulls out the little FINGER
	PUPPET.  He holds it out.

			     COLE
		You liked it, she said.

	The four-year-old stares at the finger puppet, then quietly takes
	it in her small hands.

	The two children don't say anything for a while.  Malcolm glances
	to the house, where all movements in and out of the home has
	ceased.

	Cole turns to the four-year-old.

			     COLE
		She watched out for you.

	The little girl finally looks up.  She has the saddest eyes.

			FOUR YEAR OLD
		Kyra's not coming back.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Not anymore.

	The little girl stares down at the finger puppet.  Cole lightly
	places a hand on her shoulder.

	Nothing else is said.  Nothing else is done.

	Malcolm looks across the two children on the swings.  One
	mourning.  One consoling.

	Malcolm takes it in, overwhelmed.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. PROP ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Stanley Cunningham moves between two curtains and comes to a prop
	room door in the back.  He puts an ear to the door, listens and
	then knocks.  After a second, he enters.

	Mr. Cunningham finds Cole sitting in a poor villager costume as a
	FEMALE TEACHER kneels next to him and makes final adjustments.
	Cole and the woman glance at Mr. Cunningham.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		They're calling for the stable boy.

	Mr. Cunningham looks around the room and then directly at Cole.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Who were you talking to?

	The Female Teacher looks to Cole and nods.

			     FEMALE TEACHER
		Poor Stanley.

	She stands up.  The entire left side of her face has been burnt
	horribly.  Grotesquely disfigured.

			     FEMALE TEACHER
		My favorite student.

	THE FIGURE OF THE WOMAN MOVES PAST MR. CUNNINGHAM IN THE DOORWAY.
	SHE DISAPPEARS INTO THE DARKNESS.

	Cole puts on his tattered hat.

			     COLE
		Thanks for giving me this part, Mr.
		Cunningham.

	Mr. Cunningham smiles.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		You're welcome, Cole.

	They share a look before walking out of the prop room and
	entering the hall.

	We see them walking away.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		You know when I was in school,
		there was a terrible fire in this
		section of the theater.  They
		rebuilt the whole thing.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		I know.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

	It begins to rain.  Malcolm pulls his jacket over his head as he
	scurries up the stairs of the school.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm stands and catches his breath in the corridor of St.
	Anthony's Academy.

	A teacher rushes in the hall with an armload of costumes.

			     MALCOLM
		Has the play started yet?

	The teacher hurries past Malcolm and down the hall without saying
	a word.

			     MALCOLM
		Is that a yes?

	The teacher scurries around a corner.  Malcolm watches her
	curiously.

							CUT TO:

	INT. AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm moves quickly to a set of double doors and opens them.
	He steps into the DARKNESS OF THE AUDITORIUM.

	The play is in full swing...  Cole and a large group of costumed
	children are on stage.  Cole holds a broom and wears a worn-down
	costume.  He stands to the side -- hidden by others.

	A boy in a shiny-armored costume walks to the center of the stage
	where a large cardboard stone is seated.  A sparkling HANDLE
	sticks out of the top.

	The armored boy tries to lift it.  It won't budge.

	Bobby, the chubby boy from the party, is dressed in a magician's
	costume.  He is Merlin.  He steps forward.

			     MERLIN
		Only he who is pure of heart can
		take the sword from the stone.

	Merlin looks to the group on stage.  Looks right at Cole.

			     MERLIN
		Let the boy try.

	The group of villagers on the stage LAUGH AND MOCK THE SUGGESTION.

	Tommy Tammisimo is dressed in a mismatched costume -- he hops
	around, clearly embarrassed.

			     TOMMY
			(half-heartedly)
		But he's the stable boy.  He cleans
		after the horses.

			     MERLIN
		Silence village idiot!  Let the boy
		step forward.

	Tommy turns a deep shade of red and hobbles off the stage.

	Merlin looks to Cole.  He smiles a true friend's smile.

			     MERLIN
		Arthur...

	Cole hesitates.  Not because he's acting.  He really hesitates.
	It takes him a moment before he steps forward.

	Cole steps up to the stone.  He places his hand around the
	handle.  Begins to pull.  The sword starts to come out.

	The villagers GASP.

	Cole raises the shiny sword out of the stone and high above his
	head.

	Merlin and everyone on stage bows.  A SILENCE FILLS THE
	AUDITORIUM.

	Malcolm watches his client, standing unafraid in the spot light
	for the first time.

	The villagers rise and rush to Cole.  They scoop him up and carry
	him around the stage in celebration.  Cole chuckles and then
	starts laughing as the group of eight-year-olds try
	unsuccessfully to keep him up.  They slowly sag and then
	collapse.  All the students are laughing as they try to untangle
	themselves.

	Malcolm watches with utter joy as Cole becomes indistinguishable
	among of a group of twenty children giggling and enjoying
	themselves on stage.

							CUT TO:

	INT. SCHOOL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON

	The rain comes down a little stronger now on the stained glass
	window.

	Malcolm sits on the stairs in the lobby.  Cole walks back and
	forth in front of him.  Cole still holds the sword from the play.

			     COLE
		How come we're so quiet?

	Malcolm shrugs his shoulders.

			     MALCOLM
		I think we said everything we
		needed to say.
			(beat)
		Maybe it's time to say things to
		someone else?  Someone close to you?

			     COLE
		Maybe.

	Cole keeps moving.  Beat.

			     COLE
		I'm not going to see you anymore,
		am I?

	Malcolm doesn't respond for a while.  He shakes his head, "No."
	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		You were great in the play, Cole.

			     COLE
		Really?

			     MALCOLM
		And you know what else?

			     COLE
		What?

			     MALCOLM
		Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.

	Cole smiles huge.  Beat.  Cole's sword drags on the tile as he
	continues to circle around the hall.  We get the idea he doesn't
	want to be still.

			     COLE
		...Maybe we can pretend we're going
		to see each other tomorrow?

	Cole glances at Malcolm.

			     COLE
		Just for pretend.

	Beat.  Malcolm exhales very slowly as he gets up.

			     MALCOLM
		Okay, Cole, I'm going to go now...
		I'll see you tomorrow.

	Cole watches as Malcolm walks down the stairs to the entrance.
	Cole stops moving.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		See you tomorrow.

	Malcolm's face shows his losing battle against his emotions.  He
	doesn't turn to look back.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

	A rain-soaked bridge.  A two-lane road merges to one lane around
	a severe car accident.  A rear-ended car has jumped the sidewalk
	and hit the guard rail of the bridge.  The driver is helped out
	by police.  He's shaken but okay.  Police flares guide the cars
	as they crawl by.

	Lynn and Cole are standing still in bumper-to-bumper traffic.

	Lynn leans her chin on the steering wheel.  She tries to stare
	through the layer of water on the glass.  She hits the windshield
	wipers.

			     LYNN
		I hope nobody got hurt.

	Beat.  Lynn glances over to Cole who sits in his seat silently.

			     LYNN
		You're very quiet.
			(beat)
		You're mad I missed the play,
		aren't you?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."

			     LYNN
		I have two jobs, baby.  You know
		how important they are for us.

	Beat.

			     LYNN
		I'd give anything to have been
		there.

			     COLE
		I'm ready to communicate with you
		now.

	Beat.

			     LYNN
		Communicate?

			     COLE
		Tell you my secrets.

	The way he says the words gives Lynn a chill.

			     LYNN
		What is it?

	Cole takes a long time.

			     COLE
		You know that accident up there?

			     LYNN
			(confused)
		Yeah.

			     COLE
		Someone got hurt.

			     LYNN
		They did?

			     COLE
		A lady.  She died.

			     LYNN
		Oh my God.

	Lynn leans over the steering wheel.  She wipes the windshield
	with her palm to see better.

			     LYNN
		You can see her?

			     COLE
		Yes.

	Lynn gazes out the windshield at the line of red tail lights.
	Beat.

			     LYNN
		Where is she?

			     COLE
		Standing next to my window.

	A WOMAN IN HER LATE FORTIES, HELMET CRACKED, HAIR MATTED WITH
	RAIN AND BLOOD, STANDS STARING THROUGH COLE'S PASSENGER WINDOW.

	Lynn looks over slowly.  She doesn't see anything outside his
	window.  She eyes Cole.

			     LYNN
		Cole, you're scaring me.

			     COLE
		They scare me too sometimes.

			     LYNN
		They?

			     COLE
		Dead people.

			     LYNN
		Dead people?

			     COLE
		Ghosts.

	Beat.

			     LYNN
		You see ghosts, Cole?

			     COLE
		They want me to do things for them.

			     LYNN
		They talk to you?

	Cole nods, "Yes."

			     LYNN
		They tell you to do things?

	Cole nods "Yes" again.  Lynn becomes upset.  She nods with grave
	understanding.  Cole watches her.

			     COLE
		What are you thinking, Momma?

			     LYNN
		...I don't know.

			     COLE
		You think I'm a freak?

	Lynn's eyes moves to Cole.

			     LYNN
		Look at my face.

	Cole gazes at her intense expression.

			     LYNN
		I would never think that about you
		...  ever... Got it?

			     COLE
		Got it.

	BEAT.  Cole smiles a tiny smile.  Lynn glances down.

			     LYNN
		Just let me think for a second.

	She drowns in her thoughts.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Grandma says hi.

	Lynn looks up sharply.

			     COLE
		She says she's sorry for taking the
		bumble bee pendant.  She just likes
		it a lot.

			     LYNN
		What?

			     COLE
		Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

	Lynn becomes still.  Her face is unreadable.  When she speaks,
	her words are extremely controlled.

			     LYNN
		Cole, that's very wrong.  Grandma's
		gone.  You know that.

			     COLE
		I know.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		She wanted me to tell you--

			     LYNN
			(soft)
		Cole, please stop.

			     COLE
		She wanted me to tell you, she saw
		you dance.

	Lynn's eyes lock on Cole's.

			     COLE
		She said when you were little, you
		and her had a fight right before
		your dance recital.  You thought
		she didn't come to see you dance.
		She did.

	Lynn brings her hands to her mouth.

			     COLE
		She hid in the back so you wouldn't
		see...  She said you were like an
		angel.

	Lynn begins to cry.

			     COLE
		She said, you came to her where
		they buried her.  Asked her a
		question...  She said the answer is
		"Everyday."

	Lynn covers her face with her hands.  The tears roll out through
	her fingers.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		What did you ask?

	Beat.  Lynn looks at her son.  She barely gets the words out.

			     LYNN
			(crying)
		Do I make her proud?

	Cole moves closer to Lynn.  She cradles him in her arms.  Mother
	and son hold each other tight.

	WE PULL BACK FROM THE WINDSHIELD, BACK PAST THE FRONT BUMPER
	WHERE THE FIGURE OF THE BLOODED WOMAN STANDS STARING AT COLE AND
	HIS MOTHER.

	WE SEE A MANGLED BIKE PULLED OUT FROM THE REAR-ENDED CAR ON THE
	SIDEWALK.  WE MOVE UP AND AWAY FROM THE RAIN-SOAKED BRIDGE.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. MALCOLM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Malcolm walks quietly down the sidewalk towards his home.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Malcolm enters the living room and smiles at what he sees.

	Anna is asleep in a chair.  She's curled up in a ball.  In a way,
	she looks like a little girl.

	Their WEDDING VIDEO PLAYS SOFTLY ON THE TELEVISION.

	Malcolm watches himself and Anna cutting their wedding cake.  THE
	CROWD APPLAUDS AS THEY FEED EACH OTHER PIECES.

	Malcolm turns from the television and takes a seat next to Anna.
	He gazes upon his wife softly.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		Anna, I've been so lost.
			(beat)
		I need my best friend.

	Silence.  Malcolm gazes for a beat before looking down.

			     ANNA
		I miss you.

	Malcolm's eyes move back up.  He looks at his sleeping wife.
	ANNA'S TALKING IN HER SLEEP.

	Malcolm can't believe it.

			     MALCOLM
		I miss you.

	Beat.  Her lips move again.  Eyes never open.

			     ANNA
		Why, Malcolm?

			     MALCOLM
		What, Anna?  What did I do?  What's
		made you so sad?

	Beat.

			     ANNA
		Why did you leave me?

			     MALCOLM
		I didn't leave you.

	Beat.  She becomes silent.  Anna falls back into deep sleep, her
	arm slides down.  SOMETHING SHINY FALLS OUT AND ROLLS ON THE
	GROUND.

	Malcolm's eyes watch as it comes to a stop...  Beat.  He gazes
	curiously at a GOLD WEDDING BAND laying on the wood floor.

	Confusion washes over his face.  He looks to Anna's hand...  An
	identical gold wedding ring sits on her finger.

	Beat.  Malcolm looks down at his own hand...  HIS WEDDING RING IS
	GONE.

	Malcolm is completely lost.  He takes a couple steps back.  Looks
	around in confusion...

	His eyes come to rest on the door to his basement office.  He
	looks in disbelief at the set of DEAD BOLT LOCKS on the door.

	Malcolm doesn't know what the hell's going on...  His eyes are
	drawn to the dining table...  Only ONE PLACE SETTING is out on
	the tabletop.

	His eyes search again -- they finally lock on the WEDDING VIDEO
	PLAYING.  Malcolm watches images of himself on the screen...  His
	eyes fill with a storm of emotions...

	Malcolm looks to Anna's face and becomes very still.  Beat.

	CLOSE ON ANNA...  TILL HER SLEEPING FACE FILLS THE FRAME...  IT'S
	NOW WE NOTICE FOR THE FIRST TIME, THAT ANNA'S BREATHS ARE FORMING
	TINY CLOUDS IN THE COLD AIR.

			     MALCOLM
			(like he's falling
			 down a deep hole)
		No...

							SLAM CUT:

	FLASHBACK:  INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	VIOLENT GUN SHOTS RING THROUGH THE BEDROOM.

	Anna rushes across the room to a crumpled Malcolm laying on the
	floor.  Malcolm's hands are clutched at his side.

	Anna pries his hands away to reveal the tiniest tear in his
	shirt.  Anna's eyes catch something dark -- moving...  A POOL OF
	BLOOD IS FORMING UNDER MALCOLM.  She slowly turns him over on his
	side...  A horrific sight...  An enormous exit wound on his lower
	back pours out blood uncontrollably.

	Malcolm's jaw is locked open.  His breaths are long and strained.

	ANNA IS SCREAMING, BUT HER VOICE SOUNDS FAR AWAY.

	Malcolm's open jaw releases a long strained breath and then
	becomes silent.  Anna tries to cover the wound with her hands
	desperately.

							SLAM CUT:

	PRESENT:  INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

			     MALCOLM
			(screaming)
		     ANNA!

	MALCOLM'S VOICE SHAKES THE ROOM.

	Anna just sleeps.

	Malcolm staggers back.  His breathing erratic.

	He takes a seat across from her.  He looks at his wife and
	suddenly becomes very still.

	Anna's still curled up asleep, but tears are falling from her
	shut eyes.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Don't cry.

	Anna doesn't move, but her tears seem to fall a little faster.

			     MALCOLM
		I think I have to go.

	Malcolm's mind is racing.

			     MALCOLM
			(realizing)
		I just needed to do a couple of
		things.
			(beat)
		And I needed to tell you something.

			     ANNA
		Tell me.

	Beat.
			     MALCOLM
		You were never second...  Ever.

	Malcolm gazes at his wife.  Tears fall from both their eyes.

			     MALCOLM
		You sleep now, Anna.  Everything
		will be different in the morning.

	Anna lays still.

			     ANNA
		Goodnight, Malcolm.

			     MALCOLM
		Goodnight, sweetheart.

	The room falls into silence.  Malcolm sits still across from his
	wife.  He drinks her in with his eyes.

	Malcolm leans back in the chair.  Slowly closes his eyes.  They
	close shut.

	WE ARE TIGHT ON ANNA...  WE SEE HER SOFT BREATHS FORMING A TINY
	CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR...

	WITH EACH BREATH, THEY BECOME LESS AND LESS VISIBLE...  THE ROOM
	BECOMING LESS AND LESS COLD.

	SOON HER BREATHS AREN'T VISIBLE AT ALL.  SHE BREATHES GENTLY,
	FALLING BACK INTO A PEACEFUL SLEEP.

	WE PULL BACK to reveal Anna alone in the living room.

	THE WEDDING VIDEO PLAYS ITS LAST SCENES...  MALCOLM IS AT THE
	MICROPHONE ON THE DANCE FLOOR IN FRONT OF ALL THE GUESTS.  HE'S
	HOLDING A GLASS OF WINE.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		...I think I've had too much to
		drink.

	Malcolm smiles as he takes a sip.  The guests chuckle as they
	watch.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		I just have to say, this day today
		has been one very special day...
		I wish we all could stay and play.

	The crowd erupts in LAUGHTER.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		What?

	Malcolm looks around at everyone's smiling faces.

	Beat.  Malcolm takes his time.  He looks just past the camera.

			     MALCOLM
		Anna, I never thought I'd feel the
		things I'm feeling.  I never
		thought I'd be able to stand up in
		front of my friends and family and
		tell them what's inside me...
		Today I can...

	Malcolm's eyes fill with water.

			     MALCOLM
			(softly)
		Anna Crowe...  I am in love.  In
		love I am.

	INT. BASEMENT - EVENING

	A NAKED LIGHTBULB SPARKS TO LIFE.  It dangles from the ceiling of
	a basement.

	LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS AS ANNA CROWE moves down the stairs.

	Anna is the rare combination of beauty and innocence.  She stands
	in the chilly basement in an elegant summer dress that outlines
	her slender body.  Her gentle eyes move across the empty room and
	come to rest on a rack of wine bottles covering one entire wall.

	She walks to the bottles.  Her fingertips slide over the labels.
	She stops when she finds just the right one.  A tiny smile as she
	slides it out.

	Anna turns to leave.  Stops.  She stares at the shadowy basement.
	It's an unsettling place.  She stands very still and watches her
	breath form a TINY CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR.  She's visibly
	uncomfortable.

	Anna Crowe moves for the staircase in a hurry.  Each step faster
	than the next.  She climbs out of the basement in another burst
	of LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS.

	WE HEAR HER HIT THE LIGHT SWITCH.

	THE LIGHTBULB DIES.  DRIPPING BLACK DEVOURS THE ROOM.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING

	Two place settings are arranged on the living room coffee table.
	Take-out Chinese food sits half eaten on good china.  An empty
	bottle of red wine sits between boxes of Chinese food.

	Anna arrives with the backup bottle and is now wearing a sweater.
	She hands a collegiate rowing team sweatshirt to Malcolm.

			     ANNA
		It's getting cold.

	MALCOLM CROWE sits on the floor at the coffee table, his vest and
	tie on the sofa behind him.  A jacket and an overcoat lay on a
	brirfcase next to him.

	Malcolm is in his thirties with thick, wavy hair and striking,
	intelligent eyes that squint from years of intense study.  His
	charming, easy-going smile spreads across his face.  He points.

			     MALCOLM
		That's one fine frame.  A fine
		frame it is.

	Malcolm points to the HUGE FRAMED CERTIFICATE propped up on a
	dining room chair.  It's printed on aged parchment-type paper.
	The frame is a polished mahogany.

	He slips on the sweatshirt.

			     MALCOLM
		How much does a fine frame like
		that cost, you think?

	Anna hands the backup bottle over to Malcolm.

			     ANNA
			(smiling)
		I've never told you...  but you
		sound a little like Dr. Seuss when
		you're drunk.

	Malcolm uncorks the wine and starts pouring in the empty glass.

			     MALCOLM
		Anna, I'm serious.  Serious I am,
		Anna.

	Anna giggles.  She's clearly buzzed herself.  Malcolm doesn't get
	it.  Anna takes a few calming sips of her wine.  Her attention
	slowly moves to the framed certificate.

			     ANNA
		Mahogany.  I'd say that cost at
		least a couple hundred.  Maybe
		three.

			     MALCOLM
		Three?  We should hock it.  Buy a
		C.D. rack for the bedroom.

			     ANNA
		Do you know how important this is?
		This is big time.
			(beat)
		I'm going to read it for you,
		doctor.

			     MALCOLM
		Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?

	Anna ignores Malcolm and clears her throat.  She leans forward
	her seat and reads the certificate out loud as Malcolm tries to
	tickle her.

			     ANNA
		In recognition for his outstanding
		achievement in the field of child
		psychology, his dedication to his
		work, and his continuing efforts to
		improve the quality of life for
		countless children and their
		families, the City of Philadelphia
		proudly bestows upon its son Dr.
		Malcolm Crowe...  That's you...
		the Mayor's Citation for
		Professional Excellence.

	Beat.  The power of the words sobers the two of them.

			     ANNA
		Wow.  They called you their son.

			     MALCOLM
		We can keep it in the bathroom.

	Anna turns to Malcolm.  He smiles.

			     MALCOLM
		It's not real, Anna.  Some
		secretary wrote that up.  Don't
		tell me you thought it was real?

	Anna's expression becomes serious.


			     MALCOLM
		What?

	She just keeps staring.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Don't do the quiet thing.  You know
		I hate it.

	Beat.

			     ANNA
		This is an important night for us.
		Finally someone is recognizing the
		sacrifices you made.  That you have
		put everything second, including me,
		for those families they're talking
		about.

	Malcolm plays softly with her face.  Anna takes his hands and
	holds them steady.

			     ANNA
		They're also saying that my husband
		has a gift.  Not an ordinary gift
		that allows him to hit a ball over a
		fence.  Or a gift that lets him
		produce beautiful images on a
		canvas...  Your gift teaches
		children how to be strong in
		situations where most adults would
		piss on themselves.
			(beat)
		Yes, I believe what they wrote
		about you.

	Anna lets go of his hands.  Anna's eyes are emotional.  Malcolm
	smiles softly.

			     MALCOLM
		Thank you.

	Anna leans towards him.  They hold each other tight.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		What are we hugging about again?

	Anna laughs as she wipes her eyes.

			     ANNA
		Nothing.  There wasn't supposed to
		be any crying at this celebration.
		Just a lot of drinking and sex.

	Malcolm's charming, easy-going smile returns.

			     MALCOLM
		I would like some red wine in a
		glass.

	Anna hands him his glass.  He stares at it.

			     MALCOLM
		I would not like it in a mug.  I
		would not like it in a jug.

	Malcolm looks at Anna surprised at what he said.  They crack up
	laughing.  THEIR SWEET LAUGHTER FILLS THE HOUSE.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	TWO GIGGLING SHADOWS APPEAR IN THE BEDROOM DOORWAY.  They try to
	turn on the light.  It doesn't come on.

			     MALCOLM
		Bulb's out.

	Anna giggles some more as Malcolm's shadow stumbles across the
	bedroom.

	MALCOLM TURNS ON THE BATHROOM LIGHT.

	A SHAFT OF LIGHT falls on Anna as she stands in the corner of the
	room.

	Anna smiles playfully and pulls off her sweater.  She sways to a
	pretend striptease song.

	Malcolm can't hold back his grin.  He joins in -- slowly peeling
	off the sweat-shirt.  He looks back to Anna.  She's stopped her
	playful dance.  She's facing away from him.

	He walks towards her.  HIS GRIN QUIETLY DISAPPEARS.  Malcolm's
	face turns to rock as his attention is drawn to the SHATTERED
	WINDOW in their bedroom.  The wind moves through the room.  A
	lamp lays broken on the ground by the window.

	Malcolm kneels down.  Beat.  Anna's eyes fill with a quiet
	awareness.

			     ANNA
		He's still in the house.

	A SHADOW FROM THE BATHROOM FLATS OVER BOTH OF THEM.

	ANNA SCREAMS.

	Malcolm spins around.  His heart stops.

	Malcolm and Anna stare at the bathroom doorwary.  They know
	someone is inside.  Beat.

	Malcolm slowly starts towards the door.  The first thing that
	comes into view are the clothes on the bathroom floor.  Then the
	figure of a man comes into view.  A STRANGER stands bare chested
	in the back of the bathroom.

	NO ONE MAKES A SOUND.

	The STRANGER is about nineteen.  Drugged out.  Pitch black eyes
	bulging.  His body is covered in scars and bruises.  His hands
	are folded in front of him.  He shakes ever so slightly.  He has a
	patch of white in his hair.

	Malcolm speaks in a very calm voice.  Never takes his eyes off
	the stranger.

			     MALCOLM
		Anna, don't move.  Don't say a word.

	Anna barely nods her understanding.

			     MALCOLM
			(to the stranger)
		This is forty-seven Locust Street.
		You have broken a window and
		entered a private residence.  Do
		you understand what I'm saying?

	The stranger slowly looks up for the first time.  His eyes lock
	on Malcolm.

			     STRANGER
		You don't know so many things.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		There are no needles or
		prescription drugs of any kind in
		this house.

	The stranger suddenly comes forward into the doorway.  Malcolm
	stumbles back onto the edge of the bed.

	Anna sees the stranger for the first time.  Her face drains of
	color.

	The stranger looks at Malcolm.  He half grins.

			     STRANGER
		Are you drunk?

	The stranger's stare slides to Anna.

			     STRANGER
		Did you get him drunk?

	The stranger gazes at Anna.  Gazes directly into her eyes.  A
	penetrating, unwavering stare.


			     STRANGER
		Do you know why you're scared when
		you're alone?

	Anna's expression instanly changes.

			     STRANGER
		I know.

	BEAT.  THE ROOM GOES SILENT.

			     MALCOLM
		What do you want?  I don't
		understand what you want.

	The stranger turns and glares at Malcolm.

			     STRANGER
		What you promised.

	Malcolm stops all movement.

			     ANNA
		--My God.

			     MALCOLM
		--Do I know you?

			     STRANGER
		Let's all celebrate, Dr. Malcolm
		Crowe. Recipient of awards from the
		Mayor on the news.  Dr. Malcolm
		Crowe, he's helped so many children...
		And he doesn't even remember my
		name?

	Malcolm can't speak.  Beat.  The stranger's face starts to
	tremble.

			     STRANGER
		I was ten when you worked with me.

	Beat.  Malcolm's intelligent eyes race for answers.

			     STRANGER
		Downtown clinic?  Single parent
		family?
			(beat)
		I had a possible mood disorder...
			(beat)
		I had no friends... you said I was
		socially isolated.
			(beat)
		I was afraid -- you called it acute
		anxiety...
			(beat)
		You were wrong.
			(beat)
		Come on, clear your head...  Male,
		nine...  Single parent...  Mood
		discorder... Acute anxiety.

	Malcolm looks like someone hit him with a sledgehammer.

			     STRANGER
		I'm nineteen.  I have drugs in my
		system twenty-four hours a day...
		I still have no friends.  I still
		have no peace.  I'm still afraid.

	Tears jump into the stranger's eyes.

			     STRANGER
		...I'm still afraid.

	Malcolm stands.

			     MALCOLM
		Please give me a second to think.

	Malcolm's shaking hands touch his mouth as he stares at the
	stranger.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Bed Freidken?

			     STRANGER
		Some people call me freak.

			     MALCOLM
		...Ronald...  Ronald Sumner?

	Tears fall down the stranger's face.

			     STRANGER
		I am a freak.

	Malcolm looks up at the sound of those words.  Something clicks
	in his head.

			     MALCOLM
		--Vincent?

	THE ROOM GOES SILENT AGAIN.

			     MALCOLM
		Vincent Gray?

	VINCENT GRAY stares with surprise through his tears.

	Malcolm lets out a deep breath like he just emerged from deep
	waters.

			     MALCOLM
		I do remember you, Vincent.  You
		were a good kid.  Very smart...
		Quiet...  Compassionate...
		Unusually compassionate...

	Vincent's eyes burn at Malcolm.

			     VINCENT
		You forgot cursed.

	VINCENT is fully crying now.

			     VINCENT
		You failed me.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		Vincent...  I'm sorry I didn't help
		you...  I can try to help you now.

	Vincent turns to the sink.  His hand goes in.  He turns arund and
	raises a gun at Malcolm.  He FIRES.  A VIOLENT, EAR-SHATTERING
	ECHO.  Malcolm clutches his stomach and folds like a rag doll
	onto the bed.

	Vincent instantly moves the gun to his own head.  ANOTHER
	HORRIFIC BLAST SPIKES THE AIR.  Vincent crumples onto the
	bathroom floor.

	ANNA'S CHILLING SCREAMS FILL THEIR HOME.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BENCH - AFTERNOON

	The legend, "Two Years Later" appears.

	A man flips open a worn file folder on his lap.  Handwritten
	notes fill every line.  At the top of the first page reads,
	"Vincent Gray, age 10, Referred January 19, 1989."

	The man's hand touches the name almost reverently.

	He glances through the page.  Words and phrases are circled
	throughout the file.

	"...Acute anxiety"
	"...Socially isolated"
	"...Possible mood disorder"
	"...Parent status -- Divorced"
	"...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad"

	The man's hands flip the page.  At the top of this new page
	reads, "Cole Sear, age 8, Referred September 1998."

	As the man's fingers move through the notes we again see words
	and phrases circled throughout this new case history.

	"...Acute anxiety"
	"...Socially isolated"
	"...Possible mood disorder"
	"...Parent status -- Divorced"
	"...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad"

	The hands close the notepad.  The hands are slightly shaking now.

	WE PULL BACK to reveal the shaking hands belong to Dr. Malcolm
	Crowe.

	Malcolm sits on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes
	across the street.  He gazes blankly at the brownstones.  Beat.

	A door opens.  Malcolm is brought out of his trance.

	COLE SEAR steps out his front door.  Cole is a munchkin of a boy
	with large, black eyes that seem to take in everything around
	him.

	His hair is dark, with a small patch of jet white on the side.
	Cole carefully locks the door behind him.

	He moves to the bottom of the stairs and looks around nervously.
	Anxiously.

	The eight-year-old child reaches into his pocket and slips on a
	pair of VERY LARGE GLASSES.  They look comical on him.

	Malcolm rises to his feet.  He smooths out his shirt.  Looks down
	and buttons his jacket.

	When he looks up, Cole is gone.

	Malcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy.  Cole runs at full
	speed down the street and turns the corner.  TINY SNEAKERS
	SCREECHING ON THE SIDEWALK.

	For a second, Malcolm doesn't react.  The second passes.  He
	stuffs the file in his bag and starts running too.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Malcolm hauls down the sidewalk.  He comes to a hard stop at a
	street intersection.  Searches.  Spots Cole running into a
	parking lot.

	COLE sprints across the empty lot and reaches the doors of a
	building.  He has to use all his strength to push open the highly
	ornate doors.  He slips inside.

	Malcolm jogs into the parking area.  His pace slows to a walk and
	then to stillness as he gazes up at the building.  Its old stone
	and huge towers make it stand out from the modern buildings all
	around it.  Malcolm stares up at the historic Philadelphia church
	quietly.

	A SHOOTING PAIN PIERCES HIS SIDE.  Malcolm's hand goes to it
	quickly.  He waits for it to pass before starting for the ornate
	doors.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CHURCH - DAY

	Only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews.

	Malcolm scans the majestic room and finds what he's looking for
	in the last row of the church.

	He moves down the center aisle towards the back.

	Malcolm finds Cole playing in his pew with a set of green and
	beige plastic soldiers.  Cole makes the soldiers talk to each
	other.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		Pro... Fun... Add...

	The words are unintelligible.

	Cole senses someone.  He looks up and sees Malcolm staring at
	him.  The boy immediately goes white.  Every cell of his body
	still with fear.

			     MALCOLM
		It's okay, Cole.  Don't be
		frightened.

	Cole stays rigid.  Hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen.

			     MALCOLM
		My name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe.  I
		was supposed to meet you today.
		Sorry I missed our appointment.

	Malcolm waits for a response.  None comes.

			     MALCOLM
		Do you mind if I sit down?  I have
		this injury from a couple of years
		ago and it flares up every once in
		a while just so I won't forget it.

	Beat.  Cole slowly slides down the pew, giving Malcolm most of
	the seat.  Malcolm sits.

	Cole fidgets with his soldiers.  Beat.  Malcolm looks over and
	stares at Cole's glasses.  He leans forward to inspect them more
	carefully.

			     MALCOLM
		Your eye frames.  They don't seem to
		have any lenses in them.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		They're my dad's.  The lenses hurt
		my eyes.

			     MALCOLM
		I knew there was a sound explanation.

	Malcolm returns to staring at his lap.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		What was that you were saying
		before with your soldiers?  Day pro
		fun.

			     COLE
		...De profundis clamo ad te domine.

	Malcolm stares surprised.

			     COLE
		It's called Latin.  It's a
		language.

	Malcolm nods at the information.

			     MALCOLM
		All your soldiers speak Latin?

			     COLE
		No, just one.

	Malcolm smiles at Cole.  His eyes drift down to Cole's arms.
	Malcolm's smile slowly disappears.

	Cole's arms are covered in TINY CUTS AND BRUISES.  Some almost
	healed.  Some fresh.  Malcolm looks around to gather himself.
	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		I like churches, too.
			(beat)
		In olden times, in Europe, people
		used to hide in churches.  Claim
		sanctuary.

	Cole looks up.

			     COLE
		What were they hiding from?

			     MALCOLM
		Oh, lots of things, I suppose.  Bad
		people for one.  People who wanted
		to imprison them.  Hurt them.

			     COLE
		Nothing bad can happen in a church,
		right?

	Malcolm studies Cole's anxious face.

			     MALCOLM
		Right.

	Malcolm and Cole just stare at each other.

			     COLE
		I forgot your name.

			     MALCOLM
		Dr. Crowe.

			     COLE
		You're a doctor.  What kind?

			     MALCOLM
		I work with young people who might
		be sad or upset or just want to
		talk.  I try to help them figure
		things out.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Are you a good doctor?

	Malcolm smiles.

			     MALCOLM
		I got an award once.  From the
		Mayor.

			     COLE
		Congratulations.

			     MALCOLM
		Thank you.  It was a long time ago.
		I've kind of been retired for a
		while.
			(beat)
		You're my very first client back.

			     COLE
		You use needles?

			     MALCOLM
		No.

			     COLE
		Not even little ones that aren't
		supposed to hurt?

			     MALCOLM
		No.

			     COLE
		That's good.

	Cole pockets his soldiers and rises from his pew.

			     COLE
		I'm going to see you again, right?

			     MALCOLM
		If it's okay with you?

	Cole thinks it over carefully.

			     COLE
		It's okay with me.

	Cole and Malcolm just stare at each other.

			     MALCOLM
		And Cole, next time I won't be late
		for you.

			     COLE
		Next time I won't be scared of you.

	Cole turns and starts to the rear of the church.  Malcolm loses
	himself in his thoughts.

	When Malcolm looks back, he sees Cole stop by the exit doors and
	take a tiny STATUE OF JESUS off the back table.  Cole pockets the
	statue and quietly leaves the church.

	Malcolm just sits and stares.

							CUT TO:

	INT. MALCOLM'S HOME - EVENING

	The house is dimly lit.  Malcolm has to turn on the HALLWAY LIGHT.

			     MALCOLM
		It's me.

	He stops before a pile of mail collecting on a thin table.  He
	stares at it blankly.  Almost every envelope has "Over Due" or
	"Final Notice" stamped on it.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DINING TABLE - EVENING

	Malcolm stares down at the remains of a meal on the only place
	setting on the table.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - EVENING

	Malcolm quietly walks into his bedroom.  Only A READING LIGHT IS
	ON.  THE SOFT LIGHT FALLS ON ANNA AS SHE SLEEPS.

	Malcolm moves to her side.  The sight of her stops him.

	He stares at his wife...

	She huddles under a blanket, a wad of tissues in her hand.  He
	takes it in silently.

	His eyes move to her face...  One wisp of hair falls over her
	soft lips.  OUTLINED IN THE SOFT READING LIGHT, Anna Crowe truly
	looks like an angel.

	Malcolm forms a tiny smile.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	Malcolm turns and moves for a narrow door in the hallway.

	THE DOOR KNOB.  He tries to open it.  IT'S LOCKED.  Malcolm
	reaches into his pockets.  Searches for his keys.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

	The empty basement is no longer empty.  It's piled with file
	cabinets and boxes of psychology and medical books.  A desk sits
	in the corner next to the wine racks.

	The room still feels unsettling.

	Malcolm hunches over one of the books.  Rifles through a stack of
	dusty books.  Pulls out a thick text.

	The spine of the text reads, "The Meridian Latin Dictionary."

	Malcolm sits back at his desk and opens Cole's file.  Handwritten
	on the first page are the words,

		"De profundis calms ad te, domine"

	Malcolm starts working through the Latin text.  As he comes to
	each word, he jots it down underneath the Latin.

	Malcolm translates the last word.

	He stares quietly at the paper.  The new words reads...

		"Out of the depths, I cry to you Lord."

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		...The mass for the dead.

	The words seem to hang in the air forever.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. PHILADELPHIA - DAWN

	Old Philadelphia awakens...  For a moment, it's like we're back
	in time.

	A golden sun dances on the waters of Penns Landing.  Historical
	old ships sit docked in its harbor...  The dark bronze surface of
	the Liberty Bell reflects the dawn...  A majestic Independence
	Hall stands watch as its city begins to stir...  A thirty foot
	statue of Ben Franklin makes a proud silhouette against the
	morning sky...

	AND THEN 1997 COMES CRASHING IN.

	FLUORESCENT HOUSE LIGHTS COME ON IN WINDOWS...  Jeeps and
	hatchbacks start roaming the cobblestone streets...  Neon
	restaurants signs flicker to life...  Traffic helicopters make
	their rounds...  CAR ALARMS PIERCE THE AIR.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING

	A hand turns off a radio, shutting off the morning news.

	A small dog with two different colored eyes sticks his head out
	of the dryer, where he plays with the newly-dried clothes.

	LYNN SEAR reaches in and pulls out a blouse.

	She shakes it in the air and slips it on as she dresses hurriedly
	for work.

	Lynn is a woman in her late twenties.  One hundred percent South
	Philly.  Hair teased.  She chews on an early morning piece of
	Trident.  Under all of it, Lynn Sear is an attractive and
	sweet-looking young woman.

	Lynn enters THE KITCHEN through a swinging door.

	A bowl of cereal and milk sit on a table in an empty kitchen.

	Lynn stares at a handful of kitchen CABINETS and DRAWERS that are
	open.

	Lynn shakes her head.

			     LYNN
		Cole.

	She closes them one at a time before moving to the coffee machine.

	Lynn shivers a little.  She leans over the thermostat and raises
	the heat.  She returns to her post at the coffee machine.

	TINY FOOTSTEPS.

	Lynn turns to see Cole standing in his private school uniform.

			     LYNN
		Your Cocoa Puffs are getting soggy.

	Lynn walks over to Cole.  Checks his tie.

			     LYNN
		You got a spot.

	Lynn unclips the tie.  Cole takes a seat at the kitchen table as
	Lynn walks back into the laundry room.

	The dog is gone now.  Lynn reaches into the dryer, digging for a
	new tie.  She finds one, then turns and steps back into the
	kitchen and SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS.

	Every cabinet and every drawer is wide open.

	Cole sits at the kitchen table.  His hands are pressed flat on
	the tabletop.

	He looks shaken.

	Neither says anything for a beat.

			     LYNN
			(shaken)
		Something you were looking for,
		baby?

	Beat.

			     COLE
			(shaken)
		Pop Tarts.

	Lynn looks over to the open cabinet near the sink.  The pop tarts
	are clearly visible.

			     LYNN
		They're right here.

			     COLE
		Oh.

	Cole gets up from the table.  Takes his pop tarts.  Doesn't make
	eye contact.

			     COLE
		What are you thinking, Momma?

			     LYNN
		Lots of things.

			     COLE
		Anything bad about me?

	Lynn leans down.

			     LYNN
		Look at my face.

	Cole does.

			     LYNN
		I wasn't thinking anything bad
		about you, got it?

	He looks at her eyes.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Got it.

	THE DOOR BELL RINGS.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		That's Tommy, Momma.

	Cole quietly kisses his mother on the cheek and starts out.

			     LYNN
		Don't you want this?

	Cole turns to see Lynn holding the pop tarts.  He walks back and
	takes them from her before leaving.

	Beat.  Lynn glances to the kitchen table.  Her gaze stops on the
	TWO TINY HAND PRINTS OF SWEAT formed on the table's surface.

	Lynn stands motionless in the kitchen.  She looks up and wraps
	her arms around her shivering shoulders.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BROWNSTONE STREET - MORNING

	TOMMY TAMMISIMO is a tough-looking, eight-year-old Italian kid
	who waits at the bottom of Cole's brownstone stairs in his school
	uniform.

	Cole emerges from the brownstone and moves down the steps.
	Lynn's face appears in the kitchen window.

	The two boys begin their walk down the street to school.  Tommy
	puts his arm around Cole.  Lynn waves.  Cole waves back.

	When the two boys turn the corner and are out of Lynn's sight,
	Tommy rips his arm away.

			     TOMMY
		Hey freak, how'd you like the "arm
		around your shoulder" bit.  I just
		made it up.  Went with it.  That's
		what great actors do.  It's called
		improv.

	Tommy starts to run ahead, he turns and back pedals.

			     TOMMY
			(taunting)
		Be careful...  I hope no one jumps
		out and gets you.

	Tommy runs away.

	Beat.  Cole looks around nervously.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. ST. ANTHONY'S ACADEMY - MORNING

	The last uniformed boys and girls rush into the front doors of
	St. Anthony's Academy as the FINAL BELL SOUNDS.

	Cole is the last one to go in.  He stands alone on the sidewalk.
	He looks like he'd rather be anywhere but there.

	Beat.

	He buries his hands in his pockets and begins a quiet walk by
	himself into the school.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. COLE'S HOME - AFTERNOON

	The front door CREAKS open as Cole walks in after school.  He
	looks around before closing the door.  His eyes stop on Lynn
	seated in the open doorway of the den.  Malcolm is seated with
	her.  They both look up.

	Lynn comes out.  She reaches Cole -- kneels down in front of him.

			     LYNN
			(whispers)
		How was school, baby?

	Cole shrugs.

			     LYNN
			(whispers)
		You know, you can tell me things if
		you need to.

	Cole doesn't respond.  Beat.

			     LYNN
			(whispers)
		Well, you know what I did today?

	Cole shakes his head "No."

			     LYNN
			(whispers)
		I won the Pennsylvania Lottery in
		the morning.  I quit my jobs.  Ate
		a big picnic in the park with lots
		of chocolate mouses pie and then
		swam in the fountain all afternoon...
			(smiling)
		What did you do?

	Cole starts to smile too.  He thinks.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		I was picked first for kickball
		teams at recess.  I hit a grand
		slam to win the game and everyone
		lifted me up on their shoulders and
		carried me around cheering.

	Cole and Lynn smile at each other.  Beat.

	Lynn tries to hide the utter sadness behind her smile.

			     LYNN
		I'll make triangle pancakes.  You
		got an hour.

	Lynn takes Cole's school bag and jacket before moving to the
	kitchen.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DEN - AFTERNOON

	The den doubles as a playroom.  Boxes of old toys sit in the
	corner.  A small, plastic, multi-colored table sits on the rug.

	Cole appears in the doorway.  Malcolm sits up and smiles.

	He points to the chair on the other side of the coffee table.

			     MALCOLM
		You want to sit?

	Cole nods very softly, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		Don't feel like talking right now?

	Cole nods again very softly, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		How about we play a game first?

	Cole looks a little more interested.

			     MALCOLM
		It's a mind-reading game...  Did I
		mention I could read minds?

	Cole nods, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		Here's the game.  I'll read your
		mind.  If what I say is right, you
		take a step forwards the chair.  If
		I'm wrong, you take a step
		backwards the doorway.  If you
		reach the chair, you sit.  If you
		reach the door, you can go.  Deal?

	Cole tilts his head, then nods, "Yes."

	Malcolm presses his fingers to his temples like a vaudeville
	magician.  He closes his eyes tight.

			     MALCOLM
		Just after your mom and dad were
		divorced, your mom went to a doctor
		like me and it didn't help her.
		And so you think I'm not going to
		help you.

	Beat.  Cole, surprised, takes a small step forward.

			     MALCOLM
		You're worried because she said she
		told him things.  Things she
		couldn't tell anybody else.
			(beat)
		Secrets.

	Cole takes a step.  Malcolm opens his eyes.  He looks right at
	Cole.

			     MALCOLM
		You have a secret.  But you don't
		want to tell me.

	Beat.  Cole takes another step.  The next step will put him at
	the chair.  Malcolm lowers his fingers from his temple.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		You don't have to tell me your
		secret if you don't want to.

	Malcolm smiles.  Returns his fingers to the mind-reading
	position.  Malcolm looks to Cole's arm.  Cole is wearing A LARGE
	SILVER WATCH.  It swims on his thin wrist.  It could probably
	slide up to his shoulder.  Malcolm closes his eyes.

			     MALCOLM
		Your father gave you that watch as
		a present before he left.

	Cole takes a step BACK.  Beat.  Malcolm lowers his hands
	surprised.

			     COLE
		He forgot it in a drawer.  It
		doesn't work.

	Beat.  Malcolm puts his fingers to his temple.  This time a
	little bit slower.  He gazes at Cole's school uniform.

			     MALCOLM
		You don't like to say much at
		school.  You're an excellent
		student however.  You've never been
		in any kind of serious trouble.

	Beat.  Cole takes a slow step back.  Beat.

			     COLE
		We were supposed to draw a picture.
		Anything we wanted...  I drew a man.
		He got hurt in the neck by another
		man with a screwdriver.

	AN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE OVERTAKES THE DEN.

			     MALCOLM
		You saw that on T.V., Cole?

	Cole answers by taking a small step back.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Everybody got upset.  They had a
		meeting.  Momma started crying.
			(beat)
		I don't draw like that anymore.

			     MALCOLM
		How do you draw now?

			     COLE
		I draw people with smiles, dogs
		running, and rainbows.
			(beat)
		They don't have meetings about
		rainbows.

			     MALCOLM
			(soft)
		I guess they don't.

	Malcolm looks down at Cole's feet.  They're almost at the
	doorway.  One more step and he's there.  Cole is very still.  He
	doesn't move at all.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		What am I thinking now?

	Malcolm takes his time before speaking.  He just stares.  No
	fingers to the temple.  No games.  He just stares.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		You're thinking...
			(beat)
		I don't know what you're thinking,
		Cole.

	Cole quietly takes a step back into the doorway of the other room.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		I was thinking...  you're nice.
			(beat)
		But you can't help me.

	Cole's tiny figure steps away.  Malcolm stares helplessly at the
	empty doorway where his client used to stand.

	THE DEN IS SUFFOCATED WITH SILENCE.

							CUT TO:

	INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING

	Malcolm hurriedly enters a spacious, dimly-lit Italian
	restaurant.  He stops in the dining room and searches the many
	candle-lit tables.  He finds Anna.

	Anna sits alone at a corner table.  The remains of her half-eaten
	dinner lay on the only place setting on the table.  A small PIECE
	OF CAKE WITH A CANDLE in it sits untouched.

	Anna stirs sugar in her coffee as Malcolm sits in the seat across
	from her.  She gently stops stirring, but doesn't look up.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		I thought you meant the other
		Italian restaurant I asked you to
		marry me in.

	Anna isn't laughing.  Not even close.

			     MALCOLM
		I'm so sorry.
			(beat)
		I can't seem to keep track of time.

	Anna quietly takes a sip from her coffee.

			     MALCOLM
		It didn't go well today.  Spent
		some time after trying to get my
		head together.

	Anna looks around for the waiter.

			     MALCOLM
		They're so similar, Anna.  They
		have the same mannerisms.  The same
		expressions.  The same thing
		hanging over them.
			(beat)
		It might be some kind of abuse.

	That makes Anna turn back.  She glances across the table, then
	looks down.

			     MALCOLM
		There are cuts on Cole's arms.
		Fingernail marks, I think.  Looks
		like defensive cuts.

	Malcolm demonstrates by holding up his arm to shield his face.

			     MALCOLM
			(beat)
		Possibly a teacher, neighbor.
			(beat)
		I don't think it's the mother.
		Just a gut thing.  The way she
		deals with him.  It doesn't fit.
			(beat)
		Hard to say this early.  Could
		just be a child climbing a lot of
		trees.

	Malcolm loses himself in his thoughts.  The waiter drops off the
	check on the table.  Anna grabs it before Malcolm and quickly
	signs it.

			     MALCOLM
		I know I've been kind of out of it
		for a long while and you resent it.
		You do.  I know you're mad.  I know
		it's put some distance between us.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		But I'm getting a second chance
		here.  I can't let it slip away.

	Anna waits till he's done and rises from the table.  She pushes
	her chair in hard and walks away without a word.  Malcolm sits
	alone and stares at the piece of cake with a candle on it.

			     MALCOLM
			(soft)
		...Happy Anniversary.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. FRONT STEPS - AFTERNOON

	Cole is seated on the front stoop of his brownstone.  On the
	steps and on the landing are his plastic soldiers in the grips of
	a war.

	Malcolm sits with his bag and overcoat on the step next to him.
	Malcolm just observes quietly.  Beat.

	Cole glances up as he plays.  Sees Malcolm's expression.

			     COLE
		You want to ask me a question?

			     MALCOLM
		See, this is why I lose at poker.
		Yes, I do have a question.

	On the step are two rows of soldiers facing each other.  To one
	side are a couple soldiers covered by a tissue.  Malcolm points
	to them.

			     MALCOLM
		What happened to those two?  Being
		under tissue paper can't be a good
		thing.

	Cole removes the tissue.

			     COLE
		That's Private Jenkins and Private
		Kinney.  They got killed.  Private
		Jenkins has a baby girl that was
		born seven pounds, six ounces.
		He's never seen her.  He wanted to
		get back to Blue Bell, Pennsylvania
		and hold her...

	Cole points to the other soldier.

			     COLE
		Private Kinney's wife is really
		sick -- she has something called a
		brain anism.

			     MALCOLM
			(soft)
		You mean aneurysm.

			     COLE
		Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get
		back safe to take care of her.

	Beat.  Cole's face becomes emotional.  Tears fill his eyes.

			     COLE
		It's sad they died, isn't it?

	Malcolm falls into silence and stares at his client.  Beat.  Cole
	wipes his eyes quickly.

			     COLE
		Don't look at me.
			(beat)
		I don't like people looking at me
		like that.

	Malcolm takes in Cole's gesture and expression.

			     COLE
		Stop looking at me.

	Malcolm looks down.

			     MALCOLM
		Where should I look then, Cole?

			     COLE
		Look over there.

	Cole points to the corner of the street.  Malcolm slowly turns.
	He sits in profile to Cole.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		It's very unusual for someone your
		age to understand the kind of
		problems that Private Jenkins and
		Private Kinney have or even to be
		thinking about them at all...

	Malcolm continues to stare at the street.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		It is okay if I look back now?

	Cole doesn't answer.

			     MALCOLM
		Tap the foot once for "No" and
		twice for "Yes."

	Cole taps his foot once.

	Malcolm sits patiently.  Beat.  They don't say anything for a
	while.

			     MALCOLM
		You wouldn't want to take a walk,
		would you?

	Cole looks up from his soldiers.  Malcolm stares at the far side
	of the street.

	Cole taps his foot twice.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

	The two of them walk down a row of brownstones across from a park
	where children Cole's age are playing.

			     COLE
		I walk this way to school with
		Tommy Tammisimo.

			     MALCOLM
		He your best buddy?

	Cole almost smiles.

			     COLE
		He hates me.

			     MALCOLM
		You hate him?

	Cole shakes his head, "No.!

	Malcolm thinks for a bit.

			     MALCOLM
		Your mom set that up?

	Cole nods "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		You ever tell her about how it is
		with Tommy?

			     COLE
		I don't tell her a thing.

			     MALCOLM
		Why?

			     COLE
		Cause she doesn't look at me like
		everybody and I don't want her to.
		I don't want her to know.

			     MALCOLM
		Know what?

			     COLE
		That I'm a freak.

	Malcolm stops walking.  The words hit him hard.  He stares at
	Cole.

			     MALCOLM
		Listen to me.  You are not a freak.
		Don't you believe anybody that
		tells you that.  It's bullshit and
		you don't have to grow up believing
		that.

	Beat.  Cole is surprised.

			     COLE
		You said the "s" word.

			     MALCOLM
		Yeah.  Sorry.

	Malcolm's face is filled with emotion.  Cole is suddenly hit by
	Malcolm's passion.  Beat.  Cole nods slowly as he looks at
	Malcolm with different eyes.

	They start walking again in silence.  They turn a corner and move
	down another street.  Cole spots an old man with a cane standing
	at the gate of a brownstone.

			     COLE
		Is it okay if I do something?  I
		have to do something.

	Malcolm nods "yes" as they continue walking.  Cole slows as they
	approach the old man.  As we get closer, we make out the man can
	barely see.

			     COLE
		Hi, Mr. Marschal.

	MR. MARSCHAL leans over his gate and stares at Cole for a few
	seconds.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Guten Tag, Cole.

	Mr. Marschal has a thick German accent.  The old man squints down
	the block with a concerned expression.

			     COLE
		What's wrong?

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Mrs. Marschal.  She went food
		shopping.  She's running late.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Ich Habe Durst.

	Malcolm's eyes dart to Cole.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Wunderbar!  Where did you learn to
		speak German?

			     COLE
		I just know a couple lines.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Yes, you may have a drink.  What
		would you like?

			     COLE
		Lemonade, please.

	Mr. Marschal smiles at Cole before walking back inside his house.
	Cole turns back to Malcolm.

			     COLE
			(sad)
		Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.

			     MALCOLM
		What about Mrs. Marschal?

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		She died a long time ago.

							CUT TO:

	INT. MR. MARSCHAL'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

	This brownstone has been home to the Marschal's for many, many
	years.  It's filled with a lifetime of memories.  Memories shared
	by two people.

	Two rocking chairs sit side by side near the windows that
	overlook the street...  A corner table displays fancy wooden
	chess set.  The game half-finished, frozen in a layer of dust...
	An easel stands before a piano.  The incomplete water color
	painting of a smiling elderly woman sitting on the piano bench
	sits sadly on the faded yellow paper.

	Malcolm takes in the living room silently.  He stands near the
	open door.

	Cole walks through the room.  Tiny eyes searching carefully.  He
	leans behind the sofa looking for something.  Malcolm watches
	Cole with a crinkled brow.

	Cole peeks behind the old piano crammed against the wall.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Maybe Jill will play for us when
		she gets back.

	Cole turns to find Mr. Marschal standing with a glass of
	lemonade.  Cole takes it from his shaking hands.

			     COLE
		Thank you.

	Mr. Marschal shuffles over to the sofa.  Takes a seat.

	Cole begins surveying the room again.  Beat.  His eyes finally
	come to rest on a plant seated in the corner.  He stares at it...
	THE LEAVES OF THE PLANT SHAKE SLIGHTLY FROM A BREEZE.

	Cole puts down his glass on a table and walks over to the plant.
	Cole kneels down and starts to push the potted plant aside.  THE
	POT SCREECHES ON THE WOODEN FLOOR.

	Malcolm calls to Cole under his breath.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole--

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		What's going on there?

	Mr. Marschal strains to see across the room.

	Cole doesn't answer either of them.  Instead, he continues to
	push the plant aside revealing AN AIR VENT.  Cole gently reaches
	over and takes off the metal face.  It slips right off.

	Cole's hands disappear into the darkness of the vent.  They
	reemerge holding a STACK OF NOTEBOOKS.

	Malcolm becomes very still.

	Cole rises to his feet and carries the notebooks over to Mr.
	Marschal.  Cole carefully places them on his lap.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Is this for me?

	Mr. Marschal fingers the notebooks then reaches for his thick
	glasses hanging from his neck.  He places them on the tip of his
	nose and inspects the notebooks six inches from his face.

			MR. MASCHAL
		What's this?  Jill's keeping a
		diary.

	Malcolm takes an involuntary step forward.

	Mr. Marschal starts flipping through the notebooks.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		She's full of surprises...

	He gets to the last book.  His hands become still as he stares at
	the final page of writing.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
			(whispers)
		She hasn't written anything for
		some time.

	Beat.  Mr. Marschal slowly looks up from the notebooks.  Looks up
	to Cole.  Cole just stands quietly.

	Mr. Marschal's eyes slowly fill with tears of realization.  They
	gently spill down his weathered face.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Oh no...

	Cole takes a deep breath.  Trying hard not to cry himself.  The
	sight of Mr. Marschal weeping shakes Cole.

	Cole softly lays his hand on Mr. Marschal's silver hair.  Mr.
	Marschal reaches up and clutches his small hand.

	They stay like that for a while.  Beat.  Mr. Marschal lets go and
	brings the notebooks tighter to his body.

	Cole quietly walks to Malcolm who stands motionless.  He stares
	down at Cole in a daze.

	Cole turns his head, crying.

			     COLE
			(softly)
		Stop looking at me.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT OFFICE - NIGHT

	Malcolm sits still in his office chair.  His eyes are fixed at a
	point in space.  He brings a slim, black tape recorder to his
	mouth.

	CLICK.

			     MALCOLM
		April or March of Eighty-seven.
		Two weeks into sessions with
		Vincent Gray.  I was treating a
		couple, Donald and Robin Wagner,
		who had lost their child to
		Leukemia.  They were waiting with
		Vincent in the reception room of
		the downtown clinic.  They were
		alone together maybe fifteen
		minutes.  When I entered the room,
		all three were crying.  The
		Wagner's progress from that
		afternoon was dramatic and sudden
		....  As if some door had been
		opened for them.
			(beat)
		I'm not at all clear what happened
		in those fifteen minutes.  But I
		now believe Vincent tried to tell
		me something, show me something and
		I didn't listen.

		Cole Sear allowed me to witness

		This time I'm going to listen.

	A long silence.  CLICK.  The tape recorder turns off.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

	Lynn holds a laundry basket on her hip as she fiddles with the
	thermostat in the hall.  The house is cold.  Lynn wears a winter
	jacket in the house.

	Lynn turns and moves into the shadowy hallway.  No lights.  The
	house seems somewhat ominous.  Beat.

	Lynn's eyes dart to an open guest room like she just saw
	something.  She stares in the doorway until a SOUND TURNS HER IN
	THE DIRECTION OF THE FAMILY ROOM.

	She picks up balled-up boy's sweat socks and dirty T-shirts
	laying on the carpet.  When she reaches the end of the hall, she
	HITS A LIGHT SWITCH.  The hall LIGHTS UP REVEALING A WALL OF
	PHOTOS.  Lynn forms a tiny smile.

	Snapshots of Cole and Lynn's life hang before her eyes.

	Cole's birthday parties...  Lynn and Cole at an amusement park...
	Cole under the Christmas tree...  Cole on Lynn's shoulders in a
	pool...  Cole with a group of neighbors at a barbecue...

	Lynn takes a step forward.  Lynn's face betrays the fact that she
	notices something she never noticed before.  She touches a photo
	of three-year-old Cole.

	WE MOVE INTO THE PHOTO -- COLE'S FACE SMILES AT US.  LYNN'S
	FINGER GENTLY BRUSHES A THIN STREAKS OF LIGHT THAT CURVES IN THE
	BACKGROUND BEHIND COLE.  THE STREAK OF LIGHT IS BLURRED, LIKE
	SOMETHING CAUGHT IN MOTION.

	Lynn looks to the adjacent photo -- the barbecue photo --
	Everyone stands with hot dogs and sodas.  Lynn searches the
	picture.  Her eyes suddenly stop at the TINIEST BLUR OF WHITE
	LIGHT STREAKING AROUND COLE.

	WE MOVE FROM FRAMED PHOTO TO FRAMED PHOTO -- EACH THE SAME --
	SOMEWHERE HIDDEN IN THE FRAME, SOMEWHERE NOT EASILY SEEN, LYNN
	FINDS A BLUR.

	Lynn takes it all in curiously.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COLE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

	Lynn moves into Cole's room with the laundry basket balanced on
	her hip.  The Walkman headphones on her head blares A MUFFLED
	TECHNO DANCE BEAT.  Lynn starts picking clothes up around Cole's
	room.

	This bedroom is an eerie place.  The shadows seem to make shapes
	and figures.  All the furniture is wood -- old fashioned.  The
	lamps, the paintings on the wall -- antiques as well.

	The most striking feature of the room, however, is the homemade
	tent created from bedsheets and blankets tied to chairs and
	bureaus.  It takes up a large corner of the room.

	A sign hangs over the bedsheets.

		"DO NOT ENTER"

	Lynn grabs the spiderman P.J.s that drape over the tent.

	A German Shepherd Puppy sleeps on the pillow.  SEBASTIAN lifts
	his head sleepily and peers at Lynn before returning to his
	slumber.

	Lynn slowly reaches for a picture frame that peeks out from under
	Cole's pillow.  Slides it out...  It's a VACATION PHOTO of a
	couple.  Lynn and Cole and a man.  The man looks in every way a
	larger version of Cole.

	The picture has a visible effect on Lynn.  She lets out a shaky
	breath before returning the photo to its hiding place.

	Lynn pulls a pair of school uniform pants off the wooden roll
	cover desk next to the bed.

	The desk is covered with loose leaf papers filled with writings.
	Lynn's eyes are drawn to the papers.

	Her curious gaze turns serious.  Her mouth opens a tiny bit
	involuntarily.

	THE PAPERS are strewn with lines of handwriting.  Countless
	lines.  Thousands of words...  Some horizontal, some vertical...
	The writing moves in arcs and flows in various size -- written at
	great speed -- every word connected by a single pen stroke --
	everything written in one continuous motion.

	Lynn slowly spins the papers, taking in some of the phrases...

	...Christ break the freaking glass oh no God no what the hell is
	going on Quiet the damn baby I'll cut you I swear it someone stop
	the burning I'll kill you I'll kill all you bastard...

	The words go on and on.

	Lynn removes her hands from the paper.  She pulls her headphones
	off slowly.

	THE MUFFLED TECHNO DANCE BEAT FILLS THE DEAD SILENCE OF THE EERIE
	ROOM.

		booth.

			     COLE (o.s.)
		What if she has to pee when she's
		working?  You think she just holds
		it?
			     MALCOLM
		I don't know.  I was just thinking
		the same thing.

	Beat.

			     COLE (o.s.)
		You ask a lot of questions about my
		dad today.  How come?

	Cole is playing behind the couch.  All we see is the top of his
	head.

			     MALCOLM
		Sometimes, we don't even know it,
		but we do things to draw attention.
		Do things so we can express how we
		feel about issues...  Divorce or
		whatever.

	Every now and then we get glimpses of things Cole is playing with
	peeking over the back of the couch, but we can't quite make out
	what he's doing.

			     MALCOLM
		One night, as an example...  leave
		something on a desk for someone to
		find.

	The top of Cole's head stops moving.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole, have you ever heard of
		something called free-writing?  Or
		free-association writing?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		It's when you put a pencil in your
		hand and put the pencil to a paper
		and you just start writing...  You
		don't think about what you're
		writing...  You don't read over
		what you're writing...  You just
		keep your hand moving.

	Cole has become very still.  He looks right at Malcolm.

			     MALCOLM
		After awhile if you keep your hand
		moving long enough, words and
		thoughts start coming out you
		didn't even know you had in you...
		Sometimes they're things you heard
		from somewhere...  Sometimes
		they're feelings deep inside...
			(beat)
		Have you ever done any free-
		association writing, Cole?

	Beat.  Cole nods, "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		What'd you write?

			     COLE
		Words.

			     MALCOLM
		What kind of words?

			     COLE
		Upset words.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Did you ever write any upset words
		before your father left?

	Beat.

			     COLE
		I don't remember.

	Malcolm watches him carefully.  Beat.  Malcolm waves the question
	off casually.

			     MALCOLM
		Can you do something for me?

	Malcolm smiles.  He rises and grabs his coat.

			     MALCOLM
		Think about what you want from our
		time together.  What our goal
		should be?

			     COLE
		Something I want?

			     MALCOLM
		If we could change something in
		your life, anything at all, what
		would you like that to be?

	Cole's brow furrows as he thinks about it carefully.

			     MALCOLM
		You don't have to answer now.

	Malcolm heads for the door, stops when Cole emerges from behind
	the couch.  Cole is wearing his father's jacket, it hangs to the
	ground like a dress.

			     COLE
		Instead of something I want, can I
		have something I don't want?

	Malcolm turns back to Cole.  Malcolm nods "Yes."  Beat.

			     COLE
		I don't want to be scared anymore.

	Cole's sad eyes stare up at Malcolm.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT OFFICE - NIGHT

	The surface of Malcolm's desk is covered with open texts.
	Malcolm pours over a thick reference book.

	He circles a phrase...

	"...resulting bruises and abrasions on arms and legs may, in
	fact, be self-inflicted."

	Malcolm appears disturbed by the thoughts running through his
	head.

	ANNA'S MUFFLED VOICE CARRIES DOWN THE STAIRS.

	His face turns up to the ceiling.

			     MALCOLM
			(loud)
		Are you calling me?

	WE HEAR ANNA'S FOOTSTEPS MOVE ACROSS THE BASEMENT CEILING.  WE
	HEAR THE FRONT DOOR OPEN.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		What?  You don't see enough of me
		at the store?

	Malcolm gets up and moves closer to their voices as he stretches
	his legs.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		On my way to the flea market in
		Amish country.  Thought maybe you
		want to come.  Show me how to buy
		at these things.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		I trust you...  Besides, I don't
		know if I'm up for the Amish today.
		You can't curse or spit or anything
		around them.

	Malcolm smiles at Anna.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		I thought you'd want to get out.
		You've been kind of down.

	Malcolm slowly stops smiling.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		That's very sweet.  I'm okay.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Do you think I should stop by on my
		way back?  Show you what I got?
		It's not a problem.

	Malcolm shakes his head in disbelief.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		You know that's probably not the
		best idea.  I'll just wait to see
		them in the store.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Okay.  Fine.  Understood.
			(beat)
		I'm off then.

			     ANNA (o.s.)
		Don't step in the horse manure.

			     MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Thanks.

	WE HEAR THE FRONT DOOR SHUT.

	Malcolm moves to the narrow basement window.

	INT./EXT. MALCOLM'S HOUSE - DAY

	We see SEAN, an attractive young man in his late twenties.

	He gets into his car across the street.  He just sits there for a
	moment before putting his forehead to the steering wheel.

			     MALCOLM
			(under his breath)
		Give it up, kid.

	Malcolm turns away from the window as Sean's car starts up and
	pulls away from Malcolm's house.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

	STANLEY CUNNINGHAM is a teacher in his late forties.  He writes a
	question on the board.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Can anyone guess what city was the
		capital of the United States of
		America from 1790 to 1800?

	Mr. Cunningham turns and stares at his class of eight and nine
	year old private school students.  They stare back at him blankly.

	Cole rests his chin on his desk and watches the class with big
	eyes.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		...I'll give you a hint, it's the
		city you live in.

	The class says the answer in unison.

			     CLASS
		Philadelphia.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Right...  Philadelphia is one of
		the oldest cities in the country.
		A lot of generations have lived and
		died in this city...  Almost every
		place you visit has a history and a
		story behind it.
			(beat)
		Even this school and the grounds
		they sit on...  Can anyone guess
		what this building was used for a
		hundred years ago, before you went
		here, before I went to this school
		even?

	Stanley Cunningham looks over the class of blank faces.  He's
	just about to answer his own question when he sees a hand go up.
	Mr. Cunningham looks surprised to see who it is.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Yes, Cole?

			     COLE
		They used to hang people here.

	Mr. Cunningham furrows his brow.  Beat.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		That's not correct.  Where'd you
		hear that?

			     COLE
		They'd pull the people in crying
		and kissing their families bye...
		People watching would spit at them.

	Beat.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Cole, this was a legal courthouse.
		Laws were passed here.  Some of the
		first laws of this country.  This
		building was full of lawyers.
		Lawmakers.

			     COLE
		They were the ones who hanged
		everybody.

	Mr. Cunningham chuckles.  Cole's face turns cement grey.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		I don't know which one of these
		guys told you that, but they were
		just trying to scare you, I think.

	Tommy Tammisimo leads the class in a wave of snickering.

	Cole glances up.  Sees all the eyes on him.  He glances at the
	teacher who is still staring.

			     COLE
		I don't like people looking at me
		like that.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Like what?

			     COLE
		Stop it!

	Mr. Cunningham sees the traumatized expression on Cole's face and
	instantly stops smiling.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		I don't know how else to look--

			     COLE
		You're a stuttering Stanley!

	Mr. Cunningham's face becomes still.  So does the classroom.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Excuse me?

			     COLE
		You talked funny when you went to
		school here.  You talked funny all
		the way to high school!

	The class falls into stunned silence.  Mr. Cunningham takes an
	involuntary step towards Cole's desk.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		What--

			     COLE
		You shouldn't laugh at people.  It
		makes them feel bad.

	Mr. Cunningham moves closer to Cole.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		How did you--?

			     COLE
		Stop looking at me.

	Cole covers his eyes with his hands.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Who have you been s-speaking to?

	We see Cole's mouth under his covered eyes.

			     COLE
		Stuttering Stanley!  Stuttering
		Stanley!

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Who!

	Mr. Cunningham is standing right over Cole's desk now.

			     COLE
		Stuttering Stanley!

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		S-ssstop that!

			     COLE
		Stuttering Stanley!  Stuttering
		Stanley!

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		S-ssssstop it!

			     COLE
		Stuttering--

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!

	MR. CUNNINGHAM SLAMS HIS HAND ON COLE'S DESK.  Cole's hands drop
	from his eyes.  The teacher's face is burning red.

	The children in the room are frozen.  Completely startled.

	Cole's eyes are filled with tears.

	Mr. Cunningham's expression drains of anger as Cole Sear begins
	to cry.

							CUT TO:

	INT. ANTHONY'S LIBRARY - SAME AFTERNOON

	Cole is seated in the school library by himself.  He sits at a
	long center table near the windows.  His head is laying on his
	folded arms on the table.

	Malcolm peeks his head in the door -- unsure if he's in the right
	place.  He spots Cole and enters the room.  He silently takes a
	seat across from Cole.  The eight-year-old looks up.  Cole's eyes
	are hard -- filled with anger.

			     MALCOLM
		Hey, big guy.

	Cole stares for a second.

			     COLE
		I don't want to talk about anything.

	Cole lowers his head.  Malcolm just sits and thinks.

	THE SOUND OF BOYS PLAYING SPORTS ON THE FIELD OUTSIDE FILTER IN
	THROUGH THE LIBRARY WINDOWS.

	Cole turns his head and stares at the windows.  Malcolm takes in
	the sad vision of this boy.  It affects him.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Do you like magic?

	Cole's face softens a bit.  He turns from the windows and looks
	to Malcolm.  Beat.  Cole nods, "Yes."

	Malcolm pulls out a penny from his pocket.  He places it in his
	right hand.

			     MALCOLM
		Watch the penny closely.

	Malcolm closes his hand around the penny.

			     MALCOLM
		I do the magic shake...

	Malcolm shakes his hand in circles.  Cole watches his hand
	carefully.

			     MALCOLM
		And suddenly the penny has
		magically traveled to my left hand...

	Cole looks to Malcolm's closed left hand.  Malcolm doesn't open
	it.

			     MALCOLM
		But that's not the end of the trick.
		With another magic shake, the penny
		travels into my shirt pocket...

	Cole's eyes lock on Malcolm's shirt.  Malcolm taps the pocket but
	doesn't open it.

			     MALCOLM
		But that's still not the end!...  I
		do a final magic shake...  and
		suddenly...  The penny returns to
		the hand where it started from.

	Malcolm opens his right hand.  The penny sits quietly in the
	center of his palm.

	Cole looks at the penny and then up to Malcolm's face.  Beat.
	Cole cracks a smile.

			     COLE
		That isn't magic.

			     MALCOLM
		What?

			     COLE
		You just kept the penny in that
		hand the whole time...

			     MALCOLM
		Who me?

	Malcolm smiles a mischievous smile.  He places the penny on the
	table.  Cole stares at it and then looks to Malcolm.

			     COLE
		I didn't know you were funny.

			     MALCOLM
		I forgot myself.

	Malcolm and Cole share a warm look.

	THE SOUNDS OF KIDS LAUGHING AND PLAYING OUT ON THE FIELD COME
	POURING INTO THE ROOM AGAIN.

	Cole's expression changes back to sadness as he looks to the
	windows.  Malcolm leans across the table and whispers.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole...

	Cole looks at Malcolm.

			     MALCOLM
		One day...
			(beat)
		You're going to sound just like
		them.

	Beat.  Cole's chin starts to tremble.  His voice cracks.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Promise?

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		Promise.

	Malcolm and Cole sit in silence and listen to THE SOUND OF
	CHILDREN PLAYING.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY - EVENING

	Malcolm sorts through the many bills on the mail table.

			     WOMAN (o.s.)
		Malcolm, sit your cute butt down
		and listen up.
			(beat)
		Are you listening?

	Malcolm turns AT THE SOUND OF THE WOMAN, and moves into the empty
	living room where the T.V. is on.  A blanket lays crumpled on the
	sofa.

	THE WOMAN'S VOICE IS COMING FROM A VIDEO PLAYING ON THE VCR.
	IT'S A WEDDING VIDEO.  A LARGE WOMAN IN A BRIDESMAID DRESS STANDS
	HOLDING THE MICROPHONE.   IN THE BACKGROUND, WE CAN SEE THE DANCE
	FLOOR.

			     BRIDESMAID
			(T.V.)
		No doubt about it.  Anna's like my
		sister.  You better make her happy...
		And I'm not talking about -- mmm
		this tastes like real butter --
		kind of happy...  I'm talking about
		Julie Andrews twirling around like
		a mental patient on a mountain top
		-- kind of happy.

	THE LARGE BRIDESMAID BECOMES VERY EMOTIONAL.

			     BRIDESMAID
			(T.V.)
		You're really lucky.  She's got so
		much love for you.  Don't tell her
		I told you, but she said she loved
		you from the first time she met you
		on the street.  She'd do anything
		for you.
			(crying)
		I love you guys.
			(more crying)
		My nose is running.  Why isn't
		someone getting me a tissue?

	THE WOMAN HANDS THE MICROPHONE TO SOMEONE OFF SCREEN.  THE CAMERA
	PANS AWAY FROM HER AND ZOOMS IN ON THE DANCE FLOOR.  MALCOLM AND
	ANNA ARE SLOW DANCING.  THEY'RE WHISPERING AND LAUGHING WITH EACH
	OTHER.  THE HAPPINESS FROM THEM IS TANGIBLE.

	Malcolm can't help smiling as he stares at the flickering images.
	He turns and looks down the hall to their bedroom.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - EVENING

	Malcolm moves into their bedroom.

	THE SOUND OF A SHOWER CAN BE HEARD FROM THE BATHROOM.

	Malcolm moves to the bathroom door and opens it slowly.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BATHROOM - EVENING

	Malcolm steps into the bathroom quietly.  He stares at the
	silhouette of Anna's body through the smoked glass of the shower.
	Anna stands still, her head tilted back.

	Malcolm watches quietly.  By his experience, it's clear he's
	taken by his wife's beauty.

	Malcolm starts towards the shower when his eyes glance to the
	sink.  Malcolm locks on a tiny bottle resting on the marble
	surface.

	He reaches out and picks it up.  The label on the plastic bottle
	reads,

		"Zoloft Anti-depressant"
		"To be taken twice daily"

	Malcolm gently puts down the plastic bottle.  He gazes at the
	still figure of his wife as the water covers her.

	Malcolm leaves the bathroom.  He makes sure not to make a noise
	with the door as he closes it shut.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. DARREN'S HOUSE - DAY

	Colorful balloons flutter in the wind in front of an old grey
	stone home.

	INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

	Cole and an overweight boy named BOBBY are seated at a dining
	table covered in colorful paper.  A stack of birthday presents
	are sitting on the table next to a cake.

	The house is filled with the SOUND OF CHILDREN PLAYING AND
	LAUGHING.

	Cole and the overweight boy are the only ones in the dining room.
	Bobby watches with a dull expression as Cole moves his hand in
	circles in the air.

			     COLE
		...Then you do the magic shake.
		And now the penny moves from my
		pocket all the way to the hand it
		started in.

	Cole smiles and holds out his hand.  His fingers open to reveal
	the penny.

	Bobby stares.

			     BOBBY
		That's stupid.

	Cole loses his smile.

			     COLE
		It's supposed to be funny.

			     BOBBY
		It's stupid.

	Cole and the overweight boy stare at each other.

			     BOBBY
		Give me my penny back.

	Cole gives the boy his penny.  Beat.  Cole gazes at Bobby.

			     COLE
			(almost inaudible)
		...Don't be sad.

	Bobby looks up sharply.

			     BOBBY
			(hard)
		What'd you say?

			     COLE
			(shaken)
		...Nothing.

	Bobby stares down at him before returning his attention to his
	tattered napkin.

	The two boys sit in silence.

							CUT TO:

	INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

	Cole sits alone in the corner of the living room.  The open
	kitchen doorway is next to him.  Inside the kitchen are Lynn and
	DARREN'S MOM speaking.  It's clear they're from different worlds.
	Lynn is wearing tight clothes with hair teased to dramatic
	heights.  Darren's mom is in a designer suit.

			     LYNN
		...He doesn't get invited places.

			     DARREN'S MOM
		It's our pleasure.

			     LYNN
		The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese
		party a year ago.  He hid in one of
		those purple plastic tunnels and
		didn't come out.

			     DARREN'S MOM
		Chuck E. who?

			     LYNN
		Cheese.  It's a kid's place.

	Darren's mom smiles formally and turns to give the catering
	people instructions on how to lay out the food on her sterling
	silver trays.

			     LYNN
		He's my whole life.

	Darren's mom turns back to Lynn, the forced smile on her face.

			     LYNN
		I work at an insurance place and at
		Penny's, so Cole can go to that
		good school.

			     DARREN'S MOM
		J. C. Jenny's?

	Lynn nods "Yes."

			     DARREN'S MOM
			(bullshit)
		Good for you.

			     LYNN
		I wish I could be like my momma
		though.  She always knew what was
		wrong.  Knew just what to say.

	Darren's mom glances at her expensive watch.

			     LYNN
		Cole's going through something bad.
		He won't talk to me.
			(beat)
		I'm his momma.
			(emotional)
		And I don't know what's wrong and
		I don't know what to say.

	Lynn drowns in her thoughts.  Cole moves away from the kitchen
	with sad eyes.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - AFTERNOON

	Cole walks past two expensively-dressed mothers eating hors
	d'oeuvres as they move down the hallway.

			     MRS. WESTON
		Did you have the Brie?

			     MRS. SAUNDERS
		It tasted like cheese whiz.

	They pass when Cole moves down the shiny mahogany wood hallway.
	The women's conversation FADES AWAY behind him.

	Cole turns a corner and comes to a dead stop.  He turns white as
	he stares at an open CRAWL SPACE CLOSET a few feet away.  Cole's
	eyes are riveted in the darkness of the closet.  Beat.

	THE HALLWAY ERUPTS WITH NOISE AS THE CHILDREN RUN IN FROM THE
	BACKYARD.

	Tommy Tammisimo is one of the children.  He talks with the
	birthday boy, DARREN, a skinny kid in a party hat.

			     TOMMY
		I even got a trailer.

			     DARREN
		For what?  You only had one line.

			     TOMMY
		You're slow, you know that.  The
		star of the commercial always has
		his own trailer.  You need to think
		about your character alone.

	Tommy glances down the hall and sees Cole standing frozen staring
	at the crawl space closet.

	Tommy grabs Darren.

			     TOMMY
		Darren, check it out.

	     DARREN looks down the hall to Cole.

			     DARREN
		My dad made me invite him.

	Tommy nudges Darren to move down the hall.  Cole breaks from his
	trance as Tommy and Darren walk up.

			     COLE
		Happy birthday, Darren.

			     TOMMY
		Something you want to see in there?

	Tommy points to the crawl space.

			     COLE
			(too quick)
		--No.

	Beat.  Tommy looks to Darren and then back to Cole.

			     TOMMY
		We're going to put on a pretend
		play.  You want to be in it?

	Beat.

			     COLE
		...Okay.

			     TOMMY
		It's called, "Locked in the Dungeon."

	Tommy stares at Darren.  Darren finally gets it.

			     DARREN
		Yeah, Cole...  you get to be the
		one locked in the dungeon.

	It happens too quick for Cole to react.  Darren and Tommy shove
	Cole backwards.  He stumbles into the darkness of the crawl space.

			     COLE
		Don't!

	Tommy slams the door closed.  Darren turns the lock.  They crack
	smiles at each other as Cole bangs on the door.

	The BANGING GOES ON FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN IT JUST STOPS.

	SILENCE.

	Darren and Tommy look at each other and then back at the crawl
	space door.

	Then THE SCREAMING BEGINS.

	Darren and Tommy back away from the door as COLE SCREAMS IN
	TERROR at the top of his lungs.  He CRASHES OVER AND OVER against
	the door.  HIS BODY SLAMMING AGAINST THE WOOD.  The DOOR RATTLES
	like it's going to break off its hinges.

	The two boys are statues as Cole's BLOOD-CHILLING YELLS FILL THE
	HALLWAY.

	FOOTSTEPS SPIKE THE AIR AS children and mothers come running down
	the hall.  Lynn is one of them.

	Darren's mother turns the corner.

			     DARREN'S MOTHER
		Who's making that noise?

	She looks to the closet.  THE HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMS CUT THROUGH
	THE HALL.

			     LYNN
		Cole!

	Lynn and Darren's mom rush to the door and turn the knob...  The
	door flies open.  Lynn reaches in and pulls out Cole.  He's
	UNCONSCIOUS.

	Darren's mom looks into the crawl space -- there's nothing inside
	except a couple packing boxes in the back.  She looks to Lynn.
	She turns around with Cole in her arms.

			     LYNN
			(desperate whispers)
		Help me get him in the car.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION AREA - AFTERNOON

	Colorful murals don the curved walls of the pediatric reception
	area.

	A spattering of children accompanied by adults sit and wait.

	Lynn and Malcolm are seated at a children's play table.  A game
	made of a maze of wires sit on the table in front of them.

	A young resident DR. HILL takes a seat at the table with them.
	He opens up his notes.

			     LYNN
		What's wrong with Cole?

	Beat.

			     DR. HILL
		The tests indicate he did not have
		a seizure.  In fact he's doing fine.
		After some rest, he could go home
		tonight.

	Lynn closes her eyes.  Lets out a tense breath.  Beat.  Malcolm
	eyes the doctor as he glances back to an academic-looking woman
	standing at the reception room door.

			     MALCOLM
		There's something else going on,
		Lynn.

	Lynn opens her eyes and catches the doctor's expression.

			     LYNN
		What is it?

			     DR. HILL
		There are some scratches and
		bruises on your son that concern me.

			     MALCOLM
		Oh, man.

			     LYNN
		Those are from sports, from playing.
		He's not the most coordinated kid,
		but I don't want him to stop trying,
		you know what I mean?

	Doctor Hill gestures to the woman standing near the doorway.

			     DR. HILL
		Mrs. Sloan over there is our social
		worker at the hospital.  She's
		going to ask you some procedural
		questions.

			     LYNN
		You think I hurt my child?
			(emotional)
		You think I'm a bad mother?

			     DR. HILL
		At this point it's just procedure.
		And you should probably calm down.

			     MALCOLM
		How do you expect her to react?

			     LYNN
		You want me to answer your
		questions?

			     DR. HILL
			(sarcastic)
		I'm sorry if I was being vague --
		yes, I do.

			     LYNN
		Who's going to answer mine, you
		dick.

	Dr. Hill stares at her before closing up his files.

			     LYNN
			(raising voice)
		What happened to my child today?

	Dr. Hill gets up.

			     LYNN
		Something was happening to him --
		physically happening.  Something
		was very wrong.

	Dr. Hill hands his files to MRS. SLOAN and exits the reception
	room without looking back.

	Everyone in the reception room stares at Lynn.  Mrs. Sloan walks
	up to the table and waits.

	Lynn takes a second.  Wipes her eyes.  Gathers her considerable
	strength.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		How long will these questions take?

	Cole lays rigid in the hospital bed.  Blankets bundled around him
	as if to shield him.  Cole's eyes fixed out the window.

	Malcolm quietly enters through the half-opened door to the room.
	Cole spots him.  Visibly relaxes.

			     MALCOLM
		I've decided we shouldn't schedule
		sessions anymore.  I'll just follow
		you around.

	Cole smiles weakly as Malcolm takes a seat on a rolling metal
	chair.

	Malcolm notices Cole's legs emerging from under the hospital
	gown.  Cole is wearing A MAN'S DRESS SOCK.  The baggy folds ride
	up all the way to his knees.

			     MALCOLM
		Your father ever tell you bedtime
		stories?

			     COLE
		Yes.

	Malcolm looks at Cole.  Malcolm makes a decision.  He rolls in
	the chair across the room as he thinks.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Once upon a time there was a prince,
		who was being driven around...  He
		drove around for a long, long time...
		Driving and driving...  It was a
		long trip...  He fell asleep...
			(beat)
		When he woke up, they were still
		driving...  The long drive went on--

			     COLE
		Dr. Crowe.

			     MALCOLM
		Yes.

			     COLE
		You haven't told bedtime stories
		before?

			     MALCOLM
		No.

			     COLE
		You have to add some twists and
		stuff.  Maybe they run out of gas.

			     MALCOLM
		No gas...  Hey, that's good.

	They sit in silence.  Malcolm works on a new plot in his head.

			     COLE
		Tell me a story about why you're
		sad.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Do you think I'm sad?

	Cole nods, "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		What makes you think that?

			     COLE
		Your eyes told me.

	Beat.  Malcolm's affected by his client.

			     MALCOLM
			(rote)
		I'm not supposed to talk about
		stuff like that.

	Cole smiles softly.

	Malcolm stares at the tired child sitting before him in the
	hospital bed.

	Malcolm rolls his stool away from his client as he thinks.

	Beat.  He slowly moves the rolling chair closer to Cole's bed.

			     MALCOLM
		...Once upon a time there was this
		person named Malcolm.  He worked
		with children.  Loved it more than
		anything.
			(smiles)
		Then one night, he finds out he
		made a mistake with one of them.
		Didn't help that one at all.  He
		thinks about that one a lot.  Can't
		forget.
			(beat)
		Ever since then, things have been
		different.  He's become messed up.
		Confused.  Angry.  Not the same
		person he used to be.
			(beat)
		His wife doesn't like the person
		he's become.  They don't speak
		anymore.  They're like strangers.

	Malcolm breaks from his thoughts and looks at Cole who watches
	him with unwavering attention.  Malcolm smiles.

			     MALCOLM
		And then one day this person
		Malcolm meets a wonderful boy who
		reminds him of that one.  Reminds
		him a lot of that one.  Malcolm
		decides to try to help this new boy.
		He thinks maybe if he can help this
		boy, it would be like helping that
		one too.

	Malcolm leans forward, whispers with emotional eyes.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't know how the story ends.
		I hope it's a happy ending.

			     COLE
		Me too.

	Cole looks at Malcolm's caring eyes.  Cole stares at Malcolm a
	long time.

	EVERYTHING THAT'S SAID FROM THIS POINT ON IS WHISPERED.

			     COLE
		I want to tell you my secret now.

	Malcolm blinks very slowly.

			     MALCOLM
		Okay.

	Cole takes an eternal pause.  A silent tension engulfs them both.

			     COLE
		...I see people.

	Malcolm just gazes quietly.

			     COLE
		I see dead people...  Some of them
		scare me.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		In your dreams?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		When you're awake?

	Cole nods, "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		Dead people, like in graves and
		coffins?

			     COLE
		No, walking around, like regular
		people...  They can't see each
		other.  Some of them don't know
		they're dead.

			     MALCOLM
		They don't know they're dead?

	Beat.

			     COLE
		I see ghosts.

	Malcolm becomes completely motionless.  Works to hide his shock.
	He and Cole stare at each other a long time.

			     COLE
		They tell me stories...  Things
		that happened to them...  Things
		that happened to people they know.

	Beat.  Malcolm's words are extra-controlled.  Revealing nothing.

			     MALCOLM
		How often do you see them?

			     COLE
		All the time.  They're everywhere.
			(beat)
		You won't tell anyone my secret,
		right?

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		...No.

			     COLE
		Will you stay here till I fall
		asleep?

	Malcolm nods, "Yes."  Cole pulls the covers up to his chin and
	turns to the window in the room.  Malcolm is very still and
	stares at Cole.

	MALCOLM'S EYES -- slowly turn and survey the room.  They find
	nothing.  Malcolm returns to watching Cole.

	COLE'S EYES LOOK AROUND THE ROOM WARILY...  WE MOVE IN ON THEM --
	TILL HIS EYES FILL THE FRAME.

	Beat.

	And then we see what he's staring at.  Through Cole's hospital
	room window we see the adjacent wing of the hospital building.
	Rows of hospital room windows are visible.  In the windows are
	patients...  SOME OLD, SOME YOUNG...  SOME ARE DRESSED IN MODERN
	HOSPITAL GOWNS...  SOME FROM DECADES PAST.

	THEY STAND UNNATURALLY STILL IN THEIR WINDOWS...  WATCHING,
	WAITING.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT

	Malcolm hails a cab.  He steps off the sidewalk lost in his
	thoughts. Steam rises from a street vent.  HEADLIGHTS.  A CAR
	SUDDENLY EMERGES FROM THE STEAM, NARROWLY MISSING MALCOLM.

	Malcolm jerks out of the way.  His briefcase falls to the ground.
	His tape recorder falls to the sidewalk.  Beat.  Malcolm reaches
	down and picks it up.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole...
			(beat)
		His pathology is more severe than
		initially assessed.
			(beat)
		He's suffering from visual
		hallucinations, paranoia --
		Symptoms of some kind of school age
		Schizophrenia.
			(beat)
		Medication and hospitalization may
		be required.

	CLICK.  Malcolm's hand with the tape recorder drops to his side.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		I'm not helping him.

	Malcolm stares into the night.  He stands alone as thoughts crash
	like thunder in his head.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CAR - NIGHT

	The STREETS TURN RED as Lynn drives home from the hospital in
	silence.  She glances down to her right.

	Cole is curled up asleep on the passenger seat, back in his
	regular clothes, a tiny party hat clutched in his hand.  He looks
	like a four-year-old.

	The sight of him exhausted and still, hits Lynn hard.

	Lynn's face drowns in deep concern.  She lays a hand on Cole's
	head as she drives.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	The front door opens, Lynn carries Cole in.  He's asleep on her
	shoulder.  She carries him down the hall to his BEDROOM.

	Lynn lays Cole gently on his bed next to his German Shepherd
	Puppy.  Cole curls up with Sebastian.

	Lynn watches the two youngsters sleep for a moment.  Cole is
	curled up asleep with a tiny party hat clutched in his hands.  He
	looks like a four-year-old.  Lynn has been carrying Cole's
	sweater from over her shoulder.  She pulls it off and begins to
	fold it.  Her attention is drawn to the sweater.  She fingers the
	fabric of the back.  IT'S RIPPED.  Her eyes move to Cole.  In the
	middle of the back of his T-shirt are THREE SMALL TEARS.  Lynn
	pushes the fabric open with her fingers and sees DEEP FINGERNAIL
	LIKE SCRATCHES on his skin.

	Lynn looks around helplessly, fear creeping into her eyes.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	Lynn emerges from Cole's room.  She turns OFF THE HALL LIGHTS as
	she moves into her room and closes the door.

	WE HEAR LYNN PICK UP A PHONE AND DIAL.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		Hi, this is Lynn Sear, Cole's
		mother.  I wonder if we could
		talk about your son and his
		friends keeping their goddamn
		hands off my boy?

	The thermostat on the wall reads seventy-eight degrees.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	A few hours later.  The house seems threateningly still.  Too
	still.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT


	An unnatural silence fills each room of the house.

	The thermostat on the wall now reads, fifty-two degrees.

	A LIGHT TURNS ON FROM UNDER COLE'S DOOR.

	The door opens a crack.  Cole's tiny face peeks out.  Eyes scan
	the darkness.

	The door opens a little bit more.  Cole's knees are pressed
	together.  His body dances a little.  Cole has to pee.  He moves
	cautiously into the hall.

	Cole moves briskly to a door halfway down the corridor.  Opens
	it.  Cole turns on the LIGHT IN THE BATHROOM.

	He checks behind the shower curtain, before he turns his back and
	pees into the toilet.

	A LARGE FIGURE MOVES PAST THE DOORWAY.

	Cole instantly stops peeing.  His body becomes very still.  He
	slowly reaches for the toilet handle and flushes.  He closes his
	pants and turns.  He doesn't come out of the bathroom at first.
	He just stands there and stares into the darkness of the hall.
	HIS BREATH FORMS TINY CLOUDS IN THE COLD AIR.

	Beat.  Cole finally steps out into the hallway.  His eyes catch a
	SLANT OF LIGHT now coming from the kitchen.

	Cole hesitates before being drawn to the kitchen.  He moves down
	the hall and turns the corner -- coming to a stop in the doorway
	of the kitchen.

							CUT TO:

	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Cole stares at the back of a person cooking food on the stove.
	Cole's fear slowly fades away.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Momma?
			(beat)
		Dream about daddy again?

	The person turns.  It's not Lynn.  It's a strange woman.  The
	woman's face is demented.  A purple gash cuts across her
	forehead.  ALL THE CABINETS AND DRAWERS ARE OPEN BEHIND HER.

			     WOMAN
		DINNER'S -- NOT -- READY!

	Cole's face turns the color of ash.

			     WOMAN
		What are you going to do?

	Cole backs up to the doorway.

			     WOMAN
		You can't hurt me anymore!


	The woman smiles menacingly as she thrusts her wrists forward...
	They've been savagely cut.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Cole turns and runs down the hall.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Cole runs across his room.

	He heads right for the homemade tent seated in the corner with
	the "DO NOT TOUCH" sign on it.  He scurries in.  His legs
	disappear as the bedsheets flap closed behind him.

	The crazed woman stands at the end of the hall.  Doesn't come any
	closer.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TENT - NIGHT

	Cole is curled up in the tent.  He lays still for a moment
	reaching over and FLICKING ON A FLASHLIGHT.

	The red interior of the tent gets LIP UP.

	It's a striking sight.  The bedsheet walls of the tent are lined
	with religious pictures taped to the walls.  Tiny statues of
	saints surround the interior perimeter.  We see the statue Cole
	stole from the church is in here...  This tent is a sanctuary
	made by an eight-year-old to hide in.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. AUDITORIUM STAGE - AFTERNOON

	THE LIGHTS IN THE GYM GO DOWN.  THE SPOT LIGHT OPENS ON THE STAGE
	AS THE CURTAINS MOVE TO THE SIDES...

	A sign to the side of the stage reads, "The third and fourth
	grade presents -- Rudyard Kipling's "The Jungle Book."

	The parents APPLAUD AS TOMMY TAMMISIMO WALKS OUT ON STAGE in a
	villager's outfit.

			     TOMMY
			(Decent British accent)
		There once was a boy, very
		different than other boys.  He
		lived in the jungle, and he could
		talk with the animals.

	BACKSTAGE, Mr. Cunningham cues the rest of the children.

	THE AUDIENCE APPLAUDS AS THE FULL CAST OF THE ACTORS COME OUT.
	Some are villagers, others are dressed as trees and animals.

	Cole comes on stage holding a painted cardboard monkey.

	MALCOLM APPLAUDS FROM THE BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM.

							CUT TO:

	INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON

	The arched halls of the private school are lined with posted
	drawings and test papers.

	Cole and Malcolm walk down an empty hall.

			     COLE
		Did you think the play sucked big
		time?

			     MALCOLM
		What?

			     COLE
		Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough
		syrup commercial.  He thought
		everybody was self-conscious and
		unrealistic.  He said the play
		sucked big time.

			     MALCOLM
		I know every child is special in
		their own way, but Tommy sounds
		like a punk.
			(Cole smiles)
		I thought the play was excellent.
		Better than Cats.

			     COLE
		Cats?

			     MALCOLM
		Never mind.

	Beat.  They continue down the hall in silence.  Malcolm takes his
	time.

			     MALCOLM
		Cole, I was really interested in
		what you told me in the hospital,
		I'd like to hear more about it.

	Malcolm stops at a set of doors at the end of the hall --
	realizes Cole is no longer next to him.  Malcolm turns to find
	Cole frozen about ten feet back.

	Malcolm walks to him.  He notices Cole's expression as he gets
	closer.

			     MALCOLM
		What's wrong?

	Cole points to the doors.

			     MALCOLM
		Is something in there?

	Cole doesn't say anything.  Beat.

							CUT TO:

	INT. GYMNASIUM - AFTERNOON

	It's a large shadowy GYM.  Climbing ropes hang from the wood
	beamed ceiling.

	Cole is trembling slightly as he stands next to Malcolm.

			     MALCOLM
		What is it?

	Malcolm follows the child's gaze to the ceiling of the gym.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't see.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Be real still.

	Malcolm looks to Cole and then turns back to the ceiling.
	Malcolm's body becomes very still.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Sometimes you feel it inside.
		Like you're falling down real fast,
		but you're really just standing
		still.

	Malcolm looks at the wood beams and climbing ropes.

			     COLE
		You ever feel prickly things on the
		back of your neck?

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Yes?

			     COLE
		And the tiny hairs on your arm.
		Are they all standing up?

	Malcolm glances at Cole.  Surprise on his face.

			     MALCOLM
		-- Yes.

	Beat.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		When they get mad, it gets cold.

			     MALCOLM
		Them?

	Malcolm looks at the empty stairwell and then back to Cole.

	Nothing is said for a few moments.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't see anything.
			(beat)
		Are you sure they're there?
			(beat)
		Cole?

	Malcolm turns back to Cole, he finds the child with tears in his
	eyes.  Cole looks at Malcolm desperately.

			     COLE
		Please make them leave.

	Malcolm stares helplessly.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		I'm working on it.

	Malcolm gently leads Cole away from the stairs.

	COLE GLANCES BACK AS HE MOVES OUT OF THE STAIRWELL.

	COLE'S P.O.V. -- The ropes and school banners dangling at the top
	of the stairs sways a little...  But so do THE THREE BODIES
	HANGING BY THEIR NECKS FROM A WOODEN BEAM.

	It's a truly horrific sight.  A BLACK MAN in britches and no
	shirt, face beaten to a pulp, hangs in the center.  A WHITE WOMAN
	in a torn white frilly dress -- tears soaking her face, hangs to
	the right.  A small MIXED RACE CHILD in half pants, hangs to
	their left.  The family stares at Cole.  They follow Cole with
	their tortured eyes as he exits the stairwell.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HISTORIC PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

	Malcolm walks from the bus stop over the cobblestone streets in
	front of Head House Square.  The streets are quiet and dark.
	Night time has fallen over the city.

	He slowly comes to a stop in front of an old building.  He holds
	his arm up.  Uses his other hand to gently touch his hairs on his
	arm's surface.

	Malcolm looks up slowly.  Looks around.  The dark shadows fill
	the corners of the historic building...

	Malcolm stares into the darkness...  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		...Is anyone there?

	A long moment as he waits.  The shadows seem to move, then
	becomes still.

	Malcolm shakes off the moment.  He returns his hands to his
	pockets as he moves through the dark streets of Philadelphia to
	his home.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	The doorway to Malcolm and Anna's bedroom is open.  STRAINED
	VOICES SPILL OUT INTO THE HALLWAY.

			     MALCOLM (o.s.)
		Look, he's an eight-year-old child.
		He's my only client.  If he invites
		me to his play, I'm not thinking
		about how late I get back...  I go.
		I have to go.  You know that.
		That's the only way I know how to
		work.
			(beat)
		Vincent said I failed him.
			(raising his voice)
		I WON'T GIVE COLE A CHANCE TO SAY
		THOSE WORDS TO ME!  I WON'T!

	Beat.  THE PORTABLE PHONE RINGS OUT IN THE HALL.

			     MALCOLM (o.s.)
		Please let it ring.

	WE HEAR MOVEMENT.  Anna emerges from the bedroom.  Eyes raw.  She
	wipes her tears.

	She picks up the phone and moves down the stairs.

	Malcolm walks out into the hall.  Stops at the top of the stairs.

	ANNA'S VOICE CAN BE HEARD SPEAKING ON THE PHONE from downstairs.

			     ANNA
		I can't talk now.

	Malcolm doesn't hear anything as Anna listens to the person on
	the phone.  She smiles as she wipes her tears.  He starts for the
	basement door again.

			     ANNA
			(whispers)
		I thought about you too.

	Malcolm turns.  He stands frozen at the top of the stairs.
	Anna's HUSHED WORDS RISING IN THE AIR LIKE A GUN BLAST.

							CUT TO:

	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Lynn adjusts the thermostat as she tries to keep herself warm.

			     LYNN
		I don't care what they say, this
		thing is definitely broken.

	Lynn fiddles with the dials.  Cole is standing before the beat-up
	twelve inch kitchen T.V.

	ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN is Tommy Tammisimo.  He stands in his
	pajamas in a doorway.  He coughs.

			     TOMMY
			(on T.V.)
		Mommy, my throat hurts.

	Cole watches as Tommy's T.V. mother and father give him a
	spoonful of medicine.

			     NARRATOR
			(on T.V.)
		Pediaease Cough Suppressant...
		gentle, fast, effective.

	Cole watches Tommy running around in his T.V. background, the
	very next T.V. morning.  He's not sick anymore.  Tommy waves to
	the camera smiling and healthy.  The T.V. goes BLACK as Cole
	throws his shoe at the power button.

	He moves to the dinner table where Lynn is seated.  Cole sits.
	His hands go on the table.  He's wearing a pair of his father's
	extra large LEATHER GLOVES.  Cole's small hands don't even fill
	the palm area.  Cole has difficulty trying to pick up his milk
	glass with the gloves.

			     LYNN
		Take 'em off.

	Cole removes the gloves from his hand and places them next to his
	plate.

			     LYNN
		I don't want them on my table.

	Cole moves them to the floor.

	Lynn is irritated, this is a sore point between them.

	Lynn and Cole eat quietly.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		I saw what was in your bureau
		drawer when I was cleaning.

	Cole looks up.  An anxious expression on his face.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		You got something you want to
		confess?

	Cole just stares.

			     LYNN
		The bumble bee pendant.  Why do you
		keep taking it?

	Cole looks down at his lap.

			     LYNN
		It was Grandma's.  It's not for
		playing.
			(beat)
		What if it broke?  You know how sad
		I'd be.

			     COLE
		You'd cry.  Cause you miss grandma
		so much.

			     LYNN
			(soft)
		That's right.  So why do you take
		it, sweetheart?

			     COLE
		Sometimes people think they lose
		things and they didn't really lose
		them.  It just gets moved.

			     LYNN
		Did you move the bumble bee pendant?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."  Lynn just stares.

			     LYNN
		You didn't take it before.  You
		didn't take it the time after that.
		And now, you didn't take it again?

			     COLE
		Don't get mad.

			     LYNN
		So who moved it?

	Cole doesn't answer.

			     LYNN
		There's only two of us.
			(beat)
		Maybe someone came in our house --
		took the bumble bee pendant out of
		my closet, and then laid it nicely
		in your drawer?
			(beat)
		Is that what happened?

			     COLE
			(soft)
		Maybe.

	Lynn just stares at Cole.

			     LYNN
		I'm so tired, Cole.  I'm tired in
		my body.  I'm tired in my mind.
		I'm tired in my heart.  I need a
		little help here.
			(beat)
		I don't know if you noticed -- but
		our little family isn't doing so
		good.

	Lynn folds her napkin quietly.

			     LYNN
		I'm praying for us, but I must not
		be praying right.
			(beat)
		It looks like we're just going to
		have to answer each other's prayers.
		If we can't talk to each other --
		we're not going to make it.
			(beat)
		Now baby, tell me...  I won't be
		mad, honey...  Did you take the
		bumble bee pendant?

	Beat.  Cole's eyes start to water up.

			     COLE
		No.

	Lynn goes cold.

			     LYNN
		You've had enough roast beef.  You
		need to leave the table.

	Cole just stares at his mother's expression.

			     LYNN
			(yells)
		Go!

	Cole gets up -- never taking his eyes off his mother -- and
	leaves the room.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	Cole enters the DARK HALLWAY.  He gets startled by the SOUND OF
	HIS PUPPY GROWLING.

	Sebastian comes racing down the hall and scurries past Cole.
	Cole watches his puppy dart into the living room and under a
	couch.

	Cole slowly turns back and looks down the hall.

	THE DOOR TO COLE'S ROOM SITS AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR.  IT'S
	ALMOST SHUT.  COLE WATCHES AS THE DOOR BEGINS TO OPEN VERY
	SLOWLY.  IT OPENS WIDE.  COLE DOESN'T MOVE AN INCH.

	SUDDENLY IN THE STILLNESS AND THE DARKNESS, A SMALL FIGURE
	SCURRIES FROM ANOTHER BEDROOM INTO THE BLACKNESS OF COLE'S ROOM.
	IT HAPPENS LIKE A FLASH.

	Cole stops breathing.

	THE FIGURE SLOWLY STEPS OUT FROM COLE'S DOORWAY.

	IT'S A BOY.  A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN COLE.

	THE BOY WHISPERS IN A LOW, HOARSE VOICE.

			     BOY
		Come on...  I'll show you where my
		dad keeps his gun...  Come on.

	THE BOY TURNS.  WE SEE THAT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD IS MISSING AS HE
	DISAPPEARS INTO THE DARKNESS OF COLE'S ROOM.

	Cole is too terrified to move.

							CUT TO:

	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Lynn is kneeling on the kitchen floor trying to coax the puppy
	out of the broom closet.

			     COLE (o.s.)
		Momma.

	Lynn turns -- surprised to hear her son's voice.  Lynn's eyes are
	red from crying.  She wipes them quickly with the back of her
	hand.

	Mother and son look at each other.  Beat.

			     COLE
		If you're not very mad...  Can I
		sleep in your room tonight?

	Lynn fights back some tears.

			     LYNN
		Look at my face, Cole.

	Cole does.  Lynn smiles at her son.

			     LYNN
		I'm not very mad.

	Lynn hugs him.  Beat.

			     LYNN
		Baby...  Why are you shaking?

	Cole doesn't answer.

			     LYNN
		Cole, what's wrong?

	Cole just closes his eyes and holds his mom tight.

			     LYNN
			(desperate)
		...Please tell me.

	Cole doesn't say a word.

			     LYNN
			(crying)
		Please.

							CUT TO:

	INT. ANTIQUE STORE - DAY

	We are in an antique store.  Filled floor to ceiling with
	furniture and knickknacks.

	Anna stands with a YOUNG COUPLE.  All three lean over and peer
	into a glass cabinet.

	An antique engagement ring sits on a velvet stand.

			     ANNA
		It's Edwardian.  Beautifully worked.
		Entirely platinum with a mine cut
		diamond and an actual color Burmese
		Sapphire...  It's timeless.

			     YOUNG MAN
		You got anything a little plainer?

	The young woman looks at her beau.

			     YOUNG WOMAN
		Plainer?  You want a plain ring to
		go with your plain fiance.  Is that
		how it is?

			     YOUNG MAN
		No, baby.  Don't get in a tizzy.
		It's just...  you're so beautiful...
		you're like a Burmese Sapphire all
		by yourself.  You don't need all
		that.

			     YOUNG WOMAN
			(disbelief)
		Uh-huh.

	Anna smiles as she takes the ring out of the cabinet.

			     ANNA
		Why don't you two hold it?

	She places it in their hands.

			     ANNA
		Do you feel longing?

			     YOUNG WOMAN
		Excuse me?

			     ANNA
		When I touch this piece I feel a
		longing.  I imagine the woman who
		owned this, loved a man deeply she
		couldn't be with.

	The young woman looks at Anna with great intrigue.

			     YOUNG WOMAN
		Did he have wavy hair and broad
		shoulders?

	The young man throws an odd glance at his fiance.

			     ANNA
		I don't know...  But maybe...
			(beat)
		A lot of the pieces in this store
		give me feelings.  I think maybe
		when people own things and then
		they pass away -- a part of
		themselves gets printed on those
		things -- like fingerprints.

	Beat.  The young man and the young woman gaze at Anna silently.

	They look down at the ring.  They place their hands on it
	reverently, delicately -- like checking for a pulse.

	Anna can't hold back her sweet smile.

							CUT TO:

	INT. ANTIQUE STORE - DAY

	Anna moves to the back desk where SEAN comes out.  He's carrying
	an antique bench in his arms. He places it down and takes a much
	needed seat.

			     SEAN
		You don't need someone with a
		masters.  You need a wrestler guy
		whose neck is larger than his head.

			     ANNA
		I need a wrestler with a masters.

	Anna fills out the paperwork for the ring.

			     SEAN
		What's this?

	Anna looks over to find Sean standing at his desk where a
	BIRTHDAY PRESENT sits on his tabletop.  Sean looks at her.

			     SEAN
		From you?

	Anna nods, "yes."

			     SEAN
		Is it wrestling tights?

	Anna smiles as she moves to his desk.  Sean begins to tear off
	the wrapping paper like a kid at Christmas.

	Anna laughs.  Sean holds up a weathered hardback copy of "THE
	GREAT GATSBY."  Beat.

			     ANNA
		It's a first edition.

			     SEAN
		Wow, this is too much.  It's
		perfect, Anna.

	Sean puts down the book and hugs her.  He pulls back a little,
	still holding her.  They smile at each other.

	Beat.  The moment goes on just that crucial fraction of a second
	too long.  Their smiles slowly melt away as they continue to hold
	each other.  Nothing happens for the longest time.


	CRASH!  A SHATTERING DOOR SLAM ECHOES THROUGH THE STORE.  Anna
	and Jeffery pull apart.  They rush past the young man and the
	young woman to the front of the store.  They find the glass front
	door cracked in a spider web pattern.

	They carefully push open the door and step out onto the sidewalk.
	Look around.   No one in sight.

	Anna stares down the empty street.  A concerned expression on her
	face.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Malcolm walks angrily down the sidewalk.  He stops as his hand
	goes to his side.  He winces with pain as he keeps walking.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

	Lynn and Cole emerge from the supermarket.

	Cole rides inside the shopping cart tucked between bags of food.

	Mother and son are quiet as they move towards their car.

	Beat.

	Lynn leans over, looks at the side of her son's pensive face.

	She starts pushing the cart faster.  Cole wakes from his thoughts
	as his hair flutters in the wind.  He looks back.  Lynn is
	smiling as she pushes.  Cole turns and raises his hands in the
	air like he's on a roller coaster.

	Beat.

	They slow and come to a rest at the bumper of their car.  Lynn
	leans over -- sees the side of Cole's face smiling.

	Lynn's face shows a little happiness for the first time.  A
	little hope enters her eyes as she starts to load the groceries
	into the car.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CAR - DAY

	Cole and Lynn ride home with a back seat full of groceries.

	Cole finishes off a cherry popsicle as he watches out the window.

	Lynn looks over.

			     LYNN
		Let's rent a movie.

	Cole bites off the last of the popsicle and glances at his mom.

			     LYNN
		Your pick.

	Cole stares at his mom quietly.

			     LYNN
		It can even have Jean Claude Van
		Damme in it if you want.

	Cole smiles at that.  He nods, "Yes" joyfully.

	His smile fades away as he notices his mother fiddling with the
	HEATER controls.

	Cole gazes out the front windshield as the car moves towards home.

	Suddenly a piece of paper sticks to the windshield.  It's a page
	from a Playbill.  A 1941 Playbill.  It flies away revealing a
	woman in a flowing flowery dress from the 40's suddenly walks
	into the middle of the street as the pages of her Playbill swirl
	in the air.

			     COLE
			(yells)
		Momma, look out!

	The woman in the flowery dress turns.  Her hand rests on her
	stomach.  WE SEE SHE IS PREGNANT.

	Playbills stick to the windshield obstructing the view.

	Lynn slams the brakes...  Too late.

	THE WOMAN SMASHES INTO THE FRONT GRILL OF THE CAR...  HER TERROR-
	STRICKEN FACE COMES OVER THE HOOD AND CRASHES RIGHT THROUGH THE
	WINDSHIELD IN A SHOWER OF BLOOD AND GLASS...

	COLE SCREAMS.  LYNN SCREAMS...  THE CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP IN
	THE MIDDLE OF A CONGESTED INTERSECTION.

	The line of cars behind them suddenly hit their brakes and swerve
	to one side avoiding a mass collision.  After a few seconds, the
	entire intersection has come to a halt.

	Cole who has shut his eyes...  slowly opens them.

	He looks around fearfully.  His eyes move to the windshield.  No
	broken glass.  No blood.  And no woman.  Cole looks out through
	the pristine windshield onto the street where cars are stopped
	and staring all around them.

	Cole slowly looks over to his mother.  He finds her staring at
	him in complete and utter disbelief.  Her hands clutch the wheel.
	The whites of her knuckles showing her fear.  She has no idea why
	he screamed.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DEN - AFTERNOON

	The den is very quiet.  Cole and Malcolm sit around the multi-
	colored table.  Malcolm leans back in his small plastic chair --
	arms folded over his chest.  Cole sits slumped over the table --
	eyes peering out over his arms.

	They both look like shit.

			     COLE
		You don't wanna ask me questions
		today?

	Malcolm nods, "No."  Beat.

			     COLE
		Can I ask you then?

			     MALCOLM
		Yes.

			     COLE
		What do you want more than anything?

			     MALCOLM
		I don't know.

			     COLE
		I told you what I want.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't know, Cole.

			     COLE
		Why don't you think about it for a
		while?

	Malcolm doesn't respond.  Cole watches him.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		I know what I want.
			(beat)
		My goal is to speak to my wife.
		The way she and I used to speak.
		Like there was no one in the world
		but us.

	Beat.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		How are you going to do that?

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		I can't be your doctor anymore.
			(beat)
		I haven't given my family enough
		attention.  Bad things happen when
		you do that.  Do you understand?

	The room falls into silence again.  Cole speaks extra soft.

			     COLE
		You want to go home?

	Malcolm stares across at Cole.

			     MALCOLM
		I have to.

			     COLE
		When?

			     MALCOLM
		Soon.  One week.

	Malcolm looks down at his eyes full with emotion.

			     MALCOLM
		I'm going to transfer you.  I know
		two psychologists that are
		exceptional--

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Don't fail me.

	Malcolm looks up sharply.

			     MALCOLM
		--What?

			     COLE
		Don't give up.  You're the only one
		who can help me.  I know it.

	Beat.  Malcolm tries to stay composed.  It doesn't work.

			     MALCOLM
		You want to know a secret?...  I
		was a paper champion.
			(beat)
		Do you know what that means?

	Cole shake his head, "No."  Tears fall down Malcolm's cheeks.

			     COLE
		Don't cry.

			     MALCOLM
		I means I wasn't what everyone
		thought I was...
			(beat)
		I was a fake.

			     COLE
		You weren't a paper champion.

			     MALCOLM
		Someone else can help you.  Someone
		else can make you happy.

	Cole is crying now.

	Cole wipes his eyes with his sleeve.  They sit quietly and stare
	at each other.  Beat.

	Cole whispers.

			     COLE
		Dr. Crowe?

			     MALCOLM
		Yes.

			     COLE
		You believe me, right?

	A long pause.

			     COLE
		Dr. Crowe, you believe my secret,
		right?

	They both just stare.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't know how to answer that.

	Cole searches for the answer in Malcolm's eyes...  He finds it.
	It's not the one he wanted.  Malcolm looks down.

			     COLE
		How can you help me if you don't
		believe me?

	Cole reaches into his pocket.  Pulls out a PENNY.

	Cole pushes it across the table.

	Malcolm gazes at it, then looks up at Cole's pained eyes.

	Beat.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Some magic's real.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm sits stoically at his desk in his basement.  His eyes
	gaze at the dusty FRAMED CERTIFICATE FROM THE CITY OF
	PHILADELPHIA shoved between two packing boxes.

	Malcolm leans his head back against the chair.  Stares into the
	shadows.  Drowns in his thoughts.

	Beat.  THE CHAIR CREAKS as he slowly sits up again.  Malcolm's
	eyes scan the room and come to a stop on a box marked with the
	label...

	"SESSION TAPES -- VINCENT GRAY"

							CUT TO:

	INT. BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

	A tape slides into the tape player seated on Malcolm's desk.
	Malcolm hits play.

	THE SOUND OF A DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING IS HEARD.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		Sorry about that.  Hope I didn't
		leave you alone too long...  Wow,
		it's cold in here.

	WE HEAR A CHAIR MOVE AS MALCOLM SITS DOWN.  And then SILENCE.
	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		Vincent...  Why are you crying?
			(beat)
		Vincent?

	A TEN-YEAR-OLD'S VOICE ANSWERS.

			     VINCENT
			(on tape crying)
		Yes?

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		What happened?
			(beat)
		Did something upset you?

	Beat.  VINCENT SNIFFLES.

			     VINCENT
			(on tape)
		You won't believe.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		I won't believe what?

	Beat.

			     VINCENT
			(on tape)
		I don't want to talk anymore.  I
		want to go home, okay?  I want to
		go home.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		Okay, Vincent, you can go home.

	CLICK.  THE TAPE GOES TO SILENCE.

	Malcolm just sits in the shadowy basement.  He doesn't move for a
	while.

	Then he hits the rewind button.  Stops it.  Presses play.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		--about that.  Hope I didn't leave
		you too long...  Wow, it's cold in
		here--

	Malcolm hits the rewind button again.  Lets it rewind for a
	while.  Presses play.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		--like needles either.  When I was
		a kid, I had this blood test down --
		threw up chill cheese fries all
		over this male nurse.

	WE HEAR VINCENT CHUCKLE SOFTLY.

	THE SOUND OF A DOOR OPENING IS HEARD.

			     SECRETARY
			(on tape)
		Excuse me, Doctor Reed is on line
		two.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		Vincent, I have to take this.  Give
		me a minute.

			     VINCENT
			(on tape)
		Okay.

	FOOTSTEPS AS MALCOLM AND THE SECRETARY LEAVE THE ROOM.  THE DOOR
	CLOSES.  AND THE SILENCE.

	Nothing happens for a long time.  AND THEN WE HEAR A SUDDEN CHAIR
	SCREECH ACROSS THE FLOOR.  VINCENT'S BREATHING QUICKENS.

	A SLIGHT STATIC STARTS TO FILTER IN ON THE TAPE.

	Malcolm's eyes are locked on the spool of audio tape as it spins
	in the player.

	Malcolm's fingers move to the volume dial.  He turns it way up.
	THE STATIC NOISE FROM THE TAPE FILLS THE BASEMENT.

	Malcolm leans closer to the tape player.  Closes his eyes and
	listens...  Beat.

	DEEP IN THE STATIC...  ANOTHER SOUND EMERGES, WHISPERING.

	A MAN'S VOICE IS HEARD IN THE ROOM WITH VINCENT

			     MAN'S WHISPERING
			(on tape)
		Familia...  No dejen que esto me
		pase...  Mi familia...  Yo no
		quiero morir...  Familia...

	Malcolm's mouth opens in disbelief.

			     MALCOLM
		...Jesus Christ.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm stands on a familiar sidewalk.  He stares into the bay
	window of Mr. Marschal's brownstone.

	Inside the window we see Mr. Marschal seated with a group of
	older gentlemen his age.  They sit around a table eating
	sandwiches and talking.  Malcolm watches as Mr. Marschal tells a
	story to his friends.  WE CAN'T HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING, but when
	he finishes everyone at the table laughs.  Mr. Marschal smiles.

	Malcolm can't help smiling as well.  This is not the same man he
	saw before.  Life has returned to this house.  Beat.

	Malcolm turns and moves down the street.  Each step faster than
	the next.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CHURCH - LATE AFTERNOON

	Malcolm moves to the front of the church down the center aisle.
	His eyes scan the empty seats.  No one in sight in any direction.

	Malcolm stands in the aisle a little out of breath.  He holds his
	hand to his side as he winces a bit.

	Malcolm's eyes float up to the balcony where toy soldiers sit on
	the bannister.  Cole's head pops up.

			     MALCOLM
		Hello again.

	He looks down and studies Malcolm.

			     COLE
		You been running around?

	Malcolm nods, "Yes."

			     COLE
		It makes you feel better?

	Malcolm nods, "Yes" again.

			     COLE
		I like to run around.  It's good
		exercise.
			(beat)
		You want to ask me questions now?

	Malcolm shakes his head, "No."

			     COLE
		You want to be a lance corporal in
		Company M, 3rd Battalion, 7th
		Marines?  We're being dispatched to
		the Quang Nam province.

	Cole holds up his plastic rifleman.  Malcolm's eyes show he
	understands now.


			     MALCOLM
		Maybe later.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Something happened, didn't it?

			     MALCOLM
		Yes, it did.

			     COLE
		Are you wigging out?

			     MALCOLM
		Yes, I am.

			     COLE
		We're not gonna start crying again,
		are we?

			     MALCOLM
		No, we're not.

			     COLE
		What happened?

	Beat.

	Malcolm glances around the empty church before looking back up to
	Cole.

			     MALCOLM
		These people...  People that died
		and are still hanging around.
		Maybe they weren't ready to go.

	Cole studies Malcolm's passionate face.  A new face.

			     COLE
		You really look better.

			     MALCOLM
		 Maybe they wake up that morning
		 thinking they have a thousand
		 things to do and a thousand days
		 left to do them in...  And then
		 all of a sudden, it's all taken
		 away.  No one asked them.  It's
		 just gone...

			     COLE
		You have nice red in your cheeks now.

			     MALCOLM
		Do you know what 'Yo no quiero
		morir' is?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."

			     MALCOLM
		It's Spanish.  It means...  'I
		don't want to die.'
			(beat)
		Not all the ghosts are scary, are
		they?  Like Mrs. Marschal?

			     COLE
		No.

			     MALCOLM
		What do those ghosts want when they
		talk to you?  Think real careful
		now, Cole...

	Cole stops moving.  He looks over the balcony railing at Malcolm.

			     COLE
		Just help.

			     MALCOLM
		Yes!  I think that's right!...  I
		think they all want that.  Even the
		scary ones...

			     COLE
		You believe now?

	Malcolm's stare is unwavering.

			     MALCOLM
		I believe both of you now.
			(beat)
		And I think I might know how to
		make them go away.

			     COLE
		You do?

	Malcolm nods "Yes."

			     MALCOLM
		I think they know you're one of
		those guys rare people can see them.
			(beat)
		You need to help them.  Each one of
		them.
			(beat)
		Everyone wants to be heard.
		Everyone.

	Cole takes a big sigh.  Fiddles with his riflemen.

			     COLE
		What if they don't want help?  What
		if they're just angry and they want
		to hurt somebody?

			     MALCOLM
		I don't think that's the way it
		works, Cole.

	Cole looks nervous.

			     COLE
		How do you know for sure?

	Malcolm's eyes are drawn to Cole's arm.  Peeking out from under
	his shirt sleeve are a set of cuts.  Malcolm gazes at them.

			     MALCOLM
		I don't.

	Cole and Malcolm stand silently in the center aisle of the back
	of the church.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	Malcolm moves around the corner on his street.  His mind surges
	with thoughts.  And then he glances up.  His steps slow to a
	complete stop.

	Further down the sidewalk, coming out of the front door of his
	house is SEAN.

	Malcolm's face turns to stone.  He watches as Sean comes down the
	front stairs and starts across the street.

	A sudden rage surges up.  Malcolm moves towards Sean fast.

	Sean reaches his car and enters it.  He doesn't notice the figure
	closing in on him.

	THE ENGINE STARTS.  Malcolm reaches the car a second late.  Sean
	pulls away into traffic almost hitting another car as he does.

	Malcolm watches the car disappear down the next street.  Beat.

	Malcolm turns and looks up at his home with unchecked anger and
	overwhelming pain erupting his eyes.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	Malcolm stands in his foyer.

	Anna is sitting on the stairs, phone in her hand.  She faces away
	from the front.

	Malcolm's a ball of tension as he listens to Anna talk into the
	phone.

			     ANNA
		...You just walked out.  You're
		probably on your way home.  I'm
		leaving this message...  I just
		didn't get to say what I meant...
			(beat)
		I know you're confused.  It's just...
		I'm not prepared to do this, Sean.
			(beat)
		I don't want to be ashamed of that.
		I don't want to have to make
		excuses for that.
			(beat)
		And I wanted to tell you...  I
		bought your present wholesale from
		a friend.  I didn't even pay tax on
		it.  You don't need someone cheap
		like that.
			(beat)
		By the way, it's a non-refundable
		item, it's scratched on the bottom.
			(beat)
		Are you smiling?...  I hope you're
		smiling.
			(beat)
		I'll see you at the store.

	Beat.  A long silence.  Then WE HEAR ANNA GENTLY HANG UP.

	Malcolm leans back against an old radiator.  Beat.

	His eyes close as the SOUND OF HIS WIFE'S FOOTSTEPS RISES UP THE
	STAIRS.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

	The house is silent.  No movement.

	Cole is in his pajamas asleep on the floor of the TENT.

	Curled up next to him is Sebastian.  They sleep surrounded by
	statues and pictures.

	Cole's eyes open as he hears HIS MOTHER'S DISTANT VOICE.

			     LYNN
		Cole...
			(beat)
		Cole, what's happening...

	Cole quickly gets up and rushes out of the tent.  His foot
	catches one of the chairs the tent is fastened to.  He stumbles
	out.  He doesn't realize one of the bedsheets comes loose.  It
	folds to the ground.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	He doesn't stop as he moves through the shadowy hall and pushes
	open his mother's bedroom door.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LYNN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Cole stands in the doorway to his mother's bedroom.  He looks
	over the room carefully.  Everything is still.

	Lynn's room is sparse.  No paintings, no accessaries.  A bed
	without a frame sits in the corner.  A table with a sewing
	machine fills the other side of the room.

	HIS MOTHER'S VOICE turns his attention back to the bed.

			     LYNN
		Cole, what's happening to you?

	Cole looks down and finds his mother laying in her bed.  Her face
	contorted in deep sadness as she speaks in her sleep.

			     LYNN
		Is someone hurting you?...  I'll
		beat their asses.

	Cole smiles at his mother as he moves to her side.  Touches her
	face with his tiny fingers.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Momma, you sleep now.

	His touch seems to have an effect.  Lynn becomes still in her
	sleep.  Cole watches her carefully.

							COT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	Cole closes the door to his mother's bedroom shut.  He stands
	still in the hallway.  Lets out a heavy sigh...

	HIS BREATH ROLLS IN A TINY CLOUD IN FRONT OF HIM.

	Cole's brow furrows.  He breathes again.  This time
	intentionally.  Watches as his breath materializes in the
	suddenly ice cold air.

	Every muscle in Cole's eight-year-old body becomes rigid.  He
	takes a second before moving through the inky darkness of the
	hall.

							CUT TO:

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Cole hurries to fix his tent.  He ties the collapsed bedsheet in
	a knot on the edge of the chair.  He checks it carefully before
	entering the tent.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TENT - NIGHT

	When Cole turns around, he stops breathing.

	AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GIRL VOMITS ON HERSELF IN HIS TENT.  She
	finishes and looks up at Cole with drawn eyes.

			     GIRL
		I'm feeling much better now.

	The girl reaches out with her withered and emaciated hands --
	tiny tubes hang from her wrists.  She scratches Cole as he
	tumbles back terrified out of the tent.  The whole tent collapses --

							CUT TO:

	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Cole runs hard out of his bedroom and down the hall to the living
	room.  He gets down to the ground and slides under the wooden-
	legged couch.

	Sebastian is already huddled in fear under the couch.  Cole
	presses as far back as he can and waits.

	COLE'S P.O.V. -- is of the living room floor.  Chair legs.
	Coffee table base.  Rugs...  Everything is still.

	Cole holds his breath.  He waits.  Beat.  Nothing happens.  He
	takes his first short breaths and watches the room for any sign
	of movement.

							CUT TO:

	INT. COLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	A few minutes later.  Cole is now standing in his doorway.  He
	stares at the hunched figure covered by the collapsed tent.

	BEAT.  Cole makes a decision.  He looks like he is going to cry --
	fights it back.

	He walks towards it.  Reaches down and slowly pulls the sheet off
	the figure.  The girl vomits one more time before looking up at
	Cole.

			     GIRL
		I'm feeling much better.

	Cole and the little girl stare silently at each other.  Cole
	holds her stare with trembling eyes.

	He opens his mouth -- it takes a while before the words come out.

			     COLE
		Do you want to tell me something?

							CUT TO:

	INT. PUBLIC BUS - DAY

	A downtown Septa public bus.  Malcolm and Cole are among the
	spattering of passengers.

	They're both wearing suits.

	Cole leans his head against the glass of the scratched window.
	Cole's large eyes drink in the passing scenery.

	COLE'S P.O.V. -- A dark, abandoned building stretches for an
	entire block on one side.  A MAN IN A GREY, FULL-BODIED UNIFORM
	WITH NUMBERS PRINTED ACROSS HIS CHEST...  RISES OUT OF THE TALL
	WEEDS IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING.  HE HOBBLES HIS WAY DESPERATELY
	TOWARDS THE BUS.  HIS HANDS AND LEGS ARE SHACKLED...  HE LUNGES
	OUT FOR COLE IN THE PASSING WINDOW.

			     SHACKLED MAN
		My name's not Sullivan!

	A GUNSHOT ECHOES IN THE AIR.  THE MAN'S CHEST EXPLODES IN RED AS
	HE FALLS TO HIS KNEES SCREAMING.

	Cole jerks back from the window.

	The bus quietly drives past THE OLD PRISON BUILDING.

	Cole stares down at his lap and tries not to look up anymore.
	Beat.

			     COLE
		She came a long way to visit me,
		didn't she?

			     MALCOLM
		I guess she did.

	Cole falls into deep thoughts as he stares down at his dress
	shoes.  Malcolm slips back into silence.

	The city bus slithers through the old Philadelphia streets
	working its way downtown.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HOME - AFTERNOON

	A modest home sits on a corner.  Its small lawn, groomed
	carefully.  Rows of parked cars spill out from the driveway onto
	the streets.

	People in suits and dark dresses move somberly in and out of the
	front door of the home.

	Cole and Malcolm join the visitors as they walk slowly towards
	the doors.

	A frail, little girl about four years of age sits in a dark dress
	on the swings in front of the house.  Visitors say hello to her
	as they pass.  She doesn't say anything back.

			     MALCOLM
		Her little sister?

	Cole nods, "Yes."

	Malcolm and Cole watch her for a moment before following others
	into the modest corner home.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HOME - AFTERNOON

	The home is packed with people.  The gathering of mourners is
	standing room only.  The AIR IS FILLED WITH DOZENS OF HUSHED
	CONVERSATIONS.

			     VISITOR #1
		...can you imagine being a child in
		a bed for two years?

	We move to.

			     VISITOR #2
		...I think it was six.

	We move to.

			     VISITOR #3
		...Six separate doctors?

	We move to.

			     VISITOR #4
			(whispers)
		...the little one's falling ill now...

	We move to.

			     VISITOR #5
		...God help them...

	A FAMILY PORTRAIT HANGS NEAR THE FRONT DOOR.  Two girls, one
	bigger, one smaller sit on the ground in front of their mother
	and father.  Their smiling faces welcome the mourners.

	Malcolm and Cole are standing at the bottom of a staircase.
	Waiting.

	The front door opens as another group arrives.  Malcolm nods to
	Cole as the foyer fills up.  The two of them quietly disappear
	upstairs.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

	The narrow hall is lined with boxes of medical supplies.  I.V.
	stands, sterile needles and pads are in the process of being
	taken away.  The boxes are piled outside a closed bedroom door.

	Cole stares at the shut door like he doesn't want to go in.  His
	eyes move to the large, colorful map of the world that dons the
	hallway wall.  He gazes at the many countries and continents.
	Beat.

			     COLE
		I wish I were somewhere else.

			     MALCOLM
			(soft)
		Where will you go, where no one has
		died?

	Cole stares at the map and then turns to Malcolm.

			     COLE
		Don't go home, okay?

			     MALCOLM
		I definitely won't.

	Cole turns and stares quietly at the door.  He waits a long time
	before reaching for the doorknob.

							CUT TO:

	INT. GIRL'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

	Cole closes the door behind him.  He turns and gazes at the
	girl's bedroom.  There's a hospital bed near the window.  The
	walls are covered with get-well cards and drawings from family,
	friends, and school children.

	Her shelves are filled with puppets.  All shapes and sizes of
	puppets.  Next to the shelf is a puppet stage and a camcorder on
	a mini tripod sitting next to it.

	Cole walks to the shelf and picks up a FINGER PUPPET DANCER.  He
	places it in his pocket.

	On the girl's desk, is a large collection of video cassettes.
	The labels read, "Puppet Show Christmas 96," "Puppet Show
	Birthday party," "Puppet Show class trip"...

	Cole reads the labels carefully before moving towards the
	closets.  He passes the bed.

	AN EMACIATED HAND REACHES OUT FROM BENEATH THE BED AND GRABS
	COLE'S ANKLE.

	Cole jerks back startled.  He watches as the girl's hand slips
	back under the bed.  Cole stays very still.  Waits.  Nothing
	happens.

	He slowly bends down.  His hands touch the floor.  He tilts his
	head and looks under the bed.

	The emaciated little girl who came to his tent lays curled on the
	floor.  Her bulging eyes glare at Cole.  She moves suddenly.
	Thrusts a jewelry box forward.  It slides across the wooden floor
	and stops just before Cole.  Cole and the sickly girl stare at
	each other.  Neither of them say a word.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

	The room is thick with mourners.  Most are gathered around the
	GIRL'S MOTHER, a young woman in her late twenties.  As she moves
	through the room to the kitchen, she receives the many cards,
	hugs, and flowers that are offered as condolence.  Mrs. Collins
	leaves the living room.

	Malcolm watches breathlessly from the doorway as Cole moves
	through the many adults across the room.

	The girl's father, MR. COLLINS, a thin man in his late twenties,
	is seated on the reading chair next to a T.V.  His face is
	granite.  No one in the room dares to talk to him.  He stares
	statue-like at an abstract point in the room.

			     COLE
		Mister?

	The man doesn't react.  Some of the guests look oddly at the
	little boy standing before the man.

			     COLE
		Excuse me, Mister.

	Beat.  The man slowly turns and looks down at the boy standing
	next to him.  Cole is very shaky.

	Malcolm watches everything anxiously.

	Cole stares at Mr. Collins.

			     COLE
		Are you Kyra's daddy?

	The man's face begins to crumble.  Beat.  He nods, "yes" softly.

	Cole holds out the jewelry box.  It trembles with his hands.

	The father just stares at it.  Beat.

			     COLE
		It's for you...
			(beat)
		She wanted to tell you something.

	The father becomes very still.  His eyes fill with a storm of
	confusion and pain.  After the longest time, the father reaches
	and gently takes the box out of Cole's small hands.

	Cole begins to back away...

	The father gazes at Cole as he melts into the crowd.  Cole
	reaches Malcolm and the two then slip out of the house.

	The father looks down in a daze.  He goes to open the jewelry
	box.  His movements are slow and strained.  He lifts the latch
	and open the box.

	Mr. Collins stares at an unlabeled video cassette.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

	People in the room start to turn as the T.V. comes on.  Mr.
	Collins is seated now.

	THE STATIC SNOW ON THE SCREEN IS QUICKLY REPLACED BY AN IMAGE.
	TWO PUPPETS DANCE ON STAGE.  WE HEAR KYRA'S VOICE SING FOR THE
	PUPPETS AS THEY DANCE AROUND.

	Her father's face forms the most heartbreaking of smiles as he
	watches the performance.

	The entire room has stopped what they were doing.

	T.V. SCREEN

	WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE STAIRS.  The puppets go limp.
	The entire stage gets lifted up.  We see it carried away by Kyra.
	We can view the whole bedroom now.  The camera is seated on her
	desk in the corner.

	Kyra climbs in bed and pretends to be sleeping when the door
	opens.  It's Mrs. Collins.  She carries in a tray of soup and a
	sandwich.

	LIVING ROOM

	The crowd watches in riveted silence.  The father never takes his
	eyes off of the screen.

	The image of the mother prepares the meal.  She uncovers the
	fruit and the soup.  Places a straw into the drink.

	And then it happens.

	The image of the mother walks to a closet.  Opens it.  An
	assortment of household cleaners and sponges are kept inside.
	She pulls out a bottle of floor cleaner.  Reads the label for the
	ingredients.  Walks back to the food tray, where she unscrews the
	cap on the floor cleaner.  The mother pours some into the cap.
	Checks it.

			     MRS. COLLINS
			(video tape)
		That's too much.

	The mother pours some into the bottle.  The remainder goes into
	the child's soup.  She replaces the cap and puts the bottle back
	in the closet.

	The image of the mother turns to the bed carrying the tray.  She
	places the food on a metallic rolling table and swings it over
	the bed.

			     MRS. COLLINS
			(video tape)
		Kyra, time for lunch.

	Kyra pretends to wake from a deep sleep.

			     KYRA
			(video tape)
		I'm feeling much better now.

	The image of the mother smiles.

			     MRS. COLLINGS
			(video tape)
		I'm glad, honey.
			(beat)
		Time for your food.

			     KYRA
			(video tape)
		Can I go outside, if I eat this?

			     MRS. COLLINS
			(video tape)
		We'll see.  You know how you get
		sick in the afternoon.

	Kyra picks up the spoon and takes a sip.  Her face crinkles at
	the taste.  She looks up at her mother.

			     MRS. COLLINS
			(video tape)
		Don't say it tastes funny.  You
		know I don't like to hear that.

	Kyra slowly brings the spoon to her mouth and swallows another
	spoonful.

	The father SHUTS OFF THE TELEVISION with his trembling hands.  He
	presses his hands to his eyes like they're burning.

	The ROOM IS UTTERLY SILENT.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Mrs. Collins is seated at the dining room surrounded by friends
	and family.  She fixes one of the many bouquets of flowers on the
	table.  It takes her a beat before she feels the stare.

	She looks up.

	Standing in the doorway to the dining room is Mr. Collins.  A
	group of ashen faced guests stand in the distance behind him.

	Husband and wife's eyes meet.  Mrs. Collins smiles softly.

	Mr. Collins' eyes tremble with tears.

			     MR. COLLINS
			(soft)
		You were keeping her sick...

	The whole world stops.

	The mother's face registers confusion at first.  Then slow
	realization.  Her eyes glace at the many faces around her.

	She looks back at her husband.  His glare is painful.  Rage
	filling every cell of his body.  Tears falling faster down his
	cheeks.

	Mrs. Collins turns her attention back to the flowers.  She
	concentrates with all her strength.  Beat.  Her hands begin to
	shake.


			     MRS. COLLINS
			(to no one)
		I took care of her...

	Her words are met with ice cold stares.  The first tears stream
	down her face.  The pretty flowers of consolation in her hand
	tumble to the floor.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HOUSE - AFTERNOON

	Cole sits on the swings next to Kyra's four-year-old sister.  She
	doesn't look up.

	Malcolm waits in the driveway.  Watches them from a distance.

	Cole reaches into his pocket and pulls out the little FINGER
	PUPPET.  He holds it out.

			     COLE
		You liked it, she said.

	The four-year-old stares at the finger puppet, then quietly takes
	it in her small hands.

	The two children don't say anything for a while.  Malcolm glances
	to the house, where all movements in and out of the home has
	ceased.

	Cole turns to the four-year-old.

			     COLE
		She watched out for you.

	The little girl finally looks up.  She has the saddest eyes.

			FOUR YEAR OLD
		Kyra's not coming back.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		Not anymore.

	The little girl stares down at the finger puppet.  Cole lightly
	places a hand on her shoulder.

	Nothing else is said.  Nothing else is done.

	Malcolm looks across the two children on the swings.  One
	mourning.  One consoling.

	Malcolm takes it in, overwhelmed.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. PROP ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Stanley Cunningham moves between two curtains and comes to a prop
	room door in the back.  He puts an ear to the door, listens and
	then knocks.  After a second, he enters.

	Mr. Cunningham finds Cole sitting in a poor villager costume as a
	FEMALE TEACHER kneels next to him and makes final adjustments.
	Cole and the woman glance at Mr. Cunningham.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		They're calling for the stable boy.

	Mr. Cunningham looks around the room and then directly at Cole.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		Who were you talking to?

	The Female Teacher looks to Cole and nods.

			     FEMALE TEACHER
		Poor Stanley.

	She stands up.  The entire left side of her face has been burnt
	horribly.  Grotesquely disfigured.

			     FEMALE TEACHER
		My favorite student.

	THE FIGURE OF THE WOMAN MOVES PAST MR. CUNNINGHAM IN THE DOORWAY.
	SHE DISAPPEARS INTO THE DARKNESS.

	Cole puts on his tattered hat.

			     COLE
		Thanks for giving me this part, Mr.
		Cunningham.

	Mr. Cunningham smiles.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		You're welcome, Cole.

	They share a look before walking out of the prop room and
	entering the hall.

	We see them walking away.

			     MR. CUNNINGHAM
		You know when I was in school,
		there was a terrible fire in this
		section of the theater.  They
		rebuilt the whole thing.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		I know.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

	It begins to rain.  Malcolm pulls his jacket over his head as he
	scurries up the stairs of the school.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm stands and catches his breath in the corridor of St.
	Anthony's Academy.

	A teacher rushes in the hall with an armload of costumes.

			     MALCOLM
		Has the play started yet?

	The teacher hurries past Malcolm and down the hall without saying
	a word.

			     MALCOLM
		Is that a yes?

	The teacher scurries around a corner.  Malcolm watches her
	curiously.

							CUT TO:

	INT. AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON

	Malcolm moves quickly to a set of double doors and opens them.
	He steps into the DARKNESS OF THE AUDITORIUM.

	The play is in full swing...  Cole and a large group of costumed
	children are on stage.  Cole holds a broom and wears a worn-down
	costume.  He stands to the side -- hidden by others.

	A boy in a shiny-armored costume walks to the center of the stage
	where a large cardboard stone is seated.  A sparkling HANDLE
	sticks out of the top.

	The armored boy tries to lift it.  It won't budge.

	Bobby, the chubby boy from the party, is dressed in a magician's
	costume.  He is Merlin.  He steps forward.

			     MERLIN
		Only he who is pure of heart can
		take the sword from the stone.

	Merlin looks to the group on stage.  Looks right at Cole.

			     MERLIN
		Let the boy try.

	The group of villagers on the stage LAUGH AND MOCK THE SUGGESTION.

	Tommy Tammisimo is dressed in a mismatched costume -- he hops
	around, clearly embarrassed.

			     TOMMY
			(half-heartedly)
		But he's the stable boy.  He cleans
		after the horses.

			     MERLIN
		Silence village idiot!  Let the boy
		step forward.

	Tommy turns a deep shade of red and hobbles off the stage.

	Merlin looks to Cole.  He smiles a true friend's smile.

			     MERLIN
		Arthur...

	Cole hesitates.  Not because he's acting.  He really hesitates.
	It takes him a moment before he steps forward.

	Cole steps up to the stone.  He places his hand around the
	handle.  Begins to pull.  The sword starts to come out.

	The villagers GASP.

	Cole raises the shiny sword out of the stone and high above his
	head.

	Merlin and everyone on stage bows.  A SILENCE FILLS THE
	AUDITORIUM.

	Malcolm watches his client, standing unafraid in the spot light
	for the first time.

	The villagers rise and rush to Cole.  They scoop him up and carry
	him around the stage in celebration.  Cole chuckles and then
	starts laughing as the group of eight-year-olds try
	unsuccessfully to keep him up.  They slowly sag and then
	collapse.  All the students are laughing as they try to untangle
	themselves.

	Malcolm watches with utter joy as Cole becomes indistinguishable
	among of a group of twenty children giggling and enjoying
	themselves on stage.

							CUT TO:

	INT. SCHOOL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON

	The rain comes down a little stronger now on the stained glass
	window.

	Malcolm sits on the stairs in the lobby.  Cole walks back and
	forth in front of him.  Cole still holds the sword from the play.

			     COLE
		How come we're so quiet?

	Malcolm shrugs his shoulders.

			     MALCOLM
		I think we said everything we
		needed to say.
			(beat)
		Maybe it's time to say things to
		someone else?  Someone close to you?

			     COLE
		Maybe.

	Cole keeps moving.  Beat.

			     COLE
		I'm not going to see you anymore,
		am I?

	Malcolm doesn't respond for a while.  He shakes his head, "No."
	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		You were great in the play, Cole.

			     COLE
		Really?

			     MALCOLM
		And you know what else?

			     COLE
		What?

			     MALCOLM
		Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.

	Cole smiles huge.  Beat.  Cole's sword drags on the tile as he
	continues to circle around the hall.  We get the idea he doesn't
	want to be still.

			     COLE
		...Maybe we can pretend we're going
		to see each other tomorrow?

	Cole glances at Malcolm.

			     COLE
		Just for pretend.

	Beat.  Malcolm exhales very slowly as he gets up.

			     MALCOLM
		Okay, Cole, I'm going to go now...
		I'll see you tomorrow.

	Cole watches as Malcolm walks down the stairs to the entrance.
	Cole stops moving.

			     COLE
			(soft)
		See you tomorrow.

	Malcolm's face shows his losing battle against his emotions.  He
	doesn't turn to look back.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

	A rain-soaked bridge.  A two-lane road merges to one lane around
	a severe car accident.  A rear-ended car has jumped the sidewalk
	and hit the guard rail of the bridge.  The driver is helped out
	by police.  He's shaken but okay.  Police flares guide the cars
	as they crawl by.

	Lynn and Cole are standing still in bumper-to-bumper traffic.

	Lynn leans her chin on the steering wheel.  She tries to stare
	through the layer of water on the glass.  She hits the windshield
	wipers.

			     LYNN
		I hope nobody got hurt.

	Beat.  Lynn glances over to Cole who sits in his seat silently.

			     LYNN
		You're very quiet.
			(beat)
		You're mad I missed the play,
		aren't you?

	Cole shakes his head, "No."

			     LYNN
		I have two jobs, baby.  You know
		how important they are for us.

	Beat.

			     LYNN
		I'd give anything to have been
		there.

			     COLE
		I'm ready to communicate with you
		now.

	Beat.

			     LYNN
		Communicate?

			     COLE
		Tell you my secrets.

	The way he says the words gives Lynn a chill.

			     LYNN
		What is it?

	Cole takes a long time.

			     COLE
		You know that accident up there?

			     LYNN
			(confused)
		Yeah.

			     COLE
		Someone got hurt.

			     LYNN
		They did?

			     COLE
		A lady.  She died.

			     LYNN
		Oh my God.

	Lynn leans over the steering wheel.  She wipes the windshield
	with her palm to see better.

			     LYNN
		You can see her?

			     COLE
		Yes.

	Lynn gazes out the windshield at the line of red tail lights.
	Beat.

			     LYNN
		Where is she?

			     COLE
		Standing next to my window.

	A WOMAN IN HER LATE FORTIES, HELMET CRACKED, HAIR MATTED WITH
	RAIN AND BLOOD, STANDS STARING THROUGH COLE'S PASSENGER WINDOW.

	Lynn looks over slowly.  She doesn't see anything outside his
	window.  She eyes Cole.

			     LYNN
		Cole, you're scaring me.

			     COLE
		They scare me too sometimes.

			     LYNN
		They?

			     COLE
		Dead people.

			     LYNN
		Dead people?

			     COLE
		Ghosts.

	Beat.

			     LYNN
		You see ghosts, Cole?

			     COLE
		They want me to do things for them.

			     LYNN
		They talk to you?

	Cole nods, "Yes."

			     LYNN
		They tell you to do things?

	Cole nods "Yes" again.  Lynn becomes upset.  She nods with grave
	understanding.  Cole watches her.

			     COLE
		What are you thinking, Momma?

			     LYNN
		...I don't know.

			     COLE
		You think I'm a freak?

	Lynn's eyes moves to Cole.

			     LYNN
		Look at my face.

	Cole gazes at her intense expression.

			     LYNN
		I would never think that about you
		...  ever... Got it?

			     COLE
		Got it.

	BEAT.  Cole smiles a tiny smile.  Lynn glances down.

			     LYNN
		Just let me think for a second.

	She drowns in her thoughts.  Beat.

			     COLE
		Grandma says hi.

	Lynn looks up sharply.

			     COLE
		She says she's sorry for taking the
		bumble bee pendant.  She just likes
		it a lot.

			     LYNN
		What?

			     COLE
		Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

	Lynn becomes still.  Her face is unreadable.  When she speaks,
	her words are extremely controlled.

			     LYNN
		Cole, that's very wrong.  Grandma's
		gone.  You know that.

			     COLE
		I know.

	Beat.

			     COLE
		She wanted me to tell you--

			     LYNN
			(soft)
		Cole, please stop.

			     COLE
		She wanted me to tell you, she saw
		you dance.

	Lynn's eyes lock on Cole's.

			     COLE
		She said when you were little, you
		and her had a fight right before
		your dance recital.  You thought
		she didn't come to see you dance.
		She did.

	Lynn brings her hands to her mouth.

			     COLE
		She hid in the back so you wouldn't
		see...  She said you were like an
		angel.

	Lynn begins to cry.

			     COLE
		She said, you came to her where
		they buried her.  Asked her a
		question...  She said the answer is
		"Everyday."

	Lynn covers her face with her hands.  The tears roll out through
	her fingers.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		What did you ask?

	Beat.  Lynn looks at her son.  She barely gets the words out.

			     LYNN
			(crying)
		Do I make her proud?

	Cole moves closer to Lynn.  She cradles him in her arms.  Mother
	and son hold each other tight.

	WE PULL BACK FROM THE WINDSHIELD, BACK PAST THE FRONT BUMPER
	WHERE THE FIGURE OF THE BLOODED WOMAN STANDS STARING AT COLE AND
	HIS MOTHER.

	WE SEE A MANGLED BIKE PULLED OUT FROM THE REAR-ENDED CAR ON THE
	SIDEWALK.  WE MOVE UP AND AWAY FROM THE RAIN-SOAKED BRIDGE.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. MALCOLM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Malcolm walks quietly down the sidewalk towards his home.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Malcolm enters the living room and smiles at what he sees.

	Anna is asleep in a chair.  She's curled up in a ball.  In a way,
	she looks like a little girl.

	Their WEDDING VIDEO PLAYS SOFTLY ON THE TELEVISION.

	Malcolm watches himself and Anna cutting their wedding cake.  THE
	CROWD APPLAUDS AS THEY FEED EACH OTHER PIECES.

	Malcolm turns from the television and takes a seat next to Anna.
	He gazes upon his wife softly.

			     MALCOLM
			(whispers)
		Anna, I've been so lost.
			(beat)
		I need my best friend.

	Silence.  Malcolm gazes for a beat before looking down.

			     ANNA
		I miss you.

	Malcolm's eyes move back up.  He looks at his sleeping wife.
	ANNA'S TALKING IN HER SLEEP.

	Malcolm can't believe it.

			     MALCOLM
		I miss you.

	Beat.  Her lips move again.  Eyes never open.

			     ANNA
		Why, Malcolm?

			     MALCOLM
		What, Anna?  What did I do?  What's
		made you so sad?

	Beat.

			     ANNA
		Why did you leave me?

			     MALCOLM
		I didn't leave you.

	Beat.  She becomes silent.  Anna falls back into deep sleep, her
	arm slides down.  SOMETHING SHINY FALLS OUT AND ROLLS ON THE
	GROUND.

	Malcolm's eyes watch as it comes to a stop...  Beat.  He gazes
	curiously at a GOLD WEDDING BAND laying on the wood floor.

	Confusion washes over his face.  He looks to Anna's hand...  An
	identical gold wedding ring sits on her finger.

	Beat.  Malcolm looks down at his own hand...  HIS WEDDING RING IS
	GONE.

	Malcolm is completely lost.  He takes a couple steps back.  Looks
	around in confusion...

	His eyes come to rest on the door to his basement office.  He
	looks in disbelief at the set of DEAD BOLT LOCKS on the door.

	Malcolm doesn't know what the hell's going on...  His eyes are
	drawn to the dining table...  Only ONE PLACE SETTING is out on
	the tabletop.

	His eyes search again -- they finally lock on the WEDDING VIDEO
	PLAYING.  Malcolm watches images of himself on the screen...  His
	eyes fill with a storm of emotions...

	Malcolm looks to Anna's face and becomes very still.  Beat.

	CLOSE ON ANNA...  TILL HER SLEEPING FACE FILLS THE FRAME...  IT'S
	NOW WE NOTICE FOR THE FIRST TIME, THAT ANNA'S BREATHS ARE FORMING
	TINY CLOUDS IN THE COLD AIR.

			     MALCOLM
			(like he's falling
			 down a deep hole)
		No...

							SLAM CUT:

	FLASHBACK:  INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	VIOLENT GUN SHOTS RING THROUGH THE BEDROOM.

	Anna rushes across the room to a crumpled Malcolm laying on the
	floor.  Malcolm's hands are clutched at his side.

	Anna pries his hands away to reveal the tiniest tear in his
	shirt.  Anna's eyes catch something dark -- moving...  A POOL OF
	BLOOD IS FORMING UNDER MALCOLM.  She slowly turns him over on his
	side...  A horrific sight...  An enormous exit wound on his lower
	back pours out blood uncontrollably.

	Malcolm's jaw is locked open.  His breaths are long and strained.

	ANNA IS SCREAMING, BUT HER VOICE SOUNDS FAR AWAY.

	Malcolm's open jaw releases a long strained breath and then
	becomes silent.  Anna tries to cover the wound with her hands
	desperately.

							SLAM CUT:

	PRESENT:  INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

			     MALCOLM
			(screaming)
		     ANNA!

	MALCOLM'S VOICE SHAKES THE ROOM.

	Anna just sleeps.

	Malcolm staggers back.  His breathing erratic.

	He takes a seat across from her.  He looks at his wife and
	suddenly becomes very still.

	Anna's still curled up asleep, but tears are falling from her
	shut eyes.

	Beat.

			     MALCOLM
		Don't cry.

	Anna doesn't move, but her tears seem to fall a little faster.

			     MALCOLM
		I think I have to go.

	Malcolm's mind is racing.

			     MALCOLM
			(realizing)
		I just needed to do a couple of
		things.
			(beat)
		And I needed to tell you something.

			     ANNA
		Tell me.

	Beat.
			     MALCOLM
		You were never second...  Ever.

	Malcolm gazes at his wife.  Tears fall from both their eyes.

			     MALCOLM
		You sleep now, Anna.  Everything
		will be different in the morning.

	Anna lays still.

			     ANNA
		Goodnight, Malcolm.

			     MALCOLM
		Goodnight, sweetheart.

	The room falls into silence.  Malcolm sits still across from his
	wife.  He drinks her in with his eyes.

	Malcolm leans back in the chair.  Slowly closes his eyes.  They
	close shut.

	WE ARE TIGHT ON ANNA...  WE SEE HER SOFT BREATHS FORMING A TINY
	CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR...

	WITH EACH BREATH, THEY BECOME LESS AND LESS VISIBLE...  THE ROOM
	BECOMING LESS AND LESS COLD.

	SOON HER BREATHS AREN'T VISIBLE AT ALL.  SHE BREATHES GENTLY,
	FALLING BACK INTO A PEACEFUL SLEEP.

	WE PULL BACK to reveal Anna alone in the living room.

	THE WEDDING VIDEO PLAYS ITS LAST SCENES...  MALCOLM IS AT THE
	MICROPHONE ON THE DANCE FLOOR IN FRONT OF ALL THE GUESTS.  HE'S
	HOLDING A GLASS OF WINE.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		...I think I've had too much to
		drink.

	Malcolm smiles as he takes a sip.  The guests chuckle as they
	watch.  Beat.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		I just have to say, this day today
		has been one very special day...
		I wish we all could stay and play.

	The crowd erupts in LAUGHTER.

			     MALCOLM
			(on tape)
		What?

	Malcolm looks around at everyone's smiling faces.

	Beat.  Malcolm takes his time.  He looks just past the camera.

			     MALCOLM
		Anna, I never thought I'd feel the
		things I'm feeling.  I never
		thought I'd be able to stand up in
		front of my friends and family and
		tell them what's inside me...
		Today I can...

	Malcolm's eyes fill with water.

			     MALCOLM
			(softly)
		Anna Crowe...  I am in love.  In
		love I am.

              A pleasing land of drowsy head it was,
              of dreams that wave before the half shut eye...










     EXT.  GNARLED FOREST -- NIGHT

     An UGLY MAN charges through on a horse, holding a lantern
     forward on a long pole. He looks back, terrified.

     INSERT TITLE:  1799 Sleepy Hollow, New York

     THUNDEROUS HOOFBEATS are HEARD behind.

     The ugly man glances back again.  His lantern swings wild...
     SHATTERS against a tree.  The jammed-up pole SLAMS the ugly
     man off his horse...

     He hits the ground.  He runs, trips, falls and scrambles up.

     DEEP IN THE FOREST, we glimpse the source of the HOOFBEATS: a
     HUGE FORM on a HUGE BLACK HORSE, already gone.

     The ugly man pushes through thorny bushes.  Jagged branches
     slit his hands and cheeks.

     He bursts from the briar patch and tumbles to a trail.  He
     lifts his bloodied face.  He runs.

     IN THE FOREST BEHIND: the hooves of the black horse rip
     underbrush.  HOOFBEATS DEAFENING.  A spur digs into the
     snorting steed's already bleeding flank.

     The pursuer's gloved hand draws a SWORD, blade RINGING.

     ON THE TRAIL, the ugly man runs on.  The shrill WHISTLE of a
     SWORD SWING is HEARD as the pursuer blurs past.

     The ugly man is still running when his head lolls back, at an
     impossible angle... tumbles off his shoulders... His headless
     body hits the dirt.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS -- NIGHT

     Empty cobblestone streets.  Crooked buildings.  A RAPIDLY
     CLANGING BELL breaks the silence from afar.

     INSERT TITLE:  New York City

     TWO CONSTABLES clamor round a corner, lanterns held high,
     listening.  They rush into an alleyway.

     ELSEWHERE, piers border the Hudson River.  The BELL is
     LOUDER. The two constables arrive, searching.  No one around.
     Constable One hefts his pistol, scared.

                             CONSTABLE ONE
               Where are you?!

                             MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
               Here!  Over here!

     They hurry to the river's edge.  Down a hill, the MAN,
     another constable, stands with his back to us.  He's waist
     deep in water, tossing away his ALARM BELL.

                             MAN
               I need your help with this.

     Constable Two crosses on the peir above.  Constable One moves
     forward, wary.  The MAN grunts, lifting something.

                             CONSTABLE ONE
               Constable Crane?  Ichabod Crane...
               is that you?

     The MAN turns.  Meet ICHABOD CRANE, handsome, eyes piercing.

                             ICHABOD
               Yes, it is me.  But, not only me...
                     (lifting, struggling)
               I found someone here...

     He drags a bloated MALE CORPSE up from the murky water.

                             ICHABOD
               Someone quite dead.


     EXT.  WATCHHOUSE/JAIL -- NIGHT

     The elderly HIGH CONSTABLE lifts a blanket off the corpse on
     a wheelbarrow manned by Constable Two.  A snobby MAGISTRATE
     looks, disgusted.  Constable One and Ichabod wait.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Burn it.

                             CONSTABLE ONE
               Yes, sir.

     Constable Two wheels the corpse inside.  Ichabod's dismayed.

                             ICHABOD
               Just a moment... if I may.  It is
               possible this man was murdered.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               He drowned.  Anyone could see.

                             ICHABOD
               There are surgical ways of telling
               how he died... by the water in his
               lungs...

     Ichabod follows the High Constable and Magistrate in.

     INT.  WATCHHOUSE, NIGHT WATCH QUARTERS -- NIGHT

     Constable Two wheels the body ahead past many "booking"
     tables.  A JAILER moves to unlock a massive door.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               He will be burned pursuant to
               statutes of health.

                             ICHABOD
               I could determine if he were dead
               before he went into the Hudson.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Must we again hear these heretical
               rantings?

                             MAGISTRATE
               Yes, must we?

                             ICHABOD
               There is nothing heretical about
               science, sir.  The Chinese have
               written on it for hundreds of
               years... procedural study used to
               solve seemingly unsolvable crimes.

     The door is opened.  The corpse again leads the way.

     INT.  WATCHHOUSE, JAIL -- NIGHT

     A two-tiered prison, alive with MOANS of AGONY and CRIES of
     INSANITY.  Cells are full of wretched men in chains and iron
     gags.  Many are against the bars, watching.

                             ICHABOD
               Our first night watch is adequate
               against fire and some violence,
               but if we were more often able to
               ensure justice, after the fact,
               then criminals would truly have
               something to fear from law
               enforcement.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Have they nothing to fear presently?

                             ICHABOD
               Without disrespect, look around you.
                     (motioning to cells)
               We overflow.  As do our courts.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               And, with disrespect, Constable,
               if jails and courts overflow, it is
               testimony to success, not failure.

                             ICHABOD
               But, how many innocents rot here?
               And, how many victims are buried
               without reprisal while guilty men
               roam our streets?

     The High Constable reaches a desk, taking a seat.  Guards
     wait to process beaten, bloody prisoners.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Very few, if any.

                             ICHABOD
               Even though I have seen confessions
               pried from the lips of the accused,
               often quite literally?

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               For one who calls himself a
               Federalist, your mouth reeks of
               Republican liberalism.

                             ICHABOD
               Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.

                             MAGISTRATE
                     (to High Constable)
               Um, sir... might I suggest...

     The Magistrate WHISPERS in the High Constable's ear.  Ichabod
     notices with worry that Constables One and Two wheel the
     corpse onwards into another room.

     The Magistrate finishes.  The High Constable smiles faintly.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
                     (to Ichabod)
               There is a farming community
               upstate, Constable... ten days
               journey north in the Hudson
               Highlands.  It is named Sleepy
               Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three
               persons have been murdered there.
               Each with their head lopped cleanly
               off.
                     (holds up papers)
               The elders of the Hollow have sent
               dispatches to me, requesting
               assistance, and now, just this very
               moment, I have chosen you.

                             ICHABOD
               Chosen me?

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               These "methods" of yours... there
               has been no practical application.

                             ICHABOD
               Not for lack of trying.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Just so.  Granted.  And so you take
               your experimentations to Sleepy
               Hollow and catch the murderer who
               has tainted the place.  Bring him
               here to face our good justice.
               Will you do this for me?

                             ICHABOD
                     (swallowing doubt)
               I shall, gladly.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Excellent.  Then, you are excused
               till morning.

     Ichabod moves away, heading to where the corpse was taken.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Oh, and, Constable...
                     (off Ichabod's look)
               Do make certain that you meet with
               success.  Otherwise... perhaps you
               should not come back at all.

     The High Constable smiles a sardonic smile.

     INT.  WATCHHOUSE, INCINERATION ROOM -- NIGHT

     The corpse burns in a raging furnace.  Flesh sizzles.

     Constable One pumps bellows which fan the flames.  Ichabod
     steps from darkness nearby.  He watches with bitter regret as
     the corpse is consumed.


     EXT.  CITY -- DAY

     Market town streets bustle.  Filthy.  Pigs roam free.

     INT.  ICHABOD'S HOME, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY

     Decorated in Early-American Mad Scientist: books, papers and
     jars of chemicals.  Charts of anatomy above a small bed.

                             ICHABOD (o.s.)
               Such a day for such a sad farewell.
               But, this is goodbye, my sweet.

     At the window, Ichabod holds a bird cage with a red CARDINAL
     inside.  He opens the cage.  The bird flies free.

     Ichabod watches it go, then looks down.  A COACH halts in the
     street below.  The forlorn DRIVER looks up.


     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- DAY

     In motion.  Ichabod absently studies his hands, touching the
     strange SCARS on both palms: evenly dispersed, tiny dots of
     tissue.  Many scars.

     Ichabod lifts a LEATHER SATCHEL, checking its contents.

     EXT.  UPSTATE FORESTS -- DAY

     TWO FAMILIES of MIGRANT WORKERS travel a path, leading over-
     burdened horses.  Ichabod's coach approaches from the other
     direction.  Ichabod looks out, unnerved.

     One GAUNT MAN watches Ichabod pass.  There is a dead, worried
     look in the man's eyes.  Others stare at Ichabod.


     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY

     Ichabod faces two massive, vine-covered PILLARS, unsure.  He
     turns to watch the driver lead the coach away.

     Ichabod walks between the pillars to a long straight road.
     He does not notice, above: THREE DEAD RAVENS hang from a tree
     limb, twine wrapped round their necks.

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, TOWN SQUARE -- DAY

     Ichabod walks on with baggage.  The square is empty, a CHURCH
     and GRAVEYARD at one end.  The road ahead is bordered by
     businesses and homes.

     CONVERSATION DRIFTS from a tavern.  A criminal sits in
     stocks.  A quiet CRYING is HEARD.  Ichabod hears...

     He looks for its source.  It's from a window above, LOUDER.
     SOUNDS like the SOBBING of an OLD WOMAN.


     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- DAY

     ICHABOD'S P.O.V.: a BELLTOWER stands tall, like a mast pole
     with a crow's nest basket atop.  There's a man in the basket
     and a huge BELL.

     Ichabod ponders this as he continues.  Ahead on a hill: the
     grand Van Tassel Manor House.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL MANOR HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- DAY

     MANY CHILDREN, in a circle, taunt a BLINDFOLDED YOUNG WOMAN
     spun round by the handsome, barrel-chested man, BROM VAN
     BRUNT.  A few YOUNG MEN and LADIES watch.  Brom releases the
     woman.  Everyone quiets and avoids her searching hands.

                             BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
               This is such a silly game.

                             BROM
               Be a sport and stop complaining.

     The woman moves to Brom's voice.  He backs away, flanked by
     peers GLENN and THEODORE.  Children laugh.

     Ichabod enters, clearing his throat.  No one notices.  The
     blindfolded woman keeps grasping.  One LITTLE GIRL sees
     Ichabod and goes to him, finger to her lips.

                             LITTLE GIRL
               Play along.  You must.

     She tugs him.  Before Ichabod can protest, he is placed in
     the blindfolded woman's grip.

                             BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
               There, I have someone.  Am I
               finished?

                             LITTLE GIRL
               You have to tell who it is.

     The woman touches Ichabod's face.  He is uncomfortable,
     affected by this caress.  Brom watches jealously.

                             LITTLE GIRL
               At least make a guess.

                             BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
               I don't know.  Is it Brom Bones?

                             BROM
               Certainly not.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me, Miss...
                     (takes her hands)
               They have a laugh at your expense.

     She takes the kerchief off to reveal a stunning beauty:
     KATRINA VAN TASSEL.  Ichabod tries to compose himself.

                             KATRINA
               Forgive me, I didn't know.

                             ICHABOD
               I... I am looking for Baltus Van
               Tassel.

                             BROM
               We haven't heard your name yet,
               friend.

                             ICHABOD
               Well, unless your name is Baltus,
               you should not worry over mine.

     Brom grabs Ichabod's collar, pissed.  Ichabod's baffled.

                             BROM
               You need some manners.

                             KATRINA
               Brom!

     Brom looks at her, then reluctantly releases Ichabod.

                             MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
               What is this, then... ?

     BALTUS VAN TASSEL, 45, has entered, a working-class
     aristocrat.  LADY VAN TASSEL, 40, stands behind, a mix of
     home-spun wife and well-kept lady.

                             BALTUS
               Can I help you, sir?

     Ichabod's relieved to have a proper focal point.  Children
     gather around Katrina and hide behind her.

                             ICHABOD
               I have been sent from the city
               with a letter of introduction.
               I am told you offer me room and
               board.

     Ichabod hands over papers.  Baltus reads, furrows his brow.

                             ICHABOD
               If we could speak alone.

                             BALTUS
                     (nods, looks to Katrina)
               This is not a time for frivolity,
               Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?

                             KATRINA
               They're only children, father.

     Baltus snorts, then exits with Ichabod.  The others huddle to
     gossip, except Katrina, who moves beside Lady Van Tassel to
     watch Ichabod and Baltus walk down the hall.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- DAY

     DOCTOR LANCASTER, 50, dour and always sweaty, takes a seat by
     the fire, joining Baltus and three other elders.  A pretty
     servant, SARAH, brings a pipe cradle while Lady Van Tassel
     sets down food.  Ichabod is standing.

                             BALTUS
               That will be all, ladies.
                     (waits as they exit)
               We are joined by Doctor Thomas
               Lancaster, Constable.  And to his
               left are, Clergyman Steenwyck and
               our able magistrate, Samuel Philipse,
               both keeping order in their own ways.

     PHILIPSE is youngest, eyes bloodshot, mug in hand and pipe in
     mouth.  CLERGYMAN STEENWYCK is formidably built, wearing a
     constant look of disapproval.

                             BALTUS
               I myself am in charge of financial
               matters and the regulation of
               currency in our commonwealth.  And,
               lastly, this fine fellow is James
               Hardenbrook, our Notary.

     HARDENBROOK is oldest, ancient, with one eye pale and blind.

                             ICHABOD
               An honor, gentlemen.  In time I
               will need every detail of the
               three murderings you've had, but,
               for now, I ask only if you have
               any theory at all as to who the
               killer might be?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               Excuse me?

                             ICHABOD
               I say, is there any one person
               suspect in these acts?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               I was afraid of this.

     Philipse shoots a look to Baltus.  Angst amongst the elders.

                             PHILIPSE
               Well, Constable... are you aware...
               to be honest, you are not what we
               expected.  We sent for the militia.

                             ICHABOD
               The militia?

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               Why not tell us what you have heard?
               Hmm?  How much have your superiors
               bothered to tell you?

                             ICHABOD
               All I know is three are slain, their
               heads found severed from their
               bodies...

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               The heads were not found severed.
               The heads were not found at all.

     Withered Hardenbrook leans forward, his voice cragged.

                             HARDENBROOK
               Taken.  Taken by the Headless
               Horseman.  Taken back to hell.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon me?

                             BALTUS
               You have not been well informed of
               our troubles, sir.  If you would...

     Baltus gestures for Ichabod to sit.  Baltus lights his pipe.

                             BALTUS
               The Horseman... he was a Hessian
               mercenary, sent to our shores by
               German princes to help keep
               Americans under the thumb of
               England.  However, unlike his
               compatriots who came as muscle in
               trade for currency, he came
               willingly.  For love of carnage.

     FLASHBACK -- AMERICAN BATTLEFIELD -- DAY

     The HESSIAN HORSEMAN rides his black steed into a gory,
     close-quarters clash, his cloaked uniform adorned with edged
     weapons.  He cuts down Americans left and right.

                             BALTUS (v.o.)
               He was infamous for taking his
               horse, Daredevil, hard into
               battle... chopping off heads at
               full gallop.

     He dismounts, hoisting a battle axe.  With sword and axe, he
     annihilates.  Blood gushes.  Bones crack.

                             BALTUS (v.o.)
               Just to look on him made your
               blood run cold, for he had filed
               down his teeth to rapiers... to
               add to the ferocity of his
               appearance.

     The Horseman lets out a war cry.  Jagged teeth.  Grotesque.

     FOREST BATTLEFIELD -- DAY

     Winter.  CANNONS can be HEARD BOOMING from afar.  Daredevil
     lies dead in red snow.  FOLLOW FOOTPRINTS away...

                             BALTUS (v.o.)
               He would not finally meet his end
               till the winter of seventy-nine,
               when New York City was held by
               Henry Clinton and Washington
               occupied West Point.  It was
               between those two places, not far
               from here...

     The Horseman flees, cloak flowing, chased by FIVE rag-tag
     REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS.  Ahead, a steep, rocky area prevents
     escape.  Soldier one aims a rifle and FIRES...

     Blood explodes from the Horseman's arm as he runs.  His sword
     falls from his now functionless hand.

     Soldier Two grabs the sword.

     At the rocks, the Horseman faces the men.  Another Rifleman
     raises his rifle.  The Horseman reaches over his shoulder to
     grasp a sheathed knife, THROWS --

     THOCK!  The Rifleman jerks back, knife in his eye socket.

     The Horseman readies an axe.  The Revolutionaries move in
     with swords.  They battle, STEEL AGAINST STEEL.  The Horseman
     fends off blows from all sides.

     Soldier Three lunges, stabs his blade deep into the
     Horseman's side.  The Horseman roars, brings his axe DOWN...
     BREAKS the sword at the hilt...

     An UPWARDS stroke sends Soldier Three head over heels in a
     fountain of blood.

     The Horseman staggers, howling, trying to pull the blade from
     his ribs.  The remaining soldiers close in.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Pipe smoke wafts from Philipse's mouth.

                             PHILIPSE
               Cut off his head with his own sword.
               It's a legend told for twenty years.

                             BALTUS
               But, only recently has the Headless
               Hessian been seen prowling the
               Hollow, in search of a head to suit
               his shoulders.

                             ICHABOD
               Just a moment...
                     (sits back, incredulous)
               Are you saying it is he?

                             HARDENBROOK
                     (aggravated, loud)
               When a goblin leaps from the nether
               world, others follow.  Poltergeists
               of the air, water and earth follow
               and cheer his desecrations!

     Hardenbrook BANGS his cane on a table.  Baltus puts a calming
     hand on senile Hardenbrook's shoulder.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               No one knows why he chose to now to
               climb out from his grave.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               It is very clear why.  Citizens
               here have long tried to hide sins
               behind closed doors.  Their failed
               faith has saturated the soil and
               called forth one of Satan's own.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who
               has seen this Horseman?

                             BALTUS
               Many have.

                             ICHABOD
               Then, name one person who has seen
               him with their own eyes.

     A long wait.  No reply from the elders.  Ichabod rises.

                             ICHABOD
               While I will do everything I can
               to find your assassin, I will look
               for a man of flesh and blood.  Not
               some goblin-demon from hell.


     EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- EARLY EVENING

     The Belltower is covered in defensive spikes.  A man climbs
     down a rope ladder.  Below, many ARMED MEN gather.  Everyone
     grim.  Philipse moves to the center, on horseback.

                             PHILIPSE
               Gather round!  Gather and quiet!
               The hour has come to choose for
               this night.  Each man's name is
               in this box and has been checked.

     A box is handed up.  Ichabod and Baltus arrive on foot at the
     back of the mob.  Ichabod looks...

     At a nearby forest, men light TORCH POSTS in a line bordering
     the forest edge for at least a half mile.

     Philipse draws a folded paper from the box, holds it up.

                             PHILIPSE
               May the Lord watch over him...
                     (unfolds paper)
               "Jonathan Masbath."  Are you here?

                             JONATHAN (o.s.)
               I am.  I take my responsibility.

     The crowd parts as JONATHAN MASBATH, a dirt-poor farmer with
     a bow and quiver of arrows, moves forward.  His son, YOUNG
     MASBATH, 14, grips his arm.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               No, father.  Wait...
                     (up to Philipse)
               He's already been up once.  Why
               does he go again?

                             JONATHAN
               It is a lottery, son.  It just as
               easily might have been one of them.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Then... I go with you.

                             JONATHAN
               No.  You obey my wishes.
                     (looks to crowd)
               Brom.  Look after him, will you?

     Brom steps up, nodding.  Jonathan kisses his son's cheek,
     then heads to the rope ladder.  Men pat him on the back.

                             PHILIPSE
               Someone leave him a horse.

     Young Masbath watches his father go.  Brom coaxes him away.
     At the back of the crowd, Ichabod watches skeptically, looks
     to Young Masbath as he and Brom pass.

                             ICHABOD
               You worry for naught, little man.
               Nothing will harm him there.
                     (looks up, sotto)
               It is problems here on the ground
               you people need begin to worry
               about.

     Ichabod watches Jonathan climb, very high above.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod makes notations in a LEDGER BOOK.

                             KATRINA (v.o.)
               You will dream.

     Katrina strolls in, sits on the bed.  Ichabod is nervous.

                             KATRINA
               Did they tell?  It is something in
               the air so that dreams come to
               everyone.  According to the elders,
               an Indian prophet held powwows here
               before the land was taken, and
               spells cast then still linger to
               this day.

                             ICHABOD
               Do you often make a habit of
               sitting on strange men's beds?

                             KATRINA
               You are horribly old-fashioned,
               aren't you?

                             ICHABOD
               Feel free to form your own opinion.
                     (facing his ledger)
               Though it appears you already have.

                             KATRINA
               Well, I intended to apologize for
               the behavior of my friend Brom Van
               Brunt, but it seems I've made
               matters worse.
                     (getting up to go)
               I'll leave you to your business.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me... I should apologize.  I,
               um... I... have no great love of...

                             KATRINA
               Other people?

                             ICHABOD
               Small talk.

                             KATRINA
               It might have been more.  Might have
               been positively grand talk.

     Ichabod offers his chair, backing away.  Seeing it is the
     only one, he remains standing.  Katrina sits.

                             KATRINA
               Is it me, or are you this nervous
               around all women?

                             ICHABOD
               Perhaps it is because your suitor's
               hands were recently very nearly
               wrapped around my throat.

                             KATRINA
               My suitor?

                             ICHABOD
               The massive fellow... Brom.  For
               someone you call "friend," he
               misplaces a good portion of jealousy.

                             KATRINA
               He has proposed to me twice.

                             ICHABOD
               Which may explain his temperament.
               To have asked twice means the answer
               was "no" at least once.

     Katrina looks down, discards this with a smile.

                             KATRINA
               I've read a great deal about your
               New York City.  Do be a dear and tell
               me all about it.  Sounds like an
               extraordinary place to live a life.

                             ICHABOD
               Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you
               tell me about the Headless Horseman.


     EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT

     The torches burn bright.  ABOVE, in the Belltower, Jonathan
     Masbath loads a rifle.  THUNDER BOOMS.

     Jonathan stands, looking to a sky that is all stars and moon.
     A HORSE is HEARD SHRIEKING.  Below, the horse tied at the
     base of the tower is spooked.

     A COMMOTION is HEARD, ground rumbling.  Jonathan grips a
     rifle, cocks it and moves to look...

     At the forest edge, a herd of deer stampedes out.  They
     sprint past the tower and across the field.

     Jonathan crosses to watch the herd scatter.  He crosses back
     to peer at the forest.  Bad news...

     A thick FOG creeps from the woods.

     As the fog overtakes the base of each torch, a tentacle of
     mist snakes up to the flame, killing it.  All along the
     forest, arms of vapor snuff torches... one by one by one...

     Above, Jonathan sights the rifle along the trees.

                             JONATHAN
               Come out, devil... come....


     INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod leans on a dresser.  Katrina's still seated.

                             KATRINA
               Not all think it is the Horseman.
               Many say witches come from the
               Western Woods to steal skulls for
               their cauldrons.  Some believe a
               person in this very town kneels
               before Lucifer, offering death as
               tribute.  And, still others believe
               none of it.

                             ICHABOD
               Are you so superstitious?

                             KATRINA
               To call a person superstitious is to
               imply they fear magic, but not all
               magic is black.

                             ICHABOD
               There is no such thing as magic.

                             KATRINA
               Really?  Then... what is your
               rebuttal to those romantic poets
               claiming proof of magic in a rose at
               full bloom, or even in a teardrop?

                             ICHABOD
               Poets have silly notions about
               plants and bodily secretions.

                             KATRINA
                     (laughs)
               You are funny.

     Ichabod doesn't get what's so funny about that.  The DISTANT
     TOLL of a BELL is HEARD.  Katrina looks fearful.

     She goes to open a window.  The BELL TOLLS...

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, OVERVIEW -- NIGHT

     ... TOLLS mournfully over farms and forests...

     EXT.  FARM -- NIGHT

     ... TOLLS as a MAN comes from his barn, listening, then
     sprinting towards his home.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

     ... TOLLS across the deserted square.  Windows go dark.
     Shutters are slammed shut.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     ... TOLLS.  Ichabod bounds out to the lawn, halting to
     listen.  Katrina and Baltus come out on the porch.

                             BALTUS
               Constable, where are you going!?

     ... TOLLS... TOLLS... then, SILENCE.  Ichabod chases away.

                             BALTUS
               Come back, sir...
                     (watches him go)
               Madness.

     Baltus ushers Katrina back in.  The door slams.


     EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod charges across the rocky field.  He slows, awed...

     The Belltower is down, its mast is splintered.  The horse is
     gone.  Ichabod moves to where the crow's nest lies smashed.
     No sign of Jonathan.

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FOREST -- NIGHT

     Jonathan runs past, gripping his bow.  It's QUIET... till
     HOOFBEATS are HEARD in pursuit.

     Trees are silhouetted against the sky.  As HOOFBEATS get
     LOUDER, branches bend like arms and fingers yearning to
     touch.  As HOOFBEATS ROAR PAST, the trees relax.

     FURTHER ON, Jonathan runs.  WIND begins to BLOW.

     BEHIND, in motion, WE SEE Daredevil's snorting visage; eyes
     lizard-like, with vertical slits literally aglow.

     The Horseman's hand yanks a wooden WAR HAMMER from a saddle
     mount.  (No clear view of the Horseman.)

     HORSEMAN'S P.O.V.: closing in on Jonathan.

     Jonathan is overtaken.  The Horseman swings the hammer WHOOMP
     -- sends Jonathan sprawling.

     HOOFBEATS FADE.  Jonathan tries to get up, but pain shoots
     through him.  He crawls to retrieve his bow.

     Against a tree, he takes an arrow from his shoulder quiver
     and readies it.  Waiting.  A metal TAPPING is HEARD O.S.
     CLINK... CLINK... CLINK.  A HORSE SNORTS.

     Jonathan pulls the bow taut, pained, lips bloody.

     Elsewhere, Daredevil approaches slow.  The Horseman taps his
     sword on his spur, CLINK... CLINK... CLINK...

     Foliage moves as the Horseman's form pushes through.

     Jonathan releases -- the arrow WHISTLES...

     THWACK! -- imbeds in the Horseman's chest.

     CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... continues -- Jonathan readies a
     second arrow.  Pulls and releases -- O.S. THWACK!

     CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan cries out, crawling away
     desperately.  Crawling through underbrush, over roots and
     rocks.  CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan gives up, spent,
     face to the dirt.  He closes his eyes.

     CLINKING STOPS.  Daredevil halts astride Jonathan; two legs
     on each side of Jonathan's body.


     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FARMLAND -- MORNING

     Baltus and a large, DULLARDLY MAN ride.  Behind, Ichabod
     rides with Magistrate Philipse.

     Ichabod is not adept at riding his old nag, Gunpowder.

                             ICHABOD
               The Van Garretts died first; a man
               and his son, survived by a wife and
               two infants.  And the Widow Windsor
               was next...

                             PHILIPSE
               And now Jonathan Masbath.

                             ICHABOD
                     (looks back, ponders)
               Why would he flee this direction,
               with so much open ground to cross
               before he reached cover?

                             PHILIPSE
               He would not have gone into the
               Western Woods.  No sane man would.

     Philipse drinks from a whiskey flask, sees Ichabod watching
     and offers some.  Ichabod declines.

                             PHILIPSE
               Van Ripper there...

     Ahead, the dullard, VAN RIPPER, sloppily spits tobacco.

                             PHILIPSE
               ... found the body this morning.
                     (pause) 
               You do believe now, don't you?

                             ICHABOD 
               Believe?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               You said yourself.  What mere man
               could have downed the Belltower?

                             ICHABOD 
               It is a prime tenet of science,
               Philipse, that because one thing
               appears improbable does not mean
               you embrace the utterly fantastical.

                             PHILIPSE 
               You need less big words, and more
               common sense.

     Philipse fingers an IRON KEY talisman he wears on a cord.

                             ICHABOD 
               What is that you wear?

                             PHILIPSE 
               My talisman.  It will, protect
               against the Horseman if I show a
               brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If
               I run in fear, it is worthless.

                             ICHABOD 
               Well... so much for common sense.


     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS, FURTHER ON -- MORNING

     Brom and Baltus stand at a HORSE'S CORPSE amongst jagged
     boulders.  The flesh has been stripped, guts exposed.
     Philipse and Ichabod arrive and dismount.

                             BALTUS 
               Was this Jonathan's?

                             BROM 
               Yes.  Seems he panicked across here
               and broke two legs.

                             ICHABOD 
               Who took the meat?

                             BALTUS 
               Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape
               Indian lives in the Western Woods.

                             ICHABOD 
               These woods of yours sound a bit
               crowded, what with all the witches,
               ghouls and Indians living there.

     Brom climbs up onto his own horse, a black beauty.

                             BROM 
               There's only one Lenape.  He eats
               small animals and lost children...
               and the occasional constable when he
               can get it.

     Brom rides.  Ichabod goes to the dead horse, digs in his
     satchel for a thin iron tool, which he uses it to pry off one
     HORSESHOE.  A WHISTLE is HEARD O.S.

     Everyone looks far ahead to where Van Ripper has ridden.  The
     doctor and others are there.  Van Ripper waves.


     INT. FOREST, MASBATH MURDER SITE -- MORNING

     Doctor Lancaster stands with SEVERAL ARMED MEN.  A coffin on
     a cart is covered by a blanket. Ichabod is crouched nearby.

                             ICHABOD 
               Why did you move the body, Doctor?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               To place it inside its coffin.

     Ichabod, nods, vaguely annoyed.  He puts the horseshoe into a
     hoofprint in the dirt.  It fits.

     Ichabod rises, walks, studying the ground, kicking up leaves.
     Brom, Van Ripper, Baltus and Philipse watch.

     Ichabod finds a deep hoofprint.  Huge.  He compares the
     horseshoe.  The hoofprint is much larger.

     Ichabod pulls his satchel off his shoulder, takes out a bowl,
     bottle of water and bag of brown powder; begins mixing water
     and powder with a fork to make plaster.

     The others watch, finding this bizarre, whispering.  Brom
     comes up to stand over Ichabod, irritated.

                             BROM 
               What the hell are you doing?

                             ICHABOD
                     (ignoring pause) 
               You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod
               a horse with a hoof this large?

                             BROM 
               Never.  A shoe that size I would
               have remembered.

     Ichabod starts to fill the print with plaster.

                             ICHABOD 
               Van Ripper.  Can you show where the
               body lay?

                             VAN RIPPER 
               I can show exactly.

     Van Ripper dismounts, wiping tobacco drool.  Ichabod rises to
     follow with his satchel.

                             VAN RIPPER 
               Here... in front of this oak, facing
               north.  Horrible...

                             ICHABOD 
               To the best of your recollection,
               where did the open wound fall?

     Van Ripper points.  Ichabod takes a BOTTLE of WHITE POWDER
     from his pocket.

     He uncorks the bottle, cautiously pouring powder in an x on
     the dirt there, then waiting.

     A chemical reaction causes the powder to bubble a bit.

                             ICHABOD 
               There was not much blood, was there?

                             VAN RIPPER 
               I didn't see none.

     Ichabod stands, puzzled.  He walks to the coffin cart,
     rolling up his sleeves.  Others come to watch, but keep
     distance.  Ichabod removes the blanket...

     Reveals Jonathan's headless corpse.

     Philipse can't look.  Ichabod takes strange spectacles from
     his satchel; wire-framed with many lenses.  MAGNIFICATION
     SPECTACLES.  He examines the gross neck wound, sniffs it.

     He pokes the flesh and severed spinal cord.

                             ICHABOD 
               No bleeding.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               What is that?

                             ICHABOD 
               This should have bled by the pint.
               Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh.
               How... ?  Whatever weapon was used...
               it cauterized somehow....

     Ichabod straightens, eyes weirdly big in the spectacles.

                             ICHABOD 
               It instantly burnt the wound shut.


     EXT.  CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAY

     A coffin in a grave.  Headstone reads "MASBATH, 1799."  A
     CROWD gathered.  Young Masbath broods.  Clergyman Steenwyck
     steps forward to take a handful of newly dug dirt.

     Men with guns stand at the outskirts, like on guard.

     Steenwyck sprinkles dirt into the grave with prayerful words.
     In the crowd people whisper.  They steal glances at Ichabod,
     who stands with the Van Tassels.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING/VARIOUS ROOMS -- DAY

     Dining room.  Sarah and two other servants collect plates.  A
     few people still sup, including Van Ripper, his warty WIFE
     and two kids.  Van Ripper guzzles ale, laughs at something
     his also-drunk wife says.

     IN the HALL and FOYER, funeral goers socialize quietly.

     FURTHER ON, in the SITTING ROOM, men smoke.  Young Masbath
     is confronting Ichabod, who is leaving...

                             ICHABOD 
               I am not here for revenge.  I am
               here to bring justice.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Whatever.  You still need a second
               to tend to your things.

                             ICHABOD 
               I manage fine alone.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               I deserve to help you.  Don't you see
               how much this means?  My father...
               he... he was a good man...

                             ICHABOD
                     (faces Masbath) 
               Young Masbath, I am sorry for your
               loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy.
               However... I cannot be the one to
               look after you now.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
                     (angry) 
               I did not ask you to, did I?

     Young Masbath exits.  Ichabod remains impassive.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- DAY

     Ichabod comes out.  KILLIAN, a dashingly rustic man, carries
     his son, THOMAS, 5, and chats with Baltus.  Doctor Lancaster
     peers off at something through a SPYGLASS.

                             BALTUS 
               Hail, Constable.  How are you?

                             ICHABOD 
               Well enough.  Your gathering does
               honor to the deceased.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
                     (still using spyglass) 
               We must be a curious sight to him.

                             ICHABOD 
               What are you spying on?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
                     (offers the spyglass)
               The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at
               civilization from time to time.

     ICHABOD'S POINT OF VIEW -- THROUGH SPYGLASS

     Searching a line of trees and foliage far away...

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER (o.s.)
               Do you see the Redskinned bastard?

     There he is -- the LENAPE.  A towering savage with misshapen
     features covered in tumors.  He ducks away.

     BACK TO SCENE ON PORCH

     Ichabod lowers the spyglass, a little awed.

                             ICHABOD 
               He is a behemoth.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               A diseased monster.

                             BALTUS 
               If you gentlemen will excuse the
               doctor and I... we have financial
               matters to discuss.

     Ichabod and Killian nod as Baltus and Lancaster head in.

                             KILLIAN 
               Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have
               time alone.  You've been told plenty
               about the Horseman, I'm certain.

                             ICHABOD 
               More than enough, actually. 
                     (tired laugh) 
               I beg you, no more, please.

                             KILLIAN 
               No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say
               you just laid eyes on our murderer
               through that glass.

     Ichabod ponders, folding the spyglass.

                             ICHABOD 
               Tell me something. 
                     (pause) 
               What becomes of Young Masbath?

                             KILLIAN 
               Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take
               him.  They have children and a good
               home and good land.

     Ichabod nods.  He turns to look THROUGH THE WINDOW.  In the
     DINING ROOM, Van Ripper rises, ill.  His wife questions his
     health, but he holds her off and vomits.

     Ichabod notes this with a deep sigh.


     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ORCHARD -- EARLY EVENING

     Ocher dusk.  Ichabod rides to Young Masbath, seated on the
     ground, miserable.  Young Masbath does not look up.

                             ICHABOD 
               Find yourself a place in the servants'
               residence and wake me before dawn.
               Our first task will be an unsavory one.

     Ichabod rides.  Young Masbath runs to his horse and follows.


     EXT. CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAWN

     Steenwyck is on horseback, looking down at Ichabod, furious.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               It is sacrilege!

                             ICHABOD 
               I cannot proceed without examining
               the previous victims.

     Steenwyck looks to men with shovels.  Killian's there.
     Philipse, hung-over, stands beside Young Masbath.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               Magistrate Philipse, surely you can
               stop this.

     Philipse just looks up with a helpless expression.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               I will not allow it.  I will not!

                             ICHABOD 
               Protest to my superiors if you like.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               Your superiors are two days away!

                             ICHABOD 
               Then, you should have left two days
               ago, because I have men willing to
               help me today.

     Ichabod motions.  Killian leads the men to the graveyard.
     Steenwyck watches, enraged.  He kicks his horse and rides.
     Philipse looks worried.

     EXT.  CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- LATER MORNING (TIME CUT)

     A PSALM is HEARD READ by STEENWYCK O.S. while a coffin is
     exhumed.  Ichabod guides the lifting.  The coffin is put near
     the headstone "WINDSOR."  Ichabod looks...

     At the church, Steenwyck faces about fifty people who now
     take up the PRAYER.

     Across the cemetery, two coffins, one small, one large, are
     pried open.  "VAN GARRETT, 1799."  Killian leads the effort
     with Young Masbath's aid...

     The lids come off, revealing the HEADLESS BODIES of a MAN and
     a little BOY.  Young Masbath backs away.

     At the "WINDSOR" coffin, nails creak as Ichabod opens the
     lid.  WE DO NOT SEE inside, but when Ichabod does, he is
     aghast.  He looks to the men, angry.

                             ICHABOD
               Why was I not told of this?

     No answer.  Killian arrives, nods solemnly.

                             KILLIAN 
               The Widow Windsor.

                             ICHABOD 
               Is that all you say?  Look at her.

                             KILLIAN 
               It's not something people speak of
               openly.  She did not remarry.

     Ichabod kneels, studying.  Now, WE SEE: the belly of the
     headless corpse is bulbous, because the Widow Windsor was
     very far along in a pregnancy.

     Ichabod notices: a tear in the cloth of widow's blouse.  He
     reaches through the tear, feeling the stomach.

     He straightens, greatly troubled.


     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- MORNING

     Scissors cut open the widow's blouse.  There's an inch-long
     WOUND on the moldering belly; a sword puncture.

     Ichabod examines the corpse on a table.  Lancaster watches,
     anxiously mopping his face.  Young Masbath's in a corner.
     Ichabod goes to write in his ledger full of notes.

                             ICHABOD 
               What is the common thread between
               these victims?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               I'm sure I don't know.

                             ICHABOD 
               We must discover it.  The reason the
               murderer chose these persons.

     Ichabod goes to look at the widow's corpse, pondering.

                             ICHABOD 
               The wounds are the same.  Cauterized.
               No chopping or half-measures either.
               One stroke took the head.  Have you
               seen, doctor... ?
                     (pointing to it) 
               Even the spinal bone... sliced as
               smooth as butter.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               I do not care.  You are welcome to
               use my work area, but I beg you...
               return her to her resting place.

                             ICHABOD 
               In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.

     Ichabod picks up an iron knife.  He looks to Young Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               You should step outside.


     EXT.  CHURCHYARD CEMETERY -- EARLY EVENING

     Ichabod and others restore graves.  Ichabod looks to the
     church, where Clergyman Steenwyck stands in the door.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane.
               The Lord will not forgive your sins.

     Steenwyck shuts the creaky doors.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod sleeps, dreaming...

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FARMLAND -- DAY

     A young BOY, 10, stands in a wheat field with his back to us.
     A FEMALE VOICE is HEARD FAINTLY, getting LOUDER.

                             FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
               Ichabod!  Ichabod... come along.

     The boy, YOUNG ICHABOD, turns, smiling.  He runs.  We FOLLOW
     to a clearing behind a frontier home.  MOTHER waits.  Lovely
     woman.  She kisses him.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Dark.  Young Ichabod, in bed, has one eye open.  Across the
     room, Mother has her back to him.  She's WHISPERING something
     to no one.  She turns...

     Young Ichabod pretends he is asleep.

     A DRAWER is HEARD SHUTTING.  Mother exits.  Ichabod gets up,
     curious, opens a drawer... finds something behind clothing.

     It's a piece of reed grass, woven into an elaborate pattern
     with shafts of wheat twisted into the center.  Young Ichabod
     replaces it, closes the drawer.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- MARKET SQUARE -- DAY

     A busy, muddy street lined by wares and produce.  Young
     Ichabod walks with FATHER, an emotionless man.  Father stops
     to examine tools.  Young Ichabod stays by him, but something
     captures his attention...

     Across the way, Mother is involved in a argument with a
     FREAKISH-LOOKING WOMAN.  They shout.  People stop to watch.
     Can't make out words, but Freakish Woman is furious.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- STORM SKY -- NIGHT

     LIGHTNING flashes over tree tops.  THUNDER BOOMS.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod jerks awake in his bed.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Ichabod enters with a lantern and his ledger.  He sits,
     studies notes, then notices there's a light down the hall.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Opposite an elaborate loom, Katrina reads by candlelight.
     She looks up, seeing Ichabod enter.

                             ICHABOD 
               Sorry for disturbing you.  I thought
               a forgotten candle was burning.

     Katrina self-consciously closes her shabby book, puts it with
     another on her lap and covers them.

                             KATRINA 
               You do not disturb me.  Please stay.
               Having trouble sleeping?

                             ICHABOD 
               May I ask... why do you cover your
               book that way?

                             KATRINA 
               You pay great attention to small
               things.  I hide these as I hide all
               my books.  Father would not approve,
               lest it were the Bible.

                             ICHABOD 
               I, um... I have something to show you,
               if you have a moment.

     Ichabod sits, looking through his ledger.

                             KATRINA
               These are strange... may I?

     She takes his hand, spreads the fingers to the palm.  She
     touches the many evenly spaced scars.

                             KATRINA 
               These scars.  How did you get them?

                             ICHABOD 
               I have had them since childhood.  I
               cannot remember what from.

                             KATRINA 
               It would be interesting to find out.

     Their eyes meet.  Ichabod gets back to the ledger.  Katrina
     seems to relish the effect she has.  Ichabod finds a paper
     disk on string, illustrated thusly:

                             ICHABOD 
               Here it is.  A bird on one side.
               His cage on the other.  Now,
               stare at it. 
                     (spinning it) 
               The bird seems to be in his cage.

                             KATRINA 
               Yes, he does.  May I try?

     Ichabod gives it.  She spins it, smiling.

                             ICHABOD 
               He only appears to be inside the
               cage.  The point being...

                             KATRINA
               You made this, and the drawings?

                             ICHABOD 
               Yes, but listen.  The illusion is
               easily explained.  The eye retains
               each image, till they combine.  And
               yet, some would call this toy magic.

                             KATRINA 
               Don't you see why?  Look closely a
               moment.  Put your intellect aside. 
                     (spinning it) 
               Can't you see what is inexplicable?

     Ichabod watches it spin.  He shakes his head, unimpressed.

                             KATRINA 
               Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep
               it at least?

                             ICHABOD
               If you want.  But...

                             KATRINA 
               Then, I also have a gift for you.
               True magic which even you will not
               be able to deny.

     She hands him a book.  "ROMEO AND JULIET."  Ichabod stands,
     offering it back, but she will not take it.

                             ICHABOD 
               Thank you.  No.  Here...

                             KATRINA 
               I insist that you have it.

                             ICHABOD
                     (resigned, leaving) 
               Very well.  But, it will only sit
               gathering dust.

                             KATRINA 
               That would be a pity.  Those words
               might show you something you've never
               seen before.

     Ichabod stops at the door, looks back.  He exits.


     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     A light glows in Ichabod's window.  LOOKING IN: Ichabod's in
     bed, fully dressed.  He sits up.  Pause.  He crosses to pick
     up "Romeo and Juliet."  He begins to read.


     EXT.  PHILIPSE'S FARM -- DUSK

     Ichabod walks with Philipse.  Young Masbath follows with the
     horses.  CICADAS CHATTER from a vast corn field.

                             PHILIPSE 
               Not more than a year ago, a mob hung
               a man for stealing a horse.  For
               stealing a horse!  And, you dig up
               our dead.

                             ICHABOD 
               Are you saying I should be frightened?
               Is this a message passed on from
               Clergyman Steenwyck?

     The CICADAS SUDDENLY go SILENT.  Young Masbath notices.

                             PHILIPSE 
               We are farmers here, not lawyers or
               bankers, or even constables.  Every
               penny we earn comes from what we
               send down the Hudson.

                             ICHABOD 
               I know it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Um.... excuse me, sirs...

                             PHILIPSE
                     (still to Ichabod) 
               Because of the Horseman, our migrant
               workers flee for their lives.  There
               is a danger that our crops will rot.
               So, if you are going to help us, you
               stop the Horseman.  That is your
               task... to kill an undead thing.

     Young Masbath looks to a fenced grazing area, worried.  The
     sheep there are agitated, all running one direction away.

                             ICHABOD
               Listen to what you say....

                             PHILIPSE 
               No, you listen!  You may think we are
               a pack of superstitious dullards...

                             ICHABOD 
               At times I do.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Sirs... please!

                             PHILIPSE 
               What will it take for you to realize
               this is no laughing matter?

     The horses go crazy, braying and rearing.  The reins yank
     Young Masbath off his feet as the horses flee.

     Ichabod and Philipse look to Masbath.  A SOUND is HEARD,
     distant: THUNDERING HOOFBEATS.  Wind kicks up.  HOOFBEATS
     seem to come FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.

     Philipse looks to the corn field.  A flock of birds alights;
     a great sheet of black against the sky.

                             PHILIPSE
               Oh my... oh my oh my oh my...

     Philipse runs towards his house, past Masbath.  HOOFBEATS are
     LOUDER, CLOSER.  Ichabod faces the corn field.

     The field explodes open, stalks bending to make way as the
     Headless Horseman gallops into view atop Daredevil.

     Young Masbath runs, following Philipse.

     Ichabod's stunned.  He looks down to draw his flintlock
     pistol, but the Horseman blows by before he can raise it.  A
     blast of air knocks Ichabod off his feet.

     The Horseman chases Masbath and Philipse.

     Ichabod follows.

     The Horseman draws his sword.

     Young Masbath falls in the grass...

     Daredevil's pounding hooves will certainly crush him.

     Daredevil leaps over Young Masbath, continuing the charge.

     Philipse has a long way to go before home.  He looks over his
     shoulder.  No way he'll make it.

     Ichabod, running, watches Philipse slow.

     Philipse gathers all his courage and stops, turning.  The
     Horseman is closing, sword held high.

     Philipse raises his talisman.

                             ICHABOD 
               Philipse!

     Philipse holds the talisman up, trying to be fearless.  The
     Horseman swings -- WE HEAR the CLANK of sword on talisman...

     Philipse's severed head spins.  His body falls and folds.

     Ichabod runs past Young Masbath.

     The Horseman halts just as Ichabod reaches a point in front
     of dead Philipse, aiming his pistol.  Daredevil lets out a
     SCREECHY CRY.  The Horseman rides toward Ichabod.

     Ichabod gets on one knee, trying to steady his pistol.  The
     Horseman closes.  Ichabod sweats bullets.  FIRES...

     The slug SLAMS the Horseman dead center -- bursts through and
     rends his uniform without slowing him.

     The Horseman is almost on Ichabod.  Ichabod cringes, arms
     up... as the Horseman passes.

     The Horseman leans to skewer Philipse's head with his sword.

     With the head as his prize, the Horseman races away.

     Ichabod gets up, watches the Horseman head to the forest.
     Ichabod looks to Young Masbath, finds his legs will not
     support him, falls, trembling.  THUNDER BELLOWS.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT

     Lady Van Tassel comes to a door, knocks.  Sarah stands behind
     with a tray of food.  Young Masbath is seated near.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
                     (to Young Masbath)
               Has he not come out at all?

     Young Masbath shakes his head.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     KNOCKING is HEARD.  Ichabod sleeps restlessly.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     THUNDER BOOMS.  WIND and POUNDING RAIN blast open a window.
     Mother comes to it, then moves to comfort fearful Young
     Ichabod in bed.

                             MOTHER'S VOICE (v.o.)
               Don't be afraid... don't be afraid.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY

     A keyhole.  Young Ichabod's eye peers in...

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- P.O.V. THROUGH KEYHOLE

     Mother is kneeled before flour on the floor.  She draws
     patterns in it, whispering.  She blows the flour away.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY

     The Freakish Woman (who argued with Mother) walks towards the
     home, supported by a SAD MAN.  She weeps, carrying something
     in a blanket.

     Young Ichabod comes a window, watching, scared.

     The Freakish Woman is so weak that she falls.  The blanket
     opens... the corpse of an infant tumbles to the dirt.  The
     Freakish Woman's WAILING GROWS LOUDER.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FRONT OF YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT

     TWO MEN in black drag Mother to a coach.  She looks back,
     fearful, pulled along.  A THIRD MAN in black follows.

     Young Ichabod struggles as Father restrains him.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               No... mother... no... !

     The Third Man peers back, a gray-haired, Cotton Mather-ish
     man with a villainous face.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)
               The night of the great storm, I saw
               her cross my windows.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY

     Many people in the gallery.  The Third Man stands in front of
     the tearful Freakish Woman in the witness box.

                             THIRD MAN
               You are certain it was she?

                             FREAKISH WOMAN
               In the lighting, I did see her.
                     (points)
               Her.  Lady Crane...

     Mother sits in shackles.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN
               I will never forget.  The next moment,
               I found my infant dead... with the
               blood welt on his breast.

     Those in attendance cry out at this.  Ichabod is seated
     beside Father, eyes filled with tears.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     As before, a STORM RAGES.  Ichabod is in Mother's arms.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)
               The night of the great storm, I saw
               her cross my windows.

                             MOTHER
               Don't be afraid...

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- DAY

     KNOCKING is HEARD.  Ichabod gasps awake.

                             KATRINA (o.s.)
               Constable Crane?

     Ichabod looks at his hands balled into fists.  He opens them
     -- has ONE HALF of PHILIPSE'S TALISMAN in each palm.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Katrina holds a tray of food.  The DOOR is HEARD UNLOCKING.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Katrina enters.  Ichabod sits at his work table.

                             KATRINA
               Are you hungry?

     Ichabod shakes his head, won't look up.  Katrina crosses.

     She begins picking up pieces of the PLASTER HOOFPRINT CAST
     which lies shattered on the floor.

                             KATRINA
               You promised justice.

                             ICHABOD
               If these are the random stalkings of
               a monster, what good am I?

                             KATRINA
               People have put their trust in you.

                             ICHABOD 
               They have done nothing of the sort.

                             KATRINA
               Won't they still have that justice?
                     (patience waning)
               Or, was it a vain promise?

     Ichabod stews, head in his hands.  Someone is HEARD
     RUNNING... Young Masbath enters, frightened.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Constable Crane... something has
               happened.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     The Lenape Indian hangs dead in a tree, lynched.  TOWNSFOLK
     are gathered.  Ichabod makes his way through, followed by
     Young Masbath, looking up.

                             BROM (o.s.)
               We do not need you, Constable...

     Brom strides towards Ichabod from a group of men spreading a
     sheet under the tree.  Van Ripper's there.

                             BROM
               The men who did this have been taken.
               We do not need you here.

     Brom points to where TWO FILTHY MEN in chains sit in a
     horse-drawn cart.  An armed man guards them.

                             ONE FILTHY MAN 
               You should thank us.  The killings
               will end.  We saved you all!

     The armed man shoves the filthy man to shut him up.

                             BROM 
               They spend two days in chains.

                             ICHABOD 
               Two days... ?  For murder?

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               For poaching.  Or, would you remake
               our laws now that Magistrate Philipse
               has given up the ghost?

                             ICHABOD 
               Does that look like an animal hanging?

                             BROM 
               Looks like an Indian.

     Van Ripper cuts the noose rope at the trunk.  The Lenape
     corpse free falls, landing hard.

     The Lenape lies in a heap on the sheet.  Van Ripper and
     others come to lift the sheet with the Lenape in the middle.
     Ichabod watches, noticing...

     The Lenape wears a WOVEN PIECE of REED GRASS a cord on his
     loin cloth, twisted in a pattern.

                             ICHABOD 
               Wait.  Give me a moment...

     Ichabod kneels.  He removes the woven piece, looking across
     the diseased Lenape's body.  Something else...

     The Lenape's mouth is agape; teeth rotting.  Ichabod looks
     around, finds a twig.  He uses it to pull the Lenape's mouth
     open... gets close to peer inside the Lenape's mouth.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY

     A DRAWING of the Lenape's WOVEN PIECE in Ichabod's ledger.
     The piece lies near.

     Ichabod sits staring at it, trance-like.  Masbath waits.
     Long silence.

                             ICHABOD
               The Lenape Indian had much to tell
               once I opened his mouth.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               How could he?

                             ICHABOD
               His teeth.  Someone had cut them and
               chipped off rotten pieces far back
               in his mouth.  The Lenape could not
               have done that for himself.
                     (closes his journal)
               Someone out there cared for him.

     Ichabod rises, deciding.  He picks up his satchel and exits.
     Young Masbath is surprised.  He follows.


     EXT.  WINDMILL -- DAY

     A massive, wooden WINDMILL, raised off the ground on a 7'
     center post.  Ichabod and Masbath walk to it.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath enter via a ladder from the
     underbelly.  Gears and counter wheels turn millstones.  A few
     men work in the grain powder filled air.

     Ichabod leads the way to a staircase, up twists and turns.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Where are we going?

                             ICHABOD 
               Up.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath climb out a door to the roof.  The
     rotors spin nearby.  Ichabod searches the countryside.

     Below, MANY MEN are ride up the long straight road.

                             ICHABOD 
               What is it?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               It's payment day.  Loan monies are
               given to Baltus the last day each
               month.  Almost everyone borrows...
               for tools or to hire workers.

     Ichabod sits, takes a bowl from his bag and gives it to
     Masbath, then produces a bottle of water... fills the bowl.

                             ICHABOD
                     (points) 
               Out there.  What do you see?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               The Western Woods.

                             ICHABOD 
               Look again.

     A plume of smoke rises from woods, far.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Smoke.  Chimney smoke.

     Ichabod holds a piece of straw in his mouth, rubs the point
     of a sewing needle against a small BLACK ROCK.

                             ICHABOD 
               Are you familiar with magnets?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What kind of nuts?

                             ICHABOD 
               Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch
               here.

     Ichabod shows the magnet grab the needle.  Young Masbath is
     amazed, reaching for it.  Ichabod watches him play with it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               It's spectacular.

                             ICHABOD
                     (smiles, pause) 
               Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               No, I couldn't...

                             ICHABOD 
               I have others.  All I need is this.

     Ichabod takes the needle, poking its butt end into the tip of
     the straw.  Young Masbath studies the rock, pockets it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Thank you.

                             ICHABOD
                     (nods, almost shy) 
               Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to
               business.

     Young Masbath lifts the bowl.  Ichabod drops in the
     needle/straw which floats and turns compass-like.

                             ICHABOD 
               If the Western Woods are truly the
               Devil's Glen, we will see for
               ourselves.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
                     (uneasy) 
               Father said witches live there.

                             ICHABOD 
               Witches do not exist.  However...

     Ichabod uses a knife to notch the bowl lip where the needle
     points, then surveys the smoke, making a second notch.

                             ICHABOD 
               Not long ago, I would have said the
               same for Headless Horseman.

                             KATRINA (o.s.)
               Constable... !

     Katrina's on horseback below, unhappy.

                             KATRINA 
               I need to speak with you.  Alone.


     EXT.  VAN TASSEL GREAT LAWN -- DAY

     Ichabod and Katrina lead their horses.  A heated argument.

                             KATRINA
               Why would you do such a thing?

                             ICHABOD 
               No stone may be left unturned.  It
               may appear harsh...

                             KATRINA 
               I have misjudged you I think.  I did
               not imagine you were so cruel.

                             ICHABOD 
               You are not regarding it in full.
               The Widow Windsor had been run
               through by a sword.  I followed the
               bloodless wound, a wound whose path
               I could not comprehend till I had
               seen the Horseman with my own eyes.

                             KATRINA 
               What are you on about?

                             ICHABOD 
               The child she carried was eight
               months grown at least... near to
               birthing.  The sword had pierced its
               tiny heart exactly.

                             KATRINA 
               Must I hear this?

                             ICHABOD 
               There was no blind stabbing.  This
               singular thrust found its target
               omnipotently, as if the Horseman made
               certain the unborn child died with
               its mother.

                             KATRINA 
               And this gives worth to butchery?

                             ICHABOD 
               It was not butchery.

                             KATRINA 
               What is it then?  Scientific method?
               How can any of this matter in the
               slightest?

                             ICHABOD 
               I have no solution for its meaning
               yet, but I could not just ignore it.

                             KATRINA 
               Take a lesson from Young Masbath's
               desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows
               with you to avenge his father's death.
               That I understand.  But, what do you
               want?

                             ICHABOD 
               To avenge his father, and the others.

                             KATRINA 
               But, why?  Tell me why.

     Ichabod struggles for a reply.

                             KATRINA 
               You falter with your answer because
               you strive without putting the whole
               of your heart into it.  Can't you see?
               You'll bring dignity to the dead even
               if you have to chop them into little
               pieces to do it.

                             ICHABOD
                     (fed up, growing anger) 
               If it had been surgery on a living
               person, done to save that person's
               life, you would not question it.  Not
               for a moment.  So, let me be the first
               to tell you, dear girl... on the other
               side of these sheltering mountains, a
               whole world has advanced beyond such
               plebeian thinking as yours.  And
               someday, no matter how much you fear
               it, that world will come to roust
               Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.

     Katrina storms away.  Ichabod's already regretting.


     EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath ride to the Western Woods, horses
     loaded for expedition.  At the Belltower remnants, Ichabod
     slows, looking to the wreckage.

     At forest's edge, Young Masbath waits.

     Ichabod circles the tower.  With a sigh, he rides to join
     Young Masbath. They head into the woods.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     Dark, dense and creepy.  Ichabod and Young Masbath move
     through.  Young Masbath halts his horse and looks around.

                             ICHABOD 
               What is it?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Listen.

                             ICHABOD
                     (listens, looks)
               I hear nothing.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               No crickets or cicadas calling.  No
               bird songs.

     Stark quiet.  Ichabod notes this unhappily.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- LATER DAY

     Ichabod's hand drops the needle/straw in the water bowl.  The
     needle spins.  The bowl is turned to match notches.

     Ichabod points the way to Young Masbath.

     ELSEWHERE, SOMEONE WATCHES:  A MOVING P.O.V. WATCHES them as
     they ride, FOLLOWS.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- LATER DAY

     Ichabod and Masbath reach a hill crest.  They stop, uneasy.
     Below: a CAVE with a rock archway.  An ill-fitting door
     covers the mouth.  The chimney spews smoke.

                             ICHABOD
               We have apparently arrived.

     EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     The horses are tied to a tree.  Ichabod walks to the cave
     door.  Unsure, he hesitantly knocks.

     INT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath step in.

     Walls are hung with skins and skeletons, dry flowers and reed
     grass in patterns.  An OLD CRONE sits facing away.

     The old Crone, a mountain woman with matted hair and grey
     features, sits disinterested.  Ichabod edges closer.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon.  You did not answer when I
               knocked.  Are we intruding?

                             OLD CRONE
               You are from the Hollow?

                             ICHABOD
               In a way, yes.

     Ichabod looks at tables of gourd bowls of dead insects and
     acorns.  Knifes, scissors, yellow bones.  He takes the
     Lenape's piece of reed grass from his pocket.

                             ICHABOD
               The Lenape who lived in these woods...
               do you know him?  The Redman?
                     (uncomfortable wait)
               I should tell you... he has been
               murdered.

                             OLD CRONE
               Leave me.  You are not welcome here.

     The old Crone places something on a table beside her -- a
     dead cardinal, bright red.

     Ichabod is afraid, backing away, but Young Masbath takes the
     woven piece and steps to the Crone.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Were you a friend to the Indian?
                     (waits)
               You should have this... if you were
               his friend.

     Young Masbath puts the woven piece beside the cardinal.  He
     walks to join Ichabod in leaving.

                             OLD CRONE
               You seek remedy against the Horseman?

     The Old Crone reaches to pick up the weaving.  She stands,
     faces them.  Tall.  Ichabod nods.

                             OLD CRONE
                     (to Young Masbath)
               Go out and keep away, child.
                     (to Ichabod)
               You stay.  Follow with me.

     The Old Crone takes a candle and walks, deep into the cave.

     INT.  CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY

     The Old Crone comes through a passage in the wet walls.
     Ichabod enters, scared, bent under low ceiling.

                             OLD CRONE
               I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow
               and back.

                             ICHABOD
               The Horseman.  Yes.

                             OLD CRONE
               Sit.

     Ichabod sits on crooked stool.  The old Crone kneels with her
     back to him, gathers straw in a pile on the floor.

                             ICHABOD 
               Can you help?

                             OLD CRONE 
               You want to see into the nether world...
               I can show you.  Whatever you see, do
               not move or speak.  I will hold him.

     She gathers bowls, putting grass and powder on the pile.

                             ICHABOD
               What... what are you doing?

                             OLD CRONE
                     (turns, furious) 
               Close your mouth!  Keep silent.

     She takes two jars from a table, pours ashes on the pile from
     one.  She shakes the other roughly, takes the lid off and
     upends it.  A baby bat squirms on the floor, dazed.

     The Old Crone holds the bat, using a knife to cut off its
     head.  She soaks the straw with blood, SPEAKING IN TONGUES,
     guttural.  Using a wick, she lights the straw.

     She grasps two METAL CUFFS with chains attached, slides these
     onto her bony wrists, then bends to inhale smoke.

                             OLD CRONE 
               He comes now.

     Ichabod would like to leave now.

     EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     Young Masbath, waiting by the horses, looks up.  Through the
     trees, black clouds billow and block the sun.

     INT.  CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY

     The old Crone slumps, still with her back to Ichabod.  She
     does not move.  Wind howls through a hole/window.  Rain.

     Candles blow out.  Ichabod stands, worried.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me... um...

     She remains motionless.  The STORM outside intensifies.

     WE SEE the skin of the Crone's wrists transform; swelling in
     the cuffs, hardening, cracking and bleeding.

     Some thing Ichabod cannot see.  He inches closer.

                             ICHABOD 
               Are you alright... ?

     The Crone turns, hideous, leaping erect -- a half-human,
     half-demon CREATURE.  Its black clawed hands reaching.

     Ichabod recoils, crying out.

     Chains on restraining cuffs yank the creature back.

     Ichabod hits the floor, knocking over a table of bones.  The
     creature is chained, but still wants Ichabod.  It SCREECHES.

     The Old Crone's face seethes from transformation, eyes blood
     red, nostrils dripping, teeth now jagged.

                             CREATURE/OLD CRONE 
               You seek the warrior bathed in
               blood... the Headless Horseman.

     Ichabod slides back as far as possible while the creature
     claws the rock floor, yearning.

                             CREATURE/OLD CRONE 
               Follow the Indian trail to where the
               sun dies.  Follow to the tree of the
               dead.

     The creature pulls, testing the chains.  Behind, the BOLT
     holding the chains to the wall slips.  The wall cracks.

                             CREATURE/OLD CRONE 
               Climb down to the Horseman's soulless
               place and let loose his silent
               shrieking.  Do you hear?  Do you hear?!

     Ichabod nods, quaking, aghast.  He glances to the exit.

     The chain bolt gives more... coming loose...

                             CREATURE/OLD CRONE 
               He who holds fast the Horseman's
               desire will guide his reaping hand.
               Catch hold of his desire.

     Ichabod bolts for the door.  The creature HOWLS, leaping...

     The chain bolt breaks...

     Ichabod cries out, tackled to the floor...

     It is the Old Crone who landed on him.  She has returned to
     human form, semi-conscious.  Ichabod shoves her off.

     EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     Ichabod runs out into the howling storm, past Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               We are leaving.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What happened?

     Ichabod scrambles onto Gunpowder, heading further into the
     woods, glancing back.  Young Masbath follows.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- EARLY EVENING

     No rain.  Dark.  A lantern's glow creates shifting shadows as
     Ichabod and Young Masbath ride.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Follow the Indian trail to where the
               sun dies.  To the tree of the dead. 
                     (looking back) 
               Maybe we passed it by.

                             ICHABOD 
               How could something named "the tree
               of the dead" fail to draw attention?

     A BIRD CRIES OUT.  Ichabod's startled, looking up.  The BIRD
     is HEARD ALIGHTING.  Leaves float downwards.

                             ICHABOD 
               We should not go much further in
               this murk.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Should we go back?

                             ICHABOD 
               We are far from the Hollow. 
                     (dismounts, troubled) 
               Loath to say it... better to get our
               backs against a tree and stay till
               morning.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS (TIME CUT) -- NIGHT

     Horses are tied.  Ichabod is seated against a tree.  A
     campfire burns.  Young Masbath lies on a blanket, rifle cross
     his chest, staring to treetops.

     Leaves and branches shift in the wind.  Bats fly wildly.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What does it mean... climb down to
               the Horseman's soulless place?

                             ICHABOD 
               "Let loose his silent shrieking."
               Who knows, till we work at it?  I
               admit not being anxious to find out.
                     (pause) 
               "He who holds the Horseman's desire
               will guide his reaping hand."
               Whatever the Horseman's desire is,
               other than extinguishing lives.

     A SNAPPING BRANCH.  Ichabod raises his pistol.

                             ICHABOD
                     (to Young Masbath) 
               Do not move.

     Ichabod rises.  He creeps forward, pistol and lantern
     forward.  Foliage is thick.  CRUNCHING LEAVES are HEARD.

     Ichabod crouches, puts down the lantern and picks up a
     branch.  He tosses the branch to the foliage...

     SOME ANIMAL darts away, a running blur.

     Ichabod rises, following with his pistol.

     ANOTHER ANGLE, MOVING P.O.V.: low to the ground,
     moving swiftly at Ichabod...

     Ichabod spins, blindsided.

     Young Masbath fires his rifle -- CRACK!!

     The ANIMAL is KNOCKED DOWN mid-leap, yelping...

     The beast lands, a mass of grey fur.

     Ichabod comes to stare down.  Young Masbath arrives.  They
     both look to the beast, horrified.

     The creature lies helplessly spastic; a TWO-HEADED WOLF, with
     one head blown open to brain and gore.  Its living head
     lifts, MEWING sadly, eyes pleading.

     Ichabod step up with pistol.  FIRES.  MEWING STOPS.

                             ICHABOD
               What God-forsaken hell is this?

     Ichabod swallows back sickness, looking away.  Something
     catches his eye.

                             ICHABOD
               Christ...

     Through the forest: the SKY'S LIT UP.  Distant fire.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, CAVE HOME -- EARLY EVENING

     Ichabod and Masbath ride up, confronted by the Crone's cave
     vomiting flame out all orifices.

     Ichabod approaches.  Embers swirl everywhere.  The Old
     Crone's body lies amongst bloodied leaves.  Headless.


     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

     Much commotion.  A MOB in front of the home marked
     "LANCASTER, PHYSICIAN."  Steenwyck addresses the rabble.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               You all stand idle, while this man
               goes about with a book of secrets and
               a bag filled with magic.  You all
               stand idle, while the shadow of the
               Devil falls over our town.

     Baltus, Lady Van Tassel and Katrina watch at safe distance.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               I say, if you do nothing, you share
               in the blasphemy of Ichabod Crane!

     Killian, on horseback beside his wife, BETH, and son, Thomas,
     rides to one side of the shouting crowd.

                             KILLIAN 
               Listen to me!  Do you want to save
               your crops?  Or would you rather see
               your farms go to ruin?

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               How is he saving our farms?  How?
               Ichabod Crane has brought into our
               midst the soulless, moldering corpse
               of a heretic!

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod examines the Crone's neck wound with magnification
     spectacles.  Young Masbath is seated, ledger in his lap.

                             ICHABOD
               The wound is neither smooth nor
               cauterized, but jagged.  She bleeds
               like a fountain.

     Ichabod lifts her dead hand to show bruises and cuts.

                             ICHABOD
               She did not go quietly.

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT

     Doctor Lancaster wrings his hands.  His WIFE rocks nervously
     in a rocking chair.  The CROWD outside ROARS as a bonfire
     lights up the curtained windows.

     The front door is POUNDED open.  ANGRY MEN enter.  Lancaster
     stands, lips quivering.  He points insistently to a door.

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Angry men break in.  Ichabod looks up.

                             ANGRY MAN
               Step aside, Constable.  Step aside...

     Ichabod is shoved aside, spectacles knocked off.

     The group grasps the Crone.  Masbath stands on his chair,
     clutching the ledger.  Ichabod grabs one man.

                             ICHABOD
               What are you doing?

     The man slams Ichabod back.

     Magnification spectacles are crushed under foot.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

     Angry men carry the corpse to a raging bonfire.  The mob
     makes way.  Steenwyck cheers them.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               Let her burn!  Let her burn!

     Ichabod comes out, followed by Young Masbath.  The Crone's
     corpse is thrown in the fire.  Cheers all around.

     At Ichabod's side, a man tries to grab the ledger Young
     Masbath holds.  Young Masbath cries out, hanging on to the
     book.  Ichabod joins the struggle.

     Katrina watches, emotions conflicting.

     Other men grab Ichabod.  One punches Ichabod in the face.

     Katrina rides forward as Baltus calls for her to stop.

     Katrina leaps down, into the crowd, pulls men off Ichabod.

                             KATRINA
               Stop this!  Leave them alone!

     A SHOT RINGS OUT.  Chaos halts.  Everyone turns, quieting.

     The men around Masbath and Ichabod turn to face Brom Bones.
     Brom holds a smoking pistol, flanked by Theodore and Glenn.

                             BROM 
               Let them go
                     (pointing) 
               Are you going to beat an orphaned
               child, imbecile?

     Masbath is released, along with the ledger.  Steenwyck moves
     forward, pushing people aside.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               Are you Ichabod Crane's protector,
               Brom Bones?

                             BROM 
               Only for the moment.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               You side with him in this?

                             BROM 
               No.  I agree he has only made matters
               worse.  But, that will change, if you
               listen.

     He trades with Theodore, pistol for a long rifle.  Brom hefts
     the rifle, taking a round slug from his pocket.

                             BROM 
               Theodore, Glenn and I offer to ride
               each day and night to watch over the
               Hollow.  We will stalk the border of
               the Western Woods and haunt the
               Horseman for a change, with rifles
               like this... and slugs like this...

     Brom brings the slug to his lips, blows.  It WHISTLES.

                             BROM 
               Hollowed out and filled with powder.

     Brom smiles at Katrina, who watches unimpressed.

                             BROM 
               Constable Crane is not the only one
               who fights with science on his side.

                             ICHABOD 
               I fired upon the Horseman and the
               bullet did nothing.

                             BROM 
               You must have missed your mark.

                             ICHABOD 
               I hit him square.

                             BROM
                     (to the crowd) 
               I say... if the Horseman is solid
               enough to take the lives of our
               people, he's solid enough to feel
               this...

     Brom aims the rifle at a BARREL down the road.  FIRES.

     PLUNK -- the barrel is hit -- EXPLODES.  Smoke wafts.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     In bed, Ichabod is having unpleasant dreams once more.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.) 
               The night of the great storm, I saw
               her cross my windows.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY

     Young Ichabod is seated beside Father, eyes tearful.  We are
     back in the court where Mother stands trial.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN 
               In the lightning, I did see her.
                     (points to Mother) 
               Her. Lady Crane... I will never
               forget it.  The next moment, I found
               my infant son was dead, with the
               blood welt on his breast.

     The evil Third Man turns to a jury of TWELVE MEN.

                             THIRD MAN 
               You have heard it.  The blood welt
               is the mark of Satan's touch.

     As the crowd murmurs in fear, Young Ichabod looks to Father,
     who sits with hands clenched, emotionless.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT

     In the quiet kitchen, Young Ichabod looks across the table.
     Father stares into his food.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               She was with me, father.

                             FATHER
               Nothing can be done against them.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               She was with me that night.

     Father doesn't even look up.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Empty church.  Young Ichabod carries a lantern past pews.  A
     soldier is seated near the altar with a rifle.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               May I see her?

     The soldier exits through a white door.  Young Ichabod waits,
     looking up at the vast church.  The white door opens and the
     Third Man steps out.

                             THIRD MAN
               Go home.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               May I see my mother?

                             THIRD MAN
               You do not want to be here.  Go home
               to your father.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               She did not do it... please listen...

                             THIRD MAN
               She is guilty.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               No, sir, please... she is innocent...

                             THIRD MAN
               She has confessed.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               No.

                             THIRD MAN 
               She has admitted to her evil and
               signed a written confession.  Do
               you know what confession is?
                     (off Ichabod's nod) 
               All that is left for you now is to
               pray for her soul.

     The Third Man leaves through the white door.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod buttons his shirt.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S YARD -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod comes out, looks to the lawn, not
     understanding.  Father loads a wagon full of belongings.

                             FATHER 
               We are leaving.
                     (long pause)
               She has gone away.

     Realization comes to Young Ichabod.  He runs, away across the
     lawn as Father calls after him.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FOREST TRAIL -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod runs, weeping.

                             THIRD MAN (v.o.) 
               She has confessed.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- MORNING

     Empty.  Doors are thrown open and Young Ichabod enters.  He
     goes down the aisle, towards the white door.

                             THIRD MAN (v.o.) 
               She has admitted to her evil and
               signed a written confession.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD 
               Mother.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH, BEYOND WHITE DOOR -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod enters, halting.  The room contains TORTURE
     DEVICES: iron cuffs, thumb screws, knifes and needles.

                             THIRD MAN (v.o.)
               Do you know what confession is?

     He walks, numb, eyes locked forward...

     In the corner is a SPIKED CHAIR, adorned with sharp iron
     spikes.  Hundreds of spikes.  It is fitted with straps for
     holding down the "accused."

     Tears stream down Young Ichabod's face.  He kneels, hands on
     the spikes of the chair, pressing hard.

     As he sobs, blood runs down from his hands.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     In bed, Ichabod opens tear filled eyes.  He sits up, bringing
     his trembling hands to wipe his cheeks.  His hands trail
     blood. He looks to them...

     The old scars are bleeding.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Katrina comes to the door.  Ichabod is seated by the fire,
     eyes bleary, palms wrapped with bloodied cloth.

                             KATRINA 
               Constable Crane?

     Katrina comes beside Ichabod's chair.

                             ICHABOD
               Allow me some time.  I have spent
               every hour in the company of others.
               I need to be alone.

                             KATRINA 
               What troubles you?

     She moves in front.  Ichabod gets up and crosses to sit
     facing away.  Katrina takes the chair he deserted.

                             KATRINA
               The things I said to you before...
               I was wrong to say them.

                             ICHABOD
               No, actually, you were not.  Every
               word you spoke had truth in it.

                             KATRINA 
               What has happened?

     Ichabod sits silent, puts his head back, eyes closed.

                             ICHABOD 
               Lady Van Tassel... she is your
               stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so
               little resemblance.

                             KATRINA 
               What?

                             ICHABOD 
               She is not your birth mother, is she?

                             KATRINA 
               No, but... why do you ask that?

                             ICHABOD 
               What happened to your mother?  Is she
               still alive?

                             KATRINA 
               She died.  Her lungs were diseased...
               two years ago.  What is this about?

                             ICHABOD 
               Memories have come back.  I had them
               forgotten, and wish I could forget
               them again... but they are here now. 
                     (pause) 
               Lord, how I hate this place.

                             KATRINA 
               If you want me to go, I will.  Do you
               want me to leave?

                             ICHABOD 
               I... I do not know.  I no longer know
               what I think or what I feel.

     Katrina walks to him.  She touches his back.

                             KATRINA 
               Why are you so afraid of that?  Is
               there truly such harm in uncertainty?

     She kneels, smiles a little for him.  She reaches to touch
     his face, holds his head in her hands.  Leans to kiss him.

     He rests his head against hers, weary, putting his arms
     around her.  They kiss passionately.


     EXT.  THE HOLLOW -- EARLY MORNING

     Dawn light, is visible over forests pounded by rain.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- MORNING

     Ichabod exits his room, satchel in hand.  He looks down the
     hall, then steps back in to take a white rose from a vase.

     AROUND A CORNER, Ichabod comes to the last door.  He bends,
     slipping the white rose under the crack of the door.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- MORNING

     Rain.  Ichabod comes out.  Across the lawn, Young Masbath is
     bringing the horses.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL (o.s.) 
               Good morrow, Constable.

     Ichabod turns to see Lady Van Tassel in a chair, sewing.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Returning to the Western Woods?

                             ICHABOD 
               Yes, actually.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Use caution.

                             ICHABOD
                     (nods, studies her) 
               Do you know... I think those are the
               first words I have heard from you my
               entire time here.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               As my husband says, a wife should be
               always like an echo, and at the same
               time, quite unlike an echo.
                     (off Ichabod's confusion) 
               Like an echo, she should speak only
               when spoken to, and unlike an echo,
               should never try to have the last
               word, or, at least that is what he
               believes.

     Baltus comes out the door, irritable, skillet in hand.

                             BALTUS 
               Constable... did you notice anything
               out of the ordinary during the night?

     Ichabod eyes the skillet, ill at ease, trying not to be.

                             ICHABOD 
               Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?

                             BALTUS 
               Sarah has gone missing... my servant
               girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it.
               She has joined the migration out of
               town.
                     (to Lady Van Tassel) 
               What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am
               I to starve to death?

     Lady Van Tassel gets up and goes in, taking the skillet.

                             ICHABOD 
               I should be going... good day to you.

     Ichabod heads towards Young Masbath.  Baltus watches from the
     porch, disgruntled.  He goes in.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     Heavy rain.  Ichabod and Young Masbath ride side by side.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               If the Crone's wound bled hard, that
               means she was not killed by the
               Hessian.  Someone only tried to make
               it look that way.

                             ICHABOD 
               You grow sharper by the minute, little
               man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin
               to prefer your company over all others.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Well... I'm one of the few people who
               likes you.

                             ICHABOD
                     (laughs) 
               True enough.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And
               why?

                             ICHABOD 
               Good questions, deserving answers, of
               which we are in short supply.

     A SOUND is HEARD.  Ichabod looks back, then to Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               Quicken pace.

     Ichabod rides faster.  Young Masbath keeps up.

     FURTHER ON, they charge over a hill.  Ichabod halts Gunpowder
     and climbs clumsily off.

                             ICHABOD 
               Ride on.

     Young Masbath obeys.  Ichabod takes out his pistol and wades
     into forest growth, backtracking.

     INSIDE THE FOREST, Ichabod bounds through underbrush, low.  A
     HORSE is HEARD SNORTING.  He pushes through branches...

     Moving behind a FIGURE IN A GREY CLOAK on horseback.

                             ICHABOD 
               Halt and turn.  I have a pistol aimed
               at your head.

     The figure stops, pushes off the cloak hood.  Katrina.

                             KATRINA 
               It is only me.

                             ICHABOD
               Katrina.  Why do you follow?

                             KATRINA
               I apologize if I worried you.

                             ICHABOD 
               A woman should not be out alone in
               these woods.

                             KATRINA 
               But, I am not alone, am I?  I only
               wished to see what you were up to,
               and...
                     (takes out WHITE ROSE) 
               To thank you.

     Ichabod softens, but doesn't want to.

                             ICHABOD
               Come along.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY

     Raining still.  Ichabod, Masbath and Katrina come into a
     clearing, mouths falling open at the sight of...

     A monstrously huge TREE OF THE DEAD, at the clearing's
     center, with branches reaching far and wide, knotted and
     gross, like agony captured in wood sculpture.

     Ichabod dismounts, crossing a line beyond which grass and
     weeds will not grow.  Young Masbath and Katrina dismount.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               You were right... it does draw
               attention to itself.

     Ichabod stares up into the endless, dead canopy of branches.
     He circles the incredibly wide trunk.

     There's a VERTICAL WOUND in the bark, as if the tree once had
     a terrible vertical in it, now partially healed and
     disgustingly scarred.  Ichabod approaches.

     He feels the mushy scar, picking at its scabs till much sap
     begins to trickle. It is red and Ichabod fingers it.

                             ICHABOD
               Blood.

                             KATRINA
               What did you say?

     Ichabod goes to where Katrina and Masbath wait with the
     horses, digs in a saddle bag for a hand axe.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               What is it?

                             ICHABOD
               Stay back.

     At the trunk, Ichabod thumps the flat end of the axe against
     the suture.  It sounds hollow.  Ichabod begins to chop.

     He pulls away loose bark.  The tree drips more blood and a
     clear goo.  Ichabod uses both hands on the axe to hack at the
     festering suture.

                             KATRINA
               What are you doing?

                             ICHABOD
               Just... keep where you are.

     Ignoring, Young Masbath moves closer.  Ichabod keeps
     chopping, then grips a large, loose flap of wood, trying to
     bend it.  It's not easy.  Ichabod struggles.

     Katrina follows Masbath's slow advance.

     Ichabod's pulling... the flap suddenly gives, revealing a
     blood-soaked, wide-eyed, gap-mouthed HUMAN HEAD.

     Ichabod recoils.  Behind him, Katrina stifles a scream,
     taking Young Masbath in her arms to keep him from looking.

     It is Philipse's head, hanging off the trunk flap, held by
     roots grown around and into the flesh.

     Ichabod reapproaches, back of his hand to his mouth.

     FOUR other SEVERED, DECAYING HEADS are held by ingrown roots
     within the dewy innards.

                             KATRINA 
               My God... what has happened?

                             ICHABOD 
               He... he tries to take the heads...
               they will not pass.

     He looks to the branches towering above.

                             ICHABOD 
               Must be some sort of gateway.  But,
               why this place... ?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               We should go.

                             ICHABOD 
               Why this tree?

     Ichabod begins looking at the ground, moving around the tree.
     He gets to his knees, pushing mud away.

     Uncovering a flush HEADSTONE carved with "666."

                             ICHABOD
                     (to himself) 
               "Climb down to the Horseman's
               soulless place."
                     (to Masbath) 
               Bring the shovel.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- LATER DAY

     Rain.  Young Masbath's crouched, muddy, rifle across his
     knees.  He's watching the tree.

     Behind him, Katrina climbs out of the shallow grave near a
     pile of mud.  Ichabod hands up the shovel.

                             KATRINA 
               Masbath, we've found it.

     Young Masbath goes to the grave.  Ichabod pulls at thick
     burlap cloth, straining as it comes away.

     Ichabod looks down, disbelieving.

                             ICHABOD 
               It cannot be true.

     WE SEE: roots have gripped the Horseman's bones and tattered
     uniform.  The skeleton is all there -- except the skull.

                             ICHABOD 
               Why is it every grave I open holds
               a new mystery inside?

                             KATRINA 
               The skull is gone.

                             ICHABOD 
               Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.

     Ichabod climbs out, weary in body and spirit.  LIGHTNING.
     THUNDER.  He stares at the bones.

                             ICHABOD 
               This is his silent shrieking... and
               his desire, to reclaim his head.

     Ichabod turns, looking to the bordering forest.

                             ICHABOD 
               "He who holds fast the Horseman's
               desire will guide his reaping hand." 
                     (pause) 
               Someone controls the Horseman.

                             KATRINA (o.s.) 
               Ichabod!

     Ichabod turns, looks...

     Katrina and Young Masbath back away, because the ROOTS in the
     grave are ALIVE, further entwining around remains.

     Ichabod spins to the twisted tree...

     The vertical SUTURE SEETHES, pulling inwards... sucking
     Philipse's head back in and closing, bubbling.

     Ichabod bounds over grave dirt pile, hastening Katrina and
     Young Masbath along as he flees.

     At the tree, the suture swells.

     Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath pass where their freaking
     horses are tied to a fallen trunk, heading for cover.

     A RUMBLING is HEARD from the twisted tree, which suddenly
     BURSTS wide, spitting smoldering cinders.

     At the tree line, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath cower,
     looking back.

     From the tree wound, a glow brightens, till the Headless
     Horseman and Daredevil EXPLODE into existence...

     They hit the ground running.

     Ichabod watches the Horseman ride away with bolts of
     LIGHTNING STRIKING the GROUND BEHIND.

     The Horseman disappears in the forest.

                             ICHABOD
               His next victim is chosen!
                     (to Masbath)
               Give me distance, then guide her
               back to the Hollow.

     Ichabod runs towards the horses.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Constable!

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     The Horseman rips past on Daredevil.

     EXT.  BEHIND IN WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     Ichabod rides as fast as Gunpowder is able.


     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Small home.  Killian, Thomas and Beth have finished supper.
     Beth clears plates as Killian picks his teeth with a knife.

                             THOMAS
               May I be excused, father?

                             KILLIAN
               Do you deserve to be?

                             THIRD MAN
                     (shyly)
               I think so.

                             KILLIAN
                     (smiles)
               Then, go.

     Thomas gets down from his chair.  He goes to the fireplace to
     light a tallow wick, which he takes to the next room.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Thomas plops on the floor and lights his MAGIC LANTERN: a
     lantern with an outer sleeve of glass painted with
     silhouettes of lions and monsters.

     Thomas turns the lantern and looks to the walls where the
     creatures, shadows are thrown.  He roars for them, imagining
     them real and having a grand time.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Beth comes for more dishes.

                             BETH 
               Don't pick teeth.  You teach Thomas
               bad habits.

     Killian pulls her to him, playful.

                             KILLIAN 
               I am a bad habit.  There's nothing
               for it.

                             BETH
                     (kisses him) 
               No one knows better than I.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Thomas continues his fun, shadow animals circling him.

     In the shifting light, a baby spider comes from a crack in
     the wall.  Then, another spider skitters out.  More follow.

     EXT.  FORESTS -- DAY

     A black horse runs, hooves pounding the ground.  THUNDER is
     HEARD.  The horse slows and stops... it is Brom's horse, with
     Brom aboard.  Brom looks skyward.

     The storm harshens, roaring through the trees.  Distant
     HOOFBEATS can be HEARD.  POUNDING.

     Brom takes his rifle off his shoulder.  The HOOFBEATS grow
     LOUDER and PASS, far away.  Brom turns in the saddle and
     WHISTLES.  He kicks his horse and rides.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Thomas still watches shadow beasts, but sees something else.
     He goes to the crack where hundreds of spiders flee all
     directions. Thomas is amused.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Behind Killian, mantelpiece stones pulse, breathing almost
     imperceptibly.  Demonic faces form, then disappear and reform
     again, shifting.  WIND HOWLS.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth enters, looking at Thomas.

                             BETH
               What are you doing there?

     The magic lantern stops spinning.  Shadow creatures freeze.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     The ENTIRE HOUSE CREAKS.  Killian looks up.  CREAKING STOPS.
     The HOWLING WIND is LOUD.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth comes to Thomas' side as he points.

                             THOMAS
               Spiders.

     Beth bends to see the swarming spiders.  She looks up,
     noticing the FEROCITY of the WIND.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Killian stands, looking up.  The HOUSE CREAKS again, then
     suddenly the WIND CEASES.  Silence.

                             KILLIAN
               Beth...

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth picks up Thomas.  The magic lantern creatures begin
     spinning anew, all around.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     With a ROAR, the fire flares.  Killian looks.

     WHHOOOSH the fire shoots up the fireplace.  Gone.

     Behind Killian, the DOOR SPLINTERS INWARDS.  The Horseman
     steps in, a battle axe in each hand.  WIND BLASTS...

     The DOOR to the other room SLAMS.

     Killian grabs a kitchen chair and hurls it at the Horseman.
     The Horseman swings, smashing it aside.

                             KILLIAN
               Beth... run!

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth hugs Thomas to her as she backs away.

                             KILLIAN (o.s.)
                     (from kitchen)
               Get out!

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Killian grabs an iron skewer from the fireplace, swings it to
     fend off a blow from the Horseman.

     The Horseman swings the other axe.  Killian ducks.  The axe
     cracks fireplace stone, throwing sparks.

     Killian lunges, jamming the skewer into the Horseman.

     The skewer comes through the Horseman's back.  The Horseman
     swipes with the flat of one axe -- pounding Killian aside.

     Killian hits the wall, bashing his head.  Hits the floor.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth kicks a carpet to reveal a trap door.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     The Horseman pulls the skewer out of his body, throws it.  He
     goes to lift Killian by the hair with one hand, brings back
     the axe in the other...

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     At the trap door, Beth lowers Thomas to stairs leading to the
     cellar.  Thomas is crying.

                             BETH
               Don't let him get you.

                             THOMAS
               Mommy...

                             BETH
               You hide now... go...

     Beth closes the trap door, frantically replacing the carpet.
     The room's door flies open and the Horseman strides in,
     carrying Killian's severed head.  Beth shrieks.

     The Horseman steps forward, knocks over the magic lantern.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY

     Beth's SCREAMS are abruptly CUT OFF.  Her BODY is HEARD
     HITTING the floor above.  Thomas crosses the cellar,
     stumbles.  He scurries into the shelter of a wheelbarrow
     propped against the wall.  FOOTSTEPS are HEARD.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     The Horseman's hands place Killian's and Beth's heads in a
     sack, cinching the sack shut.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     The Headless Horseman enters, bends to retrieve the battle
     axe he left.  He stands.  Pause.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY

     Thomas' trembling hands pull the wheelbarrow closer.  QUIET.
     He tries to control his sobbing.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     The Horseman turns, falls to his knees.  He starts to chop at
     the floor with both axes.  CHOPping,  CHOPping,  CHOPping...
     making quick work of it...

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY

     A hole appears in the ceiling as debris falls.

     Thomas looks up, terrified.  He gets up to run away...

     The Horseman's arm shoves through above, grasping Thomas and
     yanking him up.

     EXT.  KILLIAN'S FARM -- DAY

     Brom rides from the forest, charging across Killian's field.

     At Killian's house, Daredevil rides up as the Headless
     Horseman walks out with his sack of heads.  The Horseman ties
     the sack to the saddle and leaps up.

     Brom puts his reins in his mouth, raising his rifle.

     The Horseman heads away, past the barn, as Brom gains.

     Brom aims... FIRES!

     BOOM -- the slug EXPLODES, blowing the Horseman off
     Daredevil.  Daredevil keeps going.  The Horseman's smoldering
     body is left "face down."

     Brom halts his horse.  He climbs down, pleased.

     The Horseman moves.

     Brom backs away, satisfaction diminishing.

     The Horseman gets on his knees.

     Brom falls to one knee, begins reloading.  He fills the gun
     from his powder horn.

     The Horseman stands, unsheathes his sword and turns.  The
     blast has blown apart his uniform at the chest and shoulder,
     exposing rotten flesh and maggot-infested muscle.

     Brom readies his ramrod, jamming powder in the barrel.

     The Horseman charges.

     Brom stands, pulling out the ramrod.  The Horseman is on him.
     Brom swings the rifle, blocking.  Sparks fly.

     The battle is on, with Brom fending off the Horseman's sword
     with the gun -- CLANK -- CLANK -- CLANK.

     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod and Gunpowder break into the open.

     UP THE FIELD, the Horseman makes a backhanded swing.  Brom
     goes down, his rifle sent flying.

     Brom rolls to avoid as the Horseman slashes.

     Brom flees.  The Horseman pulls and throws a knife...

     THWAP -- the knife imbeds in Brom's thigh.

     The Horseman runs towards Brom.

     Ichabod closes in, pulling an unlit lantern off his saddle.

     Brom tries to get up, bends to extract the knife.

     The Horseman, mid-run, changes his sword grip, blade down.

     He plants one foot on Brom's back, raising his sword, about
     to skewer...

     Ichabod arrives full gallop, SMASHES the lantern into the
     Horseman -- knocking the Horseman off Brom.

     AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST, Theodore and Glen arrive on
     horseback.  They hold a moment, watching.

     Brom runs, limping, to the barn, goal in sight: farm
     implements propped there.  Brom grabs SCYTHES with long
     curved blades, one in per hand.

     The Horseman rises.

     Ichabod turns Gunpowder and leaps off, runs to Brom.

     The Horseman moves towards them, hefting a battle axe in his
     free hand.  Ichabod steps up, pistol aimed, furious.

                             ICHABOD
               For what it's worth...

     FIRES -- the bullet rips through the Horseman's stomach to
     reveal putrid innards as he keeps advancing.

     At the forest, Theodore looks to Glenn, turns and flees.

     Brom steps up, scythes ready.  He and the Horseman go at it.
     Brom blocks axe and sword, catching and deflecting blows.

     At the forest, Glenn follows Theodore away.

     Ichabod grabs a long handled SICKLE.

     Brom swings the scythes.  The Horseman avoids.

     Ichabod moves to the side, looking for an opening.  He swings
     the sickle. The Horseman blocks.

     The Horseman battles both at once, catching blows...
     countering every strike, METAL RINGING.

     Brom catches the Horseman's sword in one scythe, holding it
     off.  Catches the axe handle in the other scythe.

     The Horseman flatfoot KICKS Brom's chest, sending him down.

     Ichabod swings the sickle blade...

     Hits the Horseman, the blade embedding to the hilt.

     The Horseman drops his axe and grasps the sickle, jerking...

     The sickle handle SLAMS Ichabod's, knocking him away.

     Ichabod crawls, tries to shake off the blow.

     He looks up.  The Horseman staggers, spastically trying to
     pull the blade from his body.

     Brom limps to Ichabod, yanks him to his feet.

                             BROM
               We cannot win this.

     They head towards the forest.

     Behind, the Horseman extracts the sickle, throws it.  He
     strides after them, picks up his axe on the way.

     EXT.  RIVERBANK -- DAY

     Ichabod and Brom stumble down a hillside.  Brom points.

                             BROM
               There...

     They run to a DOCK at the edge of a wide, rapid river.  They
     jump into a FLAT BOAT barge.

                             BROM
               Go to the front and guide it.

     Ichabod goes.  Brom uses a scythe to slash the ropes.

     Ichabod picks up a GUIDE POLE.  The barge lurches, set free.

     Ichabod struggles to push the boat out.  it moves swiftly,
     caught in rain swollen current.

     Brom looks back.  No Horseman.  He leaves the scythe and
     moves to the front, hefting another pole to help guide.

                             BROM
               Let's see him catch us now.

     Ichabod looks to the shore.  Horror.

                             ICHABOD
               Look.

     LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES -- ahead, the Horseman stands on the
     bank with Axe and sword.  Daredevil near.

                             BROM 
               We'll pass right by the son of a bitch.

     Ichabod and Brom push with the poles, trying for speed.

     At the bank, the Horseman walks directly to the water...

     Just as he takes a step onto the water, the rain churned
     surface TRANSFORMS -- instantly BECOMING a SHEET of ICE...

     SPREADING and supporting the Horseman as he advances.

     ICE SHOOTS OUT ahead of him, towards a point in the river
     where it will intercept the barge.

                             BROM
               My Christ...

     The Horseman's ICE BRIDGE engulfs the barge, HALTING IT.

     Ichabod and Brom are thrown.  The barge is trapped.

     The Horseman nears.

     Brom runs to the rear to retrieve his scythe.  Ichabod holds
     up the only weapon he has, his guide pole.

     The Horseman steps on board.  Ichabod swings.  The Horseman's
     axe cracks the pole in half...

     The Horseman thrusts with sword -- into Ichabod's chest --
     clean through.  It SIZZLES as Ichabod screams.

     The Horseman lifts Ichabod up, flips him, pulling the sword
     out as Ichabod goes...

     SMASHING through the ice and under.

     UNDERWATER: water carries Ichabod, slams him against ice
     above. He's pulled down by undertow.

     ABOVE WATER, beyond the edge of the ice bridge: Ichabod comes
     up, gasping, choking on rain.

     He treads water, looking to the barge.

     ICHABOD'S P.O.V. -- FROM THE WATER

     Aboard the barge, the Horseman cuts Brom down... stands over
     him, chopping with sword.  Our VIEW grows BLURRY, and...

     FADES OUT/IN

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Candlelight.  Ichabod, shirtless, feverish, opens his eyes.
     The wound at the top of his chest is raw.  Katrina inserts a
     needle in the skin around it.

                             KATRINA
               Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Doctor, he is awake.

     Ichabod tries to sit.  Pain stops him.  Lady Van Tassel helps
     bleed the wound with the needle and a tube leading to a
     SUCTION JAR of blood.

                             ICHABOD
                     (barely a voice)
               What... what are you doing... ?

                             KATRINA
               I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.

     Doctor Lancaster comes to the bed.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               Keep still, Constable.  You were
               half-drowned when they found you.

                             ICHABOD
               ... Brom Bones...

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               He is dead.  You would be also, if
               your wound had not somehow shut.

                             ICHABOD
               Bring Young Masbath here.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               You need to sleep.

                             ICHABOD
               Bring him.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               You need rest.

     Ichabod gives up, closes his eyes.  Katrina, needle in one
     hand, brings her other hand to hold Ichabod's.

     Blood drips into the suction jar.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Ichabod is soundly asleep.  Across the room, Katrina is at
     his work table.  Ichabod stirs.  Katrina looks to him.

     Once she is satisfied he will not wake, she returns to what
     she was doing, turning a page.  She is reading his ledger.

     EXT.  SERVANT'S QUARTER'S, MASBATH'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath lies awake.  A glint of light crosses the
     window.  Masbath looks to it, gets up, peers out.

     THROUGH THE WINDOW, he can see the Van Tassel Manor House in
     the distance.  Lantern LIGHT crosses the lawn.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE, ORCHARD -- NIGHT

     The lantern light moves through the orchard, away from the
     house.  We cannot make out the person.

     Elsewhere, Young Masbath runs in pursuit.  He hides against
     one tree, leans to look...

     The light enters forest.  Young Masbath follows.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- MORNING

     Ichabod's hurting.  Masbath helps with a shirt.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Someone left last night.  Looked
               like they headed to the square, but
               I lost them in the forest.

                             ICHABOD 
               Man or woman?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               All I saw was their lantern.

                             ICHABOD 
               Business, best hidden is hidden best
               at night.

     Ichabod goes to his work table, organizing his satchel.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               If someone has the Horseman's skull...
               if they control the Horseman, then why
               haven't they sent him for your head
               yet?

                             ICHABOD 
               Because, I serve a fine purpose alive.
               It is perfection for our murderer if I
               return to New York City with nothing
               more than tales of a galloping ghoul. 
                     (pause) 
               We must uncover the reason these
               victims were targeted.  What was taken
               from them... other than their lives?
               Who benefits by their deaths?

     Ichabod fumbles the bottle of white powder.

     It bounces, cork popping out... rolls under the bed.

                             ICHABOD 
               Damn it.

     Ichabod kneels, pained.  A trail of the blood-detecting
     powder has spilled.  The bottle is out of reach.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               I'll get it.

     Young Masbath gets down, ready to crawl for it, but Ichabod
     stops him, peering under.

                             ICHABOD
               Wait...

     Far under, near the bottle, some powder is bubbling.

     Ichabod moves to the end of the bed and lifts, in pain. 
     Young Masbath helps. They drag the bed to one side.

     Under the bed: a Satanic PENTAGRAM has been DRAWN IN BLOOD.

     Ichabod stares, trying to grasp the implication.  Masbath is
     about to speak, but Ichabod puts a finger to his lips.

     Ichabod moves to lock the door.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
                     (whispers) 
               Who did this?

     Ichabod does not answer.  He picks up a wash basin and dumps
     the water to wash the Pentagram away.


     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- DAY

     WAGONS, HORSES and TOWNSPEOPLE swarm.  A CROWD loots the
     town's general store.  Provisions are passed along man to man
     and loaded on wheelbarrows.

     All up and down the long straight road, home owners board up
     windows with lumber.

     Ichabod and Young Masbath ride, passing many angry faces.

                             ICHABOD
               Panic has set in.

     They stop, tying their horses and climbing stairs to the door
     of the "NOTARY."  Ichabod looks off...

     DOWN THE ROAD, at the far end, people head to the church.
     Much activity there as well.

                             ICHABOD
               Sanctuary.  Or, so they hope.

     Families put up tents all around the church within the
     bordering wrought-iron fence.  Supplies abound.

     People work to build and erect massive wooden crosses.


     INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY

     Tidy room.  Young Masbath watches Ichabod hand a slip of
     paper to the elderly Notary, Hardenbrook.

                             ICHABOD
               Do you have these persons' wills?

                             HARDENBROOK
               I have everything... last testaments...
               birth certificates, death certificates...
               deeds.

                             ICHABOD
               Yes, sir... but, do you have these?

     Hardenbrook studies the paper with his one good eye.

                             HARDENBROOK
               Certainly... certainly.

     Hardenbrook nods, handing the list back, grinning.  Ichabod
     stands waiting.  Hardenbrook is still nodding.

                             ICHABOD
               May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?

                             HARDENBROOK
               Hmm?  See them?

                             ICHABOD
               May we look at them now?

                             HARDENBROOK 
               Of course.  You want them... it shall
               not take long.  Wait here.

     Hardenbrook heads across the room.  Ichabod offers the list.

                             ICHABOD
               Maybe you should take this.

                             HARDENBROOK 
               A fine idea.

     Hardenbrook takes it and exits.  Young Masbath sits.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What good is this?

                             ICHABOD 
               To discover what might have been taken
               from those who died, it will help to
               know what was there that could be
               taken in the first place.

     Ichabod waits.  After a moment, he looks uncertain.  He
     crosses to the half-open door...

     INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM -- DAY

     Ichabod sticks his head in, not liking what he sees.

     Hardenbrook's amidst unbelievable disarray.  Tables, shelves,
     and baskets of unevenly piled documents.

     Hardenbrook looks on a shelf, confused, then goes to a table,
     lifting papers, mumbling.

                             HARDENBROOK 
               Damn... damn... damn...

                             ICHABOD
               Master Hardenbrook...

     Hardenbrook turns, a bit startled.

                             ICHABOD 
               Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?

                             HARDENBROOK
               Well... that might be... helpful.

     INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM (TIME CUT) -- DAY

     Hardenbrook is asleep in a chair, snoring, blind eye open.
     Ichabod and Young Masbath face official-looking documents,
     with Ichabod focused on one will in hand.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               My father had farm land.  It was the
               only thing we owned of any value.

                             ICHABOD
                     (still reading) 
               And it now belongs to you, according
               to Baltus.  I heard him say it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Yes.

     Ichabod turns the will in his hand to Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               Then look here at your father's will,
               and tell me why you are not listed.

     Young Masbath takes it, boggled.  Ichabod grabs another.

                             ICHABOD 
               Van Garrett had denoted his elder son
               in his last wishes; the same son
               murdered along with him.  But Van
               Garrett's wife and two infant children
               are not written... and they were spared.
                     (picks up another will)
               Do you see?  Philipse had no family to
               bestow his farm to.  But, here...
                     (picks up another) 
               The Widow Windsor was listed on her
               late husband's will.  After her
               inheritance, she amended the document
               to include her bastard child.  This is
               why the Horseman made absolutely
               certain to impale the unborn descendant.

     Ichabod sits back.

                             ICHABOD 
               Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that
               the Horseman slaughters by assignment.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               But, if the farm is not mine, who stole
               it away?

                             ICHABOD 
               No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has
               gone intestate.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               In test... what?

                             ICHABOD 
               Intestate.  Your farm... all the
               farms... they belong to no one.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What does it mean?

     Ichabod stares off.

                             ICHABOD 
               Often in such cases, property which
               has gone intestate legally passes to
               whomever the deceased was indebted to.
               And, who in this town is owed a great
               many debts?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
                     (realization) 
               Baltus Van Tassel.

                             ICHABOD 
               Did your father take a loan?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.

     Ichabod stands, grim, gathering wills and his ledger.

                             ICHABOD 
               Tonight, we answer questions.  And, to
               discover who moves about the Van Tassel
               house after dark... all we need is a
               candle.

     A LOUD NOISE is HEARD from the other room.  Ichabod looks.

     INT.  HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY

     Ichabod bursts in.  No one there.  A chair has been knocked
     over and the front door is ajar.  Ichabod moves...

     EXT.  NOTARY -- DAY

     Ichabod exits.  All around is the commotion in the square as
     before.  No telling who it was who just fled.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY

     Young Masbath is seated, bored.  Ichabod writes in his
     ledger.  A KNOCK on the door.  They both look up.

                             KATRINA (o.s.)
                     (from outside door)
               Constable... are you there?
                     (long pause)
               Ichabod?

     The knob is tried and found locked.  Pause.  At the bottom of
     the door, a red rose is passed under.

     This saddens Ichabod.


     EXT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Quiet night.  The church is a sight, with a yard resembling
     an empty squatter's tent city, surrounded by crosses.
     Boarded over windows leak shafts of light.

     MOVING PAST THE WINDOWS: many eyes peer out from the slats.

     UP IN THE BELFRY, TWO RIFLEMEN are on watch.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Masbath are in darkness, still waiting.  Ichabod
     takes the cover off a lantern, looks at a clock.  Midnight,
     straight up.  Ichabod stands, picks up an unlit candle.

                             ICHABOD
               Midnight seems an appropriate time.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Young Masbath look out, cautious.  They move to
     the nearest door.

     Ichabod crouches, using the candle to mark the seam of the
     door and door frame.  He's making a low, wax seal.  If the
     door opens, the seal will break.

     They move to a second door, quietly.  Ichabod makes another
     low wax mark.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, MAIN ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs to a hall.  Ichabod
     continues his wax marking at each door.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, BALTUS' OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Young Masbath enter, shutting the door.  Ichabod
     walks to shelves at Baltus' desk, looks through ribbon bound
     DOCUMENTS and hands some to Masbath.

     Young Masbath pulls off the ribbon, pages through these "LOAN
     AGREEMENT" parchments.  Ichabod brings another pile.

                             ICHABOD
                     (whispering)
               They are alphabetical.

     Young Masbath has the M's.  "MARYIE," "MEGAPOLENISIS," AND
     "MELYN..." Not finding what he wants.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               There is no Masbath here.  My father's
               loan papers are missing.

                             ICHABOD
                     (regarding his documents) 
               There are none for Magistrate Philipse
               either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter,
               Thomas" "Pos, William."

     A FLOORBOARD CREAKS.  Ichabod looks, blows out the lantern.
     He and Young Masbath stand frozen.

     Across the room, light comes under the door, stops, then
     continues.  A DOOR is HEARD OPENING and SHUTTING.  Ichabod
     crosses to follow, pointing back.

                             ICHABOD 
               Keep looking.  Then, hide in my room
               and bolt the door till I return.


     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Lantern light moves, far ahead.  Ichabod follows.

     EXT.  FOREST, FURTHER ON -- NIGHT

     Ichabod stops, hidden.  He can see the light ahead, but it is
     no longer in motion.  He advances.

     EXT.  FOREST CLEARING -- NIGHT

     A lantern sits on a rock.  On a blanket, a semi-naked MAN and
     semi-naked WOMAN are in the midst of rough SEX.

     Ichabod crawls to peer from underbrush.

     The couple keeps coupling, with the man on top.  His grunts
     and gasps are particularly desperate.  He's all over the
     woman, who lays back... it is Lady van Tassel.

     Ichabod swallows, inches closer.

     Lady van Tassel pulls the man's shirt, exposes his flesh.
     She raises a small, sharp KNIFE behind his back.

     Ichabod's eyes widen.

     Lady Van Tassel brings the blade to her own hand, slicing
     deep in her palm.  Blood flows.  She rubs her cut hand over
     her partner's arching back, smearing blood.

     Lady van Tassel caresses the man's chest, neck, face...
     trailing blood.  The man lifts his head, in ecstasy, sucks
     the woman's bloody fingers... it's Clergyman Steenwyck.

     Ichabod backs away, having seen more than plenty.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath unlocks the door.  Ichabod enters.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               I was getting worried.  Who was it?

                             ICHABOD 
               Lady Van Tassel.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What was she doing?

                             ICHABOD 
               Something I really wish I had not seen.
               Never mind it.  Did you find the
               victims' loan agreements?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               No.  They are all missing.

     This troubles Ichabod.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               There is more, though.  While you were
               gone, I could hear someone else
               walking through the house.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Young Masbath creep round a corner.  Going to the
     LAST DOOR, Ichabod crouches, eyes narrowing...

                             ICHABOD
                     (whispers, to himself) 
               Katrina.

     The wax seal is broken, flecks of wax on the floor.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER AND HALL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs, checking all the wax
     marks.  Young Masbath finds one broken.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Here.

     Ichabod comes over, pushes the door...

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     They enter.  The kitchen is empty.  Ichabod crosses to
     another door, crouches.  Another broken wax mark.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT

     They enter... the room with the elaborate loom.  Ichabod
     moves his lantern to make a quick search, goes to table.

     He touches the top of a candle.  His finger comes away with a
     bit of still wet wax.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               There are no other doors.  This is as
               far as she could have gone.

                             ICHABOD 
               It is nothing.  She comes to read books,
               so her father will not find her.
                     (to convince himself) 
               It is absolutely nothing.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What books?

                             ICHABOD 
               Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does
               not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be
               long before Lady Van Tassel returns.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               But, sir... what books?  Where are they?

     Ichabod stops, looking around.  No books anywhere.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               If there is a secret place for books...
               it could be just as good for the
               missing loan agreements.

     Ichabod ponders this without saying anything.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     SEARCH MONTAGE:

     - Drawers are opened and searched, quietly.
     - Young Masbath uses a candle to look up the fireplace.
     - Ichabod opens a linen cabinet, unfolding blankets.
     - Young Masbath looks in a closet filled with big spools of
     sewing thread, on his knees, pulls a wooden box forward.
     Inside it, he finds only old cups and silverware.

     Ichabod pulls up a rug, feeling along the floorboards.

     Young Masbath crawls, doing the same.  He climbs under the
     loom, tapping on the floor.  TAP... TAP... TAP...

     He crawls further under the loom.  TAP... TAP... PLONK.  A
     hollow sound.  He taps again... PLONK... PLONK.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Constable.

     Ichabod comes over as Young Masbath lifts a loose board.
     Under the floor, there are piles of books.  Masbath brings
     them up, handing them to Ichabod, who studies the spines.

     Young Masbath reaches in up to his shoulder.  He comes up
     with "LOAN AGREEMENTS."

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Fie!  Here they are.

     Ichabod takes them.  Names are near the top: "Masbath," "Van
     Garret," "Philipse," and "Killian."

     Ichabod sits back, numb, his heart bitterly broken.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING

     Lady Van Tassel prepares food with two servants at the open
     fireplace/oven.  Ichabod enters, rushed.

                             ICHABOD 
               Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina
               is not in her room.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               No.  She has gone out.

                             ICHABOD 
               Where?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               She has taken the last of our grain
               to be milled.
                     (crossing to him) 
               You do have a background in the
               medical arts, don't you, Constable?

                             ICHABOD
               Very little.  I must be going...

     Lady Van Tassel holds out her cut palm, the gash sewn shut.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Will you look at this?  I cut my hand
               this morning: I sewed it myself, but
               I am afraid it will go bad.

     Ichabod takes her hand, distracted and nervous.

                             ICHABOD
               It appears well.  It has already
               clotted.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Look closer.  Do you have anything to
               clean it with?

                             ICHABOD
               It is fine.  Now, I must...

     Lady Van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the wrist, tight.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
                     (whispering, close) 
               I know you saw me.

                             ICHABOD
               What... ?

     Lady Van Tassel glances to servants, keeps her voice low.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               I know you followed last night.  You
               must promise not to tell Baltus...

     Ichabod tries to pull away, but she grips tighter.  The FRONT
     DOOR is HEARD SLAMMING.  Ichabod is panicky.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Have mercy on me.  Please... have mercy.

     Ichabod pulls away just as Baltus enters.  Lady Van Tassel
     goes back to work as if nothing happened.

                             BALTUS 
               Constable, it is urgent that we speak.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE FRONT PORCH -- MORNING

     Baltus leads Ichabod to the porch.

                             BALTUS 
               Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a
               meeting.  This time he is determined
               to have you forced out, or worse.

                             ICHABOD 
               How did you hear this?

                             BALTUS
               He came to me.  He promised great
               violence.  Said I should cast you out
               for my own protection.
                     (troubled pause)
               I must speak honestly.  There is no
               reason to think he will not meet with
               success.

     Ichabod looks to barn, sees Masbath bringing the horses.  The
     CHURCH BELL is HEARD TOLLING far away.

                             BALTUS 
               That is the meeting bell already
               calling.  With the murder of Killian
               and Brom, no one sees any good from
               you.  If... if you were to leave...
               you might be saving your own life.

     Ichabod studies Baltus, then offers his hand.  They shake.

                             ICHABOD 
               I appreciate your concern.  I thank
               you, sir.

     Ichabod hurries off, across the lawn, exasperated.  He runs.
     Masbath runs to him.  Ichabod takes Gunpowder and climbs up.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
                     (mounting his horse) 
               What now?  Where is she?

                             ICHABOD 
               Things have become complicated.
               Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead,
               find her and bring her to meet me
               outside the church.  Find her at all
               costs.  Quickly.

     They ride, fast.


     EXT.  FOREST -- DAY

     A conjuring pile of straw burns.  Gloved hands unfold a paper
     filled with clippings of human hair.  The hair is sprinkled
     on the fire.

     A cloaked FIGURE is kneeled at the pile.  The figure turns to
     remove A human SKULL from a cloth bag.

     The skull is placed at center in the flames.  It's teeth are
     sharp, cut to points.  The HORSEMAN'S SKULL.


     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     In the church yard refugee camp, food is prepared over fire.
     People inhabit the tents.

     INT.  CHURCH, STEENWYCK'S QUARTERS -- MORNING

     IN THE CHURCH: it's crowded with families.  Pews filled with
     bedding and belongings.  Steenwyck comes to CLOSE the DOUBLE
     DOORS of his quarters, turning, angry.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               You are astonishing, Constable.  Do
               you truly think your ridiculous
               accusations frighten me?

     Ichabod is doing nothing to hide his disdain.

                             ICHABOD 
               Only if I repeat them outside this
               room.  And, I will if I must...
                     (points to doors) 
               Out there, for all to hear.  Or...
               you may speak, as planned.  But, you
               tell them you feel compelled to move
               on to greener pastures.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               No.  You will not run me out.  No one
               will believe a word of what you say.

                             ICHABOD 
               Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does
               not travel alone for long here.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free
               thinker who does not believe in
               divinity.

                             ICHABOD 
               It is only important what you are.
               An adulterer...

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               I am the Lord's voice in this town.

                             ICHABOD
               Wallowing in sin and lust...

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               They need guidance.

                             ICHABOD 
               Wallowing quite literally in blood.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
                     (snapping, quaking) 
               Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!

                             ICHABOD 
               He may.  But, not soon enough for
               you, and not on your behalf.

     Ichabod walks.  Steenwyck is humiliated.

                             ICHABOD 
               You are so upset now... and yet, you
               seemed in such good spirits last night.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!

                             ICHABOD 
               Climb to the top of the tallest ladder
               you can find, Father.  That is the
               closest you ever come to God.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Pews are packed.  Steenwyck enters, walks to the altar.
     EVERYONE QUIETS.  Steenwyck has composed himself, barely.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               My friends... dear friends.  Those of
               you still on your farms, I thank you
               for coming.

     He sees Ichabod near the back.  THUNDER is HEARD OUTSIDE.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               I... I address unfortunate business. 
                     (pause) 
               I am forced to take my leave from
               Sleepy Hollow.  I will be moving on to
               do the Lord's work elsewhere.

     The GATHERERS MURMUR shock.  Ichabod walks out.


     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY

     Raining hard.  Baltus and Lady Van Tassel ride.

                             BALTUS 
               Hurry along.  The meeting has most
               certainly already begun.  We do not
               want Steenwyck as our enemy.

     Lady Van Tassel trails.  WOOD is HEARD SPLINTERING...

     Just off the road, a tree falls...

     The trunk catches Lady Van Tassel's horse on its rear flank.

     The horse falls.  Lady Van Tassel hits the dirt.

     Baltus looks back, halting.

     Lady Van Tassel looks up to Baltus in fear, then turns.

     Behind her, the Headless Horseman trots from, the forest on
     Daredevil, stops.  Calm.  He takes his axe in hand.


     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Storming.  The meeting is letting out.  Near the churchyard
     gate, Young Masbath rides with Katrina following on a horse
     cart.  Ichabod walks up as Katrina dismounts.

                             KATRINA 
               What is so urgent?

                             ICHABOD 
               Come with me.

     Ichabod leads her to where they can talk away from others.

                             KATRINA 
               Why have I not seen your face for so
               long?  You look much better.

     She touches his face, but he takes her hand, places the loan
     agreements there.

                             ICHABOD 
               Explain these.  I found them secreted
               away in the sewing room.

     Katrina's expression changes just so slightly to guilt.

                             ICHABOD 
               Why... why have I scrambled and run
               and clawed in all directions, only to
               find you against me?

     He stares at her.  Katrina stares back, in a small way
     defeated.  She looks for an out, but there is none.

                             KATRINA
               I have been reading your journal.
               I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating
               to resist. 
                     (pause, ashamed) 
               I rode to catch up with you at the
               Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I
               found you though, I overheard what you
               were said.

                             ICHABOD 
               It was you there?

                             KATRINA 
               When... when you spoke father's name
               along with accusations, I could not
               believe it.  I had to hide these... at
               least till I could confront him myself.

                             ICHABOD 
               And, what did he say?

                             KATRINA 
               He did not do these things.  If you
               knew him, you would realize...

                             ICHABOD 
               What did he say, Katrina?

                             KATRINA 
               I have not been able to face him yet.

                             ICHABOD 
               The loans give the land to your father.
               It does not matter survivors are still
               on their farms.  They could be thrown
               off... tomorrow... a year from now.

                             KATRINA 
               Yes, I have seen that, and I told you
               why I hid them.

                             ICHABOD 
               What would you have me believe?

                             KATRINA
                     (tiring, angry) 
               If you think I am behind this, say it.

                             ICHABOD 
               The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You
               share that name.

                             KATRINA 
               Call me a liar, then, and a murderess.
               Say it, out and out.

     Many people are starting to notice the confrontation.

                             ICHABOD 
               Katrina...

                             KATRINA 
               Speak the words, Constable.  What is
               stopping you?  What has happened to your
               ability to transcend sentimentality?

     Emotions tear at him.  Rain seems to pound down harder.

                             KATRINA 
               Oh, no.  No.  Please... don't dare stand
               looking as if you still care for me,
               after all that you have said.  If I were
               to confess, would that ease your
               suffering?  Would that make it easier
               for you to hate me?!

     A TORTURED CRY is HEARD O.S.

     Baltus comes charging through the square on his horse.

                             BALTUS
               The Horseman is coming!

     He's barely hanging on.  He stops, practically falling off,
     running towards Katrina and Ichabod.

                             BALTUS
               Save me...

                             KATRINA
               Father?

                             BALTUS
               He killed her...

     Baltus grasps Katrina, fearful.  HOOFBEATS are HEARD.

                             BALTUS
               The Horseman has killed her.

     Far behind, the Horseman rides to follow, axe held up.
     Instant mayhem -- people scatter all directions, screaming.

     Baltus runs headlong to the church.

                             KATRINA
               Father!

     Katrina runs after Baltus.  Ichabod backs away, watching the
     Horseman come, then heads to the church with Masbath.

     Baltus pushes through the iron gate, into tent city, joining
     the swarm of townsfolk pouring into the church.

     The Horseman rides behind, closing the gap.  Men, women and
     children run for cover all along the square.

     Amidst the churchyard panic, Ichabod looks back...

     The Horseman reaches the open gate and Daredevil suddenly
     rears up, snorting, unwilling to enter.

     The Horseman grabs Daredevil's reins, tries to move forward
     again.  Same result.  Daredevil freaks out.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Baltus makes his way in, shoving.  People are still clamoring
     in through the doors.

     Men pass rifles from stockpiles and climb onto pews at
     boarded windows.  Women herd children into a cellar.

     Baltus searches for a hiding place.  He looks across the
     church to see Steenwyck closing the doors of his living
     quarters.  Baltus moves...

                             BALTUS 
               Steenwyck!

     At the front doors, Katrina squeezes in with Ichabod and
     Young Masbath just as people are forcing the doors closed.
     It's madness.  People outside begin pounding.

     Katrina searches.

                             KATRINA 
               Father!

     Ichabod goes to a window, looking out between boards.

     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Across the yard, the Horseman gives his axe an underhand toss
     to the ground inside the gate.

     The AXE instantly BEGINS TO DEGRADE TO DUST in the rain.

     The Horseman rides, keeping outside the fence.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Ichabod comes away from the window, looking to panicked
     citizens.  He sees Katrina moving up the aisle...

     She's heading towards Baltus, who slams against the door to
     Steenwyck's room.

                             BALTUS 
               Damn you, Steenwyck!  Help me!
               Let me in!

     RIFLES BOOM LOUDLY as men at the windows begin firing.

     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     The Horseman circles, under fire.

     Great clouds of gun smoke shoot from the church.

     Men fire down from the belfry.

     Parts of the Horseman and Daredevil splatter red into the
     rain as slugs hit without effect.

     AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHURCH, the Horseman comes around,
     heading to the town square.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Rifleman shout to each other, running to the opposite windows
     to follow the Horseman.

     Young Masbath grabs a rifle and leaps to join the brigade.

     Baltus is still beating Steenwyck's door when a HUGE FARMER
     grips Baltus angrily and throws him...

                             HUGE FARMER 
               You'll kill us all!

     Baltus falls, knocking over pews.  Katrina's nearby.

                             HUGE FARMER 
               You're the one the Horseman wants.
               Why should we die for you!?

                             KATRINA
               NO!

     The huge farmer picks Baltus up, dragging him and shoving
     Katrina aside as she approaches.

     Ichabod's pushing past people, trying to reach them.

     EXT.  CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- DAY

     The Horseman brings Daredevil to a halt, yanking a large coil
     of ROPE off a hitching post.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     The huge farmer shoves Baltus to the floor again.

                             HUGE FARMER
               Get out!

     Others join the rage, pulling Baltus towards the front of the
     church, shouting.  Ichabod struggles to push them off.

                             ICHABOD 
               Stop this!

     Ichabod gets to Baltus' side, trying to protect.

                             ICHABOD 
               The Horseman cannot enter!  It does
               not matter who he wants, he cannot
               cross the gate!

     At the windows, ONE RIFLEMAN turns, crying out.

                             ONE RIFLEMAN 
               He's coming back!

     More panic.  The huge farmer moves towards Baltus.

                             HUGE FARMER 
               We have to save ourselves!

     Baltus pulls the pistol from Ichabod's holster, brandishing.

                             BALTUS 
               No!  Get away from me!

     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     The Horseman rides past the front, fired upon.

     He halts at the wrought iron gate, reaching to yank off one
     POST which is pointed on top, like an arrow head.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Baltus holds everyone's back with the pistol.

                             BALTUS 
               The next person to lay hands on me
               will have a bullet.  Stand off!

                             KATRINA
               Father...

                             BALTUS 
               No!  We're safe here.
                     (points at Ichabod) 
               You said it.  The Horseman will not
               have me.

     CRASH, the harpoon-like post SPEARS through a window,
     trailing rope tied to it...

     CRACK -- SKEWERS Baltus from behind, the bloodied point
     bursting out his breast bone.

     Baltus looks down, drops the gun... clutching the post with
     both hands.  Blood streams out his mouth.  Katrina screams.

     The rope yanks Baltus back.  He SLAMS into the WINDOW...

     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Baltus CRASHES out, hits the ground, dragged...

     Outside the fence, Daredevil runs with the rope tied around
     his saddle pommel.  The Horseman strides forward, sword out.

     Baltus SLAMS the fence and the rope snaps.  He is held there
     awkwardly, gurgling blood.

     The Horseman reaches Baltus... chops off his head.


     INT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS -- DAY

     The storm has passed.  Empty forest.  Long, peaceful pause,
     till Ichabod makes his way through, searching the ground.

     Ichabod comes to look down a small hill.  The corpse of Lady
     Van Tassel lies headless, in a dirty, torn dress.

     Ichabod walks to the body.  Lady Van Tassel's arm is twisted
     behind.  The sewn cut on the palm of her hand faces up.

                             ICHABOD
                     (shouting back)
               Here!  I have found her...
                     (looking at corpse,
                      quiet and miserable)
               Here she is.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL -- EARLY EVENING

     Doctor Lancaster comes out from where Katrina is asleep.  He
     closes the door, wipes his sweaty face.  Ichabod waits.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               It has been a terrible jolt to her
               nerves.

                             ICHABOD 
               You will stay at her side?

     Doctor Lancaster nods.  Ichabod walks.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- EARLY EVENING

     It's getting dark.  Ichabod comes out and crosses the porch.
     A few of the Hollow's residents are here.  Young Masbath gets
     up and follows Ichabod onto the lawn.

     Ichabod walks without waiting.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               She's the one who controlled the
               Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
                     (no answer)

                             ICHABOD 
               I need time for thinking.  Without you
               hanging on my coattails for a change.

     Ichabod keeps walking.  Young Masbath stops, wounded.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod stands holding a torch, looking up.  The whole area
     is bright from the light off a giant fire.

     There are broken lanterns and barrels around the agonized,
     twisted tree.  The tree is aflame, fire dancing up the trunk,
     and through every branch to lick the sky.


     EXT.  FOREST -- DAY

     Dawn.  Ichabod is seated overlooking the Hudson.  He stares
     at the beauty around him, brooding through bleary eyes.
     Gunpowder is tied to a tree.  BIRDS SING.

     The ledger is open in Ichabod's lap.  He thumbs pages
     absently, just keeps staring off.

     EXT.  FOREST -- DAY (TIME CUT)

     A fire burns in a circle of rocks.  Ichabod's ledger is
     thrown in.  The pages catch quickly.

     Ichabod watches, then walks away.  He's about to climb onto
     Gunpowder, but on second thought he opens his satchel and
     digs out a BOOK.  He walks back to the fire, throws it on...

     "Romeo and Juliet."  Flames devour it.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY

     The clearing is silent.  The twisted tree still stands,
     smoldering, impressive as ever, or perhaps even more so with
     the alien appearance its blackened skin now affords it.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod packs up baggage.  Young Masbath is miserable.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Won't you change your mind, sir?
               What can I say to convince you?

                             ICHABOD 
               Nothing.  To hell with this place
               and all the people here.

     Ichabod closes a bag, throws it with others.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Why... why are you like this?

                             ICHABOD
                     (pause, softening) 
               You do not know all that has happened.
                     (pause) 
               You cannot understand.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT

     A coach, with Gunpowder as one of its team, waits in the
     orchard.  Van Ripper comes to meet Ichabod and Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               Half now.  Half when we reach the
               city.

     Ichabod hands Van Ripper money.  Van Ripper takes the
     baggage.  Ichabod looks to the Manor House.  Only one light
     shines, in a second floor window.

     Katrina can be seen there a moment as she closes curtains.

     Ichabod turns to Young Masbath, who is beginning to cry.

                             ICHABOD 
               This is farewell.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Take me with you.  There's nothing
               left for me here.

                             ICHABOD 
               I cannot.
                     (bends to Masbath) 
               You should not worry.
                     (pause, sorrow) 
               Van Ripper and his wife will look
               after you.  They will.  You will be
               well cared for.

     Young Masbath hugs.  Ichabod hugs back, swallowing.

                             ICHABOD
               I am sorry.
                     (quietly) 
               Forgive me.  I failed you.

     Ichabod releases and goes quickly away, finding this misery
     unbearable.  He climbs in the coach.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Do not go, Constable.  How can you
               leave?

     INSIDE THE COACH, Ichabod slumps back in darkness and closes
     his eyes.  He pounds twice on the coach wall.

     OUTSIDE, Van Ripper whips the reins.  The coach starts.
     Young Masbath follows.  The coach picks up speed on the long
     straight road.

     Young Masbath stops, wiping tears.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Ichabod's coach moves through the town square.  A few people
     in the churchyard's tent city come out to watch it pass.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     The door is pushed open.  Young Masbath enters, looks around
     the empty room.  He goes to sit in a chair at the work table,
     crossing his arms and resting his head.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

     A plate of food sits untouched.  Katrina is slumped down in a
     chair, heartbroken, staring into the fireplace.

     Behind her, a shadow moves across the room.


     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT

     Van Ripper leads the coach through the stone pillars marking
     the entrance of Sleepy Hollow.

     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT

     Ichabod takes off his hat, sets it on the seat.  The window
     between him and the driver slides open.

                             VAN RIPPER 
               Sir... this is yours.
                     (offering something) 
               The Van Tassel girl said to give it
               to you after you were gone.

     Ichabod takes it.  It is the bird/cage spinning toy.  He
     studies it.  What melancholy.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Katrina sits with her eyes closed.  A BOARD is HEARD
     CREAKING.  She sits up. Suddenly, a FIGURE in black is behind
     her as she turns.  WHACK! -- a gloved fist strikes.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     A dull THUD is HEARD downstairs, like a body falling.  Young
     Masbath takes notice.  He moves to the door...


     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT

     Ichabod turns the strings on the bird/cage toy, ponders it.

     The paper disk spins, images flickering until the bird
     appears to be inside the cage.

     Ichabod keeps spinning it, looks out the window.

     A tear rolls down his cheek.

     The bird cage toy's rotation slows... stops.

     Ichabod looks at it a long moment, then pockets it and leans
     forward to the window at front.

     OUTSIDE THE COACH

     Ichabod's face appears behind Van Ripper.

                             ICHABOD
               Van Ripper, turn the coach about!

                             VAN RIPPER
               What did you say?

                             ICHABOD
               Turn around.  Now!


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER -- NIGHT

     Young	Masbath comes down the stairs, looking around meekly.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Hello?  Katrina?

     Masbath starts down a hall.  He does not see, in another
     room, Katrina's body is dragged across the floor.


     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

     The coach comes to Lancaster's.  Ichabod climbs out before it
     even stops fully, satchel in hand.  He hurries...

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT

     Doctor Lancaster, half asleep, comes to answer BANGING on his
     door.  Ichabod pushes past, taking Lancaster's lantern.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon the intrusion...

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod enters.  There are two coffins on the floor.

                             ICHABOD
               I never examined these bodies.

     Ichabod removes the lid from one coffin.  Lancaster is about
     to say something indignant, but then just looks disgusted.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               ... help yourself, you pompous ass.
               I will be in bed.

                             ICHABOD
               Would you stay, doctor?  I may need
               assistance.

     Lancaster reluctantly remains.  Ichabod stares at the dead
     Lady Van Tassel.  The neck wound is covered by a stained
     brown cloth, which Ichabod unwraps.

                             ICHABOD
               Stains of blood.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               What of it?

     Ichabod takes out one of the lenses that survived the
     magnification spectacles, bends to examine the neck.

                             ICHABOD
               Jagged flesh. 
                     (pause)
               The Horseman did not do this.

     Ichabod moves to the side of the coffin, lifting the hand
     with the stitched gash on its palm.

                             ICHABOD
               Here, Doctor.  Hold this just so...

     Lancaster holds the lens so that Ichabod can study the cut
     through it.  Ichabod takes a scalpel-like knife from his
     satchel, lifts the hand and cuts stitches.

     THROUGH THE LENS: the gash spreads easily, soft, bloodless.

                             ICHABOD 
               No clotting or gathering of pus.  No
               healing at all.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               What?

                             ICHABOD 
               When this cut was made, this person
               was already dead.
                     (stands straight)
               This is not Lady Van Tassel.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath enters.  The door swings shut.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Katrina.
                     (steps forward) 
               Is anyone here?

     Behind him, the door SLAMS open -- Lady Van Tassel reaches to
     grab Young Masbath by the throat.


     EXT.  CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod charges up to the church doors, pounding.

                             ICHABOD
               Open the door.  Open up, damn it!
                     (pounds, shouting)
               Lady van Tassel is alive.  The Horseman
               is her puppet.  Please... 

     The door opens and Huge Farmer points a rifle at Ichabod.
     Frightened people peer out from behind.

                             HUGE FARMER 
               Aren't we rid of you?

                             ICHABOD 
               Listen to me.  Lady Van Tassel has
               faked her death.  I need able men...

                             HUGE FARMER
               She's dead, and you have gone mad.

                             ICHABOD
               No...

                             HUGE FARMER 
                     (steps forward) 
               Get out!  Isn't it enough that you have
               ruined this town?  Go!

     Ichabod backs away from the gun, frustrated, runs...

     At the DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, Van Ripper is still on the coach.
     Ichabod sprints over, breathless, taking out his pistol.

                             ICHABOD
               Van Ripper... do you have a gun?

                             VAN RIPPER
               Yes.  Here...

     Van Ripper hold up a rifle.  Ichabod holds out his hand.

                             ICHABOD 
               May I see it?

     Van Ripper's confused, but hands the rifle over.  Ichabod
     immediately points his pistol at Van Ripper.

                             ICHABOD
               Get down.  Hurry!

     Van Ripper climbs off.  Ichabod climbs up, whips the horses.

                             ICHABOD 
               Sorry.

     Van Ripper watches the coach leave, still with his hands up.


     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     In a wooded area, Katrina lies unconscious.  Gloved hands
     reach to her hair and cut off a clump with SCISSORS.

     A conjuring pile has been made, containing a small animal's
     heart with an iron nail through it.  Katrina's hair is added
     and the pile is lit to burn.

     Nearby, Young Masbath watches, on his belly with his hands
     tied behind his back.

     Lady Van Tassel whispers over the fire, her white horse tied
     nearby.  She looks to Katrina, who stirs.

     Lady Van Tassel takes the Horseman's skull from a bag over
     her shoulder, places the skull in the flames.  THUNDER is
     HEARD.  Lady Van Tassel looks up, smiles.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT

     The wind tosses leaves in swirls.  The twisted tree opens
     wide, with a RUMBLE -- shafts of light shooting out.

     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod drives the coach hard ahead.

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Katrina sits up, groggy.  Lady Van Tassel looks down at her.

                             KATRINA 
               You... you are alive.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath
               dead along with me?

     Katrina sees Young Masbath, and beyond him, the dying fire.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               She commands the Horseman.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               And, quite beautifully done, wouldn't
               you say?  It is almost over.

     THUNDER again.  Wind starts to pick up.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
                     (of the wind) 
               He rides tonight.

                             KATRINA 
               Father saw you die.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman
               looming over me as I fled.  Things I
               wanted him to see.  But, as long as
               I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm
               me.  Baltus did not stay enough to
               see that.  He ran as a coward,
               unfettered by my fate.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Then, whose body was it... ?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               The precious servant girl Sarah.  I
               killed her and kept her body hidden,
               till I needed it.  And, when I
               return to the Hollow tomorrow, my
               version of the truth will come to
               pass. 
                     (faking meekness) 
               I mean, there I was that fateful day,
               following Baltus into the woods.  I
               did not know what he was up to...
               where he was going.  I worried for
               his safety.

     Katrina cautiously moves the hand she's supporting herself
     with, feels a rock and clutches it.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Imagine my surprise, finding him on a
               liason with a common servant.  A girl
               who had apparently become his secret
               love.

                             KATRINA 
               No one will believe your lies, whore.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               This whore will see your mouth shut
               forever very soon.  But... I am not
               going to kill you.  Not me...

     She picks up the Horseman's skull in her gloved hand.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               He will have that honor.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- NIGHT

     The Horseman rides Daredevil, a freight train of moldering
     flesh, heading towards a chasm with no bridge.

     They reach it, galloping in mid-air to the other side.

     EXT.  LONG STRAIGHT ROAD/VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod guides the coach into the Van Tassel orchard.

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Lady Van Tassel admires the skull.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL  
                     (mock sorrow) 
               Woe is me... that spying on my husband
               in his filthy indiscretion, I saw he
               and Sarah attacked by the Horseman.
               Oh pity me... so overcome was I that
               I wandered in the Western Woods...
               dazed... nearly blind from terror.

     Lady Van Tassel crouches, rubbing dirt on her face.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               And, tomorrow is my grand performance,
               having barely survived the elements...
                     (more emoting) 
               By sheer luck I found my way back to
               the Hollow.  But... what do I find
               here... ?  My dear, sweet step-daughter
               Katrina is dead.  Why has God forsaken
               her?

     Seeing that Lady Van Tassel lavish attention on Katrina,
     Masbath takes this opportunity to ease onto his knees.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
                     (of herself, pleased) 
               No one will suspect this sad woman who
               has been through such an ordeal.  With
               only the empty solace of her money and
               land to comfort her.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod leaps from the coach, bounds up the porch.

                             ICHABOD
               Katrina!

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     ICHABOD is HEARD.  Lady Van Tassel turns, astonished.

                             KATRINA
               Murderer!

     Katrina slings the rock -- strikes Lady Van Tassel in the
     head, a glancing blow that knocks her down.  Katrina runs.

     Katrina grips Young Masbath, helping him up...

     But, Lady Van Tassel scrambles up, grabs Katrina and throws
     her back to the ground.

     Lady Van Tassel steps hard on Katrina's ankle, touches her
     forehead, bleeding, pissed.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               You've been a naughty girl.

     Young Masbath leaps to action, charging head first -- slams
     into Lady Van Tassel, sends her backwards.

     Katrina runs and pulls Masbath up.  They flee.

                             KATRINA 
               Ichabod!

     Lady Van Tassel rolls, recovering, not very concerned.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Little bitch.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod comes out the open front doors... hearing...

                             KATRINA (o.s.) 
                     (far away) 
               Ichabod!

     Ichabod climbs back on the coach, taking off.

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Katrina and Young Masbath run out from a line of trees.

                             KATRINA 
               Ichabod!

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Here we are!

     BEHIND IN THE FOREST, Lady Van Tassel rides her white horse,
     in no hurry.  Wind kicks hard.  HOOFBEATS are HEARD.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Run, Katrina!  Fast as your pretty
               legs will carry you.  It makes no
               difference.

     ON THE LAWN, Ichabod drives towards Katrina and Masbath.

     Behind, at the tree line, Lady Van Tassel holds up the
     Horseman's skull, wind tossing her dress and hair.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Nothing will stop him now!

     At mid-field, Ichabod reaches Katrina and Masbath.

                             ICHABOD
               Climb up!

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Lady Van Tassel...

                             ICHABOD
               I know.  Hold on.

     With Katrina and Masbath on board, Ichabod turns the coach.
     Katrina unties Masbath's hands.  HOOFBEATS GET LOUDER.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Olly-olly oxen-free!

     Ichabod looks back towards Lady Van Tassel.

     At the treeline, the Horseman breaks into the open, hell on
     horseback.  Full speed ahead.

                             ICHABOD
               Christ.


     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT

     The coach hits the long straight road, away from the house.

     Katrina and Masbath hold on as the coach shakes violently.

                             KATRINA
               Where are we going?

                             ICHABOD
               I do not know.  Away.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Here he comes!

     Behind, the Horseman can be seen on the forest bordered road.
     Closing fast.  Breakneck pace.

                             ICHABOD
               We might make it to the church.

     Masbath takes a lantern, crawls back to the roof.

                             KATRINA
               Masbath... !

     He ignores, reaching the rear of the coach and throwing the
     lantern at the Horseman.  It smashes on the trail.

                             ICHABOD
               Damn it, boy, get back here!

     Young Masbath slides back.  Katrina helps him.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               What can we do?

                             ICHABOD
               Take the reins.

     Young Masbath takes them.  Ichabod slings Van Ripper's rifle
     over his shoulder and starts back.  Katrina grips him.

                             ICHABOD
               Masbath is right.  We must do something.

     She releases.  Ichabod gets to the luggage area at the rear,
     struggling to open a storage box.

     Behind, the Horseman draws his sword, closer.

     Ichabod opens the box, hefting out a long, jagged SAW.

                             KATRINA
               Ichabod!

     Ichabod looks.  The Horseman rides up, swinging...

     Ichabod recoils -- THWACK -- just missed by sword.

     The Horseman lets the coach get ahead, shifting to the
     other side of the trail... coming along side.

     Ichabod backpedals, looking to Masbath.

                             ICHABOD
               Keep him off!  Block him!

     Masbath guides the horses over.  The Horseman must fall
     behind to avoid the wheels.

     The coach hits a large, fallen tree trunk.

     Ichabod bounces, falling...

     He hangs off the side of the coach.

     Katrina climbs to offer her hand.  Ichabod offers the saw.

                             ICHABOD
               Take it!

     Katrina takes the saw.  Now with both hands, Ichabod tries
     for better purchase.  He grips the coach door.  It opens...

     Ichabod clings to the open door as branches slam him.

     He's reaching to the coach threshold, reaching...

     Ichabod pulls himself inside.

     BOOM -- the door hits a tree trunk, bashed to pieces.

     Ichabod looks out from the coach, dazed.  He climbs.

     Katrina looks back as Young Masbath guides the coach to block
     the Horseman again.

     The Horseman sheaths his sword, riding... reaching to grip
     the back corner of the coach.

     The Horseman dismounts, clinging, climbing...

     Ichabod takes the rifle off his shoulder, aiming...

     BANG! -- splattering the Horseman's hand point blank.  The
     Horseman hangs on with his other hand.

     The Horseman re-grips with the blasted hand, amazing since
     it's now all mush and bone.

     Ichabod throws the rifle on his way to the driver's perch,
     taking the saw from Katrina.

                             ICHABOD 
               Move forward!

     Katrina looks to the horses, then at Ichabod.

                             ICHABOD
               Go!

     Ichabod takes the reins from Young Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               Help her.

     Reins in one hand and saw in the other, Ichabod waits.  The
     Horseman rises up and moves in, taking out his sword.

     Young Masbath climbs down to the wooden pole connecting the
     coach to the bridles, puts out his hand.  Katrina takes it.

     Behind, the Horseman swings.  Ichabod blocks with the saw.

     Young Masbath guides Katrina as she leaps onto one horse.
     Bareback.  Young Masbath straddles the horse beside her.

     The Horseman swings, backhanded knocks the sword from
     Ichabod's hand as Ichabod falls back...

     Ichabod hits the bridle post, hanging onto straps for dear
     life.  His feet drag on the trail.

     Above, the Horseman comes to the driver's perch, close enough
     to kill Katrina.  He raises his sword...

     Katrina screams, ducking, helpless...

     Below, Ichabod pulls a bolt from the coach's hitching-rod.

     He shoves off with his feet.

     The Horseman swings.... missing.

     The horses detach from the coach, dragging Ichabod along.

     The coach careens out of control.

     It flies off the trail, hits an incline and sails off,
     throwing the Horseman.

     The coach hits a tree trunk and SMASHES.

     FURTHER DOWN THE TRAIL, the coach horses stop.  Young Masbath
     and Katrina climb off as Ichabod gets to his feet, hurting,
     clutching his previously wounded shoulder.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               What now?

                             ICHABOD
               I doubt that's the end.

                             KATRINA
               The church.

                             ICHABOD
               He moves too fast.

     Ichabod unhooks a lantern off the bridle rail.  The trail
     behind is silent, till a bone chilling SCREECH is HEARD.

                             KATRINA
               What was that?

                             ICHABOD
               His horse.

     They start moving.  Ichabod looks around.  He sees...

                             ICHABOD
               There...

     Through the tree line, the Hollow's massive windmill can be
     seen against the sky.  Katrina and Young Masbath run.


     EXT. WINDMILL FIELD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath book into this open area,
     heading to the windmill.  Another HORRIBLE SQUEAL echoes.

     Ichabod looks over his shoulder.

     Heavy, low hanging BRANCHES and VINES at the forest edge
     creep to life, parting... forming a sort of black tunnel.

                             ICHABOD 
               He's coming!

     The Horseman gallops out, throwing leaves in his wake.

                             ICHABOD 
               Hurry!

     The Horseman readies a battle axe.

     Ichabod gets under the windmill, helping Young Masbath up the
     ladder and in.  Katrina next.

     The Horseman is almost there.

     Ichabod follows Katrina.  He gets in, feet dangling.  The
     Horseman dismounts...

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod leaps up and struggles with the heavy trap door...
     slams it.  He closes the latch just as the Horseman hits.
     The door buckles.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               It won't hold.

     Ichabod goes to a large GRINDSTONE against a wall.  He
     struggles to roll it.

     Young Masbath helps him roll it to the trap door.  It falls
     on top with a thud.  The Horseman's sword jabs up through the
     grindstone's center hole.

     The sword withdraws.  A POUNDING begins.

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The Horseman chops at the door with his axe.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     POUNDING CONTINUES.  The grindstone shifts.  Katrina and
     Young Masbath back away.  Ichabod holds his lantern up,
     desperate for ideas, searching.

     Above, to the right, is the milling platform, where grain is
     ground and bagged.  To the left is the crooked staircase.

     Ichabod picks up a bailing hook, a plan forming.  He gives
     his lantern to Katrina and points.

                             ICHABOD 
               Get up those stairs.  Open the door to
               the roof and wait.

     Katrina and Young Masbath obey.  Ichabod crosses and climbs
     the ladder to the milling platform.  He grasps a wooden
     lever, pulling it.  Gears above begin to turn.

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The windmill's rotors CREAK to life, spinning.

     UNDER THE WINDMILL, the Horseman keeps chopping.  His axe
     exposes grindstone, throwing sparks.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Katrina looks down from the stairs.

     The Horseman's axe pries at the seam of the trap door.

                             KATRINA
               Ichabod...

                             ICHABOD
               Keep climbing.  I will follow...

     Ichabod pulls bags of grain, lining them up at the edge of
     the milling platform.

                             ICHABOD
                     (under his breath) 
               Hopefully.

     ABOVE, Young Masbath reaches the ceiling, throws open the
     door to the roof.

     BELOW, Ichabod cuts holes into the grain bags, so milled
     grain spills out and falls to the floor, creating dust.

     He grabs one open bag and dumps it.  More grain dust.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

     Masbath and Katrina come out.  Rotors spin behind them.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod sees below... the Horseman sticks a hand through,
     trying to push the grindstone aside, then withdrawing.  The
     RACKING axe continues.  Won't be long.

     Ichabod grabs one half-full bag of grain, swings it with
     effort, throws...

     The bag smashes on the grindstone, busting the door...

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The grindstone falls through, SLAMMING the Horseman down...

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod slices into a sack hanging from a pulley system.
     More and more dust rises.

     Below, the Horseman enters.  Katrina shouts from above.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Look out!

     The Horseman moves toward the ladder milling platform ladder,
     but Ichabod grabs it, pulling it up...

     The Horseman just misses the final rung.

     Ichabod throws the ladder aside as the Horseman backs off.

     Ichabod looks to the staircase.  No way to climb down from
     the milling platform and get there.

     The Horseman runs and leaps, grabbing a hanging chain...

     The Horseman climbs the chain, swinging...

     Ichabod runs across the platform, jumps...

     Ichabod grasps the frail rail of the staircase, barely.

     The rail creaks, about to break.  Behind, the Horseman lands
     on the milling platform.

     Ichabod is losing grip.  Young Masbath races down the stairs,
     grabs his hand.  He pulls Ichabod up.

     Ichabod's pistol slips from its holster and falls.

     Ichabod and Young Masbath look...

     The Horseman, following Ichabod's lead, runs across the
     milling platform and leaps...

     Grabs the staircase rail, only a few feet from Ichabod and
     Masbath.  Ichabod kicks the rail, breaking it...

     The Horseman falls in billowing dust, crashing below.

     Ichabod pushes Masbath up the stairs.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

     Katrina helps them onto the roof.

                             KATRINA
               Quickly, close it.

                             ICHABOD 
               No.
                     (takes lantern, points) 
               Get to the crest of the roof and be
               ready to jump.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Jump?  Jump where?

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The Horseman runs, agile, up stairs.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

     Ichabod shepherds Katrina and Young Masbath to the edge where
     the rotors spin close.

                             ICHABOD 
               The blades will carry us to the ground.
               Face front and wait for me.

                             KATRINA 
               I... I can't do this.

                             ICHABOD 
               We have no choice.

     Ichabod moves back to the trap door.

     Katrina and Young Masbath look at the rotors, and down at the
     long distance between them and the ground.

                             ICHABOD 
               Be ready...

     Ichabod throws the lantern into the windmill and runs.

                             ICHABOD
               Now!

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The Horseman continues up.  The lantern falls past.

     EXT.  WINDMILL, ROOF -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath jumps.  Ichabod grips Katrina and jumps...

     They hit one rotor and cling to the frame and cloth.  The
     rotor begins its downwards swing.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The lantern hits the ground and shatters.  FLAMES EXPLODE!

     Grain dust is consumed instantaneously -- FLAMES ROAR
     upwards, filling the windmill...

     Engulfing the Horseman.

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The rotor is halfway to its lowest point.  Masbath, Katrina
     and Ichabod hang on as the entire structure trembles.

     BOOM -- flames shoot out the windows, doors and seams,
     lighting up the night.

     On the rattling rotor, Ichabod struggles to hold the frame
     with one hand and keep a grip on Katrina.

     Masbath drops.  Ichabod releases Katrina, then drops.

     They hit the ground.  Ichabod rolls, gasping, holding his
     shoulder.  They all look at each other in disbelief a moment.
     Ichabod lets out a sort of rasping laugh, standing.

                             ICHABOD 
               Okay... come on...

     Ichabod ushers them across the field, uphill.  Running.
     Lightning flashes across the sky.  THUNDER RUMBLES.

     A bolt strikes the windmill, and it EXPLODES...

     SHOCKWAVE DEAFENING.  The rotors bust apart.  Splinters of
     burning wood spin all directions.

     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath keep
     running.  There is a WOODEN CART parked ahead.

     IN THE WINDMILL RUBBLE, the Horseman rises, shoving off
     burning debris.  His flame-ravaged uniform smolders.

     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod stumbles onwards, but notices
     something horrible...

     In the distance, Lady Van Tassel's white horse roams free.

                             ICHABOD
                     (as this registers)
               Oh, no...

     Young Masbath and Katrina are just past the cart when Lady
     Van Tassel rises from behind it, swings a plank...

     SLAMS Ichabod in the chest and sends him down.

     Lady Van Tassel grabs Katrina's hair, drags her.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Should have stayed away, Constable.

     Ichabod gets up slow, furious, reaches to his holster, only
     to find it empty.  He moves forward.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Keep back, or I kill her.

     She takes out scissors, holds them to Katrina's neck.
     Katrina ceases struggling.

     Ichabod keeps Masbath behind him, keeps his distance.  Lady
     Van Tassel shoots a glance...

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               See him...

     Par off, the Horseman strides from the wreckage.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               You cannot kill what is already dead.

                             ICHABOD
               Let her go!

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Yes... yes.  I think I will...

     Lady Van Tassel spins and throws Katrina in the cart, shoving
     against it.

                             ICHABOD
               No!

     The cart rolls downhill.  Ichabod moves forward.

     Lady Van Tassel turns, brandishing the scissors, slashing and
     missing.  Ichabod backs off.

     DOWNHILL, the cart picks up speed, headed for the Horseman.

     The Horseman starts running to meet it.

     UPHILL, Lady Van Tassel grins.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Say goodbye to her.

     Lady Van Tassel lunges, stabbing.  Ichabod avoids, puts all
     his fury behind his fist -- punches her in the face.

     Lady Van Tassel hits the ground and her bag falls open,
     sending the Horseman's skull rolling out...

     The skull rolls... rolls... landing far away.

     DOWNHILL, Katrina leaps out from the cart...

     She lands hard...

     The Horseman shoves the empty cart aside, still on the move.

     UPHILL, Ichabod sees the skull.  He runs towards it.

     Lady van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the ankle.  He falls.

     DOWNHILL, Katrina runs back.  The Horseman is catching up.

     UPHILL, Ichabod tries to pull f ree from Lady Van Tassel.

     Young Masbath comes behind her - BAM - hits her in the head
     with the wooden plank.  She's out.

     Ichabod scrambles to his feet.

     DOWNHILL, the Horseman catches Katrina, taking her by the
     hair as she falls to her knees and screams.

     UPHILL, Ichabod runs... grasps the Horseman's skull.

     He runs towards the Horseman and Katrina.

     DOWNHILL, Katrina struggles, but the Horseman holds her ready
     by her hair... raises his sword...

     UPHILL, Ichabod throws the skull...

                             ICHABOD 
               Horseman!

     The skull spins through the air...

     The Horseman drops Katrina, reaches up...

     Catches the skull.

     Katrina runs.

     Ichabod runs to meet her, grabs her as she falls, exhausted.
     Together, they back away from the Horseman.

     The Horseman holds the skull out, then brings it to his
     shoulders, to its rightful place.  THUNDER POUNDS.

     TRANSFORMATION begins -- blood and flesh rise up from the
     Horseman's throat and grip the skull.

     Young Masbath drops the plank, watching in awe.

     The Horseman's reformation continues.  Muscle forms.  Liquids
     become solids.  He is made whole once more, the same evil,
     human face we saw in Baltus' stories.

     He looks to Ichabod and Katrina, touches his restored face.

     Daredevil rides up, SCREECHING.  The Horseman replaces his
     sward and climbs into the saddle.

     He rides towards Katrina and Ichabod, but passes them by.
     They are so exhausted they fall down.

     Young Masbath backs up as the Horseman comes, but the
     Horseman does not want him either.

     The Horseman leans to grab Lady Van Tassel's unconscious
     form, pulls her up across Daredevil's back.

     He rides away with her.

     Ichabod and Katrina watch him go.  They look at each other,
     then kiss gratefully.

     Ichabod looks to Young Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               How are you?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Tired.

     Ichabod smiles and holds out his arm.  Masbath comes over.
     Group hug.  Lightning brightens the farmland around them.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, BURIAL GROUND -- NIGHT

     HOOFBEATS.  The Horseman enters the clearing, keeping a hand
     on Lady Van Tassel.  Ahead, the twisted tree awaits.

     Lady Van Tassel is awakening, face bloody.  She turns her
     head and looks forward.  She screams.

     The twisted tree's wound opens, wide and glowing.

     Daredevil picks up speed...

     Daredevil leaps just as a lightning bolt blasts down,
     striking the Horseman.

     For an instant, Horseman and horse are transformed, SKELETONS
     OF LIGHT, entering the tree.

     Silence and smoke.  At the tree, Lady Van Tassel's hand
     sticks out from the tight-shut suture.

     The sewn wound on her palm seeps blood.


     EXT.  NEW YORK CITY STREET, ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY

     A bright, busy day in New York.  A coach pulls up to
     Ichabod's home.  Ichabod is the driver.  He gets off, goes
     and opens the coach door.  He helps Katrina down.  Next,
     Young Masbath sticks his head out.

     Ichabod goes about unloading bags.  Katrina holds Young
     Masbath's hand, and they look down the street in wonder.

     THE END

              A pleasing land of drowsy head it was,
              of dreams that wave before the half shut eye...










     EXT.  GNARLED FOREST -- NIGHT

     An UGLY MAN charges through on a horse, holding a lantern
     forward on a long pole. He looks back, terrified.

     INSERT TITLE:  1799 Sleepy Hollow, New York

     THUNDEROUS HOOFBEATS are HEARD behind.

     The ugly man glances back again.  His lantern swings wild...
     SHATTERS against a tree.  The jammed-up pole SLAMS the ugly
     man off his horse...

     He hits the ground.  He runs, trips, falls and scrambles up.

     DEEP IN THE FOREST, we glimpse the source of the HOOFBEATS: a
     HUGE FORM on a HUGE BLACK HORSE, already gone.

     The ugly man pushes through thorny bushes.  Jagged branches
     slit his hands and cheeks.

     He bursts from the briar patch and tumbles to a trail.  He
     lifts his bloodied face.  He runs.

     IN THE FOREST BEHIND: the hooves of the black horse rip
     underbrush.  HOOFBEATS DEAFENING.  A spur digs into the
     snorting steed's already bleeding flank.

     The pursuer's gloved hand draws a SWORD, blade RINGING.

     ON THE TRAIL, the ugly man runs on.  The shrill WHISTLE of a
     SWORD SWING is HEARD as the pursuer blurs past.

     The ugly man is still running when his head lolls back, at an
     impossible angle... tumbles off his shoulders... His headless
     body hits the dirt.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS -- NIGHT

     Empty cobblestone streets.  Crooked buildings.  A RAPIDLY
     CLANGING BELL breaks the silence from afar.

     INSERT TITLE:  New York City

     TWO CONSTABLES clamor round a corner, lanterns held high,
     listening.  They rush into an alleyway.

     ELSEWHERE, piers border the Hudson River.  The BELL is
     LOUDER. The two constables arrive, searching.  No one around.
     Constable One hefts his pistol, scared.

                             CONSTABLE ONE
               Where are you?!

                             MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
               Here!  Over here!

     They hurry to the river's edge.  Down a hill, the MAN,
     another constable, stands with his back to us.  He's waist
     deep in water, tossing away his ALARM BELL.

                             MAN
               I need your help with this.

     Constable Two crosses on the peir above.  Constable One moves
     forward, wary.  The MAN grunts, lifting something.

                             CONSTABLE ONE
               Constable Crane?  Ichabod Crane...
               is that you?

     The MAN turns.  Meet ICHABOD CRANE, handsome, eyes piercing.

                             ICHABOD
               Yes, it is me.  But, not only me...
                     (lifting, struggling)
               I found someone here...

     He drags a bloated MALE CORPSE up from the murky water.

                             ICHABOD
               Someone quite dead.


     EXT.  WATCHHOUSE/JAIL -- NIGHT

     The elderly HIGH CONSTABLE lifts a blanket off the corpse on
     a wheelbarrow manned by Constable Two.  A snobby MAGISTRATE
     looks, disgusted.  Constable One and Ichabod wait.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Burn it.

                             CONSTABLE ONE
               Yes, sir.

     Constable Two wheels the corpse inside.  Ichabod's dismayed.

                             ICHABOD
               Just a moment... if I may.  It is
               possible this man was murdered.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               He drowned.  Anyone could see.

                             ICHABOD
               There are surgical ways of telling
               how he died... by the water in his
               lungs...

     Ichabod follows the High Constable and Magistrate in.

     INT.  WATCHHOUSE, NIGHT WATCH QUARTERS -- NIGHT

     Constable Two wheels the body ahead past many "booking"
     tables.  A JAILER moves to unlock a massive door.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               He will be burned pursuant to
               statutes of health.

                             ICHABOD
               I could determine if he were dead
               before he went into the Hudson.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Must we again hear these heretical
               rantings?

                             MAGISTRATE
               Yes, must we?

                             ICHABOD
               There is nothing heretical about
               science, sir.  The Chinese have
               written on it for hundreds of
               years... procedural study used to
               solve seemingly unsolvable crimes.

     The door is opened.  The corpse again leads the way.

     INT.  WATCHHOUSE, JAIL -- NIGHT

     A two-tiered prison, alive with MOANS of AGONY and CRIES of
     INSANITY.  Cells are full of wretched men in chains and iron
     gags.  Many are against the bars, watching.

                             ICHABOD
               Our first night watch is adequate
               against fire and some violence,
               but if we were more often able to
               ensure justice, after the fact,
               then criminals would truly have
               something to fear from law
               enforcement.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Have they nothing to fear presently?

                             ICHABOD
               Without disrespect, look around you.
                     (motioning to cells)
               We overflow.  As do our courts.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               And, with disrespect, Constable,
               if jails and courts overflow, it is
               testimony to success, not failure.

                             ICHABOD
               But, how many innocents rot here?
               And, how many victims are buried
               without reprisal while guilty men
               roam our streets?

     The High Constable reaches a desk, taking a seat.  Guards
     wait to process beaten, bloody prisoners.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Very few, if any.

                             ICHABOD
               Even though I have seen confessions
               pried from the lips of the accused,
               often quite literally?

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               For one who calls himself a
               Federalist, your mouth reeks of
               Republican liberalism.

                             ICHABOD
               Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.

                             MAGISTRATE
                     (to High Constable)
               Um, sir... might I suggest...

     The Magistrate WHISPERS in the High Constable's ear.  Ichabod
     notices with worry that Constables One and Two wheel the
     corpse onwards into another room.

     The Magistrate finishes.  The High Constable smiles faintly.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
                     (to Ichabod)
               There is a farming community
               upstate, Constable... ten days
               journey north in the Hudson
               Highlands.  It is named Sleepy
               Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three
               persons have been murdered there.
               Each with their head lopped cleanly
               off.
                     (holds up papers)
               The elders of the Hollow have sent
               dispatches to me, requesting
               assistance, and now, just this very
               moment, I have chosen you.

                             ICHABOD
               Chosen me?

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               These "methods" of yours... there
               has been no practical application.

                             ICHABOD
               Not for lack of trying.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Just so.  Granted.  And so you take
               your experimentations to Sleepy
               Hollow and catch the murderer who
               has tainted the place.  Bring him
               here to face our good justice.
               Will you do this for me?

                             ICHABOD
                     (swallowing doubt)
               I shall, gladly.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Excellent.  Then, you are excused
               till morning.

     Ichabod moves away, heading to where the corpse was taken.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Oh, and, Constable...
                     (off Ichabod's look)
               Do make certain that you meet with
               success.  Otherwise... perhaps you
               should not come back at all.

     The High Constable smiles a sardonic smile.

     INT.  WATCHHOUSE, INCINERATION ROOM -- NIGHT

     The corpse burns in a raging furnace.  Flesh sizzles.

     Constable One pumps bellows which fan the flames.  Ichabod
     steps from darkness nearby.  He watches with bitter regret as
     the corpse is consumed.


     EXT.  CITY -- DAY

     Market town streets bustle.  Filthy.  Pigs roam free.

     INT.  ICHABOD'S HOME, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY

     Decorated in Early-American Mad Scientist: books, papers and
     jars of chemicals.  Charts of anatomy above a small bed.

                             ICHABOD (o.s.)
               Such a day for such a sad farewell.
               But, this is goodbye, my sweet.

     At the window, Ichabod holds a bird cage with a red CARDINAL
     inside.  He opens the cage.  The bird flies free.

     Ichabod watches it go, then looks down.  A COACH halts in the
     street below.  The forlorn DRIVER looks up.


     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- DAY

     In motion.  Ichabod absently studies his hands, touching the
     strange SCARS on both palms: evenly dispersed, tiny dots of
     tissue.  Many scars.

     Ichabod lifts a LEATHER SATCHEL, checking its contents.

     EXT.  UPSTATE FORESTS -- DAY

     TWO FAMILIES of MIGRANT WORKERS travel a path, leading over-
     burdened horses.  Ichabod's coach approaches from the other
     direction.  Ichabod looks out, unnerved.

     One GAUNT MAN watches Ichabod pass.  There is a dead, worried
     look in the man's eyes.  Others stare at Ichabod.


     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY

     Ichabod faces two massive, vine-covered PILLARS, unsure.  He
     turns to watch the driver lead the coach away.

     Ichabod walks between the pillars to a long straight road.
     He does not notice, above: THREE DEAD RAVENS hang from a tree
     limb, twine wrapped round their necks.

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, TOWN SQUARE -- DAY

     Ichabod walks on with baggage.  The square is empty, a CHURCH
     and GRAVEYARD at one end.  The road ahead is bordered by
     businesses and homes.

     CONVERSATION DRIFTS from a tavern.  A criminal sits in
     stocks.  A quiet CRYING is HEARD.  Ichabod hears...

     He looks for its source.  It's from a window above, LOUDER.
     SOUNDS like the SOBBING of an OLD WOMAN.


     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- DAY

     ICHABOD'S P.O.V.: a BELLTOWER stands tall, like a mast pole
     with a crow's nest basket atop.  There's a man in the basket
     and a huge BELL.

     Ichabod ponders this as he continues.  Ahead on a hill: the
     grand Van Tassel Manor House.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL MANOR HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- DAY

     MANY CHILDREN, in a circle, taunt a BLINDFOLDED YOUNG WOMAN
     spun round by the handsome, barrel-chested man, BROM VAN
     BRUNT.  A few YOUNG MEN and LADIES watch.  Brom releases the
     woman.  Everyone quiets and avoids her searching hands.

                             BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
               This is such a silly game.

                             BROM
               Be a sport and stop complaining.

     The woman moves to Brom's voice.  He backs away, flanked by
     peers GLENN and THEODORE.  Children laugh.

     Ichabod enters, clearing his throat.  No one notices.  The
     blindfolded woman keeps grasping.  One LITTLE GIRL sees
     Ichabod and goes to him, finger to her lips.

                             LITTLE GIRL
               Play along.  You must.

     She tugs him.  Before Ichabod can protest, he is placed in
     the blindfolded woman's grip.

                             BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
               There, I have someone.  Am I
               finished?

                             LITTLE GIRL
               You have to tell who it is.

     The woman touches Ichabod's face.  He is uncomfortable,
     affected by this caress.  Brom watches jealously.

                             LITTLE GIRL
               At least make a guess.

                             BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
               I don't know.  Is it Brom Bones?

                             BROM
               Certainly not.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me, Miss...
                     (takes her hands)
               They have a laugh at your expense.

     She takes the kerchief off to reveal a stunning beauty:
     KATRINA VAN TASSEL.  Ichabod tries to compose himself.

                             KATRINA
               Forgive me, I didn't know.

                             ICHABOD
               I... I am looking for Baltus Van
               Tassel.

                             BROM
               We haven't heard your name yet,
               friend.

                             ICHABOD
               Well, unless your name is Baltus,
               you should not worry over mine.

     Brom grabs Ichabod's collar, pissed.  Ichabod's baffled.

                             BROM
               You need some manners.

                             KATRINA
               Brom!

     Brom looks at her, then reluctantly releases Ichabod.

                             MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
               What is this, then... ?

     BALTUS VAN TASSEL, 45, has entered, a working-class
     aristocrat.  LADY VAN TASSEL, 40, stands behind, a mix of
     home-spun wife and well-kept lady.

                             BALTUS
               Can I help you, sir?

     Ichabod's relieved to have a proper focal point.  Children
     gather around Katrina and hide behind her.

                             ICHABOD
               I have been sent from the city
               with a letter of introduction.
               I am told you offer me room and
               board.

     Ichabod hands over papers.  Baltus reads, furrows his brow.

                             ICHABOD
               If we could speak alone.

                             BALTUS
                     (nods, looks to Katrina)
               This is not a time for frivolity,
               Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?

                             KATRINA
               They're only children, father.

     Baltus snorts, then exits with Ichabod.  The others huddle to
     gossip, except Katrina, who moves beside Lady Van Tassel to
     watch Ichabod and Baltus walk down the hall.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- DAY

     DOCTOR LANCASTER, 50, dour and always sweaty, takes a seat by
     the fire, joining Baltus and three other elders.  A pretty
     servant, SARAH, brings a pipe cradle while Lady Van Tassel
     sets down food.  Ichabod is standing.

                             BALTUS
               That will be all, ladies.
                     (waits as they exit)
               We are joined by Doctor Thomas
               Lancaster, Constable.  And to his
               left are, Clergyman Steenwyck and
               our able magistrate, Samuel Philipse,
               both keeping order in their own ways.

     PHILIPSE is youngest, eyes bloodshot, mug in hand and pipe in
     mouth.  CLERGYMAN STEENWYCK is formidably built, wearing a
     constant look of disapproval.

                             BALTUS
               I myself am in charge of financial
               matters and the regulation of
               currency in our commonwealth.  And,
               lastly, this fine fellow is James
               Hardenbrook, our Notary.

     HARDENBROOK is oldest, ancient, with one eye pale and blind.

                             ICHABOD
               An honor, gentlemen.  In time I
               will need every detail of the
               three murderings you've had, but,
               for now, I ask only if you have
               any theory at all as to who the
               killer might be?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               Excuse me?

                             ICHABOD
               I say, is there any one person
               suspect in these acts?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               I was afraid of this.

     Philipse shoots a look to Baltus.  Angst amongst the elders.

                             PHILIPSE
               Well, Constable... are you aware...
               to be honest, you are not what we
               expected.  We sent for the militia.

                             ICHABOD
               The militia?

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               Why not tell us what you have heard?
               Hmm?  How much have your superiors
               bothered to tell you?

                             ICHABOD
               All I know is three are slain, their
               heads found severed from their
               bodies...

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               The heads were not found severed.
               The heads were not found at all.

     Withered Hardenbrook leans forward, his voice cragged.

                             HARDENBROOK
               Taken.  Taken by the Headless
               Horseman.  Taken back to hell.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon me?

                             BALTUS
               You have not been well informed of
               our troubles, sir.  If you would...

     Baltus gestures for Ichabod to sit.  Baltus lights his pipe.

                             BALTUS
               The Horseman... he was a Hessian
               mercenary, sent to our shores by
               German princes to help keep
               Americans under the thumb of
               England.  However, unlike his
               compatriots who came as muscle in
               trade for currency, he came
               willingly.  For love of carnage.

     FLASHBACK -- AMERICAN BATTLEFIELD -- DAY

     The HESSIAN HORSEMAN rides his black steed into a gory,
     close-quarters clash, his cloaked uniform adorned with edged
     weapons.  He cuts down Americans left and right.

                             BALTUS (v.o.)
               He was infamous for taking his
               horse, Daredevil, hard into
               battle... chopping off heads at
               full gallop.

     He dismounts, hoisting a battle axe.  With sword and axe, he
     annihilates.  Blood gushes.  Bones crack.

                             BALTUS (v.o.)
               Just to look on him made your
               blood run cold, for he had filed
               down his teeth to rapiers... to
               add to the ferocity of his
               appearance.

     The Horseman lets out a war cry.  Jagged teeth.  Grotesque.

     FOREST BATTLEFIELD -- DAY

     Winter.  CANNONS can be HEARD BOOMING from afar.  Daredevil
     lies dead in red snow.  FOLLOW FOOTPRINTS away...

                             BALTUS (v.o.)
               He would not finally meet his end
               till the winter of seventy-nine,
               when New York City was held by
               Henry Clinton and Washington
               occupied West Point.  It was
               between those two places, not far
               from here...

     The Horseman flees, cloak flowing, chased by FIVE rag-tag
     REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS.  Ahead, a steep, rocky area prevents
     escape.  Soldier one aims a rifle and FIRES...

     Blood explodes from the Horseman's arm as he runs.  His sword
     falls from his now functionless hand.

     Soldier Two grabs the sword.

     At the rocks, the Horseman faces the men.  Another Rifleman
     raises his rifle.  The Horseman reaches over his shoulder to
     grasp a sheathed knife, THROWS --

     THOCK!  The Rifleman jerks back, knife in his eye socket.

     The Horseman readies an axe.  The Revolutionaries move in
     with swords.  They battle, STEEL AGAINST STEEL.  The Horseman
     fends off blows from all sides.

     Soldier Three lunges, stabs his blade deep into the
     Horseman's side.  The Horseman roars, brings his axe DOWN...
     BREAKS the sword at the hilt...

     An UPWARDS stroke sends Soldier Three head over heels in a
     fountain of blood.

     The Horseman staggers, howling, trying to pull the blade from
     his ribs.  The remaining soldiers close in.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Pipe smoke wafts from Philipse's mouth.

                             PHILIPSE
               Cut off his head with his own sword.
               It's a legend told for twenty years.

                             BALTUS
               But, only recently has the Headless
               Hessian been seen prowling the
               Hollow, in search of a head to suit
               his shoulders.

                             ICHABOD
               Just a moment...
                     (sits back, incredulous)
               Are you saying it is he?

                             HARDENBROOK
                     (aggravated, loud)
               When a goblin leaps from the nether
               world, others follow.  Poltergeists
               of the air, water and earth follow
               and cheer his desecrations!

     Hardenbrook BANGS his cane on a table.  Baltus puts a calming
     hand on senile Hardenbrook's shoulder.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               No one knows why he chose to now to
               climb out from his grave.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               It is very clear why.  Citizens
               here have long tried to hide sins
               behind closed doors.  Their failed
               faith has saturated the soil and
               called forth one of Satan's own.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who
               has seen this Horseman?

                             BALTUS
               Many have.

                             ICHABOD
               Then, name one person who has seen
               him with their own eyes.

     A long wait.  No reply from the elders.  Ichabod rises.

                             ICHABOD
               While I will do everything I can
               to find your assassin, I will look
               for a man of flesh and blood.  Not
               some goblin-demon from hell.


     EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- EARLY EVENING

     The Belltower is covered in defensive spikes.  A man climbs
     down a rope ladder.  Below, many ARMED MEN gather.  Everyone
     grim.  Philipse moves to the center, on horseback.

                             PHILIPSE
               Gather round!  Gather and quiet!
               The hour has come to choose for
               this night.  Each man's name is
               in this box and has been checked.

     A box is handed up.  Ichabod and Baltus arrive on foot at the
     back of the mob.  Ichabod looks...

     At a nearby forest, men light TORCH POSTS in a line bordering
     the forest edge for at least a half mile.

     Philipse draws a folded paper from the box, holds it up.

                             PHILIPSE
               May the Lord watch over him...
                     (unfolds paper)
               "Jonathan Masbath."  Are you here?

                             JONATHAN (o.s.)
               I am.  I take my responsibility.

     The crowd parts as JONATHAN MASBATH, a dirt-poor farmer with
     a bow and quiver of arrows, moves forward.  His son, YOUNG
     MASBATH, 14, grips his arm.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               No, father.  Wait...
                     (up to Philipse)
               He's already been up once.  Why
               does he go again?

                             JONATHAN
               It is a lottery, son.  It just as
               easily might have been one of them.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Then... I go with you.

                             JONATHAN
               No.  You obey my wishes.
                     (looks to crowd)
               Brom.  Look after him, will you?

     Brom steps up, nodding.  Jonathan kisses his son's cheek,
     then heads to the rope ladder.  Men pat him on the back.

                             PHILIPSE
               Someone leave him a horse.

     Young Masbath watches his father go.  Brom coaxes him away.
     At the back of the crowd, Ichabod watches skeptically, looks
     to Young Masbath as he and Brom pass.

                             ICHABOD
               You worry for naught, little man.
               Nothing will harm him there.
                     (looks up, sotto)
               It is problems here on the ground
               you people need begin to worry
               about.

     Ichabod watches Jonathan climb, very high above.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod makes notations in a LEDGER BOOK.

                             KATRINA (v.o.)
               You will dream.

     Katrina strolls in, sits on the bed.  Ichabod is nervous.

                             KATRINA
               Did they tell?  It is something in
               the air so that dreams come to
               everyone.  According to the elders,
               an Indian prophet held powwows here
               before the land was taken, and
               spells cast then still linger to
               this day.

                             ICHABOD
               Do you often make a habit of
               sitting on strange men's beds?

                             KATRINA
               You are horribly old-fashioned,
               aren't you?

                             ICHABOD
               Feel free to form your own opinion.
                     (facing his ledger)
               Though it appears you already have.

                             KATRINA
               Well, I intended to apologize for
               the behavior of my friend Brom Van
               Brunt, but it seems I've made
               matters worse.
                     (getting up to go)
               I'll leave you to your business.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me... I should apologize.  I,
               um... I... have no great love of...

                             KATRINA
               Other people?

                             ICHABOD
               Small talk.

                             KATRINA
               It might have been more.  Might have
               been positively grand talk.

     Ichabod offers his chair, backing away.  Seeing it is the
     only one, he remains standing.  Katrina sits.

                             KATRINA
               Is it me, or are you this nervous
               around all women?

                             ICHABOD
               Perhaps it is because your suitor's
               hands were recently very nearly
               wrapped around my throat.

                             KATRINA
               My suitor?

                             ICHABOD
               The massive fellow... Brom.  For
               someone you call "friend," he
               misplaces a good portion of jealousy.

                             KATRINA
               He has proposed to me twice.

                             ICHABOD
               Which may explain his temperament.
               To have asked twice means the answer
               was "no" at least once.

     Katrina looks down, discards this with a smile.

                             KATRINA
               I've read a great deal about your
               New York City.  Do be a dear and tell
               me all about it.  Sounds like an
               extraordinary place to live a life.

                             ICHABOD
               Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you
               tell me about the Headless Horseman.


     EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT

     The torches burn bright.  ABOVE, in the Belltower, Jonathan
     Masbath loads a rifle.  THUNDER BOOMS.

     Jonathan stands, looking to a sky that is all stars and moon.
     A HORSE is HEARD SHRIEKING.  Below, the horse tied at the
     base of the tower is spooked.

     A COMMOTION is HEARD, ground rumbling.  Jonathan grips a
     rifle, cocks it and moves to look...

     At the forest edge, a herd of deer stampedes out.  They
     sprint past the tower and across the field.

     Jonathan crosses to watch the herd scatter.  He crosses back
     to peer at the forest.  Bad news...

     A thick FOG creeps from the woods.

     As the fog overtakes the base of each torch, a tentacle of
     mist snakes up to the flame, killing it.  All along the
     forest, arms of vapor snuff torches... one by one by one...

     Above, Jonathan sights the rifle along the trees.

                             JONATHAN
               Come out, devil... come....


     INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod leans on a dresser.  Katrina's still seated.

                             KATRINA
               Not all think it is the Horseman.
               Many say witches come from the
               Western Woods to steal skulls for
               their cauldrons.  Some believe a
               person in this very town kneels
               before Lucifer, offering death as
               tribute.  And, still others believe
               none of it.

                             ICHABOD
               Are you so superstitious?

                             KATRINA
               To call a person superstitious is to
               imply they fear magic, but not all
               magic is black.

                             ICHABOD
               There is no such thing as magic.

                             KATRINA
               Really?  Then... what is your
               rebuttal to those romantic poets
               claiming proof of magic in a rose at
               full bloom, or even in a teardrop?

                             ICHABOD
               Poets have silly notions about
               plants and bodily secretions.

                             KATRINA
                     (laughs)
               You are funny.

     Ichabod doesn't get what's so funny about that.  The DISTANT
     TOLL of a BELL is HEARD.  Katrina looks fearful.

     She goes to open a window.  The BELL TOLLS...

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, OVERVIEW -- NIGHT

     ... TOLLS mournfully over farms and forests...

     EXT.  FARM -- NIGHT

     ... TOLLS as a MAN comes from his barn, listening, then
     sprinting towards his home.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

     ... TOLLS across the deserted square.  Windows go dark.
     Shutters are slammed shut.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     ... TOLLS.  Ichabod bounds out to the lawn, halting to
     listen.  Katrina and Baltus come out on the porch.

                             BALTUS
               Constable, where are you going!?

     ... TOLLS... TOLLS... then, SILENCE.  Ichabod chases away.

                             BALTUS
               Come back, sir...
                     (watches him go)
               Madness.

     Baltus ushers Katrina back in.  The door slams.


     EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod charges across the rocky field.  He slows, awed...

     The Belltower is down, its mast is splintered.  The horse is
     gone.  Ichabod moves to where the crow's nest lies smashed.
     No sign of Jonathan.

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FOREST -- NIGHT

     Jonathan runs past, gripping his bow.  It's QUIET... till
     HOOFBEATS are HEARD in pursuit.

     Trees are silhouetted against the sky.  As HOOFBEATS get
     LOUDER, branches bend like arms and fingers yearning to
     touch.  As HOOFBEATS ROAR PAST, the trees relax.

     FURTHER ON, Jonathan runs.  WIND begins to BLOW.

     BEHIND, in motion, WE SEE Daredevil's snorting visage; eyes
     lizard-like, with vertical slits literally aglow.

     The Horseman's hand yanks a wooden WAR HAMMER from a saddle
     mount.  (No clear view of the Horseman.)

     HORSEMAN'S P.O.V.: closing in on Jonathan.

     Jonathan is overtaken.  The Horseman swings the hammer WHOOMP
     -- sends Jonathan sprawling.

     HOOFBEATS FADE.  Jonathan tries to get up, but pain shoots
     through him.  He crawls to retrieve his bow.

     Against a tree, he takes an arrow from his shoulder quiver
     and readies it.  Waiting.  A metal TAPPING is HEARD O.S.
     CLINK... CLINK... CLINK.  A HORSE SNORTS.

     Jonathan pulls the bow taut, pained, lips bloody.

     Elsewhere, Daredevil approaches slow.  The Horseman taps his
     sword on his spur, CLINK... CLINK... CLINK...

     Foliage moves as the Horseman's form pushes through.

     Jonathan releases -- the arrow WHISTLES...

     THWACK! -- imbeds in the Horseman's chest.

     CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... continues -- Jonathan readies a
     second arrow.  Pulls and releases -- O.S. THWACK!

     CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan cries out, crawling away
     desperately.  Crawling through underbrush, over roots and
     rocks.  CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan gives up, spent,
     face to the dirt.  He closes his eyes.

     CLINKING STOPS.  Daredevil halts astride Jonathan; two legs
     on each side of Jonathan's body.


     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FARMLAND -- MORNING

     Baltus and a large, DULLARDLY MAN ride.  Behind, Ichabod
     rides with Magistrate Philipse.

     Ichabod is not adept at riding his old nag, Gunpowder.

                             ICHABOD
               The Van Garretts died first; a man
               and his son, survived by a wife and
               two infants.  And the Widow Windsor
               was next...

                             PHILIPSE
               And now Jonathan Masbath.

                             ICHABOD
                     (looks back, ponders)
               Why would he flee this direction,
               with so much open ground to cross
               before he reached cover?

                             PHILIPSE
               He would not have gone into the
               Western Woods.  No sane man would.

     Philipse drinks from a whiskey flask, sees Ichabod watching
     and offers some.  Ichabod declines.

                             PHILIPSE
               Van Ripper there...

     Ahead, the dullard, VAN RIPPER, sloppily spits tobacco.

                             PHILIPSE
               ... found the body this morning.
                     (pause) 
               You do believe now, don't you?

                             ICHABOD 
               Believe?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               You said yourself.  What mere man
               could have downed the Belltower?

                             ICHABOD 
               It is a prime tenet of science,
               Philipse, that because one thing
               appears improbable does not mean
               you embrace the utterly fantastical.

                             PHILIPSE 
               You need less big words, and more
               common sense.

     Philipse fingers an IRON KEY talisman he wears on a cord.

                             ICHABOD 
               What is that you wear?

                             PHILIPSE 
               My talisman.  It will, protect
               against the Horseman if I show a
               brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If
               I run in fear, it is worthless.

                             ICHABOD 
               Well... so much for common sense.


     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS, FURTHER ON -- MORNING

     Brom and Baltus stand at a HORSE'S CORPSE amongst jagged
     boulders.  The flesh has been stripped, guts exposed.
     Philipse and Ichabod arrive and dismount.

                             BALTUS 
               Was this Jonathan's?

                             BROM 
               Yes.  Seems he panicked across here
               and broke two legs.

                             ICHABOD 
               Who took the meat?

                             BALTUS 
               Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape
               Indian lives in the Western Woods.

                             ICHABOD 
               These woods of yours sound a bit
               crowded, what with all the witches,
               ghouls and Indians living there.

     Brom climbs up onto his own horse, a black beauty.

                             BROM 
               There's only one Lenape.  He eats
               small animals and lost children...
               and the occasional constable when he
               can get it.

     Brom rides.  Ichabod goes to the dead horse, digs in his
     satchel for a thin iron tool, which he uses it to pry off one
     HORSESHOE.  A WHISTLE is HEARD O.S.

     Everyone looks far ahead to where Van Ripper has ridden.  The
     doctor and others are there.  Van Ripper waves.


     INT. FOREST, MASBATH MURDER SITE -- MORNING

     Doctor Lancaster stands with SEVERAL ARMED MEN.  A coffin on
     a cart is covered by a blanket. Ichabod is crouched nearby.

                             ICHABOD 
               Why did you move the body, Doctor?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               To place it inside its coffin.

     Ichabod, nods, vaguely annoyed.  He puts the horseshoe into a
     hoofprint in the dirt.  It fits.

     Ichabod rises, walks, studying the ground, kicking up leaves.
     Brom, Van Ripper, Baltus and Philipse watch.

     Ichabod finds a deep hoofprint.  Huge.  He compares the
     horseshoe.  The hoofprint is much larger.

     Ichabod pulls his satchel off his shoulder, takes out a bowl,
     bottle of water and bag of brown powder; begins mixing water
     and powder with a fork to make plaster.

     The others watch, finding this bizarre, whispering.  Brom
     comes up to stand over Ichabod, irritated.

                             BROM 
               What the hell are you doing?

                             ICHABOD
                     (ignoring pause) 
               You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod
               a horse with a hoof this large?

                             BROM 
               Never.  A shoe that size I would
               have remembered.

     Ichabod starts to fill the print with plaster.

                             ICHABOD 
               Van Ripper.  Can you show where the
               body lay?

                             VAN RIPPER 
               I can show exactly.

     Van Ripper dismounts, wiping tobacco drool.  Ichabod rises to
     follow with his satchel.

                             VAN RIPPER 
               Here... in front of this oak, facing
               north.  Horrible...

                             ICHABOD 
               To the best of your recollection,
               where did the open wound fall?

     Van Ripper points.  Ichabod takes a BOTTLE of WHITE POWDER
     from his pocket.

     He uncorks the bottle, cautiously pouring powder in an x on
     the dirt there, then waiting.

     A chemical reaction causes the powder to bubble a bit.

                             ICHABOD 
               There was not much blood, was there?

                             VAN RIPPER 
               I didn't see none.

     Ichabod stands, puzzled.  He walks to the coffin cart,
     rolling up his sleeves.  Others come to watch, but keep
     distance.  Ichabod removes the blanket...

     Reveals Jonathan's headless corpse.

     Philipse can't look.  Ichabod takes strange spectacles from
     his satchel; wire-framed with many lenses.  MAGNIFICATION
     SPECTACLES.  He examines the gross neck wound, sniffs it.

     He pokes the flesh and severed spinal cord.

                             ICHABOD 
               No bleeding.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               What is that?

                             ICHABOD 
               This should have bled by the pint.
               Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh.
               How... ?  Whatever weapon was used...
               it cauterized somehow....

     Ichabod straightens, eyes weirdly big in the spectacles.

                             ICHABOD 
               It instantly burnt the wound shut.


     EXT.  CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAY

     A coffin in a grave.  Headstone reads "MASBATH, 1799."  A
     CROWD gathered.  Young Masbath broods.  Clergyman Steenwyck
     steps forward to take a handful of newly dug dirt.

     Men with guns stand at the outskirts, like on guard.

     Steenwyck sprinkles dirt into the grave with prayerful words.
     In the crowd people whisper.  They steal glances at Ichabod,
     who stands with the Van Tassels.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING/VARIOUS ROOMS -- DAY

     Dining room.  Sarah and two other servants collect plates.  A
     few people still sup, including Van Ripper, his warty WIFE
     and two kids.  Van Ripper guzzles ale, laughs at something
     his also-drunk wife says.

     IN the HALL and FOYER, funeral goers socialize quietly.

     FURTHER ON, in the SITTING ROOM, men smoke.  Young Masbath
     is confronting Ichabod, who is leaving...

                             ICHABOD 
               I am not here for revenge.  I am
               here to bring justice.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Whatever.  You still need a second
               to tend to your things.

                             ICHABOD 
               I manage fine alone.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               I deserve to help you.  Don't you see
               how much this means?  My father...
               he... he was a good man...

                             ICHABOD
                     (faces Masbath) 
               Young Masbath, I am sorry for your
               loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy.
               However... I cannot be the one to
               look after you now.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
                     (angry) 
               I did not ask you to, did I?

     Young Masbath exits.  Ichabod remains impassive.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- DAY

     Ichabod comes out.  KILLIAN, a dashingly rustic man, carries
     his son, THOMAS, 5, and chats with Baltus.  Doctor Lancaster
     peers off at something through a SPYGLASS.

                             BALTUS 
               Hail, Constable.  How are you?

                             ICHABOD 
               Well enough.  Your gathering does
               honor to the deceased.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
                     (still using spyglass) 
               We must be a curious sight to him.

                             ICHABOD 
               What are you spying on?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
                     (offers the spyglass)
               The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at
               civilization from time to time.

     ICHABOD'S POINT OF VIEW -- THROUGH SPYGLASS

     Searching a line of trees and foliage far away...

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER (o.s.)
               Do you see the Redskinned bastard?

     There he is -- the LENAPE.  A towering savage with misshapen
     features covered in tumors.  He ducks away.

     BACK TO SCENE ON PORCH

     Ichabod lowers the spyglass, a little awed.

                             ICHABOD 
               He is a behemoth.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               A diseased monster.

                             BALTUS 
               If you gentlemen will excuse the
               doctor and I... we have financial
               matters to discuss.

     Ichabod and Killian nod as Baltus and Lancaster head in.

                             KILLIAN 
               Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have
               time alone.  You've been told plenty
               about the Horseman, I'm certain.

                             ICHABOD 
               More than enough, actually. 
                     (tired laugh) 
               I beg you, no more, please.

                             KILLIAN 
               No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say
               you just laid eyes on our murderer
               through that glass.

     Ichabod ponders, folding the spyglass.

                             ICHABOD 
               Tell me something. 
                     (pause) 
               What becomes of Young Masbath?

                             KILLIAN 
               Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take
               him.  They have children and a good
               home and good land.

     Ichabod nods.  He turns to look THROUGH THE WINDOW.  In the
     DINING ROOM, Van Ripper rises, ill.  His wife questions his
     health, but he holds her off and vomits.

     Ichabod notes this with a deep sigh.


     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ORCHARD -- EARLY EVENING

     Ocher dusk.  Ichabod rides to Young Masbath, seated on the
     ground, miserable.  Young Masbath does not look up.

                             ICHABOD 
               Find yourself a place in the servants'
               residence and wake me before dawn.
               Our first task will be an unsavory one.

     Ichabod rides.  Young Masbath runs to his horse and follows.


     EXT. CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAWN

     Steenwyck is on horseback, looking down at Ichabod, furious.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               It is sacrilege!

                             ICHABOD 
               I cannot proceed without examining
               the previous victims.

     Steenwyck looks to men with shovels.  Killian's there.
     Philipse, hung-over, stands beside Young Masbath.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               Magistrate Philipse, surely you can
               stop this.

     Philipse just looks up with a helpless expression.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               I will not allow it.  I will not!

                             ICHABOD 
               Protest to my superiors if you like.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               Your superiors are two days away!

                             ICHABOD 
               Then, you should have left two days
               ago, because I have men willing to
               help me today.

     Ichabod motions.  Killian leads the men to the graveyard.
     Steenwyck watches, enraged.  He kicks his horse and rides.
     Philipse looks worried.

     EXT.  CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- LATER MORNING (TIME CUT)

     A PSALM is HEARD READ by STEENWYCK O.S. while a coffin is
     exhumed.  Ichabod guides the lifting.  The coffin is put near
     the headstone "WINDSOR."  Ichabod looks...

     At the church, Steenwyck faces about fifty people who now
     take up the PRAYER.

     Across the cemetery, two coffins, one small, one large, are
     pried open.  "VAN GARRETT, 1799."  Killian leads the effort
     with Young Masbath's aid...

     The lids come off, revealing the HEADLESS BODIES of a MAN and
     a little BOY.  Young Masbath backs away.

     At the "WINDSOR" coffin, nails creak as Ichabod opens the
     lid.  WE DO NOT SEE inside, but when Ichabod does, he is
     aghast.  He looks to the men, angry.

                             ICHABOD
               Why was I not told of this?

     No answer.  Killian arrives, nods solemnly.

                             KILLIAN 
               The Widow Windsor.

                             ICHABOD 
               Is that all you say?  Look at her.

                             KILLIAN 
               It's not something people speak of
               openly.  She did not remarry.

     Ichabod kneels, studying.  Now, WE SEE: the belly of the
     headless corpse is bulbous, because the Widow Windsor was
     very far along in a pregnancy.

     Ichabod notices: a tear in the cloth of widow's blouse.  He
     reaches through the tear, feeling the stomach.

     He straightens, greatly troubled.


     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- MORNING

     Scissors cut open the widow's blouse.  There's an inch-long
     WOUND on the moldering belly; a sword puncture.

     Ichabod examines the corpse on a table.  Lancaster watches,
     anxiously mopping his face.  Young Masbath's in a corner.
     Ichabod goes to write in his ledger full of notes.

                             ICHABOD 
               What is the common thread between
               these victims?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               I'm sure I don't know.

                             ICHABOD 
               We must discover it.  The reason the
               murderer chose these persons.

     Ichabod goes to look at the widow's corpse, pondering.

                             ICHABOD 
               The wounds are the same.  Cauterized.
               No chopping or half-measures either.
               One stroke took the head.  Have you
               seen, doctor... ?
                     (pointing to it) 
               Even the spinal bone... sliced as
               smooth as butter.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               I do not care.  You are welcome to
               use my work area, but I beg you...
               return her to her resting place.

                             ICHABOD 
               In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.

     Ichabod picks up an iron knife.  He looks to Young Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               You should step outside.


     EXT.  CHURCHYARD CEMETERY -- EARLY EVENING

     Ichabod and others restore graves.  Ichabod looks to the
     church, where Clergyman Steenwyck stands in the door.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane.
               The Lord will not forgive your sins.

     Steenwyck shuts the creaky doors.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod sleeps, dreaming...

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FARMLAND -- DAY

     A young BOY, 10, stands in a wheat field with his back to us.
     A FEMALE VOICE is HEARD FAINTLY, getting LOUDER.

                             FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
               Ichabod!  Ichabod... come along.

     The boy, YOUNG ICHABOD, turns, smiling.  He runs.  We FOLLOW
     to a clearing behind a frontier home.  MOTHER waits.  Lovely
     woman.  She kisses him.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Dark.  Young Ichabod, in bed, has one eye open.  Across the
     room, Mother has her back to him.  She's WHISPERING something
     to no one.  She turns...

     Young Ichabod pretends he is asleep.

     A DRAWER is HEARD SHUTTING.  Mother exits.  Ichabod gets up,
     curious, opens a drawer... finds something behind clothing.

     It's a piece of reed grass, woven into an elaborate pattern
     with shafts of wheat twisted into the center.  Young Ichabod
     replaces it, closes the drawer.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- MARKET SQUARE -- DAY

     A busy, muddy street lined by wares and produce.  Young
     Ichabod walks with FATHER, an emotionless man.  Father stops
     to examine tools.  Young Ichabod stays by him, but something
     captures his attention...

     Across the way, Mother is involved in a argument with a
     FREAKISH-LOOKING WOMAN.  They shout.  People stop to watch.
     Can't make out words, but Freakish Woman is furious.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- STORM SKY -- NIGHT

     LIGHTNING flashes over tree tops.  THUNDER BOOMS.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod jerks awake in his bed.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Ichabod enters with a lantern and his ledger.  He sits,
     studies notes, then notices there's a light down the hall.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Opposite an elaborate loom, Katrina reads by candlelight.
     She looks up, seeing Ichabod enter.

                             ICHABOD 
               Sorry for disturbing you.  I thought
               a forgotten candle was burning.

     Katrina self-consciously closes her shabby book, puts it with
     another on her lap and covers them.

                             KATRINA 
               You do not disturb me.  Please stay.
               Having trouble sleeping?

                             ICHABOD 
               May I ask... why do you cover your
               book that way?

                             KATRINA 
               You pay great attention to small
               things.  I hide these as I hide all
               my books.  Father would not approve,
               lest it were the Bible.

                             ICHABOD 
               I, um... I have something to show you,
               if you have a moment.

     Ichabod sits, looking through his ledger.

                             KATRINA
               These are strange... may I?

     She takes his hand, spreads the fingers to the palm.  She
     touches the many evenly spaced scars.

                             KATRINA 
               These scars.  How did you get them?

                             ICHABOD 
               I have had them since childhood.  I
               cannot remember what from.

                             KATRINA 
               It would be interesting to find out.

     Their eyes meet.  Ichabod gets back to the ledger.  Katrina
     seems to relish the effect she has.  Ichabod finds a paper
     disk on string, illustrated thusly:

                             ICHABOD 
               Here it is.  A bird on one side.
               His cage on the other.  Now,
               stare at it. 
                     (spinning it) 
               The bird seems to be in his cage.

                             KATRINA 
               Yes, he does.  May I try?

     Ichabod gives it.  She spins it, smiling.

                             ICHABOD 
               He only appears to be inside the
               cage.  The point being...

                             KATRINA
               You made this, and the drawings?

                             ICHABOD 
               Yes, but listen.  The illusion is
               easily explained.  The eye retains
               each image, till they combine.  And
               yet, some would call this toy magic.

                             KATRINA 
               Don't you see why?  Look closely a
               moment.  Put your intellect aside. 
                     (spinning it) 
               Can't you see what is inexplicable?

     Ichabod watches it spin.  He shakes his head, unimpressed.

                             KATRINA 
               Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep
               it at least?

                             ICHABOD
               If you want.  But...

                             KATRINA 
               Then, I also have a gift for you.
               True magic which even you will not
               be able to deny.

     She hands him a book.  "ROMEO AND JULIET."  Ichabod stands,
     offering it back, but she will not take it.

                             ICHABOD 
               Thank you.  No.  Here...

                             KATRINA 
               I insist that you have it.

                             ICHABOD
                     (resigned, leaving) 
               Very well.  But, it will only sit
               gathering dust.

                             KATRINA 
               That would be a pity.  Those words
               might show you something you've never
               seen before.

     Ichabod stops at the door, looks back.  He exits.


     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     A light glows in Ichabod's window.  LOOKING IN: Ichabod's in
     bed, fully dressed.  He sits up.  Pause.  He crosses to pick
     up "Romeo and Juliet."  He begins to read.


     EXT.  PHILIPSE'S FARM -- DUSK

     Ichabod walks with Philipse.  Young Masbath follows with the
     horses.  CICADAS CHATTER from a vast corn field.

                             PHILIPSE 
               Not more than a year ago, a mob hung
               a man for stealing a horse.  For
               stealing a horse!  And, you dig up
               our dead.

                             ICHABOD 
               Are you saying I should be frightened?
               Is this a message passed on from
               Clergyman Steenwyck?

     The CICADAS SUDDENLY go SILENT.  Young Masbath notices.

                             PHILIPSE 
               We are farmers here, not lawyers or
               bankers, or even constables.  Every
               penny we earn comes from what we
               send down the Hudson.

                             ICHABOD 
               I know it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Um.... excuse me, sirs...

                             PHILIPSE
                     (still to Ichabod) 
               Because of the Horseman, our migrant
               workers flee for their lives.  There
               is a danger that our crops will rot.
               So, if you are going to help us, you
               stop the Horseman.  That is your
               task... to kill an undead thing.

     Young Masbath looks to a fenced grazing area, worried.  The
     sheep there are agitated, all running one direction away.

                             ICHABOD
               Listen to what you say....

                             PHILIPSE 
               No, you listen!  You may think we are
               a pack of superstitious dullards...

                             ICHABOD 
               At times I do.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Sirs... please!

                             PHILIPSE 
               What will it take for you to realize
               this is no laughing matter?

     The horses go crazy, braying and rearing.  The reins yank
     Young Masbath off his feet as the horses flee.

     Ichabod and Philipse look to Masbath.  A SOUND is HEARD,
     distant: THUNDERING HOOFBEATS.  Wind kicks up.  HOOFBEATS
     seem to come FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.

     Philipse looks to the corn field.  A flock of birds alights;
     a great sheet of black against the sky.

                             PHILIPSE
               Oh my... oh my oh my oh my...

     Philipse runs towards his house, past Masbath.  HOOFBEATS are
     LOUDER, CLOSER.  Ichabod faces the corn field.

     The field explodes open, stalks bending to make way as the
     Headless Horseman gallops into view atop Daredevil.

     Young Masbath runs, following Philipse.

     Ichabod's stunned.  He looks down to draw his flintlock
     pistol, but the Horseman blows by before he can raise it.  A
     blast of air knocks Ichabod off his feet.

     The Horseman chases Masbath and Philipse.

     Ichabod follows.

     The Horseman draws his sword.

     Young Masbath falls in the grass...

     Daredevil's pounding hooves will certainly crush him.

     Daredevil leaps over Young Masbath, continuing the charge.

     Philipse has a long way to go before home.  He looks over his
     shoulder.  No way he'll make it.

     Ichabod, running, watches Philipse slow.

     Philipse gathers all his courage and stops, turning.  The
     Horseman is closing, sword held high.

     Philipse raises his talisman.

                             ICHABOD 
               Philipse!

     Philipse holds the talisman up, trying to be fearless.  The
     Horseman swings -- WE HEAR the CLANK of sword on talisman...

     Philipse's severed head spins.  His body falls and folds.

     Ichabod runs past Young Masbath.

     The Horseman halts just as Ichabod reaches a point in front
     of dead Philipse, aiming his pistol.  Daredevil lets out a
     SCREECHY CRY.  The Horseman rides toward Ichabod.

     Ichabod gets on one knee, trying to steady his pistol.  The
     Horseman closes.  Ichabod sweats bullets.  FIRES...

     The slug SLAMS the Horseman dead center -- bursts through and
     rends his uniform without slowing him.

     The Horseman is almost on Ichabod.  Ichabod cringes, arms
     up... as the Horseman passes.

     The Horseman leans to skewer Philipse's head with his sword.

     With the head as his prize, the Horseman races away.

     Ichabod gets up, watches the Horseman head to the forest.
     Ichabod looks to Young Masbath, finds his legs will not
     support him, falls, trembling.  THUNDER BELLOWS.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT

     Lady Van Tassel comes to a door, knocks.  Sarah stands behind
     with a tray of food.  Young Masbath is seated near.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
                     (to Young Masbath)
               Has he not come out at all?

     Young Masbath shakes his head.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     KNOCKING is HEARD.  Ichabod sleeps restlessly.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     THUNDER BOOMS.  WIND and POUNDING RAIN blast open a window.
     Mother comes to it, then moves to comfort fearful Young
     Ichabod in bed.

                             MOTHER'S VOICE (v.o.)
               Don't be afraid... don't be afraid.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY

     A keyhole.  Young Ichabod's eye peers in...

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- P.O.V. THROUGH KEYHOLE

     Mother is kneeled before flour on the floor.  She draws
     patterns in it, whispering.  She blows the flour away.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY

     The Freakish Woman (who argued with Mother) walks towards the
     home, supported by a SAD MAN.  She weeps, carrying something
     in a blanket.

     Young Ichabod comes a window, watching, scared.

     The Freakish Woman is so weak that she falls.  The blanket
     opens... the corpse of an infant tumbles to the dirt.  The
     Freakish Woman's WAILING GROWS LOUDER.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FRONT OF YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT

     TWO MEN in black drag Mother to a coach.  She looks back,
     fearful, pulled along.  A THIRD MAN in black follows.

     Young Ichabod struggles as Father restrains him.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               No... mother... no... !

     The Third Man peers back, a gray-haired, Cotton Mather-ish
     man with a villainous face.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)
               The night of the great storm, I saw
               her cross my windows.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY

     Many people in the gallery.  The Third Man stands in front of
     the tearful Freakish Woman in the witness box.

                             THIRD MAN
               You are certain it was she?

                             FREAKISH WOMAN
               In the lighting, I did see her.
                     (points)
               Her.  Lady Crane...

     Mother sits in shackles.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN
               I will never forget.  The next moment,
               I found my infant dead... with the
               blood welt on his breast.

     Those in attendance cry out at this.  Ichabod is seated
     beside Father, eyes filled with tears.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     As before, a STORM RAGES.  Ichabod is in Mother's arms.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)
               The night of the great storm, I saw
               her cross my windows.

                             MOTHER
               Don't be afraid...

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- DAY

     KNOCKING is HEARD.  Ichabod gasps awake.

                             KATRINA (o.s.)
               Constable Crane?

     Ichabod looks at his hands balled into fists.  He opens them
     -- has ONE HALF of PHILIPSE'S TALISMAN in each palm.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Katrina holds a tray of food.  The DOOR is HEARD UNLOCKING.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Katrina enters.  Ichabod sits at his work table.

                             KATRINA
               Are you hungry?

     Ichabod shakes his head, won't look up.  Katrina crosses.

     She begins picking up pieces of the PLASTER HOOFPRINT CAST
     which lies shattered on the floor.

                             KATRINA
               You promised justice.

                             ICHABOD
               If these are the random stalkings of
               a monster, what good am I?

                             KATRINA
               People have put their trust in you.

                             ICHABOD 
               They have done nothing of the sort.

                             KATRINA
               Won't they still have that justice?
                     (patience waning)
               Or, was it a vain promise?

     Ichabod stews, head in his hands.  Someone is HEARD
     RUNNING... Young Masbath enters, frightened.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Constable Crane... something has
               happened.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     The Lenape Indian hangs dead in a tree, lynched.  TOWNSFOLK
     are gathered.  Ichabod makes his way through, followed by
     Young Masbath, looking up.

                             BROM (o.s.)
               We do not need you, Constable...

     Brom strides towards Ichabod from a group of men spreading a
     sheet under the tree.  Van Ripper's there.

                             BROM
               The men who did this have been taken.
               We do not need you here.

     Brom points to where TWO FILTHY MEN in chains sit in a
     horse-drawn cart.  An armed man guards them.

                             ONE FILTHY MAN 
               You should thank us.  The killings
               will end.  We saved you all!

     The armed man shoves the filthy man to shut him up.

                             BROM 
               They spend two days in chains.

                             ICHABOD 
               Two days... ?  For murder?

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               For poaching.  Or, would you remake
               our laws now that Magistrate Philipse
               has given up the ghost?

                             ICHABOD 
               Does that look like an animal hanging?

                             BROM 
               Looks like an Indian.

     Van Ripper cuts the noose rope at the trunk.  The Lenape
     corpse free falls, landing hard.

     The Lenape lies in a heap on the sheet.  Van Ripper and
     others come to lift the sheet with the Lenape in the middle.
     Ichabod watches, noticing...

     The Lenape wears a WOVEN PIECE of REED GRASS a cord on his
     loin cloth, twisted in a pattern.

                             ICHABOD 
               Wait.  Give me a moment...

     Ichabod kneels.  He removes the woven piece, looking across
     the diseased Lenape's body.  Something else...

     The Lenape's mouth is agape; teeth rotting.  Ichabod looks
     around, finds a twig.  He uses it to pull the Lenape's mouth
     open... gets close to peer inside the Lenape's mouth.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY

     A DRAWING of the Lenape's WOVEN PIECE in Ichabod's ledger.
     The piece lies near.

     Ichabod sits staring at it, trance-like.  Masbath waits.
     Long silence.

                             ICHABOD
               The Lenape Indian had much to tell
               once I opened his mouth.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               How could he?

                             ICHABOD
               His teeth.  Someone had cut them and
               chipped off rotten pieces far back
               in his mouth.  The Lenape could not
               have done that for himself.
                     (closes his journal)
               Someone out there cared for him.

     Ichabod rises, deciding.  He picks up his satchel and exits.
     Young Masbath is surprised.  He follows.


     EXT.  WINDMILL -- DAY

     A massive, wooden WINDMILL, raised off the ground on a 7'
     center post.  Ichabod and Masbath walk to it.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath enter via a ladder from the
     underbelly.  Gears and counter wheels turn millstones.  A few
     men work in the grain powder filled air.

     Ichabod leads the way to a staircase, up twists and turns.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Where are we going?

                             ICHABOD 
               Up.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath climb out a door to the roof.  The
     rotors spin nearby.  Ichabod searches the countryside.

     Below, MANY MEN are ride up the long straight road.

                             ICHABOD 
               What is it?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               It's payment day.  Loan monies are
               given to Baltus the last day each
               month.  Almost everyone borrows...
               for tools or to hire workers.

     Ichabod sits, takes a bowl from his bag and gives it to
     Masbath, then produces a bottle of water... fills the bowl.

                             ICHABOD
                     (points) 
               Out there.  What do you see?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               The Western Woods.

                             ICHABOD 
               Look again.

     A plume of smoke rises from woods, far.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Smoke.  Chimney smoke.

     Ichabod holds a piece of straw in his mouth, rubs the point
     of a sewing needle against a small BLACK ROCK.

                             ICHABOD 
               Are you familiar with magnets?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What kind of nuts?

                             ICHABOD 
               Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch
               here.

     Ichabod shows the magnet grab the needle.  Young Masbath is
     amazed, reaching for it.  Ichabod watches him play with it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               It's spectacular.

                             ICHABOD
                     (smiles, pause) 
               Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               No, I couldn't...

                             ICHABOD 
               I have others.  All I need is this.

     Ichabod takes the needle, poking its butt end into the tip of
     the straw.  Young Masbath studies the rock, pockets it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Thank you.

                             ICHABOD
                     (nods, almost shy) 
               Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to
               business.

     Young Masbath lifts the bowl.  Ichabod drops in the
     needle/straw which floats and turns compass-like.

                             ICHABOD 
               If the Western Woods are truly the
               Devil's Glen, we will see for
               ourselves.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
                     (uneasy) 
               Father said witches live there.

                             ICHABOD 
               Witches do not exist.  However...

     Ichabod uses a knife to notch the bowl lip where the needle
     points, then surveys the smoke, making a second notch.

                             ICHABOD 
               Not long ago, I would have said the
               same for Headless Horseman.

                             KATRINA (o.s.)
               Constable... !

     Katrina's on horseback below, unhappy.

                             KATRINA 
               I need to speak with you.  Alone.


     EXT.  VAN TASSEL GREAT LAWN -- DAY

     Ichabod and Katrina lead their horses.  A heated argument.

                             KATRINA
               Why would you do such a thing?

                             ICHABOD 
               No stone may be left unturned.  It
               may appear harsh...

                             KATRINA 
               I have misjudged you I think.  I did
               not imagine you were so cruel.

                             ICHABOD 
               You are not regarding it in full.
               The Widow Windsor had been run
               through by a sword.  I followed the
               bloodless wound, a wound whose path
               I could not comprehend till I had
               seen the Horseman with my own eyes.

                             KATRINA 
               What are you on about?

                             ICHABOD 
               The child she carried was eight
               months grown at least... near to
               birthing.  The sword had pierced its
               tiny heart exactly.

                             KATRINA 
               Must I hear this?

                             ICHABOD 
               There was no blind stabbing.  This
               singular thrust found its target
               omnipotently, as if the Horseman made
               certain the unborn child died with
               its mother.

                             KATRINA 
               And this gives worth to butchery?

                             ICHABOD 
               It was not butchery.

                             KATRINA 
               What is it then?  Scientific method?
               How can any of this matter in the
               slightest?

                             ICHABOD 
               I have no solution for its meaning
               yet, but I could not just ignore it.

                             KATRINA 
               Take a lesson from Young Masbath's
               desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows
               with you to avenge his father's death.
               That I understand.  But, what do you
               want?

                             ICHABOD 
               To avenge his father, and the others.

                             KATRINA 
               But, why?  Tell me why.

     Ichabod struggles for a reply.

                             KATRINA 
               You falter with your answer because
               you strive without putting the whole
               of your heart into it.  Can't you see?
               You'll bring dignity to the dead even
               if you have to chop them into little
               pieces to do it.

                             ICHABOD
                     (fed up, growing anger) 
               If it had been surgery on a living
               person, done to save that person's
               life, you would not question it.  Not
               for a moment.  So, let me be the first
               to tell you, dear girl... on the other
               side of these sheltering mountains, a
               whole world has advanced beyond such
               plebeian thinking as yours.  And
               someday, no matter how much you fear
               it, that world will come to roust
               Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.

     Katrina storms away.  Ichabod's already regretting.


     EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath ride to the Western Woods, horses
     loaded for expedition.  At the Belltower remnants, Ichabod
     slows, looking to the wreckage.

     At forest's edge, Young Masbath waits.

     Ichabod circles the tower.  With a sigh, he rides to join
     Young Masbath. They head into the woods.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     Dark, dense and creepy.  Ichabod and Young Masbath move
     through.  Young Masbath halts his horse and looks around.

                             ICHABOD 
               What is it?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Listen.

                             ICHABOD
                     (listens, looks)
               I hear nothing.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               No crickets or cicadas calling.  No
               bird songs.

     Stark quiet.  Ichabod notes this unhappily.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- LATER DAY

     Ichabod's hand drops the needle/straw in the water bowl.  The
     needle spins.  The bowl is turned to match notches.

     Ichabod points the way to Young Masbath.

     ELSEWHERE, SOMEONE WATCHES:  A MOVING P.O.V. WATCHES them as
     they ride, FOLLOWS.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- LATER DAY

     Ichabod and Masbath reach a hill crest.  They stop, uneasy.
     Below: a CAVE with a rock archway.  An ill-fitting door
     covers the mouth.  The chimney spews smoke.

                             ICHABOD
               We have apparently arrived.

     EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     The horses are tied to a tree.  Ichabod walks to the cave
     door.  Unsure, he hesitantly knocks.

     INT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath step in.

     Walls are hung with skins and skeletons, dry flowers and reed
     grass in patterns.  An OLD CRONE sits facing away.

     The old Crone, a mountain woman with matted hair and grey
     features, sits disinterested.  Ichabod edges closer.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon.  You did not answer when I
               knocked.  Are we intruding?

                             OLD CRONE
               You are from the Hollow?

                             ICHABOD
               In a way, yes.

     Ichabod looks at tables of gourd bowls of dead insects and
     acorns.  Knifes, scissors, yellow bones.  He takes the
     Lenape's piece of reed grass from his pocket.

                             ICHABOD
               The Lenape who lived in these woods...
               do you know him?  The Redman?
                     (uncomfortable wait)
               I should tell you... he has been
               murdered.

                             OLD CRONE
               Leave me.  You are not welcome here.

     The old Crone places something on a table beside her -- a
     dead cardinal, bright red.

     Ichabod is afraid, backing away, but Young Masbath takes the
     woven piece and steps to the Crone.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Were you a friend to the Indian?
                     (waits)
               You should have this... if you were
               his friend.

     Young Masbath puts the woven piece beside the cardinal.  He
     walks to join Ichabod in leaving.

                             OLD CRONE
               You seek remedy against the Horseman?

     The Old Crone reaches to pick up the weaving.  She stands,
     faces them.  Tall.  Ichabod nods.

                             OLD CRONE
                     (to Young Masbath)
               Go out and keep away, child.
                     (to Ichabod)
               You stay.  Follow with me.

     The Old Crone takes a candle and walks, deep into the cave.

     INT.  CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY

     The Old Crone comes through a passage in the wet walls.
     Ichabod enters, scared, bent under low ceiling.

                             OLD CRONE
               I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow
               and back.

                             ICHABOD
               The Horseman.  Yes.

                             OLD CRONE
               Sit.

     Ichabod sits on crooked stool.  The old Crone kneels with her
     back to him, gathers straw in a pile on the floor.

                             ICHABOD 
               Can you help?

                             OLD CRONE 
               You want to see into the nether world...
               I can show you.  Whatever you see, do
               not move or speak.  I will hold him.

     She gathers bowls, putting grass and powder on the pile.

                             ICHABOD
               What... what are you doing?

                             OLD CRONE
                     (turns, furious) 
               Close your mouth!  Keep silent.

     She takes two jars from a table, pours ashes on the pile from
     one.  She shakes the other roughly, takes the lid off and
     upends it.  A baby bat squirms on the floor, dazed.

     The Old Crone holds the bat, using a knife to cut off its
     head.  She soaks the straw with blood, SPEAKING IN TONGUES,
     guttural.  Using a wick, she lights the straw.

     She grasps two METAL CUFFS with chains attached, slides these
     onto her bony wrists, then bends to inhale smoke.

                             OLD CRONE 
               He comes now.

     Ichabod would like to leave now.

     EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     Young Masbath, waiting by the horses, looks up.  Through the
     trees, black clouds billow and block the sun.

     INT.  CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY

     The old Crone slumps, still with her back to Ichabod.  She
     does not move.  Wind howls through a hole/window.  Rain.

     Candles blow out.  Ichabod stands, worried.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me... um...

     She remains motionless.  The STORM outside intensifies.

     WE SEE the skin of the Crone's wrists transform; swelling in
     the cuffs, hardening, cracking and bleeding.

     Some thing Ichabod cannot see.  He inches closer.

                             ICHABOD 
               Are you alright... ?

     The Crone turns, hideous, leaping erect -- a half-human,
     half-demon CREATURE.  Its black clawed hands reaching.

     Ichabod recoils, crying out.

     Chains on restraining cuffs yank the creature back.

     Ichabod hits the floor, knocking over a table of bones.  The
     creature is chained, but still wants Ichabod.  It SCREECHES.

     The Old Crone's face seethes from transformation, eyes blood
     red, nostrils dripping, teeth now jagged.

                             CREATURE/OLD CRONE 
               You seek the warrior bathed in
               blood... the Headless Horseman.

     Ichabod slides back as far as possible while the creature
     claws the rock floor, yearning.

                             CREATURE/OLD CRONE 
               Follow the Indian trail to where the
               sun dies.  Follow to the tree of the
               dead.

     The creature pulls, testing the chains.  Behind, the BOLT
     holding the chains to the wall slips.  The wall cracks.

                             CREATURE/OLD CRONE 
               Climb down to the Horseman's soulless
               place and let loose his silent
               shrieking.  Do you hear?  Do you hear?!

     Ichabod nods, quaking, aghast.  He glances to the exit.

     The chain bolt gives more... coming loose...

                             CREATURE/OLD CRONE 
               He who holds fast the Horseman's
               desire will guide his reaping hand.
               Catch hold of his desire.

     Ichabod bolts for the door.  The creature HOWLS, leaping...

     The chain bolt breaks...

     Ichabod cries out, tackled to the floor...

     It is the Old Crone who landed on him.  She has returned to
     human form, semi-conscious.  Ichabod shoves her off.

     EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     Ichabod runs out into the howling storm, past Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               We are leaving.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What happened?

     Ichabod scrambles onto Gunpowder, heading further into the
     woods, glancing back.  Young Masbath follows.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- EARLY EVENING

     No rain.  Dark.  A lantern's glow creates shifting shadows as
     Ichabod and Young Masbath ride.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Follow the Indian trail to where the
               sun dies.  To the tree of the dead. 
                     (looking back) 
               Maybe we passed it by.

                             ICHABOD 
               How could something named "the tree
               of the dead" fail to draw attention?

     A BIRD CRIES OUT.  Ichabod's startled, looking up.  The BIRD
     is HEARD ALIGHTING.  Leaves float downwards.

                             ICHABOD 
               We should not go much further in
               this murk.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Should we go back?

                             ICHABOD 
               We are far from the Hollow. 
                     (dismounts, troubled) 
               Loath to say it... better to get our
               backs against a tree and stay till
               morning.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS (TIME CUT) -- NIGHT

     Horses are tied.  Ichabod is seated against a tree.  A
     campfire burns.  Young Masbath lies on a blanket, rifle cross
     his chest, staring to treetops.

     Leaves and branches shift in the wind.  Bats fly wildly.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What does it mean... climb down to
               the Horseman's soulless place?

                             ICHABOD 
               "Let loose his silent shrieking."
               Who knows, till we work at it?  I
               admit not being anxious to find out.
                     (pause) 
               "He who holds the Horseman's desire
               will guide his reaping hand."
               Whatever the Horseman's desire is,
               other than extinguishing lives.

     A SNAPPING BRANCH.  Ichabod raises his pistol.

                             ICHABOD
                     (to Young Masbath) 
               Do not move.

     Ichabod rises.  He creeps forward, pistol and lantern
     forward.  Foliage is thick.  CRUNCHING LEAVES are HEARD.

     Ichabod crouches, puts down the lantern and picks up a
     branch.  He tosses the branch to the foliage...

     SOME ANIMAL darts away, a running blur.

     Ichabod rises, following with his pistol.

     ANOTHER ANGLE, MOVING P.O.V.: low to the ground,
     moving swiftly at Ichabod...

     Ichabod spins, blindsided.

     Young Masbath fires his rifle -- CRACK!!

     The ANIMAL is KNOCKED DOWN mid-leap, yelping...

     The beast lands, a mass of grey fur.

     Ichabod comes to stare down.  Young Masbath arrives.  They
     both look to the beast, horrified.

     The creature lies helplessly spastic; a TWO-HEADED WOLF, with
     one head blown open to brain and gore.  Its living head
     lifts, MEWING sadly, eyes pleading.

     Ichabod step up with pistol.  FIRES.  MEWING STOPS.

                             ICHABOD
               What God-forsaken hell is this?

     Ichabod swallows back sickness, looking away.  Something
     catches his eye.

                             ICHABOD
               Christ...

     Through the forest: the SKY'S LIT UP.  Distant fire.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, CAVE HOME -- EARLY EVENING

     Ichabod and Masbath ride up, confronted by the Crone's cave
     vomiting flame out all orifices.

     Ichabod approaches.  Embers swirl everywhere.  The Old
     Crone's body lies amongst bloodied leaves.  Headless.


     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

     Much commotion.  A MOB in front of the home marked
     "LANCASTER, PHYSICIAN."  Steenwyck addresses the rabble.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               You all stand idle, while this man
               goes about with a book of secrets and
               a bag filled with magic.  You all
               stand idle, while the shadow of the
               Devil falls over our town.

     Baltus, Lady Van Tassel and Katrina watch at safe distance.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               I say, if you do nothing, you share
               in the blasphemy of Ichabod Crane!

     Killian, on horseback beside his wife, BETH, and son, Thomas,
     rides to one side of the shouting crowd.

                             KILLIAN 
               Listen to me!  Do you want to save
               your crops?  Or would you rather see
               your farms go to ruin?

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               How is he saving our farms?  How?
               Ichabod Crane has brought into our
               midst the soulless, moldering corpse
               of a heretic!

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod examines the Crone's neck wound with magnification
     spectacles.  Young Masbath is seated, ledger in his lap.

                             ICHABOD
               The wound is neither smooth nor
               cauterized, but jagged.  She bleeds
               like a fountain.

     Ichabod lifts her dead hand to show bruises and cuts.

                             ICHABOD
               She did not go quietly.

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT

     Doctor Lancaster wrings his hands.  His WIFE rocks nervously
     in a rocking chair.  The CROWD outside ROARS as a bonfire
     lights up the curtained windows.

     The front door is POUNDED open.  ANGRY MEN enter.  Lancaster
     stands, lips quivering.  He points insistently to a door.

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Angry men break in.  Ichabod looks up.

                             ANGRY MAN
               Step aside, Constable.  Step aside...

     Ichabod is shoved aside, spectacles knocked off.

     The group grasps the Crone.  Masbath stands on his chair,
     clutching the ledger.  Ichabod grabs one man.

                             ICHABOD
               What are you doing?

     The man slams Ichabod back.

     Magnification spectacles are crushed under foot.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

     Angry men carry the corpse to a raging bonfire.  The mob
     makes way.  Steenwyck cheers them.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK
               Let her burn!  Let her burn!

     Ichabod comes out, followed by Young Masbath.  The Crone's
     corpse is thrown in the fire.  Cheers all around.

     At Ichabod's side, a man tries to grab the ledger Young
     Masbath holds.  Young Masbath cries out, hanging on to the
     book.  Ichabod joins the struggle.

     Katrina watches, emotions conflicting.

     Other men grab Ichabod.  One punches Ichabod in the face.

     Katrina rides forward as Baltus calls for her to stop.

     Katrina leaps down, into the crowd, pulls men off Ichabod.

                             KATRINA
               Stop this!  Leave them alone!

     A SHOT RINGS OUT.  Chaos halts.  Everyone turns, quieting.

     The men around Masbath and Ichabod turn to face Brom Bones.
     Brom holds a smoking pistol, flanked by Theodore and Glenn.

                             BROM 
               Let them go
                     (pointing) 
               Are you going to beat an orphaned
               child, imbecile?

     Masbath is released, along with the ledger.  Steenwyck moves
     forward, pushing people aside.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               Are you Ichabod Crane's protector,
               Brom Bones?

                             BROM 
               Only for the moment.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               You side with him in this?

                             BROM 
               No.  I agree he has only made matters
               worse.  But, that will change, if you
               listen.

     He trades with Theodore, pistol for a long rifle.  Brom hefts
     the rifle, taking a round slug from his pocket.

                             BROM 
               Theodore, Glenn and I offer to ride
               each day and night to watch over the
               Hollow.  We will stalk the border of
               the Western Woods and haunt the
               Horseman for a change, with rifles
               like this... and slugs like this...

     Brom brings the slug to his lips, blows.  It WHISTLES.

                             BROM 
               Hollowed out and filled with powder.

     Brom smiles at Katrina, who watches unimpressed.

                             BROM 
               Constable Crane is not the only one
               who fights with science on his side.

                             ICHABOD 
               I fired upon the Horseman and the
               bullet did nothing.

                             BROM 
               You must have missed your mark.

                             ICHABOD 
               I hit him square.

                             BROM
                     (to the crowd) 
               I say... if the Horseman is solid
               enough to take the lives of our
               people, he's solid enough to feel
               this...

     Brom aims the rifle at a BARREL down the road.  FIRES.

     PLUNK -- the barrel is hit -- EXPLODES.  Smoke wafts.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     In bed, Ichabod is having unpleasant dreams once more.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.) 
               The night of the great storm, I saw
               her cross my windows.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY

     Young Ichabod is seated beside Father, eyes tearful.  We are
     back in the court where Mother stands trial.

                             FREAKISH WOMAN 
               In the lightning, I did see her.
                     (points to Mother) 
               Her. Lady Crane... I will never
               forget it.  The next moment, I found
               my infant son was dead, with the
               blood welt on his breast.

     The evil Third Man turns to a jury of TWELVE MEN.

                             THIRD MAN 
               You have heard it.  The blood welt
               is the mark of Satan's touch.

     As the crowd murmurs in fear, Young Ichabod looks to Father,
     who sits with hands clenched, emotionless.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT

     In the quiet kitchen, Young Ichabod looks across the table.
     Father stares into his food.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               She was with me, father.

                             FATHER
               Nothing can be done against them.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               She was with me that night.

     Father doesn't even look up.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Empty church.  Young Ichabod carries a lantern past pews.  A
     soldier is seated near the altar with a rifle.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               May I see her?

     The soldier exits through a white door.  Young Ichabod waits,
     looking up at the vast church.  The white door opens and the
     Third Man steps out.

                             THIRD MAN
               Go home.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               May I see my mother?

                             THIRD MAN
               You do not want to be here.  Go home
               to your father.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               She did not do it... please listen...

                             THIRD MAN
               She is guilty.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               No, sir, please... she is innocent...

                             THIRD MAN
               She has confessed.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD
               No.

                             THIRD MAN 
               She has admitted to her evil and
               signed a written confession.  Do
               you know what confession is?
                     (off Ichabod's nod) 
               All that is left for you now is to
               pray for her soul.

     The Third Man leaves through the white door.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod buttons his shirt.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S YARD -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod comes out, looks to the lawn, not
     understanding.  Father loads a wagon full of belongings.

                             FATHER 
               We are leaving.
                     (long pause)
               She has gone away.

     Realization comes to Young Ichabod.  He runs, away across the
     lawn as Father calls after him.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FOREST TRAIL -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod runs, weeping.

                             THIRD MAN (v.o.) 
               She has confessed.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- MORNING

     Empty.  Doors are thrown open and Young Ichabod enters.  He
     goes down the aisle, towards the white door.

                             THIRD MAN (v.o.) 
               She has admitted to her evil and
               signed a written confession.

                             YOUNG ICHABOD 
               Mother.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH, BEYOND WHITE DOOR -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod enters, halting.  The room contains TORTURE
     DEVICES: iron cuffs, thumb screws, knifes and needles.

                             THIRD MAN (v.o.)
               Do you know what confession is?

     He walks, numb, eyes locked forward...

     In the corner is a SPIKED CHAIR, adorned with sharp iron
     spikes.  Hundreds of spikes.  It is fitted with straps for
     holding down the "accused."

     Tears stream down Young Ichabod's face.  He kneels, hands on
     the spikes of the chair, pressing hard.

     As he sobs, blood runs down from his hands.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     In bed, Ichabod opens tear filled eyes.  He sits up, bringing
     his trembling hands to wipe his cheeks.  His hands trail
     blood. He looks to them...

     The old scars are bleeding.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Katrina comes to the door.  Ichabod is seated by the fire,
     eyes bleary, palms wrapped with bloodied cloth.

                             KATRINA 
               Constable Crane?

     Katrina comes beside Ichabod's chair.

                             ICHABOD
               Allow me some time.  I have spent
               every hour in the company of others.
               I need to be alone.

                             KATRINA 
               What troubles you?

     She moves in front.  Ichabod gets up and crosses to sit
     facing away.  Katrina takes the chair he deserted.

                             KATRINA
               The things I said to you before...
               I was wrong to say them.

                             ICHABOD
               No, actually, you were not.  Every
               word you spoke had truth in it.

                             KATRINA 
               What has happened?

     Ichabod sits silent, puts his head back, eyes closed.

                             ICHABOD 
               Lady Van Tassel... she is your
               stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so
               little resemblance.

                             KATRINA 
               What?

                             ICHABOD 
               She is not your birth mother, is she?

                             KATRINA 
               No, but... why do you ask that?

                             ICHABOD 
               What happened to your mother?  Is she
               still alive?

                             KATRINA 
               She died.  Her lungs were diseased...
               two years ago.  What is this about?

                             ICHABOD 
               Memories have come back.  I had them
               forgotten, and wish I could forget
               them again... but they are here now. 
                     (pause) 
               Lord, how I hate this place.

                             KATRINA 
               If you want me to go, I will.  Do you
               want me to leave?

                             ICHABOD 
               I... I do not know.  I no longer know
               what I think or what I feel.

     Katrina walks to him.  She touches his back.

                             KATRINA 
               Why are you so afraid of that?  Is
               there truly such harm in uncertainty?

     She kneels, smiles a little for him.  She reaches to touch
     his face, holds his head in her hands.  Leans to kiss him.

     He rests his head against hers, weary, putting his arms
     around her.  They kiss passionately.


     EXT.  THE HOLLOW -- EARLY MORNING

     Dawn light, is visible over forests pounded by rain.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- MORNING

     Ichabod exits his room, satchel in hand.  He looks down the
     hall, then steps back in to take a white rose from a vase.

     AROUND A CORNER, Ichabod comes to the last door.  He bends,
     slipping the white rose under the crack of the door.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- MORNING

     Rain.  Ichabod comes out.  Across the lawn, Young Masbath is
     bringing the horses.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL (o.s.) 
               Good morrow, Constable.

     Ichabod turns to see Lady Van Tassel in a chair, sewing.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Returning to the Western Woods?

                             ICHABOD 
               Yes, actually.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Use caution.

                             ICHABOD
                     (nods, studies her) 
               Do you know... I think those are the
               first words I have heard from you my
               entire time here.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               As my husband says, a wife should be
               always like an echo, and at the same
               time, quite unlike an echo.
                     (off Ichabod's confusion) 
               Like an echo, she should speak only
               when spoken to, and unlike an echo,
               should never try to have the last
               word, or, at least that is what he
               believes.

     Baltus comes out the door, irritable, skillet in hand.

                             BALTUS 
               Constable... did you notice anything
               out of the ordinary during the night?

     Ichabod eyes the skillet, ill at ease, trying not to be.

                             ICHABOD 
               Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?

                             BALTUS 
               Sarah has gone missing... my servant
               girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it.
               She has joined the migration out of
               town.
                     (to Lady Van Tassel) 
               What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am
               I to starve to death?

     Lady Van Tassel gets up and goes in, taking the skillet.

                             ICHABOD 
               I should be going... good day to you.

     Ichabod heads towards Young Masbath.  Baltus watches from the
     porch, disgruntled.  He goes in.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     Heavy rain.  Ichabod and Young Masbath ride side by side.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               If the Crone's wound bled hard, that
               means she was not killed by the
               Hessian.  Someone only tried to make
               it look that way.

                             ICHABOD 
               You grow sharper by the minute, little
               man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin
               to prefer your company over all others.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Well... I'm one of the few people who
               likes you.

                             ICHABOD
                     (laughs) 
               True enough.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And
               why?

                             ICHABOD 
               Good questions, deserving answers, of
               which we are in short supply.

     A SOUND is HEARD.  Ichabod looks back, then to Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               Quicken pace.

     Ichabod rides faster.  Young Masbath keeps up.

     FURTHER ON, they charge over a hill.  Ichabod halts Gunpowder
     and climbs clumsily off.

                             ICHABOD 
               Ride on.

     Young Masbath obeys.  Ichabod takes out his pistol and wades
     into forest growth, backtracking.

     INSIDE THE FOREST, Ichabod bounds through underbrush, low.  A
     HORSE is HEARD SNORTING.  He pushes through branches...

     Moving behind a FIGURE IN A GREY CLOAK on horseback.

                             ICHABOD 
               Halt and turn.  I have a pistol aimed
               at your head.

     The figure stops, pushes off the cloak hood.  Katrina.

                             KATRINA 
               It is only me.

                             ICHABOD
               Katrina.  Why do you follow?

                             KATRINA
               I apologize if I worried you.

                             ICHABOD 
               A woman should not be out alone in
               these woods.

                             KATRINA 
               But, I am not alone, am I?  I only
               wished to see what you were up to,
               and...
                     (takes out WHITE ROSE) 
               To thank you.

     Ichabod softens, but doesn't want to.

                             ICHABOD
               Come along.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY

     Raining still.  Ichabod, Masbath and Katrina come into a
     clearing, mouths falling open at the sight of...

     A monstrously huge TREE OF THE DEAD, at the clearing's
     center, with branches reaching far and wide, knotted and
     gross, like agony captured in wood sculpture.

     Ichabod dismounts, crossing a line beyond which grass and
     weeds will not grow.  Young Masbath and Katrina dismount.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               You were right... it does draw
               attention to itself.

     Ichabod stares up into the endless, dead canopy of branches.
     He circles the incredibly wide trunk.

     There's a VERTICAL WOUND in the bark, as if the tree once had
     a terrible vertical in it, now partially healed and
     disgustingly scarred.  Ichabod approaches.

     He feels the mushy scar, picking at its scabs till much sap
     begins to trickle. It is red and Ichabod fingers it.

                             ICHABOD
               Blood.

                             KATRINA
               What did you say?

     Ichabod goes to where Katrina and Masbath wait with the
     horses, digs in a saddle bag for a hand axe.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               What is it?

                             ICHABOD
               Stay back.

     At the trunk, Ichabod thumps the flat end of the axe against
     the suture.  It sounds hollow.  Ichabod begins to chop.

     He pulls away loose bark.  The tree drips more blood and a
     clear goo.  Ichabod uses both hands on the axe to hack at the
     festering suture.

                             KATRINA
               What are you doing?

                             ICHABOD
               Just... keep where you are.

     Ignoring, Young Masbath moves closer.  Ichabod keeps
     chopping, then grips a large, loose flap of wood, trying to
     bend it.  It's not easy.  Ichabod struggles.

     Katrina follows Masbath's slow advance.

     Ichabod's pulling... the flap suddenly gives, revealing a
     blood-soaked, wide-eyed, gap-mouthed HUMAN HEAD.

     Ichabod recoils.  Behind him, Katrina stifles a scream,
     taking Young Masbath in her arms to keep him from looking.

     It is Philipse's head, hanging off the trunk flap, held by
     roots grown around and into the flesh.

     Ichabod reapproaches, back of his hand to his mouth.

     FOUR other SEVERED, DECAYING HEADS are held by ingrown roots
     within the dewy innards.

                             KATRINA 
               My God... what has happened?

                             ICHABOD 
               He... he tries to take the heads...
               they will not pass.

     He looks to the branches towering above.

                             ICHABOD 
               Must be some sort of gateway.  But,
               why this place... ?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               We should go.

                             ICHABOD 
               Why this tree?

     Ichabod begins looking at the ground, moving around the tree.
     He gets to his knees, pushing mud away.

     Uncovering a flush HEADSTONE carved with "666."

                             ICHABOD
                     (to himself) 
               "Climb down to the Horseman's
               soulless place."
                     (to Masbath) 
               Bring the shovel.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- LATER DAY

     Rain.  Young Masbath's crouched, muddy, rifle across his
     knees.  He's watching the tree.

     Behind him, Katrina climbs out of the shallow grave near a
     pile of mud.  Ichabod hands up the shovel.

                             KATRINA 
               Masbath, we've found it.

     Young Masbath goes to the grave.  Ichabod pulls at thick
     burlap cloth, straining as it comes away.

     Ichabod looks down, disbelieving.

                             ICHABOD 
               It cannot be true.

     WE SEE: roots have gripped the Horseman's bones and tattered
     uniform.  The skeleton is all there -- except the skull.

                             ICHABOD 
               Why is it every grave I open holds
               a new mystery inside?

                             KATRINA 
               The skull is gone.

                             ICHABOD 
               Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.

     Ichabod climbs out, weary in body and spirit.  LIGHTNING.
     THUNDER.  He stares at the bones.

                             ICHABOD 
               This is his silent shrieking... and
               his desire, to reclaim his head.

     Ichabod turns, looking to the bordering forest.

                             ICHABOD 
               "He who holds fast the Horseman's
               desire will guide his reaping hand." 
                     (pause) 
               Someone controls the Horseman.

                             KATRINA (o.s.) 
               Ichabod!

     Ichabod turns, looks...

     Katrina and Young Masbath back away, because the ROOTS in the
     grave are ALIVE, further entwining around remains.

     Ichabod spins to the twisted tree...

     The vertical SUTURE SEETHES, pulling inwards... sucking
     Philipse's head back in and closing, bubbling.

     Ichabod bounds over grave dirt pile, hastening Katrina and
     Young Masbath along as he flees.

     At the tree, the suture swells.

     Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath pass where their freaking
     horses are tied to a fallen trunk, heading for cover.

     A RUMBLING is HEARD from the twisted tree, which suddenly
     BURSTS wide, spitting smoldering cinders.

     At the tree line, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath cower,
     looking back.

     From the tree wound, a glow brightens, till the Headless
     Horseman and Daredevil EXPLODE into existence...

     They hit the ground running.

     Ichabod watches the Horseman ride away with bolts of
     LIGHTNING STRIKING the GROUND BEHIND.

     The Horseman disappears in the forest.

                             ICHABOD
               His next victim is chosen!
                     (to Masbath)
               Give me distance, then guide her
               back to the Hollow.

     Ichabod runs towards the horses.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Constable!

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     The Horseman rips past on Daredevil.

     EXT.  BEHIND IN WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     Ichabod rides as fast as Gunpowder is able.


     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Small home.  Killian, Thomas and Beth have finished supper.
     Beth clears plates as Killian picks his teeth with a knife.

                             THOMAS
               May I be excused, father?

                             KILLIAN
               Do you deserve to be?

                             THIRD MAN
                     (shyly)
               I think so.

                             KILLIAN
                     (smiles)
               Then, go.

     Thomas gets down from his chair.  He goes to the fireplace to
     light a tallow wick, which he takes to the next room.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Thomas plops on the floor and lights his MAGIC LANTERN: a
     lantern with an outer sleeve of glass painted with
     silhouettes of lions and monsters.

     Thomas turns the lantern and looks to the walls where the
     creatures, shadows are thrown.  He roars for them, imagining
     them real and having a grand time.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Beth comes for more dishes.

                             BETH 
               Don't pick teeth.  You teach Thomas
               bad habits.

     Killian pulls her to him, playful.

                             KILLIAN 
               I am a bad habit.  There's nothing
               for it.

                             BETH
                     (kisses him) 
               No one knows better than I.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Thomas continues his fun, shadow animals circling him.

     In the shifting light, a baby spider comes from a crack in
     the wall.  Then, another spider skitters out.  More follow.

     EXT.  FORESTS -- DAY

     A black horse runs, hooves pounding the ground.  THUNDER is
     HEARD.  The horse slows and stops... it is Brom's horse, with
     Brom aboard.  Brom looks skyward.

     The storm harshens, roaring through the trees.  Distant
     HOOFBEATS can be HEARD.  POUNDING.

     Brom takes his rifle off his shoulder.  The HOOFBEATS grow
     LOUDER and PASS, far away.  Brom turns in the saddle and
     WHISTLES.  He kicks his horse and rides.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Thomas still watches shadow beasts, but sees something else.
     He goes to the crack where hundreds of spiders flee all
     directions. Thomas is amused.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Behind Killian, mantelpiece stones pulse, breathing almost
     imperceptibly.  Demonic faces form, then disappear and reform
     again, shifting.  WIND HOWLS.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth enters, looking at Thomas.

                             BETH
               What are you doing there?

     The magic lantern stops spinning.  Shadow creatures freeze.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     The ENTIRE HOUSE CREAKS.  Killian looks up.  CREAKING STOPS.
     The HOWLING WIND is LOUD.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth comes to Thomas' side as he points.

                             THOMAS
               Spiders.

     Beth bends to see the swarming spiders.  She looks up,
     noticing the FEROCITY of the WIND.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Killian stands, looking up.  The HOUSE CREAKS again, then
     suddenly the WIND CEASES.  Silence.

                             KILLIAN
               Beth...

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth picks up Thomas.  The magic lantern creatures begin
     spinning anew, all around.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     With a ROAR, the fire flares.  Killian looks.

     WHHOOOSH the fire shoots up the fireplace.  Gone.

     Behind Killian, the DOOR SPLINTERS INWARDS.  The Horseman
     steps in, a battle axe in each hand.  WIND BLASTS...

     The DOOR to the other room SLAMS.

     Killian grabs a kitchen chair and hurls it at the Horseman.
     The Horseman swings, smashing it aside.

                             KILLIAN
               Beth... run!

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth hugs Thomas to her as she backs away.

                             KILLIAN (o.s.)
                     (from kitchen)
               Get out!

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Killian grabs an iron skewer from the fireplace, swings it to
     fend off a blow from the Horseman.

     The Horseman swings the other axe.  Killian ducks.  The axe
     cracks fireplace stone, throwing sparks.

     Killian lunges, jamming the skewer into the Horseman.

     The skewer comes through the Horseman's back.  The Horseman
     swipes with the flat of one axe -- pounding Killian aside.

     Killian hits the wall, bashing his head.  Hits the floor.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     Beth kicks a carpet to reveal a trap door.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     The Horseman pulls the skewer out of his body, throws it.  He
     goes to lift Killian by the hair with one hand, brings back
     the axe in the other...

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     At the trap door, Beth lowers Thomas to stairs leading to the
     cellar.  Thomas is crying.

                             BETH
               Don't let him get you.

                             THOMAS
               Mommy...

                             BETH
               You hide now... go...

     Beth closes the trap door, frantically replacing the carpet.
     The room's door flies open and the Horseman strides in,
     carrying Killian's severed head.  Beth shrieks.

     The Horseman steps forward, knocks over the magic lantern.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY

     Beth's SCREAMS are abruptly CUT OFF.  Her BODY is HEARD
     HITTING the floor above.  Thomas crosses the cellar,
     stumbles.  He scurries into the shelter of a wheelbarrow
     propped against the wall.  FOOTSTEPS are HEARD.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY

     The Horseman's hands place Killian's and Beth's heads in a
     sack, cinching the sack shut.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     The Headless Horseman enters, bends to retrieve the battle
     axe he left.  He stands.  Pause.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY

     Thomas' trembling hands pull the wheelbarrow closer.  QUIET.
     He tries to control his sobbing.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     The Horseman turns, falls to his knees.  He starts to chop at
     the floor with both axes.  CHOPping,  CHOPping,  CHOPping...
     making quick work of it...

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY

     A hole appears in the ceiling as debris falls.

     Thomas looks up, terrified.  He gets up to run away...

     The Horseman's arm shoves through above, grasping Thomas and
     yanking him up.

     EXT.  KILLIAN'S FARM -- DAY

     Brom rides from the forest, charging across Killian's field.

     At Killian's house, Daredevil rides up as the Headless
     Horseman walks out with his sack of heads.  The Horseman ties
     the sack to the saddle and leaps up.

     Brom puts his reins in his mouth, raising his rifle.

     The Horseman heads away, past the barn, as Brom gains.

     Brom aims... FIRES!

     BOOM -- the slug EXPLODES, blowing the Horseman off
     Daredevil.  Daredevil keeps going.  The Horseman's smoldering
     body is left "face down."

     Brom halts his horse.  He climbs down, pleased.

     The Horseman moves.

     Brom backs away, satisfaction diminishing.

     The Horseman gets on his knees.

     Brom falls to one knee, begins reloading.  He fills the gun
     from his powder horn.

     The Horseman stands, unsheathes his sword and turns.  The
     blast has blown apart his uniform at the chest and shoulder,
     exposing rotten flesh and maggot-infested muscle.

     Brom readies his ramrod, jamming powder in the barrel.

     The Horseman charges.

     Brom stands, pulling out the ramrod.  The Horseman is on him.
     Brom swings the rifle, blocking.  Sparks fly.

     The battle is on, with Brom fending off the Horseman's sword
     with the gun -- CLANK -- CLANK -- CLANK.

     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod and Gunpowder break into the open.

     UP THE FIELD, the Horseman makes a backhanded swing.  Brom
     goes down, his rifle sent flying.

     Brom rolls to avoid as the Horseman slashes.

     Brom flees.  The Horseman pulls and throws a knife...

     THWAP -- the knife imbeds in Brom's thigh.

     The Horseman runs towards Brom.

     Ichabod closes in, pulling an unlit lantern off his saddle.

     Brom tries to get up, bends to extract the knife.

     The Horseman, mid-run, changes his sword grip, blade down.

     He plants one foot on Brom's back, raising his sword, about
     to skewer...

     Ichabod arrives full gallop, SMASHES the lantern into the
     Horseman -- knocking the Horseman off Brom.

     AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST, Theodore and Glen arrive on
     horseback.  They hold a moment, watching.

     Brom runs, limping, to the barn, goal in sight: farm
     implements propped there.  Brom grabs SCYTHES with long
     curved blades, one in per hand.

     The Horseman rises.

     Ichabod turns Gunpowder and leaps off, runs to Brom.

     The Horseman moves towards them, hefting a battle axe in his
     free hand.  Ichabod steps up, pistol aimed, furious.

                             ICHABOD
               For what it's worth...

     FIRES -- the bullet rips through the Horseman's stomach to
     reveal putrid innards as he keeps advancing.

     At the forest, Theodore looks to Glenn, turns and flees.

     Brom steps up, scythes ready.  He and the Horseman go at it.
     Brom blocks axe and sword, catching and deflecting blows.

     At the forest, Glenn follows Theodore away.

     Ichabod grabs a long handled SICKLE.

     Brom swings the scythes.  The Horseman avoids.

     Ichabod moves to the side, looking for an opening.  He swings
     the sickle. The Horseman blocks.

     The Horseman battles both at once, catching blows...
     countering every strike, METAL RINGING.

     Brom catches the Horseman's sword in one scythe, holding it
     off.  Catches the axe handle in the other scythe.

     The Horseman flatfoot KICKS Brom's chest, sending him down.

     Ichabod swings the sickle blade...

     Hits the Horseman, the blade embedding to the hilt.

     The Horseman drops his axe and grasps the sickle, jerking...

     The sickle handle SLAMS Ichabod's, knocking him away.

     Ichabod crawls, tries to shake off the blow.

     He looks up.  The Horseman staggers, spastically trying to
     pull the blade from his body.

     Brom limps to Ichabod, yanks him to his feet.

                             BROM
               We cannot win this.

     They head towards the forest.

     Behind, the Horseman extracts the sickle, throws it.  He
     strides after them, picks up his axe on the way.

     EXT.  RIVERBANK -- DAY

     Ichabod and Brom stumble down a hillside.  Brom points.

                             BROM
               There...

     They run to a DOCK at the edge of a wide, rapid river.  They
     jump into a FLAT BOAT barge.

                             BROM
               Go to the front and guide it.

     Ichabod goes.  Brom uses a scythe to slash the ropes.

     Ichabod picks up a GUIDE POLE.  The barge lurches, set free.

     Ichabod struggles to push the boat out.  it moves swiftly,
     caught in rain swollen current.

     Brom looks back.  No Horseman.  He leaves the scythe and
     moves to the front, hefting another pole to help guide.

                             BROM
               Let's see him catch us now.

     Ichabod looks to the shore.  Horror.

                             ICHABOD
               Look.

     LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES -- ahead, the Horseman stands on the
     bank with Axe and sword.  Daredevil near.

                             BROM 
               We'll pass right by the son of a bitch.

     Ichabod and Brom push with the poles, trying for speed.

     At the bank, the Horseman walks directly to the water...

     Just as he takes a step onto the water, the rain churned
     surface TRANSFORMS -- instantly BECOMING a SHEET of ICE...

     SPREADING and supporting the Horseman as he advances.

     ICE SHOOTS OUT ahead of him, towards a point in the river
     where it will intercept the barge.

                             BROM
               My Christ...

     The Horseman's ICE BRIDGE engulfs the barge, HALTING IT.

     Ichabod and Brom are thrown.  The barge is trapped.

     The Horseman nears.

     Brom runs to the rear to retrieve his scythe.  Ichabod holds
     up the only weapon he has, his guide pole.

     The Horseman steps on board.  Ichabod swings.  The Horseman's
     axe cracks the pole in half...

     The Horseman thrusts with sword -- into Ichabod's chest --
     clean through.  It SIZZLES as Ichabod screams.

     The Horseman lifts Ichabod up, flips him, pulling the sword
     out as Ichabod goes...

     SMASHING through the ice and under.

     UNDERWATER: water carries Ichabod, slams him against ice
     above. He's pulled down by undertow.

     ABOVE WATER, beyond the edge of the ice bridge: Ichabod comes
     up, gasping, choking on rain.

     He treads water, looking to the barge.

     ICHABOD'S P.O.V. -- FROM THE WATER

     Aboard the barge, the Horseman cuts Brom down... stands over
     him, chopping with sword.  Our VIEW grows BLURRY, and...

     FADES OUT/IN

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Candlelight.  Ichabod, shirtless, feverish, opens his eyes.
     The wound at the top of his chest is raw.  Katrina inserts a
     needle in the skin around it.

                             KATRINA
               Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Doctor, he is awake.

     Ichabod tries to sit.  Pain stops him.  Lady Van Tassel helps
     bleed the wound with the needle and a tube leading to a
     SUCTION JAR of blood.

                             ICHABOD
                     (barely a voice)
               What... what are you doing... ?

                             KATRINA
               I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.

     Doctor Lancaster comes to the bed.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               Keep still, Constable.  You were
               half-drowned when they found you.

                             ICHABOD
               ... Brom Bones...

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               He is dead.  You would be also, if
               your wound had not somehow shut.

                             ICHABOD
               Bring Young Masbath here.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               You need to sleep.

                             ICHABOD
               Bring him.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               You need rest.

     Ichabod gives up, closes his eyes.  Katrina, needle in one
     hand, brings her other hand to hold Ichabod's.

     Blood drips into the suction jar.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Ichabod is soundly asleep.  Across the room, Katrina is at
     his work table.  Ichabod stirs.  Katrina looks to him.

     Once she is satisfied he will not wake, she returns to what
     she was doing, turning a page.  She is reading his ledger.

     EXT.  SERVANT'S QUARTER'S, MASBATH'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath lies awake.  A glint of light crosses the
     window.  Masbath looks to it, gets up, peers out.

     THROUGH THE WINDOW, he can see the Van Tassel Manor House in
     the distance.  Lantern LIGHT crosses the lawn.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE, ORCHARD -- NIGHT

     The lantern light moves through the orchard, away from the
     house.  We cannot make out the person.

     Elsewhere, Young Masbath runs in pursuit.  He hides against
     one tree, leans to look...

     The light enters forest.  Young Masbath follows.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- MORNING

     Ichabod's hurting.  Masbath helps with a shirt.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Someone left last night.  Looked
               like they headed to the square, but
               I lost them in the forest.

                             ICHABOD 
               Man or woman?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               All I saw was their lantern.

                             ICHABOD 
               Business, best hidden is hidden best
               at night.

     Ichabod goes to his work table, organizing his satchel.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               If someone has the Horseman's skull...
               if they control the Horseman, then why
               haven't they sent him for your head
               yet?

                             ICHABOD 
               Because, I serve a fine purpose alive.
               It is perfection for our murderer if I
               return to New York City with nothing
               more than tales of a galloping ghoul. 
                     (pause) 
               We must uncover the reason these
               victims were targeted.  What was taken
               from them... other than their lives?
               Who benefits by their deaths?

     Ichabod fumbles the bottle of white powder.

     It bounces, cork popping out... rolls under the bed.

                             ICHABOD 
               Damn it.

     Ichabod kneels, pained.  A trail of the blood-detecting
     powder has spilled.  The bottle is out of reach.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               I'll get it.

     Young Masbath gets down, ready to crawl for it, but Ichabod
     stops him, peering under.

                             ICHABOD
               Wait...

     Far under, near the bottle, some powder is bubbling.

     Ichabod moves to the end of the bed and lifts, in pain. 
     Young Masbath helps. They drag the bed to one side.

     Under the bed: a Satanic PENTAGRAM has been DRAWN IN BLOOD.

     Ichabod stares, trying to grasp the implication.  Masbath is
     about to speak, but Ichabod puts a finger to his lips.

     Ichabod moves to lock the door.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
                     (whispers) 
               Who did this?

     Ichabod does not answer.  He picks up a wash basin and dumps
     the water to wash the Pentagram away.


     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- DAY

     WAGONS, HORSES and TOWNSPEOPLE swarm.  A CROWD loots the
     town's general store.  Provisions are passed along man to man
     and loaded on wheelbarrows.

     All up and down the long straight road, home owners board up
     windows with lumber.

     Ichabod and Young Masbath ride, passing many angry faces.

                             ICHABOD
               Panic has set in.

     They stop, tying their horses and climbing stairs to the door
     of the "NOTARY."  Ichabod looks off...

     DOWN THE ROAD, at the far end, people head to the church.
     Much activity there as well.

                             ICHABOD
               Sanctuary.  Or, so they hope.

     Families put up tents all around the church within the
     bordering wrought-iron fence.  Supplies abound.

     People work to build and erect massive wooden crosses.


     INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY

     Tidy room.  Young Masbath watches Ichabod hand a slip of
     paper to the elderly Notary, Hardenbrook.

                             ICHABOD
               Do you have these persons' wills?

                             HARDENBROOK
               I have everything... last testaments...
               birth certificates, death certificates...
               deeds.

                             ICHABOD
               Yes, sir... but, do you have these?

     Hardenbrook studies the paper with his one good eye.

                             HARDENBROOK
               Certainly... certainly.

     Hardenbrook nods, handing the list back, grinning.  Ichabod
     stands waiting.  Hardenbrook is still nodding.

                             ICHABOD
               May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?

                             HARDENBROOK
               Hmm?  See them?

                             ICHABOD
               May we look at them now?

                             HARDENBROOK 
               Of course.  You want them... it shall
               not take long.  Wait here.

     Hardenbrook heads across the room.  Ichabod offers the list.

                             ICHABOD
               Maybe you should take this.

                             HARDENBROOK 
               A fine idea.

     Hardenbrook takes it and exits.  Young Masbath sits.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What good is this?

                             ICHABOD 
               To discover what might have been taken
               from those who died, it will help to
               know what was there that could be
               taken in the first place.

     Ichabod waits.  After a moment, he looks uncertain.  He
     crosses to the half-open door...

     INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM -- DAY

     Ichabod sticks his head in, not liking what he sees.

     Hardenbrook's amidst unbelievable disarray.  Tables, shelves,
     and baskets of unevenly piled documents.

     Hardenbrook looks on a shelf, confused, then goes to a table,
     lifting papers, mumbling.

                             HARDENBROOK 
               Damn... damn... damn...

                             ICHABOD
               Master Hardenbrook...

     Hardenbrook turns, a bit startled.

                             ICHABOD 
               Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?

                             HARDENBROOK
               Well... that might be... helpful.

     INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM (TIME CUT) -- DAY

     Hardenbrook is asleep in a chair, snoring, blind eye open.
     Ichabod and Young Masbath face official-looking documents,
     with Ichabod focused on one will in hand.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               My father had farm land.  It was the
               only thing we owned of any value.

                             ICHABOD
                     (still reading) 
               And it now belongs to you, according
               to Baltus.  I heard him say it.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Yes.

     Ichabod turns the will in his hand to Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               Then look here at your father's will,
               and tell me why you are not listed.

     Young Masbath takes it, boggled.  Ichabod grabs another.

                             ICHABOD 
               Van Garrett had denoted his elder son
               in his last wishes; the same son
               murdered along with him.  But Van
               Garrett's wife and two infant children
               are not written... and they were spared.
                     (picks up another will)
               Do you see?  Philipse had no family to
               bestow his farm to.  But, here...
                     (picks up another) 
               The Widow Windsor was listed on her
               late husband's will.  After her
               inheritance, she amended the document
               to include her bastard child.  This is
               why the Horseman made absolutely
               certain to impale the unborn descendant.

     Ichabod sits back.

                             ICHABOD 
               Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that
               the Horseman slaughters by assignment.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               But, if the farm is not mine, who stole
               it away?

                             ICHABOD 
               No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has
               gone intestate.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               In test... what?

                             ICHABOD 
               Intestate.  Your farm... all the
               farms... they belong to no one.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What does it mean?

     Ichabod stares off.

                             ICHABOD 
               Often in such cases, property which
               has gone intestate legally passes to
               whomever the deceased was indebted to.
               And, who in this town is owed a great
               many debts?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
                     (realization) 
               Baltus Van Tassel.

                             ICHABOD 
               Did your father take a loan?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.

     Ichabod stands, grim, gathering wills and his ledger.

                             ICHABOD 
               Tonight, we answer questions.  And, to
               discover who moves about the Van Tassel
               house after dark... all we need is a
               candle.

     A LOUD NOISE is HEARD from the other room.  Ichabod looks.

     INT.  HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY

     Ichabod bursts in.  No one there.  A chair has been knocked
     over and the front door is ajar.  Ichabod moves...

     EXT.  NOTARY -- DAY

     Ichabod exits.  All around is the commotion in the square as
     before.  No telling who it was who just fled.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY

     Young Masbath is seated, bored.  Ichabod writes in his
     ledger.  A KNOCK on the door.  They both look up.

                             KATRINA (o.s.)
                     (from outside door)
               Constable... are you there?
                     (long pause)
               Ichabod?

     The knob is tried and found locked.  Pause.  At the bottom of
     the door, a red rose is passed under.

     This saddens Ichabod.


     EXT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Quiet night.  The church is a sight, with a yard resembling
     an empty squatter's tent city, surrounded by crosses.
     Boarded over windows leak shafts of light.

     MOVING PAST THE WINDOWS: many eyes peer out from the slats.

     UP IN THE BELFRY, TWO RIFLEMEN are on watch.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Masbath are in darkness, still waiting.  Ichabod
     takes the cover off a lantern, looks at a clock.  Midnight,
     straight up.  Ichabod stands, picks up an unlit candle.

                             ICHABOD
               Midnight seems an appropriate time.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Young Masbath look out, cautious.  They move to
     the nearest door.

     Ichabod crouches, using the candle to mark the seam of the
     door and door frame.  He's making a low, wax seal.  If the
     door opens, the seal will break.

     They move to a second door, quietly.  Ichabod makes another
     low wax mark.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, MAIN ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs to a hall.  Ichabod
     continues his wax marking at each door.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, BALTUS' OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Young Masbath enter, shutting the door.  Ichabod
     walks to shelves at Baltus' desk, looks through ribbon bound
     DOCUMENTS and hands some to Masbath.

     Young Masbath pulls off the ribbon, pages through these "LOAN
     AGREEMENT" parchments.  Ichabod brings another pile.

                             ICHABOD
                     (whispering)
               They are alphabetical.

     Young Masbath has the M's.  "MARYIE," "MEGAPOLENISIS," AND
     "MELYN..." Not finding what he wants.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               There is no Masbath here.  My father's
               loan papers are missing.

                             ICHABOD
                     (regarding his documents) 
               There are none for Magistrate Philipse
               either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter,
               Thomas" "Pos, William."

     A FLOORBOARD CREAKS.  Ichabod looks, blows out the lantern.
     He and Young Masbath stand frozen.

     Across the room, light comes under the door, stops, then
     continues.  A DOOR is HEARD OPENING and SHUTTING.  Ichabod
     crosses to follow, pointing back.

                             ICHABOD 
               Keep looking.  Then, hide in my room
               and bolt the door till I return.


     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Lantern light moves, far ahead.  Ichabod follows.

     EXT.  FOREST, FURTHER ON -- NIGHT

     Ichabod stops, hidden.  He can see the light ahead, but it is
     no longer in motion.  He advances.

     EXT.  FOREST CLEARING -- NIGHT

     A lantern sits on a rock.  On a blanket, a semi-naked MAN and
     semi-naked WOMAN are in the midst of rough SEX.

     Ichabod crawls to peer from underbrush.

     The couple keeps coupling, with the man on top.  His grunts
     and gasps are particularly desperate.  He's all over the
     woman, who lays back... it is Lady van Tassel.

     Ichabod swallows, inches closer.

     Lady van Tassel pulls the man's shirt, exposes his flesh.
     She raises a small, sharp KNIFE behind his back.

     Ichabod's eyes widen.

     Lady Van Tassel brings the blade to her own hand, slicing
     deep in her palm.  Blood flows.  She rubs her cut hand over
     her partner's arching back, smearing blood.

     Lady van Tassel caresses the man's chest, neck, face...
     trailing blood.  The man lifts his head, in ecstasy, sucks
     the woman's bloody fingers... it's Clergyman Steenwyck.

     Ichabod backs away, having seen more than plenty.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath unlocks the door.  Ichabod enters.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               I was getting worried.  Who was it?

                             ICHABOD 
               Lady Van Tassel.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What was she doing?

                             ICHABOD 
               Something I really wish I had not seen.
               Never mind it.  Did you find the
               victims' loan agreements?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               No.  They are all missing.

     This troubles Ichabod.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               There is more, though.  While you were
               gone, I could hear someone else
               walking through the house.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Young Masbath creep round a corner.  Going to the
     LAST DOOR, Ichabod crouches, eyes narrowing...

                             ICHABOD
                     (whispers, to himself) 
               Katrina.

     The wax seal is broken, flecks of wax on the floor.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER AND HALL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs, checking all the wax
     marks.  Young Masbath finds one broken.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Here.

     Ichabod comes over, pushes the door...

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     They enter.  The kitchen is empty.  Ichabod crosses to
     another door, crouches.  Another broken wax mark.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT

     They enter... the room with the elaborate loom.  Ichabod
     moves his lantern to make a quick search, goes to table.

     He touches the top of a candle.  His finger comes away with a
     bit of still wet wax.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               There are no other doors.  This is as
               far as she could have gone.

                             ICHABOD 
               It is nothing.  She comes to read books,
               so her father will not find her.
                     (to convince himself) 
               It is absolutely nothing.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               What books?

                             ICHABOD 
               Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does
               not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be
               long before Lady Van Tassel returns.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               But, sir... what books?  Where are they?

     Ichabod stops, looking around.  No books anywhere.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               If there is a secret place for books...
               it could be just as good for the
               missing loan agreements.

     Ichabod ponders this without saying anything.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     SEARCH MONTAGE:

     - Drawers are opened and searched, quietly.
     - Young Masbath uses a candle to look up the fireplace.
     - Ichabod opens a linen cabinet, unfolding blankets.
     - Young Masbath looks in a closet filled with big spools of
     sewing thread, on his knees, pulls a wooden box forward.
     Inside it, he finds only old cups and silverware.

     Ichabod pulls up a rug, feeling along the floorboards.

     Young Masbath crawls, doing the same.  He climbs under the
     loom, tapping on the floor.  TAP... TAP... TAP...

     He crawls further under the loom.  TAP... TAP... PLONK.  A
     hollow sound.  He taps again... PLONK... PLONK.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Constable.

     Ichabod comes over as Young Masbath lifts a loose board.
     Under the floor, there are piles of books.  Masbath brings
     them up, handing them to Ichabod, who studies the spines.

     Young Masbath reaches in up to his shoulder.  He comes up
     with "LOAN AGREEMENTS."

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Fie!  Here they are.

     Ichabod takes them.  Names are near the top: "Masbath," "Van
     Garret," "Philipse," and "Killian."

     Ichabod sits back, numb, his heart bitterly broken.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING

     Lady Van Tassel prepares food with two servants at the open
     fireplace/oven.  Ichabod enters, rushed.

                             ICHABOD 
               Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina
               is not in her room.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               No.  She has gone out.

                             ICHABOD 
               Where?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               She has taken the last of our grain
               to be milled.
                     (crossing to him) 
               You do have a background in the
               medical arts, don't you, Constable?

                             ICHABOD
               Very little.  I must be going...

     Lady Van Tassel holds out her cut palm, the gash sewn shut.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Will you look at this?  I cut my hand
               this morning: I sewed it myself, but
               I am afraid it will go bad.

     Ichabod takes her hand, distracted and nervous.

                             ICHABOD
               It appears well.  It has already
               clotted.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Look closer.  Do you have anything to
               clean it with?

                             ICHABOD
               It is fine.  Now, I must...

     Lady Van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the wrist, tight.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
                     (whispering, close) 
               I know you saw me.

                             ICHABOD
               What... ?

     Lady Van Tassel glances to servants, keeps her voice low.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               I know you followed last night.  You
               must promise not to tell Baltus...

     Ichabod tries to pull away, but she grips tighter.  The FRONT
     DOOR is HEARD SLAMMING.  Ichabod is panicky.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Have mercy on me.  Please... have mercy.

     Ichabod pulls away just as Baltus enters.  Lady Van Tassel
     goes back to work as if nothing happened.

                             BALTUS 
               Constable, it is urgent that we speak.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE FRONT PORCH -- MORNING

     Baltus leads Ichabod to the porch.

                             BALTUS 
               Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a
               meeting.  This time he is determined
               to have you forced out, or worse.

                             ICHABOD 
               How did you hear this?

                             BALTUS
               He came to me.  He promised great
               violence.  Said I should cast you out
               for my own protection.
                     (troubled pause)
               I must speak honestly.  There is no
               reason to think he will not meet with
               success.

     Ichabod looks to barn, sees Masbath bringing the horses.  The
     CHURCH BELL is HEARD TOLLING far away.

                             BALTUS 
               That is the meeting bell already
               calling.  With the murder of Killian
               and Brom, no one sees any good from
               you.  If... if you were to leave...
               you might be saving your own life.

     Ichabod studies Baltus, then offers his hand.  They shake.

                             ICHABOD 
               I appreciate your concern.  I thank
               you, sir.

     Ichabod hurries off, across the lawn, exasperated.  He runs.
     Masbath runs to him.  Ichabod takes Gunpowder and climbs up.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
                     (mounting his horse) 
               What now?  Where is she?

                             ICHABOD 
               Things have become complicated.
               Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead,
               find her and bring her to meet me
               outside the church.  Find her at all
               costs.  Quickly.

     They ride, fast.


     EXT.  FOREST -- DAY

     A conjuring pile of straw burns.  Gloved hands unfold a paper
     filled with clippings of human hair.  The hair is sprinkled
     on the fire.

     A cloaked FIGURE is kneeled at the pile.  The figure turns to
     remove A human SKULL from a cloth bag.

     The skull is placed at center in the flames.  It's teeth are
     sharp, cut to points.  The HORSEMAN'S SKULL.


     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     In the church yard refugee camp, food is prepared over fire.
     People inhabit the tents.

     INT.  CHURCH, STEENWYCK'S QUARTERS -- MORNING

     IN THE CHURCH: it's crowded with families.  Pews filled with
     bedding and belongings.  Steenwyck comes to CLOSE the DOUBLE
     DOORS of his quarters, turning, angry.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               You are astonishing, Constable.  Do
               you truly think your ridiculous
               accusations frighten me?

     Ichabod is doing nothing to hide his disdain.

                             ICHABOD 
               Only if I repeat them outside this
               room.  And, I will if I must...
                     (points to doors) 
               Out there, for all to hear.  Or...
               you may speak, as planned.  But, you
               tell them you feel compelled to move
               on to greener pastures.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               No.  You will not run me out.  No one
               will believe a word of what you say.

                             ICHABOD 
               Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does
               not travel alone for long here.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free
               thinker who does not believe in
               divinity.

                             ICHABOD 
               It is only important what you are.
               An adulterer...

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               I am the Lord's voice in this town.

                             ICHABOD
               Wallowing in sin and lust...

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               They need guidance.

                             ICHABOD 
               Wallowing quite literally in blood.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
                     (snapping, quaking) 
               Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!

                             ICHABOD 
               He may.  But, not soon enough for
               you, and not on your behalf.

     Ichabod walks.  Steenwyck is humiliated.

                             ICHABOD 
               You are so upset now... and yet, you
               seemed in such good spirits last night.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!

                             ICHABOD 
               Climb to the top of the tallest ladder
               you can find, Father.  That is the
               closest you ever come to God.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Pews are packed.  Steenwyck enters, walks to the altar.
     EVERYONE QUIETS.  Steenwyck has composed himself, barely.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               My friends... dear friends.  Those of
               you still on your farms, I thank you
               for coming.

     He sees Ichabod near the back.  THUNDER is HEARD OUTSIDE.

                             FATHER STEENWYCK 
               I... I address unfortunate business. 
                     (pause) 
               I am forced to take my leave from
               Sleepy Hollow.  I will be moving on to
               do the Lord's work elsewhere.

     The GATHERERS MURMUR shock.  Ichabod walks out.


     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY

     Raining hard.  Baltus and Lady Van Tassel ride.

                             BALTUS 
               Hurry along.  The meeting has most
               certainly already begun.  We do not
               want Steenwyck as our enemy.

     Lady Van Tassel trails.  WOOD is HEARD SPLINTERING...

     Just off the road, a tree falls...

     The trunk catches Lady Van Tassel's horse on its rear flank.

     The horse falls.  Lady Van Tassel hits the dirt.

     Baltus looks back, halting.

     Lady Van Tassel looks up to Baltus in fear, then turns.

     Behind her, the Headless Horseman trots from, the forest on
     Daredevil, stops.  Calm.  He takes his axe in hand.


     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Storming.  The meeting is letting out.  Near the churchyard
     gate, Young Masbath rides with Katrina following on a horse
     cart.  Ichabod walks up as Katrina dismounts.

                             KATRINA 
               What is so urgent?

                             ICHABOD 
               Come with me.

     Ichabod leads her to where they can talk away from others.

                             KATRINA 
               Why have I not seen your face for so
               long?  You look much better.

     She touches his face, but he takes her hand, places the loan
     agreements there.

                             ICHABOD 
               Explain these.  I found them secreted
               away in the sewing room.

     Katrina's expression changes just so slightly to guilt.

                             ICHABOD 
               Why... why have I scrambled and run
               and clawed in all directions, only to
               find you against me?

     He stares at her.  Katrina stares back, in a small way
     defeated.  She looks for an out, but there is none.

                             KATRINA
               I have been reading your journal.
               I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating
               to resist. 
                     (pause, ashamed) 
               I rode to catch up with you at the
               Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I
               found you though, I overheard what you
               were said.

                             ICHABOD 
               It was you there?

                             KATRINA 
               When... when you spoke father's name
               along with accusations, I could not
               believe it.  I had to hide these... at
               least till I could confront him myself.

                             ICHABOD 
               And, what did he say?

                             KATRINA 
               He did not do these things.  If you
               knew him, you would realize...

                             ICHABOD 
               What did he say, Katrina?

                             KATRINA 
               I have not been able to face him yet.

                             ICHABOD 
               The loans give the land to your father.
               It does not matter survivors are still
               on their farms.  They could be thrown
               off... tomorrow... a year from now.

                             KATRINA 
               Yes, I have seen that, and I told you
               why I hid them.

                             ICHABOD 
               What would you have me believe?

                             KATRINA
                     (tiring, angry) 
               If you think I am behind this, say it.

                             ICHABOD 
               The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You
               share that name.

                             KATRINA 
               Call me a liar, then, and a murderess.
               Say it, out and out.

     Many people are starting to notice the confrontation.

                             ICHABOD 
               Katrina...

                             KATRINA 
               Speak the words, Constable.  What is
               stopping you?  What has happened to your
               ability to transcend sentimentality?

     Emotions tear at him.  Rain seems to pound down harder.

                             KATRINA 
               Oh, no.  No.  Please... don't dare stand
               looking as if you still care for me,
               after all that you have said.  If I were
               to confess, would that ease your
               suffering?  Would that make it easier
               for you to hate me?!

     A TORTURED CRY is HEARD O.S.

     Baltus comes charging through the square on his horse.

                             BALTUS
               The Horseman is coming!

     He's barely hanging on.  He stops, practically falling off,
     running towards Katrina and Ichabod.

                             BALTUS
               Save me...

                             KATRINA
               Father?

                             BALTUS
               He killed her...

     Baltus grasps Katrina, fearful.  HOOFBEATS are HEARD.

                             BALTUS
               The Horseman has killed her.

     Far behind, the Horseman rides to follow, axe held up.
     Instant mayhem -- people scatter all directions, screaming.

     Baltus runs headlong to the church.

                             KATRINA
               Father!

     Katrina runs after Baltus.  Ichabod backs away, watching the
     Horseman come, then heads to the church with Masbath.

     Baltus pushes through the iron gate, into tent city, joining
     the swarm of townsfolk pouring into the church.

     The Horseman rides behind, closing the gap.  Men, women and
     children run for cover all along the square.

     Amidst the churchyard panic, Ichabod looks back...

     The Horseman reaches the open gate and Daredevil suddenly
     rears up, snorting, unwilling to enter.

     The Horseman grabs Daredevil's reins, tries to move forward
     again.  Same result.  Daredevil freaks out.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Baltus makes his way in, shoving.  People are still clamoring
     in through the doors.

     Men pass rifles from stockpiles and climb onto pews at
     boarded windows.  Women herd children into a cellar.

     Baltus searches for a hiding place.  He looks across the
     church to see Steenwyck closing the doors of his living
     quarters.  Baltus moves...

                             BALTUS 
               Steenwyck!

     At the front doors, Katrina squeezes in with Ichabod and
     Young Masbath just as people are forcing the doors closed.
     It's madness.  People outside begin pounding.

     Katrina searches.

                             KATRINA 
               Father!

     Ichabod goes to a window, looking out between boards.

     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Across the yard, the Horseman gives his axe an underhand toss
     to the ground inside the gate.

     The AXE instantly BEGINS TO DEGRADE TO DUST in the rain.

     The Horseman rides, keeping outside the fence.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Ichabod comes away from the window, looking to panicked
     citizens.  He sees Katrina moving up the aisle...

     She's heading towards Baltus, who slams against the door to
     Steenwyck's room.

                             BALTUS 
               Damn you, Steenwyck!  Help me!
               Let me in!

     RIFLES BOOM LOUDLY as men at the windows begin firing.

     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     The Horseman circles, under fire.

     Great clouds of gun smoke shoot from the church.

     Men fire down from the belfry.

     Parts of the Horseman and Daredevil splatter red into the
     rain as slugs hit without effect.

     AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHURCH, the Horseman comes around,
     heading to the town square.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Rifleman shout to each other, running to the opposite windows
     to follow the Horseman.

     Young Masbath grabs a rifle and leaps to join the brigade.

     Baltus is still beating Steenwyck's door when a HUGE FARMER
     grips Baltus angrily and throws him...

                             HUGE FARMER 
               You'll kill us all!

     Baltus falls, knocking over pews.  Katrina's nearby.

                             HUGE FARMER 
               You're the one the Horseman wants.
               Why should we die for you!?

                             KATRINA
               NO!

     The huge farmer picks Baltus up, dragging him and shoving
     Katrina aside as she approaches.

     Ichabod's pushing past people, trying to reach them.

     EXT.  CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- DAY

     The Horseman brings Daredevil to a halt, yanking a large coil
     of ROPE off a hitching post.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     The huge farmer shoves Baltus to the floor again.

                             HUGE FARMER
               Get out!

     Others join the rage, pulling Baltus towards the front of the
     church, shouting.  Ichabod struggles to push them off.

                             ICHABOD 
               Stop this!

     Ichabod gets to Baltus' side, trying to protect.

                             ICHABOD 
               The Horseman cannot enter!  It does
               not matter who he wants, he cannot
               cross the gate!

     At the windows, ONE RIFLEMAN turns, crying out.

                             ONE RIFLEMAN 
               He's coming back!

     More panic.  The huge farmer moves towards Baltus.

                             HUGE FARMER 
               We have to save ourselves!

     Baltus pulls the pistol from Ichabod's holster, brandishing.

                             BALTUS 
               No!  Get away from me!

     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     The Horseman rides past the front, fired upon.

     He halts at the wrought iron gate, reaching to yank off one
     POST which is pointed on top, like an arrow head.

     INT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Baltus holds everyone's back with the pistol.

                             BALTUS 
               The next person to lay hands on me
               will have a bullet.  Stand off!

                             KATRINA
               Father...

                             BALTUS 
               No!  We're safe here.
                     (points at Ichabod) 
               You said it.  The Horseman will not
               have me.

     CRASH, the harpoon-like post SPEARS through a window,
     trailing rope tied to it...

     CRACK -- SKEWERS Baltus from behind, the bloodied point
     bursting out his breast bone.

     Baltus looks down, drops the gun... clutching the post with
     both hands.  Blood streams out his mouth.  Katrina screams.

     The rope yanks Baltus back.  He SLAMS into the WINDOW...

     EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY

     Baltus CRASHES out, hits the ground, dragged...

     Outside the fence, Daredevil runs with the rope tied around
     his saddle pommel.  The Horseman strides forward, sword out.

     Baltus SLAMS the fence and the rope snaps.  He is held there
     awkwardly, gurgling blood.

     The Horseman reaches Baltus... chops off his head.


     INT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS -- DAY

     The storm has passed.  Empty forest.  Long, peaceful pause,
     till Ichabod makes his way through, searching the ground.

     Ichabod comes to look down a small hill.  The corpse of Lady
     Van Tassel lies headless, in a dirty, torn dress.

     Ichabod walks to the body.  Lady Van Tassel's arm is twisted
     behind.  The sewn cut on the palm of her hand faces up.

                             ICHABOD
                     (shouting back)
               Here!  I have found her...
                     (looking at corpse,
                      quiet and miserable)
               Here she is.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL -- EARLY EVENING

     Doctor Lancaster comes out from where Katrina is asleep.  He
     closes the door, wipes his sweaty face.  Ichabod waits.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               It has been a terrible jolt to her
               nerves.

                             ICHABOD 
               You will stay at her side?

     Doctor Lancaster nods.  Ichabod walks.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- EARLY EVENING

     It's getting dark.  Ichabod comes out and crosses the porch.
     A few of the Hollow's residents are here.  Young Masbath gets
     up and follows Ichabod onto the lawn.

     Ichabod walks without waiting.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               She's the one who controlled the
               Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
                     (no answer)

                             ICHABOD 
               I need time for thinking.  Without you
               hanging on my coattails for a change.

     Ichabod keeps walking.  Young Masbath stops, wounded.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod stands holding a torch, looking up.  The whole area
     is bright from the light off a giant fire.

     There are broken lanterns and barrels around the agonized,
     twisted tree.  The tree is aflame, fire dancing up the trunk,
     and through every branch to lick the sky.


     EXT.  FOREST -- DAY

     Dawn.  Ichabod is seated overlooking the Hudson.  He stares
     at the beauty around him, brooding through bleary eyes.
     Gunpowder is tied to a tree.  BIRDS SING.

     The ledger is open in Ichabod's lap.  He thumbs pages
     absently, just keeps staring off.

     EXT.  FOREST -- DAY (TIME CUT)

     A fire burns in a circle of rocks.  Ichabod's ledger is
     thrown in.  The pages catch quickly.

     Ichabod watches, then walks away.  He's about to climb onto
     Gunpowder, but on second thought he opens his satchel and
     digs out a BOOK.  He walks back to the fire, throws it on...

     "Romeo and Juliet."  Flames devour it.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY

     The clearing is silent.  The twisted tree still stands,
     smoldering, impressive as ever, or perhaps even more so with
     the alien appearance its blackened skin now affords it.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod packs up baggage.  Young Masbath is miserable.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Won't you change your mind, sir?
               What can I say to convince you?

                             ICHABOD 
               Nothing.  To hell with this place
               and all the people here.

     Ichabod closes a bag, throws it with others.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Why... why are you like this?

                             ICHABOD
                     (pause, softening) 
               You do not know all that has happened.
                     (pause) 
               You cannot understand.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT

     A coach, with Gunpowder as one of its team, waits in the
     orchard.  Van Ripper comes to meet Ichabod and Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               Half now.  Half when we reach the
               city.

     Ichabod hands Van Ripper money.  Van Ripper takes the
     baggage.  Ichabod looks to the Manor House.  Only one light
     shines, in a second floor window.

     Katrina can be seen there a moment as she closes curtains.

     Ichabod turns to Young Masbath, who is beginning to cry.

                             ICHABOD 
               This is farewell.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Take me with you.  There's nothing
               left for me here.

                             ICHABOD 
               I cannot.
                     (bends to Masbath) 
               You should not worry.
                     (pause, sorrow) 
               Van Ripper and his wife will look
               after you.  They will.  You will be
               well cared for.

     Young Masbath hugs.  Ichabod hugs back, swallowing.

                             ICHABOD
               I am sorry.
                     (quietly) 
               Forgive me.  I failed you.

     Ichabod releases and goes quickly away, finding this misery
     unbearable.  He climbs in the coach.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Do not go, Constable.  How can you
               leave?

     INSIDE THE COACH, Ichabod slumps back in darkness and closes
     his eyes.  He pounds twice on the coach wall.

     OUTSIDE, Van Ripper whips the reins.  The coach starts.
     Young Masbath follows.  The coach picks up speed on the long
     straight road.

     Young Masbath stops, wiping tears.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Ichabod's coach moves through the town square.  A few people
     in the churchyard's tent city come out to watch it pass.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     The door is pushed open.  Young Masbath enters, looks around
     the empty room.  He goes to sit in a chair at the work table,
     crossing his arms and resting his head.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

     A plate of food sits untouched.  Katrina is slumped down in a
     chair, heartbroken, staring into the fireplace.

     Behind her, a shadow moves across the room.


     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT

     Van Ripper leads the coach through the stone pillars marking
     the entrance of Sleepy Hollow.

     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT

     Ichabod takes off his hat, sets it on the seat.  The window
     between him and the driver slides open.

                             VAN RIPPER 
               Sir... this is yours.
                     (offering something) 
               The Van Tassel girl said to give it
               to you after you were gone.

     Ichabod takes it.  It is the bird/cage spinning toy.  He
     studies it.  What melancholy.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Katrina sits with her eyes closed.  A BOARD is HEARD
     CREAKING.  She sits up. Suddenly, a FIGURE in black is behind
     her as she turns.  WHACK! -- a gloved fist strikes.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     A dull THUD is HEARD downstairs, like a body falling.  Young
     Masbath takes notice.  He moves to the door...


     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT

     Ichabod turns the strings on the bird/cage toy, ponders it.

     The paper disk spins, images flickering until the bird
     appears to be inside the cage.

     Ichabod keeps spinning it, looks out the window.

     A tear rolls down his cheek.

     The bird cage toy's rotation slows... stops.

     Ichabod looks at it a long moment, then pockets it and leans
     forward to the window at front.

     OUTSIDE THE COACH

     Ichabod's face appears behind Van Ripper.

                             ICHABOD
               Van Ripper, turn the coach about!

                             VAN RIPPER
               What did you say?

                             ICHABOD
               Turn around.  Now!


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER -- NIGHT

     Young	Masbath comes down the stairs, looking around meekly.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Hello?  Katrina?

     Masbath starts down a hall.  He does not see, in another
     room, Katrina's body is dragged across the floor.


     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

     The coach comes to Lancaster's.  Ichabod climbs out before it
     even stops fully, satchel in hand.  He hurries...

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT

     Doctor Lancaster, half asleep, comes to answer BANGING on his
     door.  Ichabod pushes past, taking Lancaster's lantern.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon the intrusion...

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod enters.  There are two coffins on the floor.

                             ICHABOD
               I never examined these bodies.

     Ichabod removes the lid from one coffin.  Lancaster is about
     to say something indignant, but then just looks disgusted.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               ... help yourself, you pompous ass.
               I will be in bed.

                             ICHABOD
               Would you stay, doctor?  I may need
               assistance.

     Lancaster reluctantly remains.  Ichabod stares at the dead
     Lady Van Tassel.  The neck wound is covered by a stained
     brown cloth, which Ichabod unwraps.

                             ICHABOD
               Stains of blood.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               What of it?

     Ichabod takes out one of the lenses that survived the
     magnification spectacles, bends to examine the neck.

                             ICHABOD
               Jagged flesh. 
                     (pause)
               The Horseman did not do this.

     Ichabod moves to the side of the coffin, lifting the hand
     with the stitched gash on its palm.

                             ICHABOD
               Here, Doctor.  Hold this just so...

     Lancaster holds the lens so that Ichabod can study the cut
     through it.  Ichabod takes a scalpel-like knife from his
     satchel, lifts the hand and cuts stitches.

     THROUGH THE LENS: the gash spreads easily, soft, bloodless.

                             ICHABOD 
               No clotting or gathering of pus.  No
               healing at all.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER 
               What?

                             ICHABOD 
               When this cut was made, this person
               was already dead.
                     (stands straight)
               This is not Lady Van Tassel.


     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath enters.  The door swings shut.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Katrina.
                     (steps forward) 
               Is anyone here?

     Behind him, the door SLAMS open -- Lady Van Tassel reaches to
     grab Young Masbath by the throat.


     EXT.  CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod charges up to the church doors, pounding.

                             ICHABOD
               Open the door.  Open up, damn it!
                     (pounds, shouting)
               Lady van Tassel is alive.  The Horseman
               is her puppet.  Please... 

     The door opens and Huge Farmer points a rifle at Ichabod.
     Frightened people peer out from behind.

                             HUGE FARMER 
               Aren't we rid of you?

                             ICHABOD 
               Listen to me.  Lady Van Tassel has
               faked her death.  I need able men...

                             HUGE FARMER
               She's dead, and you have gone mad.

                             ICHABOD
               No...

                             HUGE FARMER 
                     (steps forward) 
               Get out!  Isn't it enough that you have
               ruined this town?  Go!

     Ichabod backs away from the gun, frustrated, runs...

     At the DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, Van Ripper is still on the coach.
     Ichabod sprints over, breathless, taking out his pistol.

                             ICHABOD
               Van Ripper... do you have a gun?

                             VAN RIPPER
               Yes.  Here...

     Van Ripper hold up a rifle.  Ichabod holds out his hand.

                             ICHABOD 
               May I see it?

     Van Ripper's confused, but hands the rifle over.  Ichabod
     immediately points his pistol at Van Ripper.

                             ICHABOD
               Get down.  Hurry!

     Van Ripper climbs off.  Ichabod climbs up, whips the horses.

                             ICHABOD 
               Sorry.

     Van Ripper watches the coach leave, still with his hands up.


     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     In a wooded area, Katrina lies unconscious.  Gloved hands
     reach to her hair and cut off a clump with SCISSORS.

     A conjuring pile has been made, containing a small animal's
     heart with an iron nail through it.  Katrina's hair is added
     and the pile is lit to burn.

     Nearby, Young Masbath watches, on his belly with his hands
     tied behind his back.

     Lady Van Tassel whispers over the fire, her white horse tied
     nearby.  She looks to Katrina, who stirs.

     Lady Van Tassel takes the Horseman's skull from a bag over
     her shoulder, places the skull in the flames.  THUNDER is
     HEARD.  Lady Van Tassel looks up, smiles.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT

     The wind tosses leaves in swirls.  The twisted tree opens
     wide, with a RUMBLE -- shafts of light shooting out.

     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod drives the coach hard ahead.

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Katrina sits up, groggy.  Lady Van Tassel looks down at her.

                             KATRINA 
               You... you are alive.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath
               dead along with me?

     Katrina sees Young Masbath, and beyond him, the dying fire.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               She commands the Horseman.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               And, quite beautifully done, wouldn't
               you say?  It is almost over.

     THUNDER again.  Wind starts to pick up.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
                     (of the wind) 
               He rides tonight.

                             KATRINA 
               Father saw you die.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman
               looming over me as I fled.  Things I
               wanted him to see.  But, as long as
               I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm
               me.  Baltus did not stay enough to
               see that.  He ran as a coward,
               unfettered by my fate.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Then, whose body was it... ?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               The precious servant girl Sarah.  I
               killed her and kept her body hidden,
               till I needed it.  And, when I
               return to the Hollow tomorrow, my
               version of the truth will come to
               pass. 
                     (faking meekness) 
               I mean, there I was that fateful day,
               following Baltus into the woods.  I
               did not know what he was up to...
               where he was going.  I worried for
               his safety.

     Katrina cautiously moves the hand she's supporting herself
     with, feels a rock and clutches it.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Imagine my surprise, finding him on a
               liason with a common servant.  A girl
               who had apparently become his secret
               love.

                             KATRINA 
               No one will believe your lies, whore.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               This whore will see your mouth shut
               forever very soon.  But... I am not
               going to kill you.  Not me...

     She picks up the Horseman's skull in her gloved hand.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               He will have that honor.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- NIGHT

     The Horseman rides Daredevil, a freight train of moldering
     flesh, heading towards a chasm with no bridge.

     They reach it, galloping in mid-air to the other side.

     EXT.  LONG STRAIGHT ROAD/VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod guides the coach into the Van Tassel orchard.

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Lady Van Tassel admires the skull.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL  
                     (mock sorrow) 
               Woe is me... that spying on my husband
               in his filthy indiscretion, I saw he
               and Sarah attacked by the Horseman.
               Oh pity me... so overcome was I that
               I wandered in the Western Woods...
               dazed... nearly blind from terror.

     Lady Van Tassel crouches, rubbing dirt on her face.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               And, tomorrow is my grand performance,
               having barely survived the elements...
                     (more emoting) 
               By sheer luck I found my way back to
               the Hollow.  But... what do I find
               here... ?  My dear, sweet step-daughter
               Katrina is dead.  Why has God forsaken
               her?

     Seeing that Lady Van Tassel lavish attention on Katrina,
     Masbath takes this opportunity to ease onto his knees.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
                     (of herself, pleased) 
               No one will suspect this sad woman who
               has been through such an ordeal.  With
               only the empty solace of her money and
               land to comfort her.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod leaps from the coach, bounds up the porch.

                             ICHABOD
               Katrina!

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     ICHABOD is HEARD.  Lady Van Tassel turns, astonished.

                             KATRINA
               Murderer!

     Katrina slings the rock -- strikes Lady Van Tassel in the
     head, a glancing blow that knocks her down.  Katrina runs.

     Katrina grips Young Masbath, helping him up...

     But, Lady Van Tassel scrambles up, grabs Katrina and throws
     her back to the ground.

     Lady Van Tassel steps hard on Katrina's ankle, touches her
     forehead, bleeding, pissed.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               You've been a naughty girl.

     Young Masbath leaps to action, charging head first -- slams
     into Lady Van Tassel, sends her backwards.

     Katrina runs and pulls Masbath up.  They flee.

                             KATRINA 
               Ichabod!

     Lady Van Tassel rolls, recovering, not very concerned.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Little bitch.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod comes out the open front doors... hearing...

                             KATRINA (o.s.) 
                     (far away) 
               Ichabod!

     Ichabod climbs back on the coach, taking off.

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Katrina and Young Masbath run out from a line of trees.

                             KATRINA 
               Ichabod!

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Here we are!

     BEHIND IN THE FOREST, Lady Van Tassel rides her white horse,
     in no hurry.  Wind kicks hard.  HOOFBEATS are HEARD.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Run, Katrina!  Fast as your pretty
               legs will carry you.  It makes no
               difference.

     ON THE LAWN, Ichabod drives towards Katrina and Masbath.

     Behind, at the tree line, Lady Van Tassel holds up the
     Horseman's skull, wind tossing her dress and hair.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Nothing will stop him now!

     At mid-field, Ichabod reaches Katrina and Masbath.

                             ICHABOD
               Climb up!

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Lady Van Tassel...

                             ICHABOD
               I know.  Hold on.

     With Katrina and Masbath on board, Ichabod turns the coach.
     Katrina unties Masbath's hands.  HOOFBEATS GET LOUDER.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Olly-olly oxen-free!

     Ichabod looks back towards Lady Van Tassel.

     At the treeline, the Horseman breaks into the open, hell on
     horseback.  Full speed ahead.

                             ICHABOD
               Christ.


     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT

     The coach hits the long straight road, away from the house.

     Katrina and Masbath hold on as the coach shakes violently.

                             KATRINA
               Where are we going?

                             ICHABOD
               I do not know.  Away.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Here he comes!

     Behind, the Horseman can be seen on the forest bordered road.
     Closing fast.  Breakneck pace.

                             ICHABOD
               We might make it to the church.

     Masbath takes a lantern, crawls back to the roof.

                             KATRINA
               Masbath... !

     He ignores, reaching the rear of the coach and throwing the
     lantern at the Horseman.  It smashes on the trail.

                             ICHABOD
               Damn it, boy, get back here!

     Young Masbath slides back.  Katrina helps him.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               What can we do?

                             ICHABOD
               Take the reins.

     Young Masbath takes them.  Ichabod slings Van Ripper's rifle
     over his shoulder and starts back.  Katrina grips him.

                             ICHABOD
               Masbath is right.  We must do something.

     She releases.  Ichabod gets to the luggage area at the rear,
     struggling to open a storage box.

     Behind, the Horseman draws his sword, closer.

     Ichabod opens the box, hefting out a long, jagged SAW.

                             KATRINA
               Ichabod!

     Ichabod looks.  The Horseman rides up, swinging...

     Ichabod recoils -- THWACK -- just missed by sword.

     The Horseman lets the coach get ahead, shifting to the
     other side of the trail... coming along side.

     Ichabod backpedals, looking to Masbath.

                             ICHABOD
               Keep him off!  Block him!

     Masbath guides the horses over.  The Horseman must fall
     behind to avoid the wheels.

     The coach hits a large, fallen tree trunk.

     Ichabod bounces, falling...

     He hangs off the side of the coach.

     Katrina climbs to offer her hand.  Ichabod offers the saw.

                             ICHABOD
               Take it!

     Katrina takes the saw.  Now with both hands, Ichabod tries
     for better purchase.  He grips the coach door.  It opens...

     Ichabod clings to the open door as branches slam him.

     He's reaching to the coach threshold, reaching...

     Ichabod pulls himself inside.

     BOOM -- the door hits a tree trunk, bashed to pieces.

     Ichabod looks out from the coach, dazed.  He climbs.

     Katrina looks back as Young Masbath guides the coach to block
     the Horseman again.

     The Horseman sheaths his sword, riding... reaching to grip
     the back corner of the coach.

     The Horseman dismounts, clinging, climbing...

     Ichabod takes the rifle off his shoulder, aiming...

     BANG! -- splattering the Horseman's hand point blank.  The
     Horseman hangs on with his other hand.

     The Horseman re-grips with the blasted hand, amazing since
     it's now all mush and bone.

     Ichabod throws the rifle on his way to the driver's perch,
     taking the saw from Katrina.

                             ICHABOD 
               Move forward!

     Katrina looks to the horses, then at Ichabod.

                             ICHABOD
               Go!

     Ichabod takes the reins from Young Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               Help her.

     Reins in one hand and saw in the other, Ichabod waits.  The
     Horseman rises up and moves in, taking out his sword.

     Young Masbath climbs down to the wooden pole connecting the
     coach to the bridles, puts out his hand.  Katrina takes it.

     Behind, the Horseman swings.  Ichabod blocks with the saw.

     Young Masbath guides Katrina as she leaps onto one horse.
     Bareback.  Young Masbath straddles the horse beside her.

     The Horseman swings, backhanded knocks the sword from
     Ichabod's hand as Ichabod falls back...

     Ichabod hits the bridle post, hanging onto straps for dear
     life.  His feet drag on the trail.

     Above, the Horseman comes to the driver's perch, close enough
     to kill Katrina.  He raises his sword...

     Katrina screams, ducking, helpless...

     Below, Ichabod pulls a bolt from the coach's hitching-rod.

     He shoves off with his feet.

     The Horseman swings.... missing.

     The horses detach from the coach, dragging Ichabod along.

     The coach careens out of control.

     It flies off the trail, hits an incline and sails off,
     throwing the Horseman.

     The coach hits a tree trunk and SMASHES.

     FURTHER DOWN THE TRAIL, the coach horses stop.  Young Masbath
     and Katrina climb off as Ichabod gets to his feet, hurting,
     clutching his previously wounded shoulder.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               What now?

                             ICHABOD
               I doubt that's the end.

                             KATRINA
               The church.

                             ICHABOD
               He moves too fast.

     Ichabod unhooks a lantern off the bridle rail.  The trail
     behind is silent, till a bone chilling SCREECH is HEARD.

                             KATRINA
               What was that?

                             ICHABOD
               His horse.

     They start moving.  Ichabod looks around.  He sees...

                             ICHABOD
               There...

     Through the tree line, the Hollow's massive windmill can be
     seen against the sky.  Katrina and Young Masbath run.


     EXT. WINDMILL FIELD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath book into this open area,
     heading to the windmill.  Another HORRIBLE SQUEAL echoes.

     Ichabod looks over his shoulder.

     Heavy, low hanging BRANCHES and VINES at the forest edge
     creep to life, parting... forming a sort of black tunnel.

                             ICHABOD 
               He's coming!

     The Horseman gallops out, throwing leaves in his wake.

                             ICHABOD 
               Hurry!

     The Horseman readies a battle axe.

     Ichabod gets under the windmill, helping Young Masbath up the
     ladder and in.  Katrina next.

     The Horseman is almost there.

     Ichabod follows Katrina.  He gets in, feet dangling.  The
     Horseman dismounts...

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod leaps up and struggles with the heavy trap door...
     slams it.  He closes the latch just as the Horseman hits.
     The door buckles.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               It won't hold.

     Ichabod goes to a large GRINDSTONE against a wall.  He
     struggles to roll it.

     Young Masbath helps him roll it to the trap door.  It falls
     on top with a thud.  The Horseman's sword jabs up through the
     grindstone's center hole.

     The sword withdraws.  A POUNDING begins.

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The Horseman chops at the door with his axe.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     POUNDING CONTINUES.  The grindstone shifts.  Katrina and
     Young Masbath back away.  Ichabod holds his lantern up,
     desperate for ideas, searching.

     Above, to the right, is the milling platform, where grain is
     ground and bagged.  To the left is the crooked staircase.

     Ichabod picks up a bailing hook, a plan forming.  He gives
     his lantern to Katrina and points.

                             ICHABOD 
               Get up those stairs.  Open the door to
               the roof and wait.

     Katrina and Young Masbath obey.  Ichabod crosses and climbs
     the ladder to the milling platform.  He grasps a wooden
     lever, pulling it.  Gears above begin to turn.

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The windmill's rotors CREAK to life, spinning.

     UNDER THE WINDMILL, the Horseman keeps chopping.  His axe
     exposes grindstone, throwing sparks.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Katrina looks down from the stairs.

     The Horseman's axe pries at the seam of the trap door.

                             KATRINA
               Ichabod...

                             ICHABOD
               Keep climbing.  I will follow...

     Ichabod pulls bags of grain, lining them up at the edge of
     the milling platform.

                             ICHABOD
                     (under his breath) 
               Hopefully.

     ABOVE, Young Masbath reaches the ceiling, throws open the
     door to the roof.

     BELOW, Ichabod cuts holes into the grain bags, so milled
     grain spills out and falls to the floor, creating dust.

     He grabs one open bag and dumps it.  More grain dust.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

     Masbath and Katrina come out.  Rotors spin behind them.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod sees below... the Horseman sticks a hand through,
     trying to push the grindstone aside, then withdrawing.  The
     RACKING axe continues.  Won't be long.

     Ichabod grabs one half-full bag of grain, swings it with
     effort, throws...

     The bag smashes on the grindstone, busting the door...

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The grindstone falls through, SLAMMING the Horseman down...

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod slices into a sack hanging from a pulley system.
     More and more dust rises.

     Below, the Horseman enters.  Katrina shouts from above.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Look out!

     The Horseman moves toward the ladder milling platform ladder,
     but Ichabod grabs it, pulling it up...

     The Horseman just misses the final rung.

     Ichabod throws the ladder aside as the Horseman backs off.

     Ichabod looks to the staircase.  No way to climb down from
     the milling platform and get there.

     The Horseman runs and leaps, grabbing a hanging chain...

     The Horseman climbs the chain, swinging...

     Ichabod runs across the platform, jumps...

     Ichabod grasps the frail rail of the staircase, barely.

     The rail creaks, about to break.  Behind, the Horseman lands
     on the milling platform.

     Ichabod is losing grip.  Young Masbath races down the stairs,
     grabs his hand.  He pulls Ichabod up.

     Ichabod's pistol slips from its holster and falls.

     Ichabod and Young Masbath look...

     The Horseman, following Ichabod's lead, runs across the
     milling platform and leaps...

     Grabs the staircase rail, only a few feet from Ichabod and
     Masbath.  Ichabod kicks the rail, breaking it...

     The Horseman falls in billowing dust, crashing below.

     Ichabod pushes Masbath up the stairs.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

     Katrina helps them onto the roof.

                             KATRINA
               Quickly, close it.

                             ICHABOD 
               No.
                     (takes lantern, points) 
               Get to the crest of the roof and be
               ready to jump.

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Jump?  Jump where?

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The Horseman runs, agile, up stairs.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

     Ichabod shepherds Katrina and Young Masbath to the edge where
     the rotors spin close.

                             ICHABOD 
               The blades will carry us to the ground.
               Face front and wait for me.

                             KATRINA 
               I... I can't do this.

                             ICHABOD 
               We have no choice.

     Ichabod moves back to the trap door.

     Katrina and Young Masbath look at the rotors, and down at the
     long distance between them and the ground.

                             ICHABOD 
               Be ready...

     Ichabod throws the lantern into the windmill and runs.

                             ICHABOD
               Now!

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The Horseman continues up.  The lantern falls past.

     EXT.  WINDMILL, ROOF -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath jumps.  Ichabod grips Katrina and jumps...

     They hit one rotor and cling to the frame and cloth.  The
     rotor begins its downwards swing.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The lantern hits the ground and shatters.  FLAMES EXPLODE!

     Grain dust is consumed instantaneously -- FLAMES ROAR
     upwards, filling the windmill...

     Engulfing the Horseman.

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The rotor is halfway to its lowest point.  Masbath, Katrina
     and Ichabod hang on as the entire structure trembles.

     BOOM -- flames shoot out the windows, doors and seams,
     lighting up the night.

     On the rattling rotor, Ichabod struggles to hold the frame
     with one hand and keep a grip on Katrina.

     Masbath drops.  Ichabod releases Katrina, then drops.

     They hit the ground.  Ichabod rolls, gasping, holding his
     shoulder.  They all look at each other in disbelief a moment.
     Ichabod lets out a sort of rasping laugh, standing.

                             ICHABOD 
               Okay... come on...

     Ichabod ushers them across the field, uphill.  Running.
     Lightning flashes across the sky.  THUNDER RUMBLES.

     A bolt strikes the windmill, and it EXPLODES...

     SHOCKWAVE DEAFENING.  The rotors bust apart.  Splinters of
     burning wood spin all directions.

     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath keep
     running.  There is a WOODEN CART parked ahead.

     IN THE WINDMILL RUBBLE, the Horseman rises, shoving off
     burning debris.  His flame-ravaged uniform smolders.

     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod stumbles onwards, but notices
     something horrible...

     In the distance, Lady Van Tassel's white horse roams free.

                             ICHABOD
                     (as this registers)
               Oh, no...

     Young Masbath and Katrina are just past the cart when Lady
     Van Tassel rises from behind it, swings a plank...

     SLAMS Ichabod in the chest and sends him down.

     Lady Van Tassel grabs Katrina's hair, drags her.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Should have stayed away, Constable.

     Ichabod gets up slow, furious, reaches to his holster, only
     to find it empty.  He moves forward.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Keep back, or I kill her.

     She takes out scissors, holds them to Katrina's neck.
     Katrina ceases struggling.

     Ichabod keeps Masbath behind him, keeps his distance.  Lady
     Van Tassel shoots a glance...

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               See him...

     Par off, the Horseman strides from the wreckage.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               You cannot kill what is already dead.

                             ICHABOD
               Let her go!

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Yes... yes.  I think I will...

     Lady Van Tassel spins and throws Katrina in the cart, shoving
     against it.

                             ICHABOD
               No!

     The cart rolls downhill.  Ichabod moves forward.

     Lady Van Tassel turns, brandishing the scissors, slashing and
     missing.  Ichabod backs off.

     DOWNHILL, the cart picks up speed, headed for the Horseman.

     The Horseman starts running to meet it.

     UPHILL, Lady Van Tassel grins.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL 
               Say goodbye to her.

     Lady Van Tassel lunges, stabbing.  Ichabod avoids, puts all
     his fury behind his fist -- punches her in the face.

     Lady Van Tassel hits the ground and her bag falls open,
     sending the Horseman's skull rolling out...

     The skull rolls... rolls... landing far away.

     DOWNHILL, Katrina leaps out from the cart...

     She lands hard...

     The Horseman shoves the empty cart aside, still on the move.

     UPHILL, Ichabod sees the skull.  He runs towards it.

     Lady van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the ankle.  He falls.

     DOWNHILL, Katrina runs back.  The Horseman is catching up.

     UPHILL, Ichabod tries to pull f ree from Lady Van Tassel.

     Young Masbath comes behind her - BAM - hits her in the head
     with the wooden plank.  She's out.

     Ichabod scrambles to his feet.

     DOWNHILL, the Horseman catches Katrina, taking her by the
     hair as she falls to her knees and screams.

     UPHILL, Ichabod runs... grasps the Horseman's skull.

     He runs towards the Horseman and Katrina.

     DOWNHILL, Katrina struggles, but the Horseman holds her ready
     by her hair... raises his sword...

     UPHILL, Ichabod throws the skull...

                             ICHABOD 
               Horseman!

     The skull spins through the air...

     The Horseman drops Katrina, reaches up...

     Catches the skull.

     Katrina runs.

     Ichabod runs to meet her, grabs her as she falls, exhausted.
     Together, they back away from the Horseman.

     The Horseman holds the skull out, then brings it to his
     shoulders, to its rightful place.  THUNDER POUNDS.

     TRANSFORMATION begins -- blood and flesh rise up from the
     Horseman's throat and grip the skull.

     Young Masbath drops the plank, watching in awe.

     The Horseman's reformation continues.  Muscle forms.  Liquids
     become solids.  He is made whole once more, the same evil,
     human face we saw in Baltus' stories.

     He looks to Ichabod and Katrina, touches his restored face.

     Daredevil rides up, SCREECHING.  The Horseman replaces his
     sward and climbs into the saddle.

     He rides towards Katrina and Ichabod, but passes them by.
     They are so exhausted they fall down.

     Young Masbath backs up as the Horseman comes, but the
     Horseman does not want him either.

     The Horseman leans to grab Lady Van Tassel's unconscious
     form, pulls her up across Daredevil's back.

     He rides away with her.

     Ichabod and Katrina watch him go.  They look at each other,
     then kiss gratefully.

     Ichabod looks to Young Masbath.

                             ICHABOD 
               How are you?

                             YOUNG MASBATH 
               Tired.

     Ichabod smiles and holds out his arm.  Masbath comes over.
     Group hug.  Lightning brightens the farmland around them.


     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, BURIAL GROUND -- NIGHT

     HOOFBEATS.  The Horseman enters the clearing, keeping a hand
     on Lady Van Tassel.  Ahead, the twisted tree awaits.

     Lady Van Tassel is awakening, face bloody.  She turns her
     head and looks forward.  She screams.

     The twisted tree's wound opens, wide and glowing.

     Daredevil picks up speed...

     Daredevil leaps just as a lightning bolt blasts down,
     striking the Horseman.

     For an instant, Horseman and horse are transformed, SKELETONS
     OF LIGHT, entering the tree.

     Silence and smoke.  At the tree, Lady Van Tassel's hand
     sticks out from the tight-shut suture.

     The sewn wound on her palm seeps blood.


     EXT.  NEW YORK CITY STREET, ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY

     A bright, busy day in New York.  A coach pulls up to
     Ichabod's home.  Ichabod is the driver.  He gets off, goes
     and opens the coach door.  He helps Katrina down.  Next,
     Young Masbath sticks his head out.

     Ichabod goes about unloading bags.  Katrina holds Young
     Masbath's hand, and they look down the street in wonder.

          Darkness.
          A SOUND slowly builds: the rhythmic rocking of a TRAIN'S
          WHEELS over RAILROAD TRACKS...

          INT. HIGH SPEED TRAIN - MORNING

          COLTER jolts awake. Sunlight hits his face.
          He blinks. A stunned beat. He's disoriented.
          Slowly he turns his head to one side...
          PASSENGERS. Filling most of the seats. Office workers on
          their morning commute into a city.
          Turning the other way, he's confronted with a window. Trees
          flash by, splitting the rising sunlight into a hypnotic
          strobe pattern.
          Colter looks to be thirty years old. A military buzz cut. A
          disciplined physique, lean and spare, almost gaunt. Skin
          burnished by years of desert sandstorms and equatorial sun.
          His expression, prematurely aged by combat, is perpetually
          wary, sometimes predatory, accustomed to trouble.
          Despite his military bearing, Colter wears a button down
          shirt and navy sports coat. On his wrist is a digital watch.
          It reads 7:40 a.m.
          He swallows. A strange, creeping panic.
          He has no idea where he is.

          EXT. NEW JERSEY COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING

          The train hurls straight at us.
          NEW ANGLE -- Skimming alongside as the train twists and
          turns, sucking up track -- feet, yards, miles of it.
          Beneath it, the curving rails, which the rushing train barely
          seems to touch. They vibrate with an eerie, dulcimer HUM.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Colter hasn't moved. By his side he sees a canvas MESSENGER
          BAG. Is that his?
          Tentatively, he lifts the edge of the bag to look inside. A
          red APPLE rolls against two LIBRARY BOOKS. The bag's leather
          NAME TAG reads: "SEAN FENTRESS."
          It's not coming back to him. This whole experience is
          starting to freak him out.
          He catches the scent of something. A passenger walks by with
          a STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE.
          CHK-THOCK! Two rows back, an OVERWEIGHT MAN opens a can of
          soda.
          Sitting opposite Colter, facing him, is a WOMAN in her late
          twenties (CHRISTINA). In contrast to the corporate suits
          around her, her appearance is thrift store funky: black nail
          polish, dark lipstick, black hair with blue streaks, a button-
          down blouse edged in black funeral lace with silver skull-and-
          bones cufflinks. She's busy writing in a journal.

                         COLTER
          Ma'am?
          Nothing.

                         COLTER
          Excuse me... ma'am?
          She looks up. Blank stare.

                         COLTER
          What is this?

                         CHRISTINA
          What's what?

                         COLTER
          Where am I?

                         CHRISTINA
          (looks out the window)
          Almost at Newark.
          Goes back to her journal.

                         COLTER
          What's Newark? A city?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         CHRISTINA
          It's more of a hell hole.
          But Colter still doesn't understand. He gets up. Nausea
          slams into him. He hangs on to the seat.

                         COLTER
          Woah.

                         (BEAT)
          I think I'm going to puke.

                         CHRISTINA
          (gestures, alarmed)
          Okay, bathroom's that way.
          Colter looks down the aisle, hesitating.

                         CHRISTINA
          Go. Seriously.
          Colter eases himself into the aisle. Totters down the length
          of the car until he finds the RESTROOM.
          The door is LOCKED. The latch reads "OCCUPIED."
          Bracing himself, he lurches forward into...

          INT. TRAIN - SECOND CAR - MORNING

          He freezes. It's a mirror image of the first car. But no,
          the passengers are different.
          Beside him there's a small door. Thinking it's the bathroom,
          he instead opens it to find a CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT. A
          cramped office with chairs and surveillance monitors.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Ticket?
          A heavy-set CONDUCTOR stands in the aisle. A jangling of
          keys. Colter just stares at him. Dazed.

                         CONDUCTOR
          May I see your ticket?
          The last thing on his mind. Bewildered, he searches his
          pockets.

                         COLTER
          I don't think I...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Have to write you up then.
          He pulls out a citation pad.

                         COLTER
          Is this...?
          From inside his sports coat he pulls out a TRAIN TICKET. The
          conductor snips his ticket and brushes past.

                         COLTER
          Wait a sec. I'm a little out of it
          here. Where's this train headed?

                         CONDUCTOR
          New York. Penn Station.

                         COLTER
          New York?
          Why would he be going to New York? How can this be
          happening? Fear starts to grip him as the hallucination
          simply continues.

                         COLTER
          Do you know where I got on?
          The conductor examines his ticket again.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Princeton Junction.

                         COLTER
          Where's that?

                         CONDUCTOR
          "Bout ten minutes back.

                         COLTER
          But I've never been to Princeton
          Junction. See... I don't remember
          waking up or buying a ticket or
          getting on the train or anything
          else. It's just a blank.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Lucky you.
          The jaded conductor moves on. Colter is alone with his
          confusion. Takes a deep breath. The nausea has eased
          slightly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         COLTER
          Okay. You're gonna figure this
          out.

          INT. TRAIN - FIRST CAR - MORNING

          Entering the first car again. The rows of passengers. Must
          be at least forty people.
          As he walks back up the aisle, he looks from face to face:
          A pale COMPUTER ENGINEER reviews some documents.
          A forty-something SECRETARY does a crossword puzzle.
          DEREK, a stock broker type, talks on his cell phone:

                         DEREK
          Trust me, by one o'clock, the
          bridge is going to be jammed...
          A COLLEGE STUDENT, slumped against a window, eyes shut,
          listens to an MP-3 player.
          An OLD MAN with a faded wool suit clutches a cane.
          A BACKPACKER, female, European, 20s, hiking boots, examines a
          guidebook.
          A dowdy OFFICER MANAGER type sorts supermarket coupons into a
          tabbed file box.
          An African American EXECUTIVE reads a newspaper.
          None of them pays any attention to Colter.
          A WHOOSH of AIR -- he turns to
          An AIR-CONDITIONING VENT. The HISS of AIR sound sinister.
          Like the exhalations of a creature.
          A SCRAPE. He looks to see
          A woman FILING HER NAILS.
          Colter cringes. Every detail, every sensory impression seems
          heightened, near the point of overload.
          He reaches Christina again. Eases back in the seat across
          from her. She writes in her journal, ignoring him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
          There's something else in his sports coat. A WALLET. He
          turns it over a few times, inspecting it. Pulls out a
          DRIVER'S LICENSE. Another man's face is in the photo. The
          name on the license reads: "SEAN FENTRESS." The same name as
          on the messenger bag. The street address on the license
          reads: "58 Alexander Road, Princeton Junction, New Jersey."

                         COLTER
          Sean Fentress? Who the hell's
          that?
          And why does he have this guy's wallet? He leans forward to
          speak with Christina again.

                         COLTER
          Ma'am?
          She lowers her journal, annoyed. We see she hasn't been
          writing but DRAWING. A well-executed sketch of a face.

                         CHRISTINA
          Why do you keep calling me ma'am?
          How old do you think I am, anyway?

                         COLTER
          I'm having a little problem here.
          I'm trying not to freak out, but I
          think something's happened to me.

                         CHRISTINA
          Like what?

                         COLTER
          Like, total memory loss. Complete.
          I don't know how I got here.

                         CHRISTINA
          So you drank too much last night.
          So did I. Unfortunately, I
          remember the whole thing.

                         COLTER
          That's not it. See... I'm a pilot.
          I fly helicopters in Iraq. I'm in
          the army.
          She waits for more. As if he's telling a joke.

                         COLTER
          I was on a mission. Right before I
          woke up here I was in the middle of
          a mission...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          Wavering. Unsure of himself. His memories.

                         CHRISTINA
          Boy, you really did drink a lot
          last night.

                         COLTER
          I'm telling you the truth.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Now approaching Newark Station.
          Newark Station, next stop.
          The train begins to SLOW DOWN. A few people begin to get up.
          The platform of Newark Station slides into view.

                         COLTER
          These aren't my clothes. And this
          wallet here...
          He holds up the driver's license. One final attempt to
          convince her.

                         COLTER
          You see this? This isn't me.

                         CHRISTINA
          Of course it is.

                         COLTER
          What?

                         CHRISTINA
          Take a look in the mirror, good
          sir.
          The mirror? She goes back to her sketchbook. Determined not
          to be interrupted again. Anxiety ripples through Colter.

                         COLTER
          This can't be happening.
          The train lurches to a stop.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Newark Station.
          Colter gets up. Through the windows, a few passengers
          disembark onto the platform: Derek, the Old Man, the College
          Kid and GUZMAN, a Middle Eastern man, who HURRIES past all of
          them towards the station building.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.
          Colter only half notices all this. He's intent on reaching
          the train's BATHROOM, the door of which is now OPEN.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          All aboard. Doors are closing.
          Christina watches Colter go. Curious.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          This is a New York bound train.
          Next stop, New York - Penn Station.
          The train begins MOVING. Colter reaches the bathroom.

          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING

          A fluorescent light flutters on as Colter shuts the door.
          He's in a tiny space with prefab restroom fixtures in
          stainless steel.
          He SHOUTS in surprise. Recoils backwards. Eyes locked on

                         THE MIRROR
          Staring back is SEAN FENTRESS'S FACE. Not his own.
          He's frozen there. Heart pounding. Seized by cosmic panic.
          He SLAPS himself in the face. Hard.

                         COLTER
          Wake up!
          The restroom rattles and tilts with the motions of the train,
          obliging him to hang on.
          This isn't a dream. At least not one he can wake up from.
          The other guy's face stares back at him. Blinks when he
          blinks.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Warehouses go by in a blur. The train is entering New
          Jersey's industrial zones on the outskirts of New York City.
          From her seat, Christina stares at the messenger bag which
          Colter left behind. Then up at the closed restroom door.

                         CUT TO:

                         BATHROOM DOOR

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.
          Her hand knocks.

                         CHRISTINA
          Hey. You okay in there?

          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Colter sits on the closed toilet seat. Head buried in his
          hands. Scared. Desperate for it all to end.

          INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

          Christina's holding Colter's messenger bag. She talks
          through the closed door.

                         CHRISTINA
          You left your bag on the seat.
          Which is a flagrant violation of
          rail security, leaving a suspicious
          package behind and all that. I
          probably saved you a huge fine.
          No answer.

                         CHRISTINA
          I'll just leave it right out here
          for you.
          She places the bag beside the door. She hesitates at the
          door. The oddness of this situation.

          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Colter stares into the mirror at the stranger's face.
          Practically catatonic at this point. And then her voice --

          CHRISTINA (O.S.)
          If it'll help you remember, you've
          been riding this train every
          morning for three months.
          Her words rouse him.

                         COLTER

                         (WHISPERS)
          Three months?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

          INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

          Christina's walking back down the aisle.
          The car rocks to one side as an EXPRESS TRAIN flashes by on
          the opposite tracks, going the other way. A blur and a
          whoosh, and it's gone.

          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING

          On the verge of opening the door, Colter hears a METALLIC
          RATTLING. Two SCREWS are rattling around in the sink.
          Colter picks up a screw. Turns it over and over in his hand.
          What are they doing in the sink?
          He looks UP.
          An overhead VENTILATION PANEL has been PRIED OPEN. Above it
          is the darkness of a CRAWL SPACE.
          Something is sitting up there.
          From outside comes a TRAIN HORN.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Through the windows, a FREIGHT TRAIN is passing the other
          way. A moving wall of metal boxcars and liquid tankers.

          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING

          Colter looks up into the crawl space. Can't quite see the
          object up there.
          Moving carefully in the tiny space, he stands up on the
          toilet. Grabbing onto the ventilation panel, he WRENCHES IT
          all the way open. Then PULLS himself uncomfortably upward.
          On tip-toes, he looks into crawl space and discovers

          A MASSIVE BOMB
          It's an enormous device. Several large CANNISTERS tied
          together, full of sloshing liquid. Barely discernible behind
          wires and gaffing tape is CELL PHONE -- the bomb's detonator.

                         COLTER
          Jesus.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          Running footsteps from outside. Commotion. An ALARM sounds.

          THE BOMB'S CELL PHONE RINGS -- THE DEVICE'S CIRCUIT CLOSES --

          THE BOMB EXPLODES IN COLTER'S FACE WITH A HUGE AND DEAFENING

          FORCE, INSTANTLY KILLING HIM.

          INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS


          THE FIREBALL RIPS THROUGH THE CAR -- KILLING CHRISTINA AND

          ALL THE OTHERS.

          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - MORNING

          Fuel lines explode in the other cars in a horrendous chain
          reaction. The fire is spectacularly bright, lighting up the
          windows of the rowhouse apartments facing the tracks.
          Nearby TREES INCINERATE, mere matchsticks amid sheets of
          flames.
          On the rowhouses, a ALUMINUM DOOR MOLDINGS begin to MELT in
          the intense heat.
          One of the FREIGHT CARS, loaded down with coal, shuddering
          from the blast, wobbles a few yards then PITCHES OVER --
          ROLLING off the rails, tipping right off the elevated
          tracks...
          It FALLS through the air and SMASHES into the middle of an
          traffic intersection below with a shattering force.
          The cascade of EXPLOSIONS continues. Large portions of BOTH
          TRAINS are ANNIHILATED, while the heat reduces the heavy-
          gauge steel rails back to elemental, molten ore.
          And then...
          An odd sound, like a BALLOON loosing air or MACHINERY winding
          down as we

                         DISSOLVE TO:
          BRILLIANT WHITE. All sounds cease.
          For exactly 1/3 OF A SECOND, a mysterious PATTERN OF LINES
          appears. Like METAL RODS, maybe. RADIATING OUTWARDS. It
          makes no sense. An abstract pattern.
          Then it's gone. Many will not even see it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          Now there is only darkness. Nothingness. Seconds pass.
          The CLICK of an INTERCOM switching on.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          This is Beleaguered Castle.

          INT. ISOLATION UNIT

          We're VERY CLOSE on Colter's UPSIDE DOWN face. His eyes
          flutter open. He's surprised to find himself alive.
          Consternation flashes through him as he discovers that he's
          tightly strapped in. He now wears a military flight suit.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Captain Colter Stevens, this is
          Beleaguered Castle. Acknowledge
          transmission.
          The measured calm of a mission controller's voice comes over
          Colter's headset.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Captain Stevens, do you copy?

                         COLTER
          Where am I?

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          You're with Beleaguered Castle.
          PULL BACK, fractionally, to reveal Colter in a tight and
          confined CAPSULE. It bristles with sophisticated electronics
          and ghostly glowing diodes. He's like an astronaut in an
          orbiter craft.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Are you functional?
          He tries to clear his head. He's still upside down.

                         COLTER
          I'm dizzy.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Adjusting your rotation.
          Very slowly, almost imperceptibly, Colter's upside-down face
          begins to turn and right itself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Can you report at this time?

                         COLTER
          What is this? Who am I talking to?
          More confusion. No idea how to react. Just as on the train.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Report what you saw.

                         COLTER
          When?

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Just now.

                         COLTER
          I was on a train.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          And?

                         COLTER
          And... There was a bomb.

                         (PANICKING)
          What the hell is going on?!

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Just relax, Captain.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. ISOLATION UNIT

          Later. We're still in the tiny chamber. It's stabilized.
          As has Colter, but in the manner of a dangerous wild animal
          given a sedative.
          Embedded into the controls is a two inch-square VIDEO
          MONITOR. It shows the face of GOODWIN. He's a middle-aged
          communications officer. Although we know him as Goodwin, his
          military name badge and rank insignia have been covered up.
          He wears a headset and sits surrounded by banks of electronic
          equipment and keyboards. He peers in at Colter, exuding the
          blandness of a military flight controller.

                         GOODWIN
          Standby for thread one of alpha

                         COLTER
          Who are you?

                         GOODWIN
          You already have that information,
          Captain. Now think. Recall my
          name.
          A long moment. A name floats into his head.

                         COLTER
          Goodwin?

                         GOODWIN
          Correct.

                         COLTER
          How do I know that? I have no idea
          how I know your name's Goodwin.

                         GOODWIN
          Commencing memory pattern.

                         COLTER
          Listen to me. Something's wrong.
          I was flying a mission. I was in a
          chopper. Then I woke up on a
          train. Now I'm here. Can you
          explain that? What unit is this?

                         GOODWIN
          You're with Beleaguered Castle.

                         COLTER
          Who?

                         GOODWIN
          You're with friends.

                         (PATIENTLY)
          The exercises will assist you. Are
          you ready?
          Just like with the train, he seems to have no choice but to
          go along with it.

                         GOODWIN
          Memory Thread One. Listen to the
          following passage: "When Lily woke,

          sat up, bewildered by the
          strangeness of her surroundings;
          then memory returned, and she
          looked about her with a shiver.

          In the cold slant of light
          reflected from the back wall of a
          neighboring building, she saw her
          evening dress and opera cloak lying
          on a tawdry heap on a chair." End
          of thread one.
          Silence. Is it Colter's turn to speak?

                         COLTER
          I don't get it. Is this a Red Flag

          Thread Two. Listen. I am holding
          the following hand of cards: Queen
          of spades. Four of clubs. Nine of
          clubs. Three of hearts. Nine of
          hearts.

                         (BEAT)
          I repeat: Queen of spades. Four of
          clubs. Nine of clubs. Three of
          hearts. Nine of hearts. End of
          thread two.
          Beads of sweat on Colter's forehead. What the hell?

                         GOODWIN
          Thread Three. The following is a
          recording of a Western Screech-Owl:
          A rather spooky BIRD CALL plays -- a short whistle, followed
          by a long trill. The call is repeated twice more.

                         GOODWIN
          End of Thread Three. End of
          pattern. Acknowledge.
          Unexpectedly, in the back of his mind, a reply is there.

                         COLTER
          A... Acknowledge. End of pattern.
          How did he know to say that? A conditioned response?

                         GOODWIN
          Stand by to initiate pattern
          recall.

                         COLTER
          Go for pattern recall.
          The response comes to him more quickly. Like lines from an
          old script. Even if it still baffles him.

          He thinks for a moment. Focus. Play along. Maybe it will
          all be okay.

                         COLTER
          Queen, two nines, four and a three.

                         GOODWIN
          That is correct. The passage I
          read contained mention of a woman's
          name. What was that name?

                         COLTER
          Laurie.

                         (THEN)
          No. Lily. Her name was Lily.
          At each answer, Goodwin makes notations and adjusts gauges.

                         GOODWIN
          That is correct. End of pattern.
          Goodwin leans forward to flip a switch and EVERYTHING GOES

          DARK.

          Over DARKNESS, the SOUND of BACKGROUND CONVERSATION.
          Engineers speaking in technical jargon.
          Click. The unit's VIDEO MONITOR comes on again, illuminating
          Colter in its glow. He's still strapped into the capsule.
          The tiny monitor shows an out of focus view of a LAB. Like a
          movie camera inadvertently left on between takes.
          ENGINEERS wander past, oblivious. Their disjointed
          conversations continue at low volume.
          Abruptly, a MAN SMOKING A PIPE sits down in front of the
          camera. His graying hair is windblown and unkempt. His eyes
          are piercing blue. He wears a track and field warm-up
          jacket. He looks in at us with an unsettling Cheshire-cat
          grin. He puffs on his pipe. Winks. Pressing a button he --
          Click -- shuts the whole thing off again. Sound and picture
          vanish. Leaving us suspended.

          Colter mulls his options. Should he talk? Keep silent? He
          tugs against the steel harness holding him in. A HATCH, like
          the kind used on submarines, seals the capsule.
          Goodwin's voice grows slightly louder over his headset.

          The HUM of machinery starting up.

          COLTER (V.O.)
          Goddamn it, Goodwin, what is all

          The machinery HUM changes modulation. Then gives way to a
          GENTLE ROCKING SENSATION. Tha-thunk. Tha-thunk. Tha-thunk.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Colter opens his eyes...
          SUNLIGHT hits his face. In flickering patterns. He turns to

                         LOOK OUT

          A TRAIN WINDOW
          At the passing woodland scenery.
          He's back on the train. Back in the same navy sports coat.
          Across from him, Christina is at work on her sketch pad.
          Just like before. Other commuters all around him.
          Everything is exactly the same as before.
          Note: The remaining story will follow this "binary pattern."
          Scenes will take place either on the train or in the capsule.
          Compared to tomb-like isolation chamber he just came from,
          the train is exploding with sensory input -- the smell of
          steaming coffee, the cramped proximity of other passengers,
          the crinkle of an freshly-ironed dress shirt, the glint of a
          buckle on a purse, the slanting sunlight, the trees out the
          window, bursting with summer leaves.
          Almost unintentionally, Colter finds himself repeating the
          same opening actions as last time -- checking his watch (7:40
          a.m.)... turning at the scent of passing coffee... peeking in
          the canvas messenger bag beside him...
          This time, however, he takes the books out of the messenger
          bag. The books are stamped "NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY."
          He also takes out the APPLE. Sniffs it. Takes a bit. It's
          good. No, it's awesome. Crisp and delicious.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          Is Goodwin watching him from somewhere?
          Not knowing what else to do, he takes a few more bites.
          Enjoying this small pleasure.
          He reaches in his sports jacket pocket and pulls out his

          TRAIN TICKET.
          CLOSE ON -- THE TICKET. It hasn't been punched yet.
          CHK-THOCK! The Overweight Man opens his can of soda. Just
          as before.

                         COLTER
          It's a goddamn simulation.
          Christina's pen stops sketching. She glances up.

                         COLTER
          A three dimensional, completely
          immersive scenario. Touch, taste,
          sound, sight and smell.
          A measure of relief. A way to think about all this.

                         CHRISTINA
          Are you talking to me?

                         COLTER
          Complete with pretty girl.

                         CHRISTINA
          Pretty girl.

                         COLTER
          Every combat simulator has one. In
          the middle of a fire fight a pop-up
          window starts playing a porno.

                         (CONFIDENT NOW)
          You're an unusual choice for a
          distraction.

                         CHRISTINA
          And you're a moron.
          Disregarding her, Colter gets up. Pursuing a new line of
          action. The only way he can make sense of this. He starts
          walking up the rows.

                         COLTER
          Find the bomber. Find the bomber.
          The conductor approaches him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Ticket?
          Expecting this now, Colter hands over his ticket to be
          punched.

                         COLTER
          Everything okay today, chief?

                         CONDUCTOR
          Say what?

                         COLTER
          Anything out of the ordinary?
          The conductor frowns at him. Who is this guy?

                         CONDUCTOR
          Please take a seat, sir.
          Colter moves on. He looks for suspects. We've seen the
          faces before -- the Computer Engineer, the Secretary, the
          Stock Broker, the Backpacker and so on.
          All seems normal. He finds himself focusing on a jumble of
          unfiltered details -- Suits. Ties. Shoes. Skirts.
          Watches. Newspapers. Coffee cups. Litter.
          Sudden dizziness. He grabs a seatback for support. Sensory
          details slam into him. We go EXTREMELY CLOSE ON:
          The STITCHING on a leather purse.
          A FOUNTAIN PEN rattling in a fold-out tray.
          AIR CONDITIONING hissing from a vent.
          A CRUMPLING SOUND as the Overweight Man crushes an empty soda
          can.
          TAP, TAP, TAP -- the Computer Engineer tapping his foot on
          the floor. Faster and faster.
          Derek, the Wall Street Type, talks on his phone:

                         DEREK
          Trust me, by one o'clock, the
          bridge is going to be jammed...
          Then... the CLICK of a LOCK UNLATCHING.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.
          The restroom door swings open. GUZMAN, the Middle Eastern
          man, emerges. After a furtive glance around, he quickly
          takes a seat.
          Now Colter makes the connection. The bomb in the restroom.
          The Middle Eastern man emerging from the same restroom.
          Colter starts down the long aisle.
          In his seat, Guzman slips on dark glasses. He looks
          forbidding with his mustache and olive-colored skin.

                         COLTER
          How's it going?
          Colter stands in front of him, arms crossed. Behind his dark
          glasses, Guzman ignores him, but he's visibly uncomfortable.

                         COLTER
          What's your name?
          Guzman is stock still. Beads of sweat on his forehead. The
          conductor appears, accosting Colter.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Didn't I tell you to take a seat?

                         COLTER
          Goodwin? Where are you? It's
          over. I found him.
          Appealing to Goodwin's invisible presence. But nothing
          happens.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Who are you talking to?
          An edgy silence. Other passengers looking over. Colter's
          about to retort, about to accuse Guzman, when he stops.
          It's too easy.
          Colter senses the uproar he's about to create. Which just
          might be a mistake. He reconsiders.

                         COLTER
          Sorry. This guy seemed a little...
          anxious. I was worried about him.

                         GUZMAN

                         (THICK ACCENT)
          I am minding my business. Tell him
          to mind his.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.
          The conductor has noticed Guzman's white-knuckle uneasiness.

                         CONDUCTOR
          You feeling all right, sir?
          With a pained smile, Guzman loosens his collar.

                         GUZMAN
          Motion sickness, I'm afraid. I
          believe I will get off at the next
          stop.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Very well.
          The conductor turns back to Colter.

                         COLTER
          Okay. I'm sitting down.
          Turning away, he finds a seat. He studies Guzman out of the
          corner of his eye.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Now approaching Newark Station.
          Newark Station, next stop.
          The train begins to slow down.
          Several rows up, he sees Christina. She looks back at him
          with distaste.
          A small number of passengers get up, among them the College
          Student. He catches Colter's attention as he picks up a
          WALLET from a seat and catches up with Derek, the Stock
          Broker, who's about to get off the train.

                         COLLEGE STUDENT
          Hey, you dropped this.

                         DEREK
          (relieved, takes back the

                         WALLET)
          Wow. Thanks.
          The College Student waits to get off. Colter now eyes him
          closely.
          As the train pulls to a stop, Guzman forcefully pushes
          forward towards the doors, moving with a barely contained
          urgency.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         GUZMAN
          Excuse me... Please let me
          through...

                         COLTER

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Jesus, he's running away.

          EXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING

          The doors slide open.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Newark Station.
          The Old Man, Derek and the College Kid get off. Guzman
          hurries past them towards the station house.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          All aboard. Doors are closing.
          Just before the doors close, Colter steps out onto the
          platform. Eyes locked on Guzman -- who disappears inside the
          station house.
          The train PULLS OFF, leaving Colter behind. Did he make the
          right move?
          As he goes to pursue Guzman, Colter is struck by more sensory

                         IMPRESSIONS:
          The STATION CLOCK. Its digital numerals flash 7:50 a.m.,
          hurting Colter's eyes with their brightness.
          The dying HISS of the rails as the train recedes down the
          track.
          The super-sharp glint of a PENNY embedded down in the gravel
          of the tracks.
          The melancholy SIGH of trees in the wind.
          Pushing it all aside, he hurries after Guzman.

          INT. NEWARK STATION HOUSE - MORNING

          Entering, Colter stops. There's no sign of Guzman. Just an
          empty marble lobby. A lone CLERK restocks timetable
          brochures at a display.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         COLTER
          A guy just came through here. Did
          you see where he went?

                         CLERK
          (not looking up)
          Lots of guys come through here.
          Windows look out over the station's parking lot. There's no
          sign of Guzman out there.

                         COLTER
          He was just here. A Middle Eastern-
          looking guy.
          Through the platform doors comes Derek, followed by the
          College Kid. Derek heads for the parking lot, while the
          College Kid mills around the newspaper stand.
          A muffled COUGH.
          Colter spins. Sees a door marked "MEN'S ROOM."

          INT. NEWARK STATION - MEN'S ROOM - MORNING

          Pushing open the door, Colter discovers a row of 1930's-era
          sinks and stalls. An intercom crackles to life:

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          The train to Philadelphia will be
          four minutes late... The train to
          Philadelphia will be four minutes
          late...
          Colter's footsteps echo down the length of the deserted men's
          room. The last stall door is SHUT.
          From within the closed stall, comes the sound of VOMITING.
          Colter edges closer.
          A toilet FLUSHES. Guzman emerges from the stall. Looks
          awful. Freezes when he sees Colter.

                         COLTER
          All better now?
          Guzman's face hardens. He goes to the sink to wash his
          hands.

                         COLTER
          Don't much care for trains myself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.
          The bathroom mirror, of course, reflects back Sean Fentress's
          face, not Colter's. Guzman does not seem to notice this
          disparity. He picks up his briefcase and briskly walks out.
          Colter takes an uneasy look at Fentress looking back at him
          in the mirror, then follows Guzman out.

          INT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING

          Colter emerges in the lobby. Guzman is nearby. A bit
          indecisive. Colter wanders over to the newspaper stand.
          The STATION CLOCK reads 7:54 a.m.
          Colter looks down at HIS WATCH: THREE MINUTES remaining.
          What will Guzman do?
          Guzman glances over at Colter, then heads through the doors
          and back out on the train platform.

          EXT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING

          Guzman sits on a bench. Colter stops nearby him.

                         GUZMAN
          I resent this. This is harassment.
          You obviously work for someone.

          FBI. CIA.

                         (BITTER)
          I expected this reception in your
          country.

                         COLTER
          How are you going to pull this off?
          That bomb has a cell phone
          detonator. And I don't see a pay
          phone around here. So I'm betting
          you got a phone on you with the
          number already programmed in.

                         GUZMAN
          I have no idea what you're talking
          about. I am an international
          business man. An executive.
          The tracks begin to VIBRATE. In the distance comes the HORN
          of an EXPRESS TRAIN approaching.

                         COLTER
          Open your briefcase. Prove to me
          there's no phone in there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         GUZMAN

                         (STANDS UP)
          I will prove nothing to you. Leave
          me alone.
          WHAM! Colter PUNCHES Guzman with tremendous force, sending
          Guzman sprawling to the ground.
          Colter's hand throbs from the force of the punch. The
          simulation's reality stuns Colter all over again.
          Crouching down, Colter pops open Guzman's briefcase. Inside
          is a corporate IDENTIFICATION BADGE with Guzman's name and
          photograph on it. The company is Shell Oil.

                         COLTER

                         (READING)
          "Hasnan Guzman, Vice President,
          Shell Oil." Must be a cover.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Philadelphia train now approaching.
          Guzman groans in pain. Colter rifles through his briefcase.

                         COLTER
          Where the hell's your phone?
          Another look at HIS WATCH -- 20 SECONDS.
          Grabbing Guzman, Colter goes through his suit pockets. He
          triumphantly pulls out GUZMAN'S CELL PHONE and steps back.
          Guzman looks up at him, eyes moist with humiliation and
          malice.

                         COLTER
          I thought so. Now let's see you
          try to --
          A distant THUD rattles the station windows. Colter pivots,
          looks down the tracks. The first thing he sees is

          THE EXPRESS TRAIN
          Closing in on the station.
          The second thing he sees, far beyond it, miles further down
          the tracks, is the RISING PLUME of a HUGE EXPLOSION.
          Colter looks back at Guzman in shock. Then down at Guzman's
          cell phone. Which has remained off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

                         COLTER
          You didn't do it.
          Disbelief. As the din of the distant explosion is drowned
          out by the ROAR of

          THE ARRIVING EXPRESS TRAIN
          With a cry of rage Guzman SPRINGS UP and PUSHES COLTER INTO
          THE PATH OF THE ON-COMING EXPRESS TRAIN -- with a blast of
          its horn, THE TRAIN RUNS HIM OVER.
          Everything stops.
          Like film celluloid catching fire in a projector, the world
          itself BLISTERS AND BURNS INTO SEARING WHITE... into
          smothering, forgetful SILENCE...
          For exactly 2/3 of a second (1/3 of a second longer than
          before), the same flickering after-image appears:

          THIN LINES -- RADIATING OUTWARD --
          This time they all connect into

          THE SPOKES OF A WHEEL. A BICYCLE WHEEL.

          INT. ISOLATION UNIT

          The SOUND of MACHINERY STRAINING. Colter is SLAMMED back
          into his seat -- back in the capsule. All he can do is hang
          on and gasp for air.

                         COLTER
          Holy fuck!

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Stabilize. Lower your pulse.
          Colter opens his eyes. He's back in his military flight
          suit.
          The craft goes still. Cautiously, he releases his hands from
          their grip on the seat restraints. He looks like he's
          sweated off five pounds.

                         GOODWIN
          Do you need to urinate?

                         COLTER
          A fucking train just ran over me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

                         GOODWIN
          Do you need to urinate?

                         COLTER
          How are you doing this? Am I on
          some kind of drug?

                         GOODWIN
          Did you find the bomber?

                         COLTER
          I didn't find the bomber. You
          fooled me with the Middle Eastern
          guy. I went for the diversion.
          What kind of freaky simulation is
          this? Let me out of here!

                         GOODWIN
          Which Middle Eastern guy? Be
          specific.

                         COLTER
          Guzman. Shell Oil. Look, I don't
          have intel experience. Why do you
          have me doing this?

                         GOODWIN
          You've already been told what you
          need to know. Discipline your
          memory. Limit your operational
          awareness to the tasks we assign
          you. Everything else is
          irrelevant.

                         COLTER
          Irrelevant? Killing me each time
          is irrelevant?

                         GOODWIN
          You do not die. As you can see,
          you simply return to us.

                         COLTER
          How? How can you do that?
          Silence.

                         COLTER
          Who's the man with the pipe?

                         GOODWIN
          Say again?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         COLTER
          There was a man smoking a pipe. I
          saw him on the monitor. Who's he?
          How does he fit into this?

                         GOODWIN
          The man with the pipe isn't here
          right now.

                         COLTER
          Let me talk to him. This isn't
          right. I'm not your prisoner.
          Goodwin makes technical adjustments to dials and gauges.

                         GOODWIN
          You feel unsatisfied with our
          relationship?

                         COLTER
          What is this? Why are you talking
          like that? Is this some kind of
          script?

                         GOODWIN
          If Guzman, the Middle Eastern man,
          is innocent, as you maintain, who
          might be the guilty party?

                         COLTER
          Who cares? I'm tired of this.

                         GOODWIN
          This isn't a game, Captain.

                         COLTER
          Then what is it? Don't you already
          know who the bomber is? Don't you
          have all the answers?

                         GOODWIN
          We have no answers. Only corpses.
          A weird beat.

                         COLTER
          Corpses? Whose corpses? The
          passengers?

                         GOODWIN
          Some were too badly burned to be
          identified.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         GOODWIN (CONT'D)
          The heat from the explosion fused
          many of them completely into the
          wreckage.
          Is this the truth? Or another evasive answer? His mind
          pulled in all kinds of unpleasant directions.

                         COLTER
          These were real people?

                         GOODWIN
          Yes.

                         COLTER
          This really happened?

                         GOODWIN
          Yes.

                         COLTER
          When?

                         GOODWIN
          Today.

                         COLTER
          Today?! The train blew up today?

                         GOODWIN
          It was attacked this morning, at
          7:57 a.m., Eastern Standard Time.
          Six miles outside of New York City.
          Colter's head is spinning.

                         COLTER
          You're lying. I don't believe it.

                         GOODWIN
          What do your senses tell you?
          His senses tell him it's true. But how can he accept it?

                         COLTER
          Where am I, right now, as we speak?

                         GOODWIN
          With Beleaguered Castle.

                         COLTER
          My unit's still in Iraq. I'm
          flying missions in Iraq. I flew
          one yesterday!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         GOODWIN
          Your unit was rotated Stateside
          three weeks ago.
          The news comes like a slap in the face. Colter clearly has
          no memory of this.

                         COLTER
          Then why do I still have Iraqi dirt
          underneath my fingernails?
          Goodwin simply makes another adjustment on the controls.

                         COLTER
          Talk to me! Three weeks? I've
          been back three weeks? How'd I get
          in here? Have I seen my family?
          Does my father know I'm home?
          "Cause I'd kinda like to tell him
          if that's the case.

                         GOODWIN
          Listen up, soldier.
          Goodwin hunches forward, putting his elbows on his desk. As
          he does so, he inadvertently reveals a glimpse of his
          military unit SHOULDER PATCH. The insignia contains wings
          and a lightning bolt against a background of stars.
          Underneath it is written "CAOC-N."

                         GOODWIN
          The train is just the beginning.
          Our intel says there are more
          attacks are coming today. And
          they're linked with the train.
          Time is of the essence. Do you
          understand?
          Colter barely hears. He's fixated on that shoulder patch.

                         GOODWIN
          Captain?

                         COLTER
          I'm listening.

                         GOODWIN
          D.N.I. Counterterrorism has come up
          with the five most likely follow-up
          targets in the New York area.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         GOODWIN (CONT'D)
          They are, in no order of
          importance, the Holland Tunnel,
          Newark International Airport, the
          Brooklyn Bridge, Penn Station and
          the Empire State Building. It
          could be any of them, it could be
          none of them. Whatever it is, if
          you find the bomber and learn his
          plan, the next one we might be in a
          position to prevent. Those are
          your orders.
          It's too much information to process. Colter's head spins
          with questions.

                         COLTER
          Wait. If I'm somehow on that train
          before it blows up, why don't I
          just dismantle the bomb?

                         GOODWIN
          Those are not your orders.

                         COLTER
          But all those people dying...

                         GOODWIN
          Those are not your orders. You are
          not to influence events any more
          than you need to in order to
          accomplish your mission.
          Military priorities. Defying comprehension.

                         COLTER
          I didn't volunteer for this shit.

                         GOODWIN
          Would you like to see the release
          form you signed?

                         COLTER

                         (EXASPERATED)
          How do I know it's real? How do I
          know you didn't force me to sign
          it? And how the hell can I be put
          on a train over and over again -- a
          train I never was really on?!
          He might as well be talking to a wall.

                         COLTER
          I don't believe in time travel,
          Goodwin. There's no such thing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          Machinery begins to RUN. Like the WHINE of a JET ENGINE
          firing up.

                         GOODWIN
          Only one way forward, Captain.
          Seventeen minutes. Find the truth.

                         COLTER
          Why seventeen? Why me? Why
          anything?
          The capsule begins to SHAKE.

                         COLTER
          Let me out! Don't send me back
          there!
          SFX: UP ON a HUGE ROAR as --

          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - MORNING

          THE TRAIN hurls down the tracks.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Landscape flies by. Colter's forehead rests against the
          glass window. Piercing sunlight.

                         COLTER
          Shit. This is not happening.
          He leans back in his seat, as if just another beaten down
          office worker on the train.

                         CHRISTINA
          Ain't life grand?
          Across from him, Christina sketching. A gentle smirk. He
          focuses in on her. Not knowing where else to begin.

                         COLTER
          You an artist?

                         CHRISTINA
          I went to art school. Doesn't make
          me an artist.

                         COLTER
          Can I see what you're working on?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          Her pencil pauses. She eyes Colter.

                         CHRISTINA
          I'd rather not.
          He looks down at his watch. 7:41 a.m. He's been back for
          one minute. Adjusting the settings, he changes the digital
          display to COUNT DOWN the remaining SIXTEEN MINUTES.
          He tries again for human contact.

                         COLTER
          You don't look like you belong
          here. The way you're dressed.

                         CHRISTINA
          You certainly do.

                         COLTER
          I'd really like to see what you're
          working on. Unless you're worried
          I won't like it.

                         CHRISTINA
          It's private. And your opinion
          doesn't interest me.

                         COLTER
          So you scribble away on that thing
          so as not to deal with people.
          She scowls. Tosses the sketch pad onto his lap. Surprised,
          Colter opens it. It's full of faces -- thumbnail portraits
          of other passengers riding the train. They're exquisitely
          observed, darkly stylized into expressions of loneliness.

                         COLTER
          They're amazing.

                         CHRISTINA
          I wouldn't go that far.

                         COLTER
          Seriously, they're really good,
          Miss...?

                         CHRISTINA
          Christina.

                         COLTER
          My name's Colter. How many of
          these passengers have you drawn?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         CHRISTINA
          All of them, practically.
          She leans forward, eyes glinting conspiratorially.

                         CHRISTINA
          I know all about them.

                         COLTER
          You know all about them?

                         CHRISTINA
          I'm a collector of moments.

                         (DISCREETLY GESTURING)
          That woman over there? She's a
          patent attorney with three kids and
          a summer place on Long Island.
          More important, however, she colors
          her hair herself and wears the same
          houndstooth check suit every third
          Wednesday. The nebbishy fellow
          behind her always calls into his
          office three minutes before we go
          into the tunnel. And the guy with
          the shaved head and leather jacket
          eating a scone has a profile
          identical to that of Julius Caesar.
          A click of the restroom door opening. Guzman emerges from
          the bathroom and returns to his seat.

                         COLTER

                         (RE: GUZMAN)
          What about that guy?
          Christina looks over Guzman.

                         CHRISTINA
          I haven't seen him before today.

                         (LOOKING CLOSER)
          He's cranky. Thinks the worst of
          people.

                         COLTER
          Dangerous?

                         CHRISTINA
          Everyone's dangerous.

                         COLTER
          You see anything unusual happen
          this morning? Anything out of the
          ordinary?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         CHRISTINA
          I'm not sure I know what you mean.

                         COLTER
          Has anyone else come out of that
          bathroom that you remember?
          She takes a closer look at him. A puzzled smile.

                         CHRISTINA
          Who are you?
          Colter hesitates. Debating.

                         COLTER
          Don't you know? Haven't you seen
          me here every day for, what, three
          months?

                         CHRISTINA
          Something's different about you
          today.

                         COLTER
          If I told you that there's a
          terrorist on this train, that I was
          sent here to catch him, would you
          believe me?

                         CHRISTINA
          Most fervently.

                         COLTER
          Then tell me which one you'd
          arrest.
          Christina pages through her sketch pad again. Considering
          different faces.

                         CHRISTINA
          They're all so utterly normal.
          That's what's terrifying about
          them. Perhaps there's more than
          one. A team at work. The patent
          attorney in cahoots with Julius
          Caesar and the nebbishy guy. And
          don't forget the sullen college
          kid. He's the expendable one. But
          they're all controlled by this good-
          looking stock broker.
          She shows him her sketch of Derek, the Stock Broker.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         CHRISTINA
          Blond, blue eyed, hyper alert. The
          perfect Machiavellian operative.
          Out for himself. He'll betray them
          all in the end.
          She's not taking him seriously.

                         COLTER
          Never mind.
          He gets up. Foolish of him to confide in her. His watch now
          reads THIRTEEN MINUTES.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Now approaching Newark Station.
          Newark Station, next stop.
          The train begins to slow. Derek, Guzman, the Old Man and the
          College Kid head towards the exit doors.

                         CHRISTINA

                         (STAGE WHISPER)
          He's getting away...!
          Colter moves aside to let them walk past.

                         COLTER

                         (CURT DISMISSAL)
          Thanks for your help, ma'am.

                         CHRISTINA
          Ma'am? How old do you think I am?

                         COLTER
          I don't know. Thirty two?
          Her icy glare tells him he's guessed too high.

          EXT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING

          The disembarking passengers exit the platform.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          The train is moving again. In the exit area, Colter watches
          the station disappear. He's doing this all wrong.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Next stop New York Penn Station.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING

          The two screws rattle in the sink. Colter gazes up at the
          half-opened ventilation shaft -- and at the edge of the
          sinister bomb planted there.
          Back down to the mirror. Sean Fentress's face. The most
          baffling mystery of all.

                         COLTER
          What happened, Fentress? Who are
          you? How can I be you?
          FLASHCUT -- Back in the isolation unit. On the monitor, the
          glimpse of Goodwin's SHOULDER PATCH INSIGNIA. The unit
          initials "CAOC-N."
          Back to scene. Colter churning over the thought.

                         COLTER
          "CAOC-N." What unit is that?
          A KNOCK on the door.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Through the windows comes the blur of the EXPRESS TRAIN
          whizzing past (the same train which previously ran over
          Colter).
          Emerging from the bathroom, Colter discovers Christina there.

                         CHRISTINA
          Who were you talking to?

                         COLTER
          Leave me alone.
          Colter walks off. Irked at his change in tone, she follows
          him, carrying his messenger bag.

                         CHRISTINA
          My pleasure, okay? It's just that
          you left your bag on your seat.
          (trying to be cute)
          It's a flagrant violation of rail
          security, leaving a suspicious
          package behind and all that. Maybe
          you're the terrorist.
          This is too much. Colter turns on her. Paranoid.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         COLTER
          Terrorist? Why did you say that?

                         CHRISTINA
          I was joking.

                         COLTER
          Stop joking. Who are you? Are you
          an operative?

                         CHRISTINA
          I had no idea you were so
          thoroughly weird. I'm not entirely
          sure I like it.

                         COLTER
          Why do you have sketches of
          everybody on board? Are you part
          of this?

                         CHRISTINA
          Part of what?

                         COLTER
          I can have you arrested. Maybe
          that's the only way you'll drop the
          bullshit and talk. Stay put. I'm
          getting help.
          She sees he's serious and drops her arch playfulness. Speaks
          in a flat, sober voice.

                         CHRISTINA
          Who am I? I'll tell you. I'm
          twenty seven years old. I have no
          savings and no health insurance.
          He turns back. Waits. The more she speaks, the angrier she
          gets.

                         CHRISTINA
          Six months ago I moved back in with
          my parents because I ran out of
          money. I got A's in line drawing
          and advanced oil painting but no
          one's buying my stuff. Two weeks
          ago I put away all my paints. My
          little sketch book is the last
          thing left. You see, I'm not a
          artist. I'm a receptionist in a
          law firm. The only thing I operate
          is a phone switchboard.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.
          The stark reality of her life.
          The HORN of the FREIGHT TRAIN yanks his attention to the
          windows. Up ahead are the row houses opposite which the
          train exploded. Time is running down.

                         CHRISTINA
          Now let me tell you about you. You
          work at the New York Public
          Library. You've been eyeing me for
          months on this train but haven't
          said a word to me. You're bland
          and colorless and predictable. And
          now I see you're delusional, too.
          Colter doesn't hear her. He's still looking out the window.

          COLTER'S POV
          Above the row houses, a COMMERCIAL AIRLINER is climbing
          serenely into the blue after take-off out of Newark Airport.
          The view is wiped away as the FREIGHT TRAIN comes surging
          past the windows. But the sight of the plane has already
          caused something to click in Colter's head.

                         COLTER
          Son of a bitch. "CAOC-N." That's
          not army. That's Air Force.
          Combined Air and Space Operations
          Center. Nellis Air Force Base!

                         CHRISTINA
          Are you mocking me?

                         COLTER
          They're running this whole thing
          out of Nellis Air Force Base in
          Nevada. Fucking Nevada!
          Tears in Christina's eyes. That Colter would persist in this
          delusion after what she's confessed about herself.

                         COLTER
          (racking his brain)
          What's there? What's on that base?
          B-52s. KC tankers. Air Combat
          Command. Predator Drones. Remote
          operations.
          (something to this)
          This a remote operation.

                         (FINALLY)
          What if it is time travel?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          A worried CONDUCTOR runs past them, talking rapidly into his
          radio. We catch the words "bomb threat."

                         COLTER
          What did he say?
          A WARNING ALARM begins beeping. Passengers look around
          uneasily. Christina, however, focuses her anger on Colter.

                         CHRISTINA
          Do me a favor. Don't ever talk to
          me again.
          She drops his messenger bag at his feet and walks away.
          Colter looks down at his watch. THE LAST SECONDS TICK AWAY --

          5... 4... 3...

                         COLTER
          Christina!
          He grabs her -- she struggles against him --

                         CHRISTINA
          Get off me!
          But he HOLDS HER TIGHT, shielding her with his body and
          squeezing his eyes shut as --

          THE EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE TRAIN -- EVERYTHING VAPORIZES.
          Blinding light. Painful to look at.
          Like a star exploding.
          A dull, hollow sound of WIND rattling through an abyss.
          And then the ghostly still life. Details flicker into view:
          A bicycle. A stone wall. And next to it...
          A woman.
          It's Christina. Turning to look at us. A gentle, reassuring
          smile.

          INT. ISOLATION UNIT

          Click -- click. Click -- click. The video monitor is
          malfunctioning. It flickers on and off, revealing Colter's
          face in and out of darkness.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.
          The capsule is nearly shut down. The controls appear non-
          functional. Ice crystals have formed over the circuitry.
          Colter hugs himself, shivering. His breath is visible in the
          capsule's tomb-like cold.

                         COLTER
          Goodwin? What's happening? Come
          in. Can you read me? It's goddamn
          cold in here.
          He hits a few buttons. Almost at random. The VENTS which
          had been blowing in air FALL SILENT.

                         COLTER
          Goodwin, I'm losing oxygen.
          The monitor fizzles out. The light from the controls FADES.

                         COLTER
          Goodwin!
          It's now COMPLETELY DARK.
          He BANGS on the side of the capsule. Just a muffled thump.
          A terrifying silence.
          The SNAP of a harness releasing. A THUD as Colter falls to
          the floor of the capsule. Cursing. Some sounds of thrashing
          around. Then...
          The SPARK of a BLUE FLARE illuminates Colter's face. He's
          activated a miniature signal light on his flight suit. It
          begins to BLINK. Like a beacon for downed pilots afloat in
          the sea. It is the only light in the otherwise dead capsule.
          Up on his knees, he grasps the release handles of the EXIT
          HATCH. Using all his strength he TURNS...
          But the handles don't budge. The hatch remains sealed.
          He gets to his feet. Can't stand up fully. The capsule is
          incredibly cramped.
          Rifling through a cabinet, he discovers OPERATIONAL MANUALS
          in small, almost illegible type. And a small set of TOOLS.
          He spreads them out on the tiny ledge. Taking a wrench, he
          BANGS on the escape hatch. A deep, clanging ECHO in the
          hull.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          So, like any pilot would, he sets about repairing his craft.
          At first he puzzles over the electronics and circuitry.
          Daunted by the complexity.
          There's no time to lose. Using a miniature screw driver, he
          begins unscrewing the monitor panel. His fingers are slow
          and clumsy in the frigid cold and the screw driver slips out
          of his hands.

                         LATER
          Icicles have appeared over dormant air vents. Colter, ice
          crystals in his hair, is shivering more violently. Much of
          the capsule's electronics lay open and exposed.
          Using copper wires, he's attempting to revive a row of
          BATTERIES. They spark once... twice... Nothing.

                         COLTER
          Come on!
          Another SPARK. It shocks him. There's a puff of blue smoke.
          He's burned his fingers.
          But the battery now has a tiny BLINKING GREEN LIGHT.
          Working fast, Colter attaches the copper wires to the leads
          on the battery. From inside the engines comes a faint
          electric HUM.
          FFFT. The monitor awakens. Like a film projector it throws
          the image of a PLAYING CARD onto the opposite side of the
          craft.
          Colter begins replacing the monitor components. As he does,
          a pre-recorded AUDIO FILE comes on:

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          -- four principle dialects of
          Arabic: Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-
          Lebanese and North African. We
          will now play you portions of each,
          discussing the audible differences
          between them.
          CLIPS of SPOKEN ARABIC begin to play.
          Colter continues reconstituting the computer. The monitor
          fills with scrolling lines of COMPUTER CODE.
          With an oddly low-tech CLANG, the heart of the machine
          reawakens. The air vents come back to life. Heat starts to
          return. The icicles begin to DRIP.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          Colter sits back in his seat, exhausted from the work.
          The monitor switches to a real-time view of the LAB.
          Goodwin's chair is there, but Goodwin is not in sight. In a
          background distorted by the FISH-EYE LENS, various
          technicians wander by.

                         COLTER
          Hello? Anyone out there? It's me.
          He toggles an audio jack. Then a MAN comes walking up.
          Frowns into the camera, as if through the foggy lens of
          another world.
          It's the MAN WITH THE PIPE. The elusive Bohemian scientist
          whom Colter glimpsed once before. He will be known as

          RUTLEDGE.

                         COLTER
          Can you hear me?
          Rutledge is tinkering with the camera. The image shakes for
          a moment as he adjusts it. Then puts on a headset.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Project designer initiating
          sequence and drives check.

                         COLTER
          I'm here! I'm okay!
          Rutledge checks his headset. Not sure he heard right.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Is someone there?

                         COLTER
          Yeah. It's me. Colter.
          Rutledge blinks in surprise. The blue eyes sparkling.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Wow! It's you.

                         COLTER
          The capsule lost power. It's still
          pretty cold in here.

                         RUTLEDGE
          We've been working towards you from
          the other side. Nice to have you
          with us again. You feeling all
          right?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         COLTER
          I think so. Who are you?

                         RUTLEDGE
          The name's Rutledge.

                         COLTER
          They wouldn't let me talk to you
          before.

                         RUTLEDGE
          No, I guess not. They're pretty
          anal around here.
          (lights his pipe)
          Don't tell them you saw me smoking
          in here, okay?
          His genial eccentricity is completely at odds with the
          military environment. And then it occurs to Colter:

                         COLTER
          You're the inventor of this thing.

                         RUTLEDGE

                         (SHRUGS)
          I prefer the term project designer.
          And sorry for all the secrecy.
          Goodwin will be thrilled you re-
          established contact.

                         COLTER
          I don't want to deal with Goodwin
          anymore.

                         RUTLEDGE
          What?

                         COLTER
          Don't you understand? He's
          torturing me. I'm helpless. Can't
          you get me out of here?
          Rutledge looks uneasy. As a scientist, he's ill-equipped to
          deal with personnel issues.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Why would Goodwin have it in for
          you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         COLTER
          He's a remote operator. And remote
          operators are risk averse pussies
          who sit at control screens in the
          rear while actual pilots like me
          put their asses on the line in the
          field.

                         RUTLEDGE
          He seems pretty devoted to the
          mission.

                         COLTER
          And just what kind of mission is
          this? Talk to me, man. Why won't
          he let me save those people on the
          train?

                         RUTLEDGE
          Because they can't be saved.

                         COLTER
          Why not? I know what's going to
          happen. I could take apart the
          bomb. Stop the train.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Yeah but you'd be doing it in the
          Source Code, not here. Not in our
          own past.
          Mystery upon mystery.

                         COLTER
          What's the difference?

                         RUTLEDGE
          I'm not sure I should be telling
          you this.

                         COLTER
          Telling me what?
          Coaxing the scientist in him.

                         RUTLEDGE
          It's quantum physics. Linear
          algebra. Parabolic calculus. It
          would take weeks to explain.

                         COLTER
          Is Source Code time travel?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.
          Rutledge sighs. Looks at his pipe.

                         RUTLEDGE
          It's gone out again.

                         COLTER
          Why can't I save those people on
          the train?

                         RUTLEDGE
          Think of it like this: events in
          our past can never be undone.
          Einstein proved that.

                         COLTER
          So...

                         RUTLEDGE
          So Source Code opens up another
          past for you. A parallel past. It
          looks the same but it has no
          intersection with our own world.
          In essence, by sending you back, an
          entirely new but utterly parallel
          world is created. It looks
          identical to ours, but nothing you
          do there has any effect on this
          reality.
          At last some useful information. Colter races to process it.

                         COLTER
          What happens to the Source Code
          world after I leave it?

                         RUTLEDGE
          I don't know. You can never know
          that because you're not there to
          observe it. Maybe it vanishes.
          Maybe not.

                         (UNEASY)
          I should tell them you're okay.

                         COLTER
          What about the bicycle?

                         RUTLEDGE
          What bicycle?

                         COLTER
          I see it each time. Right after
          the bomb goes off. Like an after
          image.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         COLTER (CONT'D)
          There's a bicycle and a stone wall
          and a girl. It's a girl from the
          train. I don't know where any of
          it is supposed to be, but --
          Rutledge removes the pipe from his mouth.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Wait. You see all this after you
          leave the train?

                         COLTER
          Yeah. Just for a split second.
          Rutledge is stunned. Like he's discovered some strange new
          property to his invention.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Please tell me you're not making
          this up.

                         COLTER
          No. It's there. What do you think
          it means?

                         RUTLEDGE
          I don't know.
          Rutledge looks off camera for a moment.

                         RUTLEDGE
          They're here. There's no more time
          to talk.

                         (QUICKLY)
          Make sure he sends you back in.
          Find out about the after images.
          Goodwin appears. Rutledge reluctantly takes off his headset.

                         COLTER
          Rutledge, wait. Don't leave me.
          Rutledge steps away. A pointed look at Colter. Goodwin
          settles back into his seat, donning the headset.

                         GOODWIN
          Welcome back. How are you feeling?

                         COLTER
          I'm alive. No thanks to you.

                         GOODWIN
          You find the bomber?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         COLTER
          You're a brick wall, Goodwin. A
          fucking brick wall.

                         GOODWIN
          Lower your pulse. The situation
          has worsened. The fire on the
          tracks caused one of the freight
          cars to blow up and release some
          kind of gas. As a precaution
          they're having to evacuate all of
          lower Manhattan.
          Evacuate lower Manhattan? The enormity of this. Having to
          take it on faith.

                         GOODWIN
          We may have lost the initiative.

                         COLTER
          What do you mean? Let's keep
          going.

                         GOODWIN
          We were expecting more from you.

                         COLTER
          I can give you more. Let me think
          for a second.
          But Goodwin ignores him. Absorbed in paperwork.

                         COLTER
          The freight car blows up from the
          fire. It spews gas, or what could
          be gas -- it might be chlorine, so
          they can't take any chances.
          Anxious now. Trying to make up lost ground. Whatever it
          takes to get sent back in.

                         COLTER
          So they decide to play it safe and
          evacuate parts of New York City.
          And maybe that's part of the
          terrorists' plan, right?

                         (THINKING)
          So... so who benefits from that?
          What's vulnerable? What's down
          there in lower Manhattan?

                         (BEAT)
          Wall Street.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.
          Surprising himself with this insight.
          And now Goodwin is paying attention again. Waiting for more.

                         COLTER
          Wall Street. That's what they're
          going to hit next. The financial
          markets.
          Goodwin considers this. For the first time, slightly
          impressed.

                         GOODWIN
          I want to show you something.

                         CUT TO:

          DRIVERS LICENSE PHOTOS
          The video monitor shows CHRISTINA's DMV shot. Her wry,
          secretive smile.

                         COLTER
          Did she die, too?

                         GOODWIN
          Yes. This drivers license photo
          was found with her body. We're
          creating a database of recovered
          identifications as they come in
          from the site.
          A pang of sorrow. Moving among ghosts.

                         COLTER
          You sure she's dead?

                         GOODWIN
          Would you like to see her morgue
          photos?

                         COLTER

                         (QUIETLY)
          She was sitting across from me.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          We know.

          Rescue workers in protective gear picking their way carefully
          through the twisted, charred remains of the two trains.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          This was taken shortly after the
          rescue crews arrived on scene.
          The TIME CODE on the image reads 8:26 a.m.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          We noted the location of each
          corpse when we pulled it out.
          On screen, rescue workers pull a CHARRED CORPSE out of the
          wreckage.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Prepare yourself. This is unedited
          footage.

                         COLTER
          I told you I didn't want to see
          her!
          The camera ZOOMS IN on a corpse. Its burned face, like a
          piece of rotted fruit, fills the screen. Nevertheless, we
          recognize it. And it's not Christina. It's someone else.

                         COLTER
          That's...

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Sean Fentress.
          The man in the mirror. Himself, at least on the train.

                         COLTER
          He died on the train.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          As a host identity, Sean Fentress
          had to have certain basic
          similarities to you. Gender.
          Blood type. Approximate age. His
          head was still intact. We need the
          head, you see. To link the two of
          you remotely.
          They carry the corpse towards a MORGUE TRUCK with a vast
          array of SATELLITE COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT attached to it.

          The image freezes, then DISSOLVES back to Christina's DMV
          photo.
          Silence. Pondering.

                         GOODWIN
          Would you like to see the other
          passenger photos? Perhaps that
          would help you.

                         COLTER
          You still have Christina's body?
          The other things she was carrying?

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Why?

                         COLTER
          I want to know about her.
          Everything I can. She's not just
          another victim. She's connected to
          all this.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          The rich smell of steaming coffee. The glint of a polished
          leather shoe. The crisp click of someone uncapping a
          fountain pen. The scenery rushing by -- the blur of trees,
          the soft lavender of the morning sky. The swell and pull of
          the mighty machine coursing over the rails.
          If a train ride could ever be a sensory delight, this is it.
          To Colter, every sensation has become even more pronounced,
          more intensely real than ever.
          CLOSE ON - HIS WATCH - A beep as he sets it to countdown
          again from seventeen minutes. The duration of his freedom.
          Across from him is Christina. Absorbed with her sketching.

                         COLTER
          Thirty six dollars and eleven
          cents.
          She looks up at him.

                         COLTER
          In your wallet. Right now. Thirty
          six dollars and eleven cents.

                         CHRISTINA
          Is this a magic trick or something?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         COLTER
          Yes. In five seconds, a guy's
          going to open a can of soda.

          4... 3.. 2... 1...

          CHK-THOCK!
          The Overweight Man opens his soda can. She gives Colter a
          quizzical look. He points out the window. They're passing a
          neighborhood of modest homes.

                         COLTER
          We're about to pass a street with
          willow trees. Two girls will be
          jumping rope. A white dog's going
          to run out behind them. A
          Dalmatian mix.
          In a moment, they pass a scene exactly as Colter described.
          Christina's befuddled smile.

                         CHRISTINA
          You want to tell me how you're
          doing this?

                         COLTER
          Close observation. You could say
          I'm a collector of moments.

                         CHRISTINA
          A collector of moments?

                         COLTER
          Yes.

                         CHRISTINA
          That's the cheesiest line I've ever
          heard.
          She resumes her drawing.

                         COLTER
          You trained to be an artist.
          No response.

                         COLTER
          You got A's in line drawing and oil
          painting. But your work didn't
          sell. You took a job answering
          phones in a law firm.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         COLTER (CONT'D)
          Six months ago you moved back in
          with your parents. Two weeks ago
          you put your paints away for good.
          The sketch book is all you have
          left.

                         CHRISTINA
          Who the hell are you? Who have you
          been talking to?

                         COLTER
          You.

                         CHRISTINA
          Me? No. I haven't ever talked to
          you.

                         COLTER
          But we have, Christina. You've
          drawn all these people here. You
          know their routines. At one point
          you thought you were different from
          all of them. But now you're not so
          sure.
          Christina has gone white. Utterly incredulous.

          INT. TRAIN DINING CAR - MORNING

          A small bar area. Coffee sloshing in styrofoam cups Colter
          hands one to Christina and sits down opposite her. A glance
          at his watch shows TWELVE MINUTES left.

                         CHRISTINA
          Okay, you've got my attention. Now
          tell me what this is all about.

                         COLTER
          I need your help.

                         CHRISTINA
          Are you selling something?

                         COLTER
          Listen to me. I can't use up any
          more time trying to convince you.
          I just need you to believe
          everything I'm about to tell you.

                         CHRISTINA
          This better be good.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         COLTER
          Bear with me.
          (beat, where to begin?)
          Your sketch book. Is there a
          drawing of me in there?

                         CHRISTINA
          I'm not sure.

                         COLTER
          Please, Christina.

                         CHRISTINA
          Yes, fine! Here.
          She flips through it. Shows him a sketch of SEAN FENTRESS.

                         CHRISTINA
          I did it last week.

                         COLTER
          The thing is, that's not me.

                         CHRISTINA
          Give me a little credit.

                         COLTER
          No. You drew what you saw, but the
          person you're seeing now is someone
          else. I'm not Sean Fentress. I'm
          not really on this train.

                         CHRISTINA

                         (INCOMPREHENSION)
          You're not really on this train.

                         COLTER
          I'm taking someone's place.
          Borrowing it. My name is Colter.
          I'm a soldier. And I'm being held
          prisoner. And this is the only way
          -- the only time and place I have --
          to figure out how to escape.
          She gives him a blank look.

                         CHRISTINA
          After three months of riding the
          train, this is how you introduce
          yourself to me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         COLTER
          I'm serious. Elements in the
          American military are using me for
          an experiment. I'm not sure
          exactly how it all happened, but
          I'm at a facility on Nellis Air
          Force Base in Nevada. Right now.
          As we speak. It's a project called
          Source Code.

                         CHRISTINA
          Source Code.

                         COLTER
          It's a program. It shifts
          identities. It also performs small
          amounts of time travel. Or "time
          engineering." I don't know the
          jargon.
          He's not getting through to her. It's too bizarre.

                         COLTER
          I've been put on this train to look
          for someone. A criminal. And I
          need to find out just enough about
          him to keep them putting me back on
          this train. Because right here's
          only place I can figure out what's
          really happening. But I have very
          little time. And each time I come
          back, you won't remember me and
          I'll have to go through this all
          over again.

                         CHRISTINA
          You are, I think, deliciously mad.

                         COLTER
          Then how do I know all those things
          about you if we've never spoken
          before?
          She doesn't have an answer. Can't easily dismiss him.

                         CHRISTINA
          Why tell all this to me? There's
          lots of people around for you to
          talk to.

                         COLTER
          Because I think you have the answer
          to this whole thing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         CHRISTINA
          Believe me, I don't have the answer
          for anything.

                         COLTER
          There's a vision. I keep having
          it. It's very powerful. And
          you're in it. And there's a
          bicycle. And this... old stone
          wall. And it's very peaceful.
          Does this sound familiar? Like
          where you live, maybe?

                         CHRISTINA
          Stone walls? My parents live in a
          house with aluminum siding and an
          American eagle over the door. The
          only bike is a Harley which the guy
          down the street revs at three in
          the morning.

                         COLTER
          The vision must mean something.
          It's the only time when I'm not on
          the train or in the capsule. Why
          else would Rutledge be so
          interested?

                         CHRISTINA
          Who's Rutledge?

                         COLTER
          Someone who was trying to help me
          understand something. Until they
          got to him.
          He lowers his head. A dead end. No answer. The train
          begins to slow down.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Now approaching Newark Station.
          Newark Station, next stop.
          Colter looks at HIS WATCH. Ten minutes left.

                         CHRISTINA
          I saw a program on TV. It was
          about psychics. They say psychics
          have a lot of paranoia.

                         COLTER
          I don't believe in that shit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Newark Station.
          Through the window, the Old Man, Derek and the College Kid
          disembark. Guzman hurries past them to the station house.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          All aboard. Doors are closing.

                         CHRISTINA
          Don't you have people you can go to
          for help? Friends, family?
          The train begins to move again.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          This is a New York bound train.
          Next stop, New York - Penn Station.

                         COLTER
          Most of my friends are in the
          military. My dad runs a melon farm
          in Alabama.

                         CHRISTINA
          Maybe now's the time to reach out
          to him.
          She hands him her cell phone. Colter just holds it in his
          hand.

                         COLTER
          Me and my dad, we don't see eye to
          eye. We're just two different
          people.

                         CHRISTINA
          As opposed to being the exact same
          person?

                         COLTER
          Are you always this sarcastic?

                         CHRISTINA
          This is so not about me.
          Colter reluctantly dials. As it rings --

                         COLTER
          What day is it?

                         CHRISTINA
          June 11th.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         COLTER
          June?
          One more thing to puzzle him.
          The call connects. An OLDER MAN, DONALD STEVENS, answers.
          The gravelly voice of a Midwestern farmer.

          DONALD (V.O.)
          Hello?

                         COLTER
          Dad?
          Donald doesn't respond.

                         COLTER
          Dad, it's me. It's Colter.
          Again, silence.

                         COLTER
          Been a while, huh? I'd been
          meaning to call you, but --
          Click. The line goes dead. Colter looks at Christina.

                         COLTER
          He wanted me to stay on and take
          over the farm but... I had other
          ideas.

                         CHRISTINA
          You're intimidated by him.

                         COLTER
          What?

                         CHRISTINA
          You're scared of him. I can see
          it.

                         COLTER
          The hell I am.
          Challenged, he redials. Braced for conflict. The call
          connects.

                         COLTER
          Dad, don't hang up. We're going to
          talk. I need your help.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         DONALD

                         (CONTROLLED ANGER)
          Now you listen to me. Whoever you
          are, never call here again.
          Donald hangs up.

                         CHRISTINA
          He's still mad at you, huh?

                         COLTER
          No... it was like he didn't even
          know who I was.
          Troubled, he hands back her phone. Outside, the EXPRESS
          TRAIN flashes by.

                         CHRISTINA
          I don't know how to help you.
          She feels bad for him. And something inside Colter closes.
          Retreating inside himself.

                         COLTER
          Sorry to have bothered you.
          He gets up to go. Christina stays where she is.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Back in his seat. Lost in the view out the window. The
          neighborhoods have given way to Newark's industrial fringe.
          Bringing him closer to the inevitable end.

          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
          I have a friend.
          Surprised, he turns to find her there.

                         CHRISTINA
          She works at the New York Times.
          Her name's Stephanie. She's just a
          proofreader, but she wants to be
          made a reporter. She's always
          saying she needs a good story to
          bring in so she gets noticed.
          Something like this, with a crazy
          paranoid angle could really
          interest her.

                         COLTER
          Forget it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         CHRISTINA
          She could do some poking around.
          She's already quite suspicious of
          the government.
          Christina's dialing her phone. Colter turns back to the
          window.

                         CHRISTINA
          I'm getting voice mail.
          (into the phone)
          Steph, it's Christina. You know
          that story you're always looking to
          write? I might just have something
          for you. I met a guy. His name is
          Colter Stevens. He says he's in
          the army. He flies helicopters in
          Iraq, but now they've put him into
          a secret project called Source
          Code. Maybe you can look into it a
          bit, okay? Call me.
          She hangs up. Pleased with herself.

                         CHRISTINA
          She'll call back. Just wait.
          None of it will do Colter any good, but he manages a smile.

                         COLTER
          Thank you, ma'am.

                         CHRISTINA

                         (LAUGHS)
          Ma'am? How old do you think I am?
          He gives her a wary look. Considers.

                         COLTER
          Twenty five?
          She smiles, pleased.

                         CHRISTINA
          No, but thanks.

                         (BEAT)
          What did you mean, there's a
          criminal on the train? How do you
          know that?
          Colter looks away. Careful.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         COLTER
          I just do.

                         CHRISTINA
          How can I help you if you don't
          tell me everything about this?

          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING

          Colter enters the tiny space. Christina is reluctant to
          follow him into the bathroom.

                         COLTER
          You said you wanted to know.

                         CHRISTINA
          Can't you just tell me?
          He gives her an imploring look. She sighs and squeezes in
          next to him.

                         CHRISTINA
          Try anything and I'll kill you.

                         COLTER
          Shut the door.
          As she shuts the door, Colter gets up on the sink.

                         CHRISTINA
          What are you doing?
          He wrenches back the ventilation panel, then steps aside.

                         COLTER
          It's up here.
          He holds out his hand. She grabs hold and steps up on the
          sink. She's not quite tall enough to see into the
          crawlspace, so he steps up behind her and lifts her the rest
          of the way.

                         CHRISTINA
          (startled, feels his hands

                         ON HER)
          What are you --

                         COLTER
          Just look.
          Her blouse brushes his face as he holds her up. A long beat
          as she looks inside the overhead space at the bomb.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         CHRISTINA
          Is that...?

                         COLTER
          Acetone Peroxide. It's a liquid
          explosive. There's fourteen
          cannisters of it. Simple
          detonator. Cell phone signal
          closes the circuit and boom.
          He lowers her. An incredulous beat.

                         CHRISTINA
          Did you put this here?

                         COLTER
          No. It was someone else. They
          don't know who. That's why I'm
          here. To find out.
          Watching her. Will she believe him?

                         CHRISTINA
          We have to tell someone. We have
          to stop this.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          The bathroom door opens and Christina walks quickly away.
          Mounting fear. Colter falls into step behind her.

                         COLTER
          It won't matter. The train's
          already...

                         CHRISTINA
          Already what?

                         COLTER
          I've been sent here. It sounds
          crazy, but it's true. I've been
          sent from the future -- from five
          hours in the future. This train's
          already been blown up.
          She backs up. Scared of him. Every right to be.

                         COLTER
          You wanted to know. Now you know.
          She turns and hurries for the exit doors.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         CHRISTINA
          This isn't happening. I've got to
          get off.
          Colter catches up with her inside the exit vestibule. She's
          stabbing at the door release button.

                         CHRISTINA
          Why won't it open?!
          Her phone is RINGS. They both stop. She looks at the
          number.

                         CHRISTINA
          It's Steph.

                         (HOLLOW)
          I told you she'd be interested.

                         (ANSWERS)
          Hi.
          Her eyes are fixed suspiciously on Colter as she listens.
          Colter looks outside. Recognizes the terrain. Looks down at

          HIS WATCH --

          50 SECONDS.
          It's awful. Unbearable. He dashes towards the bathroom --

          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING

          Tears open the door. Jumps up on the sink.

                         THE BOMB
          Sits in the semi-darkness, faintly illuminated by the
          bathroom's fluorescent light. As he grabs hold of the bomb,
          he hears --

          CHRISTINA (O.S.)
          Colter...?
          Working fast, he unhooks the leads on the detonator, rips
          away gaffing tape -- jostling the cannisters of explosives --

          CHRISTINA (O.S.)
          Colter, I have to tell you
          something.
          -- and pulls off the detonator cell phone. Ducking back
          down, he see Christina standing in the doorway.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         COLTER
          Look. Now the fucking thing can't
          go off.

                         HIS WATCH
          Reads 20 SECONDS.

                         CHRISTINA
          Stephanie did a computer search.
          Something in her expression worries him.

                         CHRISTINA
          She's got a database of all
          newspaper articles going back to
          forever.

                         COLTER
          Source Code's classified. It
          wouldn't be in a newspaper.

                         CHRISTINA
          No. But you were. She found you.

                         COLTER
          She found me? What does that mean?
          She stops. Not wanting to go on.
          From outside comes the HORN from the approaching freight
          train.

                         COLTER
          Jesus Christ, Christina, are you
          going to spit it out?
          In his hand, the CELL PHONE RINGS. Colter's eyes light up in
          amazement -- the DISPLAY SCREEN is showing the name and
          number of the bomber. But before he can read what's there,
          Christina's voice finds its way to the back of his brain:

                         CHRISTINA
          According to the notice, you were
          killed in action two months ago.
          The world stops.
          A SEARING PAIN SLAMS INTO him. He drops the phone and
          doubles over. She runs to him --

          COLTER'S POV

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.
          Everything around him PIXELATES into a hundred thousand
          POINTS on an array. Christina's cries become bursts of
          static. Flying behind the array come LINES OF COMPUTER CODE -
          - the Source Code architecture laid bare.
          And then the screen itself seems to melt, giving way to a
          frightening series of HALLUCINATORY FRAGMENTS:

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          A PILOT'S P.O.V. -- desert sand, searingly bright -- flight
          deck instrumentation -- a windshield pockmarked with bullet
          holes -- the horizon tilting as the helicopter PLUNGES
          towards earth amid a chaos of RADIO TRANSMISSIONS:
          "...taking a lot of RPG fire... be advised A61 is going
          down... A61 is going down hard..."

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          Black smoke. Boots crunching on sand as we are borne,
          P.O.V., a victim on a jostling stretcher.

          INT. MEDIVAC HELICOPTER - DAY

          Airborne again. The thud of rotors. Through blurred vision
          we see medics working furiously to save a life.

          INT. C5 TRANSPORT JET - DAY

          The smooth, glassy calm of 30,000 feet. The regular
          pulsations of a VENTILATOR. Fluids drip down through an IV
          bag. Tubes and monitors stacked all around us. Gurneys of
          other wounded packed together. The grumble of another,
          unseen wounded soldier:

          SOLDIER (O.S.)
          Never any damn leg room on a plane.
          An ALARM begins beeping.

          FLIGHT MEDIC (O.S.)
          Hey, this guy's crashing...

          FADE TO BLACK.
          Silence and darkness. Nothingness.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          Then, a PLAYING CARD appears, as if through a slide
          projector. The Jack of Clubs.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Captain...?
          The playing card flickers, separates into pixels, then
          dissolves.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Captain, allow me to introduce
          myself. My name is Goodwin.
          You're with Beleaguered Castle.
          You are safe. All your needs will
          be met here.
          Lines of computer code flit across the screen. A blinking
          cursor.

          FADE TO BLACK.
          A tiny APERTURE opens... revealing CHRISTINA. And the
          bicycle. And the stone wall. The strange, recurring vision.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Captain?
          The sound drives away the image, replacing it with

          THE JACK OF CLUBS

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Captain, just tell me what you see.
          Just look and speak.
          Groggy breathing. A ragged voice:

          COLTER (V.O.)
          I see a card.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Very good. Very, very good.

          INT. ISOLATION UNIT

          On Colter's face. A deep, cold knot in his stomach.
          Shuddering in fear. The truth before him now. Crouching
          there, a nightmare, ruling over him.
          On the MONITOR, Goodwin looks into the camera. Assessing the
          situation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         GOODWIN
          Are you comfortable? Are you warm?
          Colter clings to his harness as if to keep from vanishing
          entirely from existence.

                         GOODWIN
          Do you need to urinate?
          Colter swallows. Too terrorized to speak.

                         GOODWIN
          Beleaguered Castle is waiting for
          your report.
          Goodwin taps his pen on his clipboard. Impatient. He flips
          a switch. A blocky COMPUTER VOICE, something out of the
          1970s, comes on:

          COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
          Hearing Test. First sequence.
          Left ear.
          A short SERIES of ELECTRONIC TONES.

          COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
          Hearing Test. First sequence.
          Right ear.
          The tones cease. Colter remains impassive and inert.

                         GOODWIN
          Captain, I know you can hear me.
          Did you find the bomber?
          Goodwin keys in some commands. Forever adjusting.

          COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
          Memory Thread One: "When Lily woke,
          she had the bed to herself. She
          sat up, bewildered by the
          strangeness of her surroundings;
          then memory returned, and she
          looked about her with a shiver."
          Goodwin stops the audio.

                         GOODWIN
          As you're collecting your thoughts,
          I should tell you there's been
          another development. A terrorist
          group has taken responsibility for
          bombing the train.

          70.

                         GOODWIN (CONT'D)
          This began broadcasting over the
          Internet a half hour. We've traced
          it to central Asia.

          ON THE MONITOR
          A grainy VIDEO shows an arid, wind-swept plateau of a far-
          away desert. It is twilight. A MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER, his face
          hidden by a hooded cloak, sits cross legged before a
          flickering camp fire and a tea service.
          The fighter rises, picks up a rocket-propelled grenade
          launcher, and approaches the camera. The wind whips his
          black robes. The figure looks slight. Almost spectral. It
          begins speaking to the camera.

                         MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER
          (on camera, in accented

                         ENGLISH)
          By now you have suffered a taste of
          divine vengeance. God willing, you
          will soon suffer another.
          Colter does not raise his head. No idea whether he's even
          listening.

                         MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER
          These attacks will show you that
          you will never be safe. You can
          secure your borders. But what can
          you do against one of your own
          citizens? One who looks like you,
          who is blameless, living already
          among you, who takes eighty million
          of our dollars, a trifle, and
          carries out our bidding? You
          cannot stop this. Time has run
          out.
          The image freezes. Then switches back to the live feed of
          Goodwin.

                         COLTER
          Let me talk to Rutledge.

                         GOODWIN
          So you've decided to speak.

                         COLTER
          Rutledge. Get him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         GOODWIN
          We appreciate your desire for
          further discussion. Perhaps at a
          later date.

                         COLTER
          Will you let me out of here?
          Goodwin ignore the question. Continues making notations.

                         GOODWIN
          Frankly, Captain, we're
          disappointed.

                         COLTER
          Find Rutledge! Now!

                         GOODWIN
          I have to say that we expected more
          from you.

                         COLTER
          Stop! Stop reading from your
          goddamn script!

                         GOODWIN
          Perhaps we overestimated your
          abilities.

                         COLTER
          I swear to fucking Christ!

                         GOODWIN
          Please accept the criticism in the
          spirit it was given. Perhaps a few
          memory exercises would help.

                         COLTER
          I don't need your criticism and I
          don't need your memory exercises,
          you gutless freak. And by the way,
          that bomb is detonated by a cell
          phone. When activated, the phone's
          display screen displays caller ID
          information. Caller ID. I wonder
          if that information would be useful
          to Beleaguered Castle.
          For a split second, Goodwin looks thrown. But the mask of
          the cold clinician goes back up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         GOODWIN
          Very well. We're ready for that
          information.

                         COLTER
          You'll have to send me back. I
          didn't get a good look at it. But
          I will next time.
          Goodwin hesitates. Skeptical.

                         GOODWIN
          What assurance do we have you'll be
          able to read the screen before the
          device detonates?

                         COLTER
          Goodwin, there's no time left.
          Send... me... back.
          Goodwin's pale, inscrutable face fills the monitor. His eyes
          are unblinking. Unfeeling. Nothing behind them.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Colter prowls the aisle feverishly. He scans the overhead
          luggage rack. Peeks inside a bag. Doesn't see what he
          wants. He looks all around... up the rows of passengers...
          intently scanning...
          There. The Computer Engineer. He's asleep. But clutched in
          his hand is what Colter wants -- a CELL PHONE.

          CLOSE ON - THE COMPUTER ENGINEER - MOMENTS LATER
          The train jolts slightly, waking him up. Looking down, the
          Computer Engineer notices that his cell phone has vanished.
          Across the aisle, a LATINA OFFICE MANAGER taps him on the
          arm. She gestures down the aisle to

                         COLTER
          Who's walking off with the guy's cell phone. Behind him, the
          Computer Engineer gets up.

                         COMPUTER ENGINEER
          Hey, do you have my phone?
          People turn to look. Among them is Christina. Colter just
          starts walking faster.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         COMPUTER ENGINEER

                         (UPSET)
          Dude, give me back my phone!

          INT. SECOND CAR - MORNING

          The Computer Engineer hurries in. Colter is nowhere in
          sight. He RUNS down the aisle and towards the next car.
          PAN OVER to the DOOR of the CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT as it

          CLICKS SHUT.

          INT. TRAIN CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT - MORNING

          Breathless, Colter has just finished shutting the door and is
          about to use the cell phone when sees
          THE CONDUCTOR and a TRAIN OFFICIAL
          Looking over at him in surprise.

                         COLTER
          Sorry. Wrong turn.
          Reversing gears, Colter backs out of the compartment.

          INT. SECOND CAR - MORNING

          Just as the befuddled Computer Engineer disappears into the
          third car, Colter steps back into the aisle and walks the
          other way.

          INT. FIRST CAR - MORNING

          Sweating a bit now, Colter is keying in a number on the cell
          phone as he walks.

          OPERATOR (V.O.)
          Operator. City and listing.

                         COLTER
          Las Vegas, Nevada. Nellis Air
          Force Base.

          OPERATOR (V.O.)
          Connecting you.
          A tingle up his spine. The call connects.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

          POST OPERATOR (V.O.)
          Post Operator.

                         COLTER
          Is this... Nellis Air Force Base?

          POST OPERATOR (V.O.)
          Yes, sir. How may I direct your
          call?
          He takes a deep breath.

                         COLTER
          I'm trying to reach... Captain
          Colter Stevens.
          Calling himself. Strange. No idea where this is going.

          POST OPERATOR (V.O.)
          I have no listing for a Captain
          Colter Stevens.

                         COLTER
          Then give me the Combined Air and
          Space Ops Center.

          POST OPERATOR (V.O.)
          One moment, sir.
          The call seems to take forever to connect. Then a terse
          military VOICE comes on the phone.

          VOICE (V.O.)
          C Deck.

                         COLTER
          Who is this?

          VOICE (V.O.)
          C Deck.

                         COLTER
          I'm calling for Rutledge. It's
          urgent.

          VOICE (V.O.)
          You have the wrong number.

                         COLTER
          This is Captain Colter Stevens.
          An eerie pause.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

          VOICE (V.O.)
          Would you repeat that?

                         COLTER
          Colter Stevens. Captain Colter
          Stevens.

          VOICE (V.O.)
          Hold the line.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Now approaching Newark Station.
          Newark Station, next stop.
          The train slows at it pulls into Newark Station.
          Another voice comes over the phone.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Captain? This is Goodwin.
          Colter's heart sinks.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Where are you, Captain?

                         COLTER
          Let me talk to Rutledge.

                         GOODWIN
          Where are you? How did you find
          us?

                         COLTER
          I'm on the train.
          The train pulls to a stop.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Newark Station.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          What train?

                         COLTER

                         (REALIZES)
          You don't know. It hasn't happened
          yet.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          What hasn't happened?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         COLTER
          The explosion.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          What explosion?

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          All aboard. Doors are closing.

                         COLTER
          Don't you understand? I'm in it,
          Goodwin. I'm calling you from
          inside the mission. Inside the
          Source Code.
          A beat of stunned silence. The train begins moving.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Next stop New York Penn Station.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          This contact is ill-advised. I
          must ask you to hang up.

                         COLTER
          Goodwin, I'm trapped in this and I
          can't get out.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          You have no authorization to be
          making this call. Goodbye.

                         COLTER
          No! Wait! Don't hang up! Forget
          authorization. There's no time.
          Soon you're going to find out what
          happened on this train. And then
          your own day is going to start.
          But not until then. Right now it's
          just you and me talking. And
          you're a different Goodwin than the
          one I'm going to go back to in a
          few minutes. You're separate from
          him. Separate worlds. Do you
          understand?

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          I think so.

                         COLTER
          Good. Now there's a lot of secrecy
          in all of this, and you have your
          reasons for that.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         COLTER (CONT'D)
          But here and now, just this once, I
          need to ask you something. And you
          need to tell me the truth.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          I'd rather you not ask me anything,
          Captain.

                         COLTER
          I'm going to ask it.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          I should terminate this call.

                         COLTER
          Jesus, Goodwin, how can I get
          through to you? You're not just a
          soldier. Somewhere inside you're a
          human being, too. Somewhere inside
          you've got to know that this is
          wrong. Source Code is wrong. And
          if you can't grasp that, if you
          just follow orders, then you're
          just as much a prisoner as I am.
          The car SHUDDERS as the EXPRESS TRAIN FLASHES BY. Quiet
          returns as it recedes.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          What's your question?
          Surprised, Colter raises his head. Draws a breath.

                         COLTER
          Did I survive that helicopter crash
          in Iraq?
          Silence. Colter shuts his eyes.

                         COLTER
          Answer me. Did I survive that
          crash?
          Another pause. This is crushing Colter.

                         COLTER
          Goodwin.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Not physically.

                         COLTER
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         GOODWIN
          You did not physically survive the
          crash.
          A terrible chill comes over Colter. He swallows. Trying to
          stay brave.

                         COLTER
          Not physically? Fuck. At least
          give me an answer I can understand.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          We've kept alive certain areas of
          your brain.

                         COLTER
          But... the capsule I'm in...

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          A manifestation. Your way of
          making sense of it.
          This is crushing. Colter fights back terror.

                         COLTER
          You had no right.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          As a soldier...

                         COLTER
          I was a soldier. Then. But now?

                         (WHISPERS)
          After death?

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          It was the only way. You couldn't
          have a body and be sent back into
          the Source Code.

                         (BEAT)
          What is the status of your mission?
          Is it a success?

                         COLTER
          You really want to know?

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          I suppose not. You're right to
          keep it from me.

                         COLTER
          That's what we do. Keep stuff from
          each other. Will this ever end?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          End?

                         COLTER
          How can I get out of this?

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          You must realizes the army's made
          an investment in you. You'll be
          used again.

                         COLTER
          How?

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Imagine a turntable. With a record
          spinning on it. All we do is lift
          up the needle. The music stops.

                         COLTER
          And then what?

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Then we wait. Until another
          mission. And the needle comes down
          again. You won't remember any of
          this. We'll start with the playing
          cards. Electronic tones. Simple
          memory exercises. Bit by bit,
          we'll revive your cerebral
          capacities once more.
          The barbarism of it. Digital slavery.

                         COLTER
          How many times have I done this?

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Does it matter?

                         COLTER
          No one knows I'm here. No one can
          help me.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          In stimulating your cortex, they're
          prolonging your life. Many
          soldiers would find that preferable
          to death.

                         COLTER
          You can't do this. I served my
          country. I already gave my life.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          The courts.

                         COLTER
          What?

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          The courts know you're here.

                         COLTER
          Military court or civilian court?

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Military.
          Colter finds no comfort in this.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          I'm sorry you found out about all
          of this. That wasn't our
          intention.

                         COLTER
          Does that make it any less wrong?
          No answer. Colter looks down at his watch. Time is running
          out. And there's absolutely nothing he can do.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          COLTER'S FACE
          Ashen. Almost lifeless. Around him is the darkened steel
          cocoon of the

          INT. ISOLATION UNIT

          Its appearance has altered slightly, given Colter's new
          awareness of what this really is. The capsule is even more
          claustrophobic. There are fewer controls. Even less light.
          A shadow world.
          The monitor is blank. He shouts from the void --

                         COLTER
          Goodwin?!
          Rutledge appears. Drops into the seat and puts on the
          headset. Fiddles with his pipe as a way to avoid looking at
          the camera.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         RUTLEDGE
          How's it going? Any breakthroughs?

                         COLTER
          I finally get it, Rutledge. You're
          the good guy, Goodwin's the bad
          guy. Working together, you get
          what you want out of me. Why
          didn't I see it before?

                         RUTLEDGE
          Believe me, Captain, I'm on your
          side.

                         COLTER
          Drop it. I know about the
          helicopter crash. I know what
          they've done with me.

                         RUTLEDGE

                         (STRUGGLING)
          Look, it's been a long day. For
          all of us. But now we've got to
          bring this home and catch a killer.

                         COLTER
          What's in it for me?

                         RUTLEDGE
          Come on. These guys are serious.
          Help me out. My ass is on the
          line, too, you know.

                         COLTER
          You can do better than that. They
          sent you here to offer me a deal.

                         RUTLEDGE
          If you think I'm enjoying this,
          you're wrong.

                         COLTER
          What's their offer? What can they
          possibly threaten me with after so
          colossally fucking me? Spit it
          out, you spineless turd.
          Rutledge's face goes red. Quite possibly no one has ever
          spoken to him like this before. After a sputtering pause,
          Rutledge's mouth hardens.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         RUTLEDGE
          The government can decide to take
          an interest in people. People like
          your father with his struggling
          farm. It can discover things like
          unpaid property taxes. It can call
          in his equipment loans or tie him
          down for years in environmental
          litigation. On the other hand, it
          can pay him handsomely for mineral
          deposits he never knew were there.
          As distant and problematic as your
          relationship was, surely you'd like
          the chance to do something for him.
          A beat of silent outrage from Colter.

                         COLTER
          Those after images I saw. You
          never knew about them. They
          weren't part of Source Code
          architecture, were they?

                         RUTLEDGE

                         (HASTILY)
          They're meaningless. Nerves
          firing. Brain chemistry.

                         COLTER
          You don't believe that. I've been
          to places you haven't. I've
          crossed and recrossed that line
          between living and dying. And when
          I do, that veil gets lifted for
          just a second. And what's there is
          real. Maybe it's a vision of the
          next world, but I can see it.

                         RUTLEDGE
          You can see it. But you can never
          get there without our help.

                         COLTER
          Get there? What do you mean?

                         RUTLEDGE
          Our offer. Maybe we can get you
          there. In return for your
          completing the mission.

                         (BEAT)
          They'll let you die. I'll shut off
          your life support and you'll simply
          slip away.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         RUTLEDGE (CONT'D)
          Just like the good Lord intended
          you to do a few months back.
          A fearful beat. Negotiating over his own soul.

                         COLTER
          You'd never do it. You wouldn't
          have to. You could just flip the
          switch and start me back up again
          unaware. For all I know, you've
          made this deal with me before.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Actually, we haven't. Your
          operational awareness has become
          too great. If you found out the
          truth about yourself once, you
          might do so again. As for Source
          Code, I'm sure we can find other
          servicemen coming back from
          overseas with wounds just like
          yours.

                         (PATRONIZING)
          Do you have the courage to serve
          your country one final time?
          Colter's eyes bore into Rutledge.

                         COLTER
          I'm going to find you, Rutledge.
          Someday. Somewhere.

                         RUTLEDGE
          (retreating from the

                         CONFRONTATION)
          The display screen on the detonator
          was a useful and exciting insight
          you made. This time, make it pay
          off. Get the information on the
          screen. But let the bomb explode.
          We need the force of the explosion
          to help integrate you quickly back
          into the present.
          The Source Code machinery is already beginning to HUM.
          Rutledge excitedly keying in system commands.

                         COLTER
          You hear me? Somehow, I'm going to
          find you.

                         RUTLEDGE
          I doubt that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          There's barely time for Colter to grab onto the harness
          restraints before the machinery goes into a deafening HOWL.

          THUNK.
          Colter's body convulses and goes limp. Unconscious, he sags
          in his seat, held in by the harness. Everything SWITCHES OFF

          AND GOES DARK.
          A split second later, the capsule comes back to life again.
          As if the plug were simply put back in.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Captain?
          Colter JOLTS AWAKE. Disoriented. Thrashing to get free.

                         RUTLEDGE
          It's okay. Calm yourself. You're
          back.
          Colter exhales. Shuddering. He's just completed another
          Source Code.

                         RUTLEDGE
          What happened?
          The tentacles of the nightmare slowly releasing. Replaced by
          the oppression of being back in the capsule. Back in
          Rutledge's power.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Was the bomber's identity on the
          cell phone?

                         COLTER
          I think so. But there wasn't time
          to read the screen. As soon as it
          rang the bomb went off.

                         RUTLEDGE

                         (IMPATIENT)
          What about the phone itself? Make,
          model, product identification
          number.

                         COLTER
          I was unable examine the phone
          without separating it from the
          detonator -- which I was instructed
          not to do.
          His delivery is different now. Impersonal. Distant.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Did you make any other progress?
          What in heck's name did you do for
          those seventeen minutes?
          Colter does not answer.
          The machinery again STARTS UP. Colter tenses, bewildered.
          Eyes dart accusingly to the screen.

                         COLTER
          Wait. What are you --

          THUNK.
          Again, he convulses and goes limp.
          Click. Darkness. Everything POWERS DOWN...
          ... And BACK UP again -- controls, monitor, machinery.
          Colter GROANS and opens his eyes. Gripped by another terror.
          Returning from yet another trip on the train. Another bomb
          blast. Death and resurrection. Rutledge looks in on him
          with impatience.

                         RUTLEDGE
          We can do this all day. Until you
          get it right.

                         COLTER
          Please... I don't feel good...

                         RUTLEDGE
          I don't doubt it. Who's the
          bomber?

                         COLTER
          I don't know... I honestly... I
          can't keep...
          The HUMMING again. He's helpless. An insect on a pin.
          Colter tears at his restraints, ready to bash his brains out
          against the controls. He SCREAMS...

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          ... and, in sudden freedom, surges up out of his seat with a
          cry. Around him startled passengers look over in confusion.

                         CHRISTINA
          Hey!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          Colter, back in his navy jacket, slacks and shirt, has
          pitched forward into Christina.

                         CHRISTINA
          You want to get off me?
          The Overweight Man, wide eyed in surprise, has his finger
          poised to open his can of soda.

                         COLTER
          Go ahead! Open your fucking soda!
          CHK-THOCK! The Overweight Man complies. Some half-muttered
          reproaches, then most people go back to what they were doing.

                         CHRISTINA
          What's wrong with you, anyway?
          She glares at him at he stands up. He can't respond.
          Despair surges through him. He stumbles off down the aisle.
          But where can he go? There is no freedom. No escape.
          Imprisoned in both worlds.
          From her seat, Christina watches him go. Sensing the torment
          in him.

                         EXIT AREA
          Colter is slumped in a corner. Christina appears. Taps him
          on the shoulder.

                         CHRISTINA
          You okay?
          He eyes her furtively. Like a cave man who's never seen
          another human being before.

                         CHRISTINA
          You're not okay.
          He's ghastly pale. He's sweating profusely.

                         COLTER
          Ma'am, please... return to your
          seat.
          Footsteps. The sound of jangling KEYS.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Ticket.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          The conductor takes up position in front of him. As
          implacable as Rutledge, in his way.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Ticket, please.

                         CHRISTINA
          He's not feeling well.

                         CONDUCTOR
          He still needs a ticket.
          Colter makes no move to respond. No more concern for
          anything.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Have it your way, pal.
          He takes out his book to write Colter up.

                         CHRISTINA
          Wait. I'll pay it.

                         CONDUCTOR
          I have no idea where he got on.
          Full fare's $22.50.

                         CHRISTINA
          All right, all right.
          Getting out her wallet, she pays the conductor. He eyes her
          with disapproval, then shambles off.

                         CHRISTINA
          I see customer service is alive and
          well on New Jersey Transit.

                         COLTER
          Why did you just do that?

                         CHRISTINA
          The ticket? I don't know. You
          looked a little lost.
          The gratitude in his look makes her self conscious. She
          turns to go.

                         COLTER
          Will you do me a favor?

                         CHRISTINA
          What's that?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         COLTER
          Get off the train.

                         CHRISTINA
          What?

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Now approaching Newark Station.
          Newark Station, next stop.

                         COLTER
          Please. Just get off the train.
          Her puzzled look. The train begins to SLOW DOWN.

                         CHRISTINA
          This isn't my stop.

                         COLTER
          You shouldn't have been on this
          train, Christina. You should be
          living another life. Not spending
          it answering phones for lawyers.

                         CHRISTINA
          How do you...?
          A group of passengers approaches the exit area. We've seen
          them all before: Derek, the Old Man, the College Kid. And
          the small encounters: shuffling around, positioning at the
          doors, and the College Kid tapping Derek on the arm, holding
          out Derek's wallet.

                         COLLEGE STUDENT
          Hey, you dropped this.

                         DEREK
          (relieved, takes it back)
          Wow. Thanks.
          The train stops. The doors OPEN.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Newark Station.
          Derek, the Old Man and the College Kid get off. A second
          later, Guzman bursts past them, making his nauseated run for
          the station.
          Leaving just Colter and Christina there. The doors stand
          open, invitingly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         COLTER
          Everyone has a destiny. And this
          isn't yours.
          He steps out onto the platform. Holds out his hand for her
          to join him. A coaxing look.
          She's incredulous. This guy. His words. This whole moment.

                         CHRISTINA
          Who in the world are you?

                         COLTER
          Just do it. Stop being afraid.
          Believe in yourself.
          He waits for her. Only two steps away.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          All aboard. Doors are closing.
          She blinks. The spell breaks. Those two steps prove to be
          two much.

                         CHRISTINA
          Leave me alone.
          She retreats back into the car. Colter is heartbroken.
          About to pursue her, he happens to look over and see

                         DEREK
          Instead of going directly to the station house, Derek
          continues walking down the platform alongside the train, as
          if intending to reboard further down.
          And then it happens.
          With a quick motion Derek TOSSES SOMETHING through an open
          door of another car, then heads quickly away towards the
          station house.
          With no time to think, Colter slips back on board just as the
          doors slide shut.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          The train begins moving. Christina is nowhere in sight.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          This is a New York bound train.
          Next stop New York - Penn Station.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.
          Intrigued, Colter leaves the exit door area...

          INT. SECOND CAR - MORNING

          ... Strides down the aisle of the second car... and reaches
          the next set of

                         EXIT DOORS
          There's nothing there. Whatever Derek tossed inside is gone.
          Did someone pick it up? Colter looks up the aisle and then
          the other way into the next car. No one there.
          Once more he examines the exit area. Gets down on his knees.
          Then he spots it -- an OPENING between the floor and one of
          the wall panels, only a few inches high.
          And there something lies. Colter slides it out.
          Derek's WALLET. Intentionally left here. The same wallet
          the College Kid gave back to Derek earlier.
          Opening it, Colter pulls out Derek's DRIVER'S LICENSE.

          INT. ISOLATION UNIT

          The Source Code has finished. The monitor shows just the
          empty chair. Finally Rutledge returns to his seat.

                         RUTLEDGE
          They've searched the wreckage and
          found the wallet. It was under the
          wall panel. Just as you said.
          An awkward dynamic between them. They despise each other but
          have to work together.

                         COLTER
          Believe me, he's our guy. He
          tossed his own wallet back on the
          train. Only reason he'd do that...

                         RUTLEDGE
          (finishing his thought)
          ...is if he wanted us to think he
          died in the explosion. I know.

                         (BEAT)
          We looked into his profile.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         RUTLEDGE (CONT'D)
          Derek Frost is a commodities
          trader, with a wife, two children
          and a promotion one month old.
          He's an emergency preparedness
          volunteer on his office floor, for
          God's sake.

                         COLTER
          You saw that terrorist video --
          they said it was one of us. One of
          our own.

                         RUTLEDGE
          If he's really the one, you can
          find out the rest of his plan.

                         COLTER
          How?

                         RUTLEDGE
          By any means necessary. There is
          no Geneva Convention in the Source
          Code.

                         COLTER
          Torture him, you mean.

                         RUTLEDGE

                         (SHRUGS)
          Find out the plan, before it
          happens here. And then I'll let
          you die.
          Their grisly bargain.

                         RUTLEDGE
          In the conductor's compartment
          there's a fully loaded 9 millimeter
          handgun locked in a safe. Think
          you can remember the combination?

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Christina is absorbed in her sketch book. Across from her,
          Colter watches. A stranger to her again. It hurts too much.
          She feels his eyes on her. When she looks up, he's gone.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          As Guzman exits the bathroom, he almost crashes into Colter,
          who's waiting right there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         GUZMAN
          Excuse me.

                         COLTER
          Assalam'alaikoom.
          Squeezing past, Guzman does a double take to hear the
          standard Arabic reply.

          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING

          Reaching into the overhead crawl space, Colter once again
          unhooks the cell phone detonator from the bomb.
          Sitting down on the toilet seat, he dials 4-1-1 on the cell
          phone.

          OPERATOR (V.O.)
          What listing?

                         COLTER
          The New York Times.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Christina's CELL PHONE RINGS. She gets it out.

                         CHRISTINA
          Hello?

          STEPHANIE (V.O.)
          Christina? It's Stephanie. Where
          are you right now?

                         CHRISTINA
          Going to work. Why?

          STEPHANIE (V.O.)
          The strangest thing. The phone
          rang at my desk and some guy I
          don't know said the train you're on
          isn't safe and that you should get
          off at the next stop. Then he hung
          up.

                         CHRISTINA
          What?
          The train begins to SLOW DOWN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Now approaching Newark Station.
          Newark Station, next stop.

                         CHRISTINA
          I don't understand.

          STEPHANIE (V.O.)
          Maybe you should get off. Are you
          okay?
          The station platform slides into view.

                         CHRISTINA
          I'm fine. Everything's normal. Is
          there something on the news? Some
          kind of alert?

          STEPHANIE (V.O.)
          Nothing that I've heard.

          EXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING

          The train pulls to a stop. Passengers begin to get off.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Newark Station.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Christina is out of her seat, debating.

          STEPHANIE (V.O.)
          I think you should get off.

                         CHRISTINA
          I'll be late for work.

          STEPHANIE (V.O.)
          The hell with work, Christina! You
          hate that job anyway.

                         CHRISTINA
          It's probably a joke. A weirdo guy
          from somewhere.
          She sees Colter down in the exit area. They lock eyes.
          And somehow she knows. He made the call. Colter quickly
          disappears into the other car.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          INT. SECOND CAR - MORNING

          The doors stand open to the platform. Just then Derek's
          WALLET goes skidding back on board, disappearing under the
          wall panel. A second later, Colter reaches the exit area.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          All aboard. Doors are closing.

          EXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING

          The train doors shut. Colter is now out on the platform.
          Christina is not there. Concerned, walking quickly forward,
          Colter looks through the windows...
          And finds her staring back at him. Still on the train. A
          strange moment between the two of them.
          Once again he's failed to save her.
          They watch each other for as long as possible, until the
          train pulls away.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          As the train SPEEDS UP, Christina sits down again, lowering
          her phone.

          STEPHANIE (V.O.)
          Did you get off...?

                         CHRISTINA
          No. I'll call you back.
          She hangs up. Disturbed. As if she's failed some test.
          But what test? Why this weird feeling?

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          This is a New York bound train.
          Next stop New York - Penn Station.
          The train SPEEDS UP. Anxiety creeps into her face. Looking
          around, the tranquility of the passengers begins to seem
          ominous, hinting that she's made the wrong choice.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

          INT. TRAIN CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT - MORNING

          The conductor enters. About to pour himself a cup of coffee

                         WHEN --

                         CONDUCTOR
          Huh?
          The metal door to THE SAFE has been OPENED.

          INT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING

          Inside the quiet lobby, Derek is heading for the outer doors
          to the parking lot, when:

          COLTER (O.S.)
          Derek Frost.
          Colter is walking towards him, holding up Derek's WALLET.

                         COLTER
          You forget something?

                         DEREK
          Gosh. Is that my wallet?
          As he goes to take it, Colter GRABS HIM.

          INT. NEWARK STATION - MEN'S ROOM - MORNING

          Behind the closed door at the end stall comes the sound of

          GUZMAN VOMITING.
          BANG - The men's room DOOR flies open -- Colter DRAGS Derek
          inside.

                         DEREK
          What the hell, man? What the
          hell???

                         COLTER
          You see this?
          Colter pulls out the DETONATOR CELL PHONE -- the one he took
          off the bomb. Holds it inches from Derek's face.

                         COLTER
          Now you can't blow it up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

                         DEREK
          What is this? Get away from me!
          The BARREL of a 9 MM PISTOL. Aimed right at him.

                         COLTER
          Believe me, I'm very accurate with
          one of these things.

                         DEREK
          Jesus.
          Derek raises his hands. Sweating. All fright. Like a
          decent man, terrorized.
          It gives Colter pause. Does he have the right guy?
          A toilet FLUSHES. The last stall door opens and Guzman
          emerges. Stops cold as Colter swings the pistol at him.

                         COLTER
          Stay there, my man.

                         DEREK
          Don't hurt me.

                         COLTER
          Stop acting, for Chrissakes.

                         DEREK
          Keep my wallet. Take my watch.
          Take anything you want.
          Unprompted, Guzman takes out his own wallet and sets it on
          the counter. Calmer than Derek. Accustomed to trouble.

                         GUZMAN
          There. Now you have two wallets.
          Take them and go.

                         COLTER
          Shut up!
          Tensing. This isn't supposed to happen like this.

                         DEREK
          Please. I have a family.

                         COLTER
          What about those other passengers?
          Don't you think they had families?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         GUZMAN
          Just what is this about?

                         COLTER
          This man's a terrorist. He planted
          a bomb on the train.

                         DEREK

                         (HALF LAUGHS)
          What?
          Click. Colter pulls back the hammer and savagely JAMS the
          barrel of the pistol into Derek's cheek.

                         COLTER
          What's the next attack? Who else
          are you going to kill today, huh?

                         DEREK

                         (IN TEARS)
          Oh God... Oh God...
          Guzman takes a step towards Colter.

                         COLTER
          One more step, asshole.

                         GUZMAN
          Don't treat him like this. He's
          not an animal. Neither are you.

                         DEREK
          Listen to him. For God's sake I'm
          not a terrorist...!
          A URINE STAIN spreads on Derek's pants. He looks down,
          ashamed. Colter keeps the gun on him.

                         COLTER
          Piss all you want. You took eighty
          million dollars to kill hundreds of
          people today.

                         DEREK
          Eighty million dollars? I swear to
          you...

                         COLTER
          Then what about the wallet, huh?
          Why the fuck did you twice try to
          leave your wallet on board?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         DEREK

          I... I...

                         COLTER
          Time's up! What is it?! What is
          the next attack! So help me, I'll
          put this bullet through your brain.

                         DEREK
          I don't know what you're talking
          about!

                         COLTER
          I'm going to do it.
          Tightening his finger around the trigger. Tears are
          streaming down Derek's face. But he's not going to talk.

                         DEREK
          I would never hurt anyone. I have
          a family. I guess you'll have to
          kill me.
          But Colter can't. He can't shoot him. He lowers the gun.
          Disgusted with himself. Why can't he do it?

                         GUZMAN
          You see? You are a human being.
          Speaking gently. Trying to calm him. Even as Colter feels
          like he's failed.

                         GUZMAN
          This can be worked out. We can
          listen to each other.
          The temperature cooling. Derek's nodding with him.

                         DEREK
          Anything you want... Please...
          The detonator CELL PHONE RINGS, startling all of them.
          Confused, he answers the phone.

                         COLTER
          Hello.

          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
          Who is this?

                         COLTER

                         (STUNNED)
          Christina?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
          Are you the guy who was sitting
          across me on the train?
           Colter looks at his watch. The countdown passes THREE

          MINUTES. 2:59... 2:58...

                         COLTER
          How can you be calling this number?

          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
          My friend had it. From when you
          called her -- to try and get me off
          the train. Who are you? What do
          you want?
          Derek and Guzman cautiously lower their hands. Watching in
          confusion.

                         COLTER
          I was trying to warn you.

          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
          About what?

                         COLTER
          I'm not sure that it matters now.

          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
          Talk to me. I feel that something
          terrible's going to happen. Do I
          need to get off the train? Am I
          going to die?
          He can hear the b.g. noise of the train on the other end.

                         COLTER
          I'm right here, okay? Don't be
          afraid.

                         CHRISTINA

                         (ANGUISH)
          Why didn't I get off the train?

                         (SIGHS)
          I knew I should have driven in
          today. But then there's the
          bridges, right? You never know
          when they'll be jammed.
          That stirs something in the back of Colter's mind.

                         COLTER
          What did you say?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         CHRISTINA
          The bridges. You just never know
          when they'll be jammed.
          His heart starts racing.

                         FLASHBACK
          On the train. Earlier. Derek in his seat, on his cell
          phone. Colter nearby, overhearing him:

                         DEREK
          Trust me, by one o'clock, the
          bridge is going to be jammed...

          BACK TO SCENE
          Colter looks to Derek. His stomach sinks.

                         COLTER
          "By one o'clock, the bridge is
          going to be jammed." That's what
          you said. You knew. You knew
          there was going to be an
          evacuation. You knew before it
          happened. All those people walking
          across the...
          The realization hits.

                         COLTER
          They're going to bomb the bridges.
          While they're full of people.

                         ON DEREK
          A slight flicker travels across Derek's face. Like a
          disturbance on a surface of deep water.

          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
          What are you talking about. Who's
          going to --
          Over the phone comes the HORN from the passing FREIGHT TRAIN.
          Colter presses the phone to his ear, trying to hear her.

                         COLTER
          Christina? Just hang in there.
          You'll be okay.
          A HAND closes over his gun. Before Colter can react, Derek

          TURNS THE GUN BACK INTO HIM --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

          BLAM! BLAM!

          DEREK SHOOTS COLTER TWICE IN THE CHEST.
          Colter staggers back -- slumps to his knees. Guzman cries
          out -- makes a run at Derek -- who spins and --

          BLAM!

          SHOOTS GUZMAN DEAD.
          Spent shell casings roll to a stop on the tile floor. A
          terrible silence.

          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
          What's happening? Are you okay?
          Are you there?
          Derek picks up the phone and terminates the call. He coldly
          evaluates the two men dying in pools of blood. Then calmly
          walks out.
          As the life slips from Colter's eyes, he manages to focus on
          his beeping WATCH --
          Where the seventeen minutes have RUN OUT. And the world

          BLEACHES WHITE...
          In the haze comes the mystical vision again -- but deeper in:
          THE STONE WALL now curves over our heads, becoming a TUNNEL.
          CHRISTINA walks away from us -- down into the tunnel. The
          far end is ablaze in WHITE LIGHT.
          We try calling to her. But our voice is weak and faint. She
          continues towards the light... and we do not follow.

          INT. ISOLATION UNIT

          The monitor is dark. Everything is still. Colter in his
          seat. For long seconds we watch his face.

          INT. ENGINEERING LAB - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

          A jarring transition. We are now away from Colter's P.O.V.
          and in the real, physical environment of the Source Code
          operations center. Military and civilian personnel work amid
          mysterious scientific equipment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          Rutledge talks on a wall phone. Like a team player serving
          his country.

                         RUTLEDGE

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Yes... We appreciate that... I just
          hope the information has come in
          time to clear the bridges... Thank
          you, sir.
          When he hangs up, he turns to Goodwin and a few other
          TECHNICIANS. Naked ambition courses through him.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Whether or not they can stop the
          bridge attack, we came up with the
          intelligence. And that virtually
          assures all of our futures. This
          is just the beginning, guys.

                         (TO GOODWIN)
          You did a great job, Goodwin. You
          operated our captain with skill and
          professionalism. What's that you
          have?
          Goodwin opens an envelope and slides out a CITATION.

                         GOODWIN
          The Army investigated Colter's
          helicopter crash in Iraq.
          Apparently he stayed behind to fly
          protective cover for a disabled
          convoy until he ran out of fuel.

                         RUTLEDGE
          What's this, then? Some kind of
          posthumous reprimand for reckless
          flying?

                         GOODWIN
          No. It's the Silver Star.
          Something in Goodwin's voice momentarily checks Rutledge's
          breezy good humor.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Send it on to his father. It'll
          ease the pain of his son's death.

                         GOODWIN
          I thought I might inform the
          captain of the citation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Better not. We can't risk
          acquainting him with the citation
          in case the memory wipe isn't
          entirely clean.

                         GOODWIN
          The memory wipe?

                         TECHNICIAN
          I thought we were going to let him
          die.

                         RUTLEDGE
          I know, I know. But now the
          Director of National Intelligence
          is sure to want a closer look at
          our program, and until we train up
          another candidate, we'll need to
          keep Colter around to demonstrate
          it.

                         TECHNICIAN
          Oh.

                         RUTLEDGE
          This thing is much bigger than any
          one of us. Goodwin, please clear
          Colter's memories and re-initialize
          Source Code.
          Rutledge walks away. The technician gives Goodwin a look of
          disgust. Goodwin carefully replaces the citation into the
          envelope.

          INT. CONTROL CONSOLE - DAY

          Mission Control. Panels, consoles and screens. Goodwin
          takes a seat at his workstation. He swings a microphone up
          and goes to flip a switch.
          Then stops. Unsure how to proceed. Looks down at the
          envelope with the citation in it.

          INT. ISOLATION UNIT

          Inside the capsule, the silence continues. Colter thinks to
          himself. The MONITOR then comes on.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

                         GOODWIN
          Captain, this is Beleaguered
          Castle. Acknowledge transmission.

          INT. CORRIDOR - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

          Rutledge walks by himself. Reflecting. Pleased with
          himself. Under his breath, he acknowledges the praises he's
          imagining in his head:

                         RUTLEDGE
          Thank you, sir... I appreciate your
          faith in me... It's a great day for
          our country.

          INT. ISOLATION UNIT

          Colter looks out at Goodwin. A beat of difficult silence.

                         GOODWIN
          How are you feeling? Are you
          comfortable?

                         COLTER
          Just do it.

                         GOODWIN
          Come again?

                         COLTER
          Just do it. I knew they wouldn't
          let me die. At least you can make
          me forget all of this. I hope.
          Goodwin stares at his hands. Unmoving.

                         COLTER
          What are you waiting for? You're
          just doing your job. I'd do the
          same thing if I was you. At least
          you've got a shot at saving those
          people on the bridges.

                         GOODWIN
          I doubt it.

                         COLTER
          You don't think they'll save them?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

                         GOODWIN
          No. I meant, I doubt you'd be
          doing this, if you were me.
          An unusually personal statement, coming from Goodwin.

                         COLTER
          Look, someone had to be where
          you're sitting, and someone had to
          be in here. Turned out it was you
          and me.

                         (THEN)
          Just do it. I'm tired.

                         GOODWIN
          Would you like to see Christina
          again? One last time?
          Colter's not sure he heard him right.

                         COLTER
          I don't understand.

                         GOODWIN
          Seventeen minutes. That's all I
          could give you. No mission to
          fulfill. Just... the two of you.

                         COLTER

                         (STUNNED)
          Why would you do that?

                         GOODWIN
          As a favor. One prisoner to
          another.

                         COLTER
          Prisoner?

                         GOODWIN
          You were right. About me. And
          about Source Code. We've kept too
          much from each other.
          An odd sensation comes over Colter.

                         GOODWIN
          I usually report in at 0600. Today
          I was there early. I was there
          when the call came in. Your call.
          His call? They share a long look.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         COLTER
          No... There's no way... There's no
          way you could have...
          Goodwin just smiles.

                         COLTER

                         (PROTESTING)
          How? The Source Code was a
          parallel world! You told me so!
          It's hermetically sealed. Nothing
          I did on that train would have any
          effect on this reality!

                         GOODWIN
          You were on the train. I was not.

                         COLTER
          But...

                         GOODWIN
          We didn't know if any bleed-
          throughs could occur. The
          implications would be staggering.
          That's why you were told to avoid
          unduly influencing events.

                         COLTER
          You're saying I could have saved
          those people?!

                         GOODWIN
          No. Not in our world. The time
          currents are too strong. But minor
          alterations, here and there, a
          phone call, say, those might slip
          through. We didn't know for sure.
          But you proved it.
          Colter is thunderstruck. Unable to grasp it.

                         GOODWIN
          I've been thinking about the things
          you said on that call. As the day
          passed, the more I understood them.
          And now, I guess we've caught up to
          each other.

                         COLTER
          Man. Just when I think I
          understand this...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         GOODWIN

                         (NERVOUS)
          There's not much time. They think
          I'm re-initializing the system.
          One last look at her. That's all I
          can give you. If that.

                         COLTER
          They'll nail your ass for this.

                         GOODWIN
          If I had any feelings, I'd worry
          about that. But, as you've
          maintained, I do not.
          The strange path of their relationship. Ending at last at
          simple, grudging respect.

                         COLTER
          Roger that.

          MACHINERY BEGINS TO HUM.

                         GOODWIN
          This is Beleaguered Castle signing
          off. Acknowledge final
          transmission.

                         COLTER
          Final transmission acknowledged.

                         (BEAT)
          Thank you, Goodwin.
          Goodwin interrupts his preparation for a last look at Colter.
          The noise gets louder. The capsule begins to shake.
          Colter touches the monitor. His fingers imparting to the
          last image of his world a quiet benediction.

          INT. CORRIDOR - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

          Sipping a cup of coffee, Rutledge lingers at a window,
          contemplating his future.

          INTERCOM (V.O.)
          Dr. Rutledge, extension 16.
          Blinking out of reverie, he goes over to a wall phone and
          punches an extension.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         RUTLEDGE
          This is Rutledge.
          He listens. His face darkens.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Shit.
          He SLAMS down the phone and starts RUNNING.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Colter is back on the train. It is morning again, seventeen
          minutes before the destruction. He's back in the navy
          blazer. The slacks. The commuters, caught up in their
          individual concerns, ignore Colter. But he looks on them
          with an appreciation approaching joy.
          For a moment he just sits there. Simply being alive in this
          world. Attuned to the motion of the train. The sun on his
          face. And across from him, oblivious, working away on her
          sketch pad, is Christina.
          The best sight of all.

          INT. ENGINEERING LAB - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

          Banks of MACHINERY are RUNNING. Rutledge comes charging in.
          Flustered. Barking questions.

                         RUTLEDGE
          What is this? Who authorized this?

                         TECHNICIAN
          We don't know, sir. But Source
          Code is up and running again.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Where's Goodwin?
          The chair at the console is EMPTY.

                         TECHNICIAN
          No idea, sir.
          A DIGITAL CLOCK ticks down from 17 minutes: 15:28... 15:27...

          15:26...

                         RUTLEDGE
          What the hell is he doing?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Colter drinks in the sight of Christina. Finally he gets up
          and walks off down the aisle.
          As soon as he's gone, Christina looks up. She's observed his
          interest in her. Doesn't quite know what to make of it.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Colter is by himself in the exit door area. From his jacket
          he takes out a CELL PHONE.

          CLOSE ON -- THE CELL PHONE SCREEN
          As he dials 9-1-1. The call connecting...

          OPERATOR (V.O.)
          9-1-1. What is the nature of your
          emergency?

          INT. CONTROL CONSOLE - DAY

          Rutledge watches the computers churn.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Shut it down.

                         TECHNICIAN
          Sir?

                         RUTLEDGE
          Shut down the Source Code. Right
          now.
          The technician hesitates.

          RUTLEDGE (CONT'D)
          Fine. I'll do it myself.
          Rutledge sits down at the controls.

                         TECHNICIAN
          I wouldn't do that.
          Rutledge gives a dismissive snort. And yet he pauses.

                         RUTLEDGE
          And why not?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         TECHNICIAN
          We've never interrupted Source Code
          in mid run. We'd have to literally
          pull the plug. It could damage the
          processors.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Let it finish, then. No harm in
          that, I guess.

                         (OMINOUS)
          All of you are in deep shit, I
          promise you. As for Goodwin, he'll
          never make it off this base.
          Rutledge picks up a phone.

                         TECHNICIAN
          I don't think that's where he's
          headed.
          Rutledge considers. And then catches on.

                         RUTLEDGE
          He wouldn't.
          Looks up at the technician. Grows more and more uneasy.
          Snapping his attention back to

          THE COUNTDOWN CLOCK
          Which reads: 12:42. Before it hits 12:41, Rutledge is
          already out of his chair and RUNNING for the door.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Seal the ICU. I want a detachment
          of MPs meeting me on the way there.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Colter walks down the aisle. Looks at HIS WATCH -- 12
          minutes, 40 seconds. The train begins to SLOW DOWN.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Now approaching Newark Station.
          Newark Station, next stop.
          The Computer Engineer begins to wake up. As he does, Colter
          passes by, deftly slipping the borrowed cell phone back into
          the engineer's hand without being noticed.
          Derek packs up his things. We see him hide his wallet into a
          gap in the seat cushions and get up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          111.
          The College Kid, also getting up, notices Derek's wallet,
          picks it up and hurries after him.

                         COLLEGE STUDENT
          Hey, you dropped this.

                         DEREK
          Wow. Thanks.
          Keeping his composure, Derek accepts the wallet.
          Colter steps aside, allowing them to pass. Allowing it all
          to happen.
          The station slides into view. No one on the platform.

          INT. STAIRWELL - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

          Rutledge furiously descends, shoving people out of his way.

          INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

          Rutledge runs up to a locked door and swipes his access card
          through the scanner. It comes up RED.

                         RUTLEDGE
          What?!
          He tries again. Red. The door stays LOCKED.

          EXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING

          The train comes to a halt. Unlike before, the doors stay
          shut for SEVERAL SECONDS LONGER than usual. Derek waits
          quietly at the doors.
          Finally they open. Derek steps out onto the platform,
          together with the Old Man, the College Kid and Guzman.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Newark Station.
          Colter remains on board, standing in the exit area, watching.
          As usual, Derek quickly flips his wallet onto the next car
          and starts toward the station house. Guzman is ahead of him,
          already pushing open the doors to the station.
          All is quiet. Perhaps too quiet. Derek approaches the
          station and sees

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

          THROUGH THE OPEN DOORS
          In station lobby are POLICE OFFICERS.
          Derek's jaw tightens. He changes course, heading instead for
          an outdoor stairwell.
          Coming UP the stairs, however, are more POLICE OFFICERS.
          Wheeling around, Derek heads the other way. Walking faster,
          but keeping his head. Not running, not panicking.
          The train, oddly, is still sitting there.
          As he nears the other end of the platform, MORE OFFICERS
          appear from behind columns, cutting off his escape. The
          police are coming from all sides, converging on the platform.
          Yet no one panics. No one runs. Finally --

                         POLICE COMMANDER

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Derek Frost.
          Derek goes to get back on the train. The doors, however,
          SLIDE SHUT in his face. Through the closed doors, Derek
          looks in at Colter, still on the train. They stare at one
          another through the window.

                         POLICE COMMANDER
          Mr. Frost. Please turn to face us.
          An entire PHALANX OF POLICE OFFICERS is on the platform.

                         DEREK
          Of course. What's this about?
          Unseen by the officers, Derek has taken out his CELL PHONE
          and is DIALING IT as he turns around.
          The police approach, cautiously.

                         POLICE COMMANDER
          Place your hands in the air.

                         DEREK
          My pleasure.
          Raising his hands, he pushes SEND on his phone.
          On board the train there's a RINGING.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          The DETONATOR PHONE has been removed from the bomb and now
          rings harmlessly in the hand of the train's SECURITY OFFICER.
          The restroom door is open and swarming with conductors
          examining the bomb.
          On the platform, the officers tackle Derek, subduing him.
          Passengers watch at the windows, mesmerized.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Once again, please return to your
          seats, ladies and gentlemen.
          No way. No one's moving from the windows.
          Except for Colter, who stands off by himself. The first look
          of satisfaction we've ever seen on his face.

          INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

          An ALARM is going off. At a locked door, an Air Force
          LOCKSMITH is in the process of disabling the key pad.
          Rutledge paces, livid.

                         RUTLEDGE
          I want to know who reprogrammed
          this lock. And if you don't get
          this open in ten seconds I'll see
          that you're busted back down to
          private.

                         LOCKSMITH
          I'm already a private, sir.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Just open it! A man's life is at
          stake.
          The key pad goes GREEN and the pressure lock releases.
          Rutledge tears open the door.

          INT. STAIRWELL - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

          Armed MILITARY POLICE clatter down the steps.

          INT. BUNKER MEDICAL FACILITY - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

          Goodwin enters. He locks another door behind him. He is
          shaken but nevertheless going forward. In the chamber, three
          MEDICS monitor gauges and screens. One of them stands up to
          block his way.

                         MEDIC #1
          Sorry, I can't let you pass.
          Goodwin removes the patch on his uniform to reveal the
          insignia of a major.

                         GOODWIN
          Step aside. That's an order.

                         MEDIC #1
          We all know your rank, Goodwin, but
          I have explicit orders from
          Rutledge not to --
          BAM! Goodwin drops the Medic with a splintering HEADBUTT.

                         GOODWIN
          I'm glad you know my rank. Were
          you also aware I'm in the Special
          Forces?

          EXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING

          The train has been evacuated as police investigators search
          the rest of the cars. Hoards of passengers fill the platform
          as conductors try to herd them towards the station.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Ladies and gentlemen, rail service
          has been cancelled. Please clear
          the platform and proceed into the
          station. New Jersey Transit
          apologizes for the inconvenience.

          EXT. NEWARK STATION - PARKING LOT - MORNING

          Police cars parked everywhere. Two DETECTIVES are
          questioning the Computer Engineer.

                         DETECTIVE
          So you have no idea how your cell
          phone was used to call in the tip?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.

                         COMPUTER ENGINEER
          No!
          People mill about waiting for the buses, groaning and
          complaining. Christina accosts a passing transit employee.

                         CHRISTINA
          What now? How do we get to work?
          You guys have some busses or
          something?
          The transit employee ignores her and walks away.

                         CHRISTINA
          Hey! I'm talking to you!
          She stands there in exasperation. This whole thing has been
          designed to thwart her. Nearby, Colter sits on a bench.

                         COLTER
          Ain't life grand?
          Looking over, she notices him.

                         CHRISTINA
          Yeah. Now I'm going get fired for
          being late.

                         COLTER
          Maybe that's a good thing.
          She gives him a sharp look.

          INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

          Rutledge runs, now leading the detachment of MPs.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Shoot him if you have to, you hear
          me?
          The MPs exchange a look of annoyance at being ordered around
          by this guy.

          INT. BUNKER MEDICAL FACILITY - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

          A heavy INNER DOOR has been opened.

          INT. BUNKER ICU - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

          The BEEPING of life support systems. The compressions of a
          ventilator. Goodwin approaches a GURNEY. A jungle of tubes
          and lines lead from the gurney into advanced machinery. A
          somber look on his face.

                         GOODWIN
          Hello, Captain.
          As Goodwin edges forward, we reveal the bare foot of someone
          lying there.
          A DIGITAL TIMER reads 1 MINUTE.

          INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

          At the facility's outer door, the locksmith goes to work on
          another panel as Rutledge and the MPs stand by.

                         LOCKSMITH
          Give me twenty seconds.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Make it ten.
          Rutledge looks at HIS WATCH. It reads 52 SECONDS.

          EXT. NEWARK STATION - PARKING LOT - MORNING


          CLOSE ON - COLTER'S WATCH
          It also reads 52 seconds.
          His work is done. He's saved her. Saved them all. At least
          this one time.
          Only she doesn't know that. Christina stands there, arms
          crossed, scowling at the parking lot.

                         CHRISTINA
          Could this day get any worse?

                         COLTER
          That train was taking you to a
          place you didn't want to be. But
          then you got off. And maybe that's
          a sign.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          117.

                         CHRISTINA
          Yeah. If only.
          She takes out her cell phone. The stress of her day.

                         CHRISTINA
          I'm calling a cab. Maybe I'll only
          be somewhat late for work.
          Colter watches her, a quiet ache inside. Maybe some people
          don't want to be saved.

          INT. BUNKER ICU - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

          The noise from the outer door grows louder. The MPs are only
          seconds from getting inside. Goodman moves towards the life
          support equipment.
          As he does, we glimpse a horrifying sight: the upper half of
          Colter's body -- his real body -- inside a sterile tent of
          transparent plastic. His skull has been removed. A massive
          apparatus has been infused directly onto his brain.
          Goodwin takes a long, last look.

                         GOODWIN
          Thank you for your service. Time
          to go home.
          Goodwin's hand goes to the switch to shut off life support.
          His eyes on the clock. It reads 30 SECONDS.

          EXT. NEWARK STATION - PARKING LOT - DAY

          Christina on the phone, waiting as it dials.

                         COLTER
          Hey.
          She turns. Colter gets up.

                         COLTER
          You can do anything you want with
          your life. Starting right now.
          She's taken aback. He starts walking off.

          CAB DISPATCH (V.O.)
          Metro Cab Dispatch.
          A long beat as she watches him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          118.

          CAB DISPATCH (V.O.)
          Hello...?
          Click. She shuts her phone.
          Beat. Is she crazy? She's baffled by her own action. And
          by this unusual guy here.

                         CHRISTINA
          Wait.
          Colter turns. She crosses her arms archly.

                         CHRISTINA
          You can't just expect someone to
          change her life just like that. At
          the very least... you'd have to buy
          that person coffee and explain your
          reasons.
          She waits for his response. Uneasy at putting herself out
          there.
          Colter's watch ticks down to the final seconds. His last
          moments in this world. He has only time enough for a final
          look of reassurance.

                         COLTER
          Maybe some other time.
          Disappointment flickers on her face. She turns to go.
          Behind her is a STONE WALL. A BICYCLE is parked against it.
          Colter's breath catches in his throat. This is it! This is
          the mysterious scene he's been seeing!
          HIS WATCH - Hits ZERO.

          INT. BUNKER ICU - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY

          THE DIGITAL TIMER - Also hits ZERO.
          The outer door OPENS. Rutledge RUSHES in, accompanied by
          MPs.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Arrest him!
          Goodwin backs away from the gurney, hands in the air.
          The BEEPING has given way to a MONOTONE. All of Colter's
          vital signs have FLATLINED.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          119.

                         RUTLEDGE
          He's dying...!
          Rutledge frantically goes to reconnect the machines -- but
          Goodwin has turned off too many of them.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Get a medical team in here! Move!
          But the MPs just stare at the appalling sight of Colter's
          exposed brain.

                         RUTLEDGE

                         (SHRIEKING)
          What are you standing there for?!
          Do it! We can save him!!!
          No one moves. Rutledge rashly grabs for one of the MP's
          rifles.

                         RUTLEDGE
          I guess force is the only thing you
          people understa --

                         MP
          Back away, sir, now!
          The MP has leveled his rifle at Rutledge. Who steps back,
          aghast. His authority has vanished with Colter's life.
          Goodwin shuts off the monitors. Silence fills the room.
          Colter is dead.
          Rutledge stares sorrowfully at Colter's body. Then at
          Goodwin with burning hatred.

                         RUTLEDGE
          You're a murderer.
          Goodwin offers his hands to the MP.

                         GOODWIN
          Go ahead and arrest me.
          But the MP does nothing.

                         GOODWIN
          I'll be around. Whenever you want
          me.
          They part as he walks out of the room. A look of grim
          satisfaction on his face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          120.

          EXT. NEWARK STATION - PARKING LOT - MORNING

          Christina walks past the bicycle parked against the stone
          wall. She's about to enter a TUNNEL that goes under the
          tracks. The same tunnel from Colter's vision.
          She stops. Something tells her to turn around.
          The bench where Colter sat is empty.
          But three feet away... Colter is standing there. Still here.
          Dumbfounded, he looks at his watch -- it remains at ZERO.
          He looks all around. Trees stirring in the breeze. A bird
          flies overhead. The crowd of passengers outside the station.

                         CHRISTINA
          You okay?
          Colter turns to her. How can this be? He's afraid to even
          speak. As if that alone could break the enchantment.
          But the world is here. It goes on. That's all he knows.
          Finally he swallows. Finding his voice.

                         COLTER
          You're right. The least I can do
          is buy you coffee.
          This pleases Christina, although she tries not to show it.

                         CHRISTINA
          Okay, well, come on then.
          Walking forward, he joins her. The two of them disappear
          down the tunnel.
          A beautiful morning.

          FADE OUT.

          Sometimes within the brain's old
          ghostly house,
          I hear, far off, at some forgotten
          door,
          A music and an eerie faint carouse
          And stir of echoes down the
          creaking floor.

          In the black, a child HUMS. Gentle WATER sounds.

          FADE IN:

          INT A BATHROOM NIGHT
          JAKE, a four year old boy, sits in a bathtub. The door to thi
          bathroom is open and his mother is visible in the background,
          walking back and forth in the bedroom, getting dressed to go
          out. The STEREO is blaring in the bedroom, the music echoes
          off the tile in the tiny bathroom.
          Jake is playing with a plastic airplane. He answers a
          question.

          JAKE

          YES

          (PAUSE)
          Sometimes.

          (PAUSE)
          With my toys.
          He looks up, but we're close in on him and can't see who he's
          looking at.
          JAKE (cont'd)
          My... blue sword. No! The one with
          the gray tape around the middle. That
          one.
          He lands the airplane on the water. He giggles.
          JAKE (coast' d)
          That's silly.
          MAGGIE (o.s.)
          (from the bedroom)
          Jake? You all right in there?

          JAKE
          (calling out to the door)

          YES!
          The airplane takes off again. Jake lowers his voice to a
          whisper.
          JAKE (cont'd)
          What?

          (PAUSE)
          My daddy, but he doesn't know about it
          yet.
          He brings the airplane in for a careful water landing and lets
          go of it. He looks up.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          2. 

          CONTINUED:
          JAKE (cont' d)
          Can I ask you a question?
          He pauses, looks to the door to make sure his mother isn't too
          close. Moving back now, we see that Jake is all alone in the
          bathroom, staring at the empty bathtub across from him.
          JAKE (cont'd)
          Does it hurt to be dead?

          UNDER THE WATER,
          the toy airplane sinks and crash lands on the bottom of the
          tub.

          IN THE BATHROOM,
          MAGGIE WITZKY, twenty-six or seven, Jake's mom, city girl
          knows how to take care of herself, pokes her head in the
          doorway, buttoning up her blouse.

          MAGGIE
          Who you talkin' to, Jake?
          He turns to her and whispers.

          JAKE
          It's a secret.

          CUT TO:

          INT JAKE'S ROOM NIGHT
          TOM WITZKY, Maggie's age, lean and muscled like somebody who
          works for a living, lies on Jake's bed next to his son,
          reading him a story. Jake is nearly asleep.

          TOM
          Well, I was walking in the night, and
          I saw nothing scary. For I have never
          been afraid of anything. Not very. I
          was deep within the woods when,
          suddenly, I spied them. I saw a pair
          of pale green pants with nobody inside
          them! I wasn't scared. But, yet, I
          stopped. What could those pants be
          there for? What could a pair of pants
          at night be standing in the air for?
          Maggie leans in the doorway and whispers.

          MAGGIE
          Is he asleep? My brother's here.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          3. 

          CONTINUED:
          Tom looks at Jake, who is asleep. Tom closes the book, turns
          off the light, and covers his son. He kisses him on the
          forehead. Tom goes to a dresser and turns on the baby monitor
          (the transmitter). Its red light glows.
          After Tom leaves, Jake opens his eyes and stares.

          CUT TO:

          EXT STREET DAY
          The Chicago skyline looms over the street they live on. Not
          the suburbs, but not quite downtown either. Racially mixed.
          Two story brick houses jammed side by side, barely room for a
          raised voice across the narrow driveways. Bar on the corner,
          neon sign -- "BERNIE'S TAP." A HOMELESS GUY rants his way
          down the opposite sidewalk.
          Tom, Maggie, and PHILIP, early twenties, come out of the house
          and head down the steps. Tom carries the baby monitor (the
          receiver) in one hand. Jake's breathing is clearly audible on
          the speaker.
          Tom's on the sidewalk. Maggie, still three steps up, stops
          and puts her arms wide. Tom turns around and Maggie lets
          herself go, falling straight forward. Tom catches her on his
          back and carries her piggy-back. She leans around and bites
          his ear.

          PHILIP
          What are the odds of a single woman
          being at this thing?

          TOM
          `Bout a million to one.

          PHILIP
          Any hot mommies?

          TOM
          Depends. How big you like `em?
          The hot engine of a Yellow Trans-Am fires up in the driveway
          of the house across the street. It backs into the street, its
          passenger door hanging open. The DRIVER honks the horn and a
          SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD KID runs out of another house and jumps
          into the moving vehicle. They take off. The Homeless Guy
          berates them, shaking his fist.
          They reach the steps of the house next door. PARTY NOISE
          comes from within, shadows move in the windows. Tom swings
          Maggie around, puts her on the step, wraps his arms around
          her, and kisses her. Great kiss. It goes on.

          PHILIP
          Excuse me, hello, I enjoy soft-core as
          much as the next guy, but this is
          almost like incest for me.

          MAGGIE
          (still kissing Tom)
          Should we tell him?

          TOM
          Sure.

          MAGGIE
          I'm pregnant.

          PHILIP
          Get the fuck outta here!
          He grabs Maggie and hugs her. Tom starts up the steps.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          Look at this, I haven't even had a
          second date in a year and a half, you
          guys are on your second kid!
          Philip catches up to Tom and throws his arms around him.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          You big huggable bear. You're still
          goin' back to school, though, right?
          You promised me.

          TOM
          I don't know, I just found out about
          this.

          PHILIP
          I'm telling you, if you never go back
          to college you'll regret it for the
          rest of your life. The memories I
          have of being a freshman -- those were
          three of the happiest years of my
          life.

          CUT TO:

          INT BOBBY & VANESSA'S - LIVING ROOM NIGHT
          TWENTY OR THIRTY PEOPLE are crowded into a living room. It's
          loud, smoky, there's music and a ton of booze -- empty beer
          bottles, five gallon jugs of wine, big liter bottles of vodka
          and gin.

          5. 

          CONTINUED:
          The men are mostly on one side, women on the other. As Maggie
          heads toward the women, Tom grabs her arm and pulls her back
          close.

          TOM
          Seven years, and I've still never been
          to a party where you weren't the one I
          wanted to hang with.
          She smiles, melted, and they part. Tom joins the men. BOBBY,
          Vanessa's husband, an athletic-looking guy holding a sleeping
          three-year-old on his shoulder, talks with FRANK McCARTHY,
          fortyish, big Irish drinker, and HARRY DAMON, who is also
          older than the rest.

          FRANK
          Tom-Tom-Tommy, how are ya?
          He shoves a beer into Tom's hand.

          TOM
          Alive on the planet.
          (nods to Harry)
          Harry.

          HARRY
          Hello, Tom. Takin' care of the place?

          TOM
          Actually, I'm drillin' holes in all
          the floors, Harry.

          FRANK
          (as Tom drinks)
          That's it, take the medicine deep into
          your body. Good, good.

          HARRY
          So how you likin' the neighborhood?

          TOM
          Well, I grew up about a mile from
          here, it ain't like a foreign country.

          FRANK
          The hell it isn't! This is the best
          God damn neighborhood in Chicago,
          `cause we look out for each other, and
          that's sayin' a lot as we approach the
          Year of our Lord two thousand.

          HARRY
          What are you, runnin' for Mayor?

          LENNY, the local crank, pipes up.

          LENNY
          Hey, did any of you guys see those
          Dominican crack dealers hangin' around
          the park again?
          Everybody GROANS.

          FRANK
          (to Bobby)
          What is Lenny doing here? Did you
          tell him you were having a party?!

          BOBBY
          Vanessa made me.

          LENNY
          Yeah, laugh it up, laugh it up, and
          when you all wake up dead with your
          throats cut some night --

          FRANK
          I mean, I could see if he just heard
          the noise and wandered in, but to
          actually invite him into your home.. .

          LENNY
          -- don't come cryin' to me!

          ACROSS THE ROOM,
          Philip surveys the selection of females. He sees VANESSA,
          late twenties, hasn't lost the weight from the last baby yet --

          PHILIP
          Not attracted to...
          -- SHEILA, a thin, nervous woman around Frank's age --
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          Not drunk enough for...
          -- and a LOUD WOMAN with enormous hair.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          Frightened by...

          LATER,
          everyone has eaten, some have left, the ones that remain are
          bombed. A DRUNK COUPLE dances dirty. Frank stares long and
          hard at someone's cleavage.

          7. 

          CONTINUED:
          Sheila, the nervous woman, stares at Frank, pissed off. He
          looks at her, gives her a "What?" gesture. Must be married to
          each other.
          Tom, on the other side of the room, hears a SHRIEK of women's
          voice: and turns. He sees Maggie blushing, receiving hugs and
          congrLtulations from the two or three women around her.

          IN THE :ITCHEN,
          Vanessa talks to Maggie while she mixes up a blender of
          Margaritas. The room is jammed with people.

          VANESSA
          How did you and Tom meet?

          MAGGIE
          He saved my life.

          VANESSA
          No, really.

          MAGGIE
          I'm serious. The summer I was
          nineteen, I was at Jones Beach, I swam
          out too far and got a cramp in my leg.
          There was no way I was gonna make it
          back. I was goin' down, I was
          swallowing water and everything. Tom
          was a lifeguard. I don't know what he
          was doing out that far, he said he
          just had a feeling.

          VANESSA
          Oh my God, did you have sex with him
          like, that night?

          MAGGIE
          Had to. He said I'm his slave until I
          saved him back.

          VANESSA
          That's so romantic. Bobby and I met
          when I peed in the guys' john at a Bon
          Jovi concert.
          She hits "puree" on the blender.

          STILL LATER,
          the party's down to the hard-core half dozen, who are passing
          a joint. Tom sits on the couch, feet on the coffee table next
          to their baby monitor. Maggie is next to him, Frank and
          Sheila are jammed in there too.

          CONTINUED:
          Bobby and Vanessa sit on the floor opposite. Philip is in a
          chair at the end.

          VANESSA
          P(ople who say they were hypnotized
          weren't really, they were just, you
          kn)w, playing along.

          PHILIP
          Then how could they have needles stuck
          into their throats without bleeding?
          Without even making a sound?

          FRANK
          Bullshit.

          VANESSA
          You never saw that happen.

          PHILIP
          Uh, hello, I had a two inch needle
          stuck right into the thick of my arm,
          by my professor, while I was under
          hypnosis.

          FRANK
          Bullshit!

          VANESSA
          You're making it up!

          BOBBY
          That's disgusting!

          MAGGIE
          I saw his arm the next day. It left a
          mark.

          FRANK
          Bullshit!

          SHEILA
          Can you learn another word?

          FRANK
          Prove it.

          VANESSA
          Yeah, let's see.

          FRANK
          Hypnotize somebody. Hypnotize
          Vanessa.

          VANESSA
          Oh, no. Uh uh.

          PHILIP
          Why not?

          VANESSA
          Because, I .night make a fool out of
          myself! I n. ;.ght, I don't know, expose
          myself or sowething.
          She clutches her arms around her breasts as she says that.
          You get the feeling she'd like to expose herself.

          PHILIP
          I thought you didn't believe in it.

          VANESSA
          I don't, but -- do Maggie.

          MAGGIE
          Yeah, right.

          FRANK
          You do it, Sheila. We promise not to
          make you do a strip tease on the
          kitchen table.
          Sheila glares at him. They must be fun to hang out with.

          VANESSA
          That's what I'd do! That's exactly
          the kind of thing I'm afraid I'd do!

          MAGGIE
          Hey Frank, you're the one who's so
          curious, why don't you-

          FRANK
          No.

          MAGGIE
          Ah, that's different. Whaddya got to
          hide?

          FRANK
          No fuckin' way, I ain't gonna do it.
          Tom sits forward.

          TOM
          What the hell? I'll try anything
          once.

          

          

          

          

          A MOMENT LATER,
          a hand switches off the lamp on the table.
          Another hand turns off the lamp in the corner.
          The music is turned off.
          Tom sits in the armchair in the n3arly-darkened room. Philip
          shoves the coffee table back and sits on it, directly in front
          of him. The others crowd around expectantly, silent.

          PHILIP
          No sound.from anyone, please. Any
          distraction can break it up.
          He raises his index finger and holds it about a foot in front
          of Tom's face.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          Okay. Look at it.

          TOM
          Damn fine lookin' finger.
          Laughter.

          PHILIP

          (AUTHORITATIVE)
          Be quiet.
          (they do)
          Look at it. Keep looking at it.
          Don't look at anything else, just my
          finger.

          TOM
          Can you clean out the nail, it's kinda
          makin' me sick here.
          Philip raises two fingers and jabs Tom in the eyes.
          TOM (cont' d)
          Hey, what the fuck?

          PHILIP
          Shall we try this again?

          TOM
          (rubbing his eyes)
          Asshole.

          Look at me, Tom. You're not afraid of
          this. You want this to happen. Don't
          you?

          TOM
          Poke me again you son of a batch and
          I'll clock you, I swear to Go'..

          MAGGIE
          Philip, have you ever done this
          before?

          PHILIP
          Maggie, please, I nearly have a
          master's degree in cognitive psy-

          MAGGIE
          Have you ever done it before?

          PHILIP
          Well, I've seen it done a dozen times.

          MAGGIE
          Try not to screw him up permanently.

          PHILIP
          (to Tom)
          You want to be hypnotized. Say yes.

          TOM
          Yeah.

          PHILIP
          "I want to be hypnotized."

          TOM
          I want to be fuckin' hypnotized,
          already.

          PHILIP
          Okay. Close your eyes.
          As Tom does, our eyes close too, big heavy lashes dropping
          over everything and plunging us into blackness.
          PHILIP (o.s.)
          Just listen for a moment.

          

          

          

          

          12. 

          IN THE BLACK,
          we can still hear the sounds of the living room. Tom
          breathes. Ice CLINKS in a glass as someone drinks. A car
          HUMS by outside.
          PHILIP (o.s.)
          Now look at the backs of your eyelids.
          Do you see anything there?
          TOM (o.s.)
          Uh...
          Out of the pitch black, we can detect tiny images.
          TOM (o.s.)
          Some colors... something floating...
          up.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          Focus on it.
          A small squiggly line comes into focus, drifting up through
          the black, then bouncing suddenly downward.
          PHILIP (o.s.)
          Now... I want you to pretend you're in
          a theatre.

          INT THEATRE NIGHT
          We're sitting in a theatre, a bare stage at the front.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          A movie theatre.

          INT MOVIE THEATRE NIGHT
          Okay, we're sitting in a movie theatre. It's crowded with
          people, waiting for the movie to start.
          PHILIP (o.s.)
          You're the only one there.
          The people disappear. The theatre is empty.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          You're sitting near the front.
          We pop up ten rows closer to the screen.

          PHILIP (o . s . )
          The walls of the theatre are black,
          covered with black velvet.
          SHOOOP! Black velvet descends over the walls.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          The seats are covered with black
          velvet.
          Black velvet crawls over the seats.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          There is no light in the theatre.
          The lights click off.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          In the whole pitch-black theatre,
          there's only one thing you can see.
          The white screen. You drift toward
          it, in your chair.
          Up ahead of us, the screen is a dazzling white. We move
          slowly toward it, floating over the seats.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          There are letters up on the screen.
          Tall, thick, black letters, but
          they're out of focus. You drift
          closer to them, trying to read them.
          Blurry black letters appear on the screen. We drift closer.
          PHILIP (o. s . )
          You're comfortable in your black
          velvet seat, very comfortable. You
          just sit there, looking at the screen,
          drifting closer in your chair, staring
          at those letters on the screen.
          You're relaxing. Your feet and ankles
          are relaxed. Your legs are relaxed.
          Your hands are limp and heavy. Your
          arms are relaxed. Your face. The
          letters come into focus, you're close
          enough now, you can read them.
          The letters are right in front of us now, but still blurry.
           PHILIP (o . s . )

          The moment he speaks the word, five giant black letters come
          into focus on the white screen, filling our entire field of
          vision.
          PHILIP (o . s . )

          SLEEP.
          We stare at that word for a moment --
          -- and then everything goes black. No sound, no image, no
          nothing. And then...

          INT BOBBY & VANESSA'S LIVING ROOM NIGHT
          Six faces stare right at us from up close. Tom is in the
          chair, eyes open, looking disoriented.

          TOM
          Didn't work, huh?
          All six faces burst out laughing, a great nervous tension
          released. Somebody turns the lights back on, somebody else
          hits the music.
          TOM (cont' d)
          What?
          More laughter. Philip seems very pleased with himself.
          Maggie comes and sits on the arm of the chair next to Tom,
          puts her hand on his face.

          MAGGIE
          Are you okay?

          TOM
          Did somethin' happen?
          People start talking, all at once.

          VANESSA
          You were faking it. You had to be
          faking it.

          TOM
          What are you talking about?

          FRANK
          That was the weirdest thing I've ever
          seen in my whole fuckin' life.

          PHILIP
          How do you feel?

          TOM
          How am I supposed to feel?

          PHILIP
          A little.., hot, maybe?
          EveryboJy laughs again. Tom wipes his forehead. He's covered
          with sweat. He gets up. He doesn't like this at all, being
          the only one not in on the joke.

          TOM
          What'd you do to me?

          PHILIP
          Nothing much. Just had you stretched
          out as stiff as a board between those
          two chairs --
          He points to two dining room chairs that are sitting back to
          back four or five feet apart.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          (lighting a lighter)
          -- and ran this back and forth under
          your legs.
          Tom feels the backs of his legs. He looks at Maggie.

          TOM
          That happened?

          MAGGIE
          You said it didn't hurt at all. And
          he kept it moving.

          TOM
          Hey, thanks a lot, it was very nice of
          you not to burn my flesh.

          FRANK
          Joey Ariola woulda burned it.
          They laugh again. Tom looks at him, stunned.

          TOM
          Who?

          FRANK
          The kid who beat you up all the time
          when you were twelve. You told us all
          about him. You were cryin' and
          everything.

          Tom seethes, humiliated. Vanessa looks at her watch.

          PHILIP
          (low, to Vanessa)
          Don't.

          FRANK
          Not time yet.

          TOM
          What?

          FRANK

          (INNOCENTLY)
          Huh?

          TOM
          Not time for what?

          MAGGIE
          Tom, you didn't do anything
          embarrassing or anything.

          TOM
          Aright, somebody else go. Come on,
          let's go, somebody else, right now.

          PHILIP
          Tom, look --

          TOM
          Nobody? Well, then I guess the
          party's over, ain't it?
          (to Maggie)
          Let's go. Come on, let's go home.

          PHILIP
          You're getting a little too worked up
          about this.

          TOM
          You know, I don't think so, because
          I'll tell you something, it's a very
          nasty feeling to know somebody's been
          fuckin' around in your head for
          everybody else's amusement, you know?
          (lightening up a bit)
          I mean, Joey Ariola, Christ, I haven't
          thought about him in maybe ten years,
          and -- come on, man, somebody else has
          gotta go. Don't make me be the only-

          On the mantle over the fireplace, a clock CHIMES. Everyone is
          immediately silent, staring at Tom. He looks at the clock.
          It's eleven.
          He lifts his foot, pulls off his shoe --
          -- and throws it out the window.
          There is an explosion of laughter.

          PHILIP
          Why'd you do that, Tom?

          TOM
          I... have no idea.
          Even more laughter, now everybody's slapping him on the back.
          Tom nods, "yeah, yeah, laugh it up."

          PHILIP
          I couldn't resist.
          Tom cranks an arm around Philip's neck and pulls him down,
          choking him. But it's playful, his sense of humor returning.

          TOM
          Any other surprises you left in my
          head, you fuckin' dead man, you?

          CUT TO:

          INT TOM & MAGGIE'S HOUSE NIGHT
          It's dark. Tom and Maggie lie in bed, awake.

          MAGGIE
          I hope it's a girl, I can't help it.
          Six brothers, I mean, give me a break.
          I'm sick of all these balls around the
          house.
          He doesn't laugh. She rolls over, strokes his chest with one
          hand.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          What's the matter?

          TOM
          Two kids. I'm only twenty-six. How
          did this happen?
          She slides one hand down, under the covers.

          MAGGIE
          (imitating him)
          "Please, baby, please baby, just this
          one time, I can't feel anything with
          one of those on."

          TOM
          No, I now how it happened, I'm just
          sayin'... You're gonna have to stop
          work, at least for a while. I'll be
          workin' Saturdays for at least another
          year, maybe two.

          MAGGIE
          You don't have to. We'll get by, we
          always do.
          Tom stares at a dark brown water stain on the ceiling.

          TOM
          How many times I gotta ask Harry to
          fix that? He said he fixed this place
          up, so how come the roof leaks every
          time it rains?

          MAGGIE
          Relax.
          Her hand is moving. He twists.

          TOM
          Maggie, you don't think, I mean, ten,
          twelve years from now... I don't want
          you to think I'm gonna be a line man
          forever, you know, like Frank or
          somethin'.

          MAGGIE
          It's a good job. You know how many
          guys would kill for your job?

          TOM
          I'm smarter than that, I know I am.

          MAGGIE
          (kisses his ear)
          Relax.
          She's making it hard for him to concentrate.

          TOM
          I'm smarter than Philip, Christ, six
          years in college, he's still got his
          head up his ass. I just want you to
          know, this ain't where I plan to stop.
          She licks his ear. He closes his eyes.
          TOM (cont' d)
          All my life, I feel like there's
          something better inside me, it's
          trying like hell to get out and it's
          like x won't let it.
          She rolls on top of him and whispers.

          MAGGIE
          Let me help.

          LATER,
          the clock reads 2:31 a.m. Maggie is asleep, Tom is lying on
          his back, still awake.
          He looks over at the clock, agitated. He stares up at the
          ceiling. He closes his eyes.

          A BARRAGE OF IMAGES
          races across the back of his eyelids:
          -- Philip's face, close to his, a finger held in front of him.
          -- A flame, leaping out from a cigarette lighter.
          Six more faces, pressed in close to his.
          Himself, floating in an armchair above an empty movie
          theatre.

          IN THE BEDROOM,
          Tom snaps his eyes open. He rolls over onto his side,
          punching his pillow. He closes his eyes again.

          MORE IMAGES COME,
          faster this time. We share his point of view:
          -- A twelve year old boy beats us up in an alley near a
          dumpster.
          -- A fourteen year old girl kisses us behind a brick building.

          CONTINUED:
          -- A vicious dog sinks its teeth into our calf.
          -- Maggie, drowning, reaches out to us.
          The images Increase in speed, a half a dozen flip by so fast
          they're almcst subliminal -- a car tire, a broken arm, falling
          into water, breaking window, ham and eggs, a bolt of
          lightning.

          IN THE BEDROOM,
          Tom sits up abruptly, shaking his head to clear it.

          TOM
          .the fuck, man?
          He puts his hands to the side of his head. It hurts. A lot.
          Maggie stirs, but doesn't wake up. Tom gets up and walks out.
          As he passes Jake's room, he does a double take.

          IN JAKE'S ROOM,
          the four year old is awake. Not just awake, but standing next
          to his bed, perfectly straight, staring at the open doorway.
          Tom steps in. He can see by the light of the nightlight.

          TOM

          (WHISPERS)
          Jake?
          The little boy doesn't answer. Tom walks slowly over to the
          boy and squats down in front of him, putting his arms on the
          boy's shoulders.
          TOM (cont' d)
          Are you okay?
          Jake just looks at Tom, straight into his father's eyes. The
          boy's face lights up in a wide smile. He reaches out with one
          hand and rests his fingertips on Tom's forehead.

          JAKE
          Don't be afraid of it, Daddy.
          The hell does that mean?
          But before Tom can respond, Jake turns, climbs back in bed,
          rolls over to face the wall, and goes back to sleep.

          

          

          

          

          INT BATHROOM NIGHT
          Tom shakes some Advil into his palm; washes three down with a
          glass of water. He runs water in the sink, splashes some on
          his face. He straigltens, looks in the mirror as he wipes his
          dripping face. He stares at himself for a moment, then
          summons his nerve and closes his eyes.

          IMMEDIATELY,
          more images come.
          -- The front of Tom's own house, from a distance. A MAN IN AN
          OVERCOAT stands on the porch, waving to us to come in.
          -- Rough hands attack us, covering our eyes and face.
          -- A face, close to ours but blurry and distorted, as if seen
          through dirty, blue-tinted eyeglasses.
          -- Wooden floorboards as we race down toward them. We hit,
          hard, and our blood sprays out onto the wood.

          IN THE BATHROOM,
          Tom's eyes pop open. That was disturbing.

          INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT
          Tom strides into the living room. Their house is small,
          crowded with kids' toys and furniture they got for their
          wedding. Tom paces back and forth, holding his head in his
          hands. He turns and bolts into the kitchen.

          IN THE KITCHEN,
          Tom rips the refrigerator open and searches the top shelf. He
          finds what he's looking for, a large carton of orange juice.
          He opens a cabinet, takes out a glass and fills it.
          He upends the glass, drains it in one gulp. Still
          unsatisfied, he picks up the carton. He drinks the rest.
          Juice runs down his chin.

          BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM,
          Tom drops onto the sofa. He sits for a moment, trying to
          regain himself. His breathing returns to normal. He sits
          forward, picks up the remote off the coffee table, points it
          at the TV and turns it on. When he sits back --
          -- there's a woman sitting next to him.

          CONTINUED:
          She's eighteen or nineteen years old, so pale her skin's
          almost luminous. She's attractive but odd, she wears a
          billowy black dress with a diamond pattern, bangles up and
          down each wrist. Her lips are light blue, her eyes red-
          rimmed. Steam rises softly from her hair and skin; when she
          speaks, her breath comes out of her mouth in clouds of vapor.

          WOMA I
          You can kiss me if you want to.
          Tom bolts to his feet and staggers away from the couch. The
          woman stares intently at him and says something else, but her
          words are lost under the rising sound of static on the
          television.

          TOM
          What?!
          She repeats, but he can only see her lips moving, the words
          are lost under the static. Realizing, Tom turns hurriedly
          toward the TV and hits the mute switch. When he turns back --
          -- the woman is gone. He stands in the middle of the room,
          looking all around him. But he's alone.

          INT BEDROOM NIGHT
          Tom crawls back into bed and pulls the blankets up tight
          around him. He's shivering.

          A HAND
          drops over him and he nearly jumps out of his skin. It's
          Maggie, rolling over to embrace him in her sleep. He takes
          her hand in his and lies still, eyes wide open.

          CUT TO:

          INT KITCHEN DAY
          Morning. Tom and Maggie sit at the kitchen table. From the
          living room, we can hear a-kids' morning show on the
          television. Tom is wearing jeans and a phone company uniform
          shirt. Maggie is staring at him. They keep their voices low.

          MAGGIE
          What do you mean, like... You mean
          like a hallucination?

          TOM
          Maybe. I was awake, I know that.
          She nods, thinking, no idea how to deal with this.

          You know, she didn't menti. -in it.

          MAGGIE
          You sure you weren't dreami.g?

          TOM
          Positive. I had this headache like
          you wouldn't believe, and I was
          thirsty as hell.

          MAGGIE
          What should we do? You want to call
          Philip?

          TOM
          Yeah, I'll call him. But I don't
          think he's got a fuckin' clue in life.
          From the living room, Jake laughs uproariously at something on
          the TV.

          MAGGIE
          How about my cousin Elizabeth?

          TOM
          I don't need brain surgery, I just had
          a weird thing happen, that's all.
          Like a hypnosis hangover. One-time
          deal, don't worry about it.

          MAGGIE
          Well, if anything like this happens
          again, we should go talk to Elizabeth.

          TOM
          Maggie...

          MAGGIE

          EXT HOUSE DAY
          There's a pickup football game in the street, a half a dozen
          sixteen and seventeen year olds timing their plays to coincide
          with the red lights.
          Tom gets into a pickup truck with a phone compaty logo on the
          door, starts it up, and pulls forward to the neat house. He
          hits the horn. While he waits, he turns and loo--s back up at
          the front of his own house.

          HE REMEMBERS
          one of the images that blasted through his mind last night.
          It's his own house, on a wintry day. A man in an overcoat is
          standing on the porch, waving an arm in a friendly way --
          "C'mon in." But the image is silent, slow and eerie. We move
          slowly toward the porch, toward the man in the overcoat.

          BACK IN THE PICKUP,
          Tom turns slowly away from his house, just as

          THE FOOTBALL
          BANGS off his windshield, nearly breaking it. TWO BODIES
          hurtle through the air and land on his hood with a loud metal

          CLANG.
          Tom jumps a foot. He gets out of the car. ADAM McCARTHY,
          seventeen, climbs off the hood, embarrassed.

          TOM
          Jesus, you guys scared the shit out of
          me!
          The kid with Adam doesn't seem embarrassed, he just reaches
          for the football. Tom beats him to it.
          TOM (cont' d)
          You gotta play right here in the
          middle of the street?
          Frank is out of his house now, approaching the truck. He
          wears the same uniform shirt as Tom, carries a tool belt over
          his shoulder.

          FRANK
          Lighten up, Tommy, you sound like your
          own grandfather .

          TOM
          (looking at his hood)
          Aw man, it's dented. This ain't even
          my truck. They're gonna dock me for
          this.

          FRANK
          That'll pop right out. Use one of
          them plunger things. Adam, say you're
          sorry.

          ADAM
          I'm really sorry, Mr. Witzky.

          FRANK
          There you go, he said he's sorry,
          whaddya want from a kid. Let's go.
          Frank gets in the truck. The other football players walk
          toward Tom, calling for the ball. KURT DAMON, a great-looking
          seventeen year old, stares pointedly at the ball in Tom's
          hand. Tom looks at him.

          TOM
          Hell of an arm ya got there.
          Kurt smiles and shrugs. Tom tosses the ball back to him.
          Kurt turns and catches it behind his back as he walks away.

          IN THE TRUCK,
          Tom gets back in and closes the door.

          FRANK
          That Damon kid, he's gonna break your
          old passing records this Friday.

          TOM
          Bound to happen some time.

          FRANK
          Comin' to the game?

          TOM
          (starts the car)
          Yeah, I'm comin', I'm comin'
          HARRY (o.s.)
          Hey, Tom!
          Tom turns. Harry Damon, the guy from across the street, is
          headed toward him. But Tom notices something behind Harry. A
          police car has turned onto the block and is rolling to a stop.

          The UNIFORMED COP behind the wheel is staring out the window,
          looking right at Tom.
          Harry comes up to the open window and starts talking, but Tom
          is looking past him, at the Cop, who has stopped now.
          HARRY (cont' d)
          Thought I'd stop by and pick up the
          rent. Save you the trip across the
          street.

          TOM
          It's still two days yet, isn't it?
          Tom looks more closely at the Cop. He realizes the Cop isn't
          looking at him, he's looking past him, toward Tom's house.

          HARRY
          Yeah, just thought you'd want to get
          it out of your hair.

          TOM

          (DISTRACTED)
          Well, my checkbook's inside.

          HARRY
          I can wait. Hey, Frank, some game we
          picked to miss last night, huh? How
          many yards Adam end up with?
          Tom turns in his seat, following the Cop's line of vision.

          FRANK
          Two hundred eleven and two touchdowns.
          Harry lets out a low whistle. Tom sees what the Cop is
          looking at so intently -- it's Jake, who's playing on the
          sidewalk in front of their house while Maggie watches. Tom
          turns back, but as he does the police car is just pulling
          away.

          INT SIGNAL DIVISION DAY
          The signal division of the local phone company has a large
          main floor. A twenty-foot wall on one side of the room shows
          a forest of jagged, blinking lines.

          IN THE TOWERS,
          Tom is wedged between giant walls of circuit boards. He pulls
          a red circuit clip from his belt and picks a line at random.

          He pulls up the test handset unit that hangs from'his belt and
          listens, hoping from a dial tone. Instead, he cuts in on a

          WOMAN'S VOICE.
          VOICE (o.s.)
          (on phone line)
          -which was okay, I guess, but then he

          like, oh my God, can you please make
          yourself any less attractive?
          Tom pulls off the clip and picks another line. Now it's a

          SNEAKY MAN'S VOICE.
          VOICE (o.s.)
          -unless they find out we already

          it's imperative we lead them to
          believe we're honestly trying to-,
          Tom clips to another line. It's a SEXY WOMAN'S VOICE.

          all the way down to my-
          Tom starts to unclip, then hesitates, only human. The voice
          abruptly changes.
          VOICE (coast' d)
          Hey, did somebody pick up on your end?
          Is your wife there?
          Tom unclips and picks another line. He gets a dial tone. He
          enters a number on his headset. A SLEEPY VOICE answers.

          TOM
          Phil, it's Tom. Is there anything
          else important you said to me last
          night, while I was under?

          INT PHILIP'S APARTMENT DAY
          Philip (Maggie'a brother) is still in bed in his apartment.
          It's a smallish place, one wall is all windows with a lovely
          view of a factory, its stacks belching black smoke into the
          air. Philip's hung over. He holds the phone like he resents
          it.

          TOM
          Other than the shoe thing, what else

          after I came out of it?

          TOM
          Post-hypnotic suggestion, I know what
          it's called, Phil. Did you leave any
          others behind when you were kickin'
          your big, clumsy-ass feet around
          inside my brain?

          Tell me the truth, Phil!

          PHILIP
          No, I swear! I went out of my way not
          to, I even added a thing at the end to
          make sure!

          TOM
          What thing?

          PHILIP
          I, I didn't want you to retain any of
          the experience, you know, I wanted you

          TOM
          In general, what was it?

          PHILIP
          Well, it was perfectly harmless, I
          just said, uh, I said "When you come
          out from under, your mind will be
          completely free. There's nothing
          binding it. Nothing holding it back.
          You will be completely open."
          Tom stops, thinking for a long moment.

          TOM
          Yeah, I'd say that about describes it.

          PHILIP
          Describes what?

          TOM
          Never mind, it's gone now. I gotta
          go.

          PHILIP
          Describes what?
          But Tom has hung up. Philip unplugs the phone and goes back
          to sleep.

          drinking coffee, and doing the dishes.

          JAKE
          Who?

          I'd call mom, but it's a long drive
          for her and she's not feeling very
          well again, so... call me as soon as
          you can, and no, I'm not kidding.

          Are you gonna use her Friday night?
          Really? Would you mind if I asked her
          to sit for us, just this once? Oh,
          great, thank you so much, you saved my
          life. What's her number? Uh huh, uh
          huh. Great, thanks again. Okay.
          She hangs up and finishes her make-up in her reflection in the
          toaster.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          When did you ever meet Dorothy, Jake?

          JAKE

          day, right? She was there then?
          Jake turns to the empty chair on his left. He looks at it for

          (to Tom)
          Don't get me wrong, it's great what
          the Damon kid is doin' and everything,
          I mean, I'm sorry your record's
          gettin' broke, but, what, it held up
          almost ten years?
          Tom is terribly distracted, looking back over his shoulder,
          still plagued with a headache.

          TOM
          Yeah, `bout that.
          They round a corner. Just ahead, a high school football field
          is surrounded by bright lights, mobbed with STUDENTS and
          PARENTS. A BAND plays on the field, it's just about time for
          kickoff.

          FRANK
          (raising his voice over the

          CROWD)
          So you got that, that's great. What
          I'm sayin', though, is this year it's
          all Kurt Damon this and Kurt Damon
          that, and yeah, the kid has an arm,
          but high school football is running
          the ball -- smash-mouth, in-your-face,
          power football. Always been that way.
          Tom glances up at a mercury-vapor streetlight as they pass
          under it.

          35. 

          CONTINUED:
          The same BUZZING sound, the one he heard when he first looked
          at Dorothy, comes back now, seeming to come from the street
          light. Tom shakes it off.
          FRANK (cost' d)
          Now Adam, and I admit, L am biased,
          but my kid is having ona hell of a
          season and it's like nol.-)dy noticed.
          If they'd just give him he carries he
          could break a thousand yards. And on
          an eight game schedule!
          He pulls out a pint bottle of schnapps and has a bump, offers
          one to Tom, who declines. A SEXY TEENAGE GIRL walks past.
          Frank notices. Carefully.

          BEHIND THEM,
          Sheila and Maggie walk together. Sheila stares at Frank as he
          ogles the teenager.

          SHEILA
          Look at him. Why doesn't he just lick
          them when they walk by?

          MAGGIE

          (LAUGHS)
          According to Tom, the average guy
          carries around a hard-on two and a
          half hours out of every day. What are
          you gonna do?

          SHEILA

          (DARKLY)
          I've got a few ideas.
          A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN walks past and Frank gives her the big
          crank-around.
          SHEILA (cont' d)
          Look at that! He's not even picky. I
          swear to God, that man will stick it
          in a bowl of soup if it's still warm..
          Maggie notices Tom, up ahead, with a hand to his temple. She
          catches up.

          MAGGIE
          Are you okay?
          He forces a smile. They head into a crowded tunnel that leads
          into the stadium.

          

          

          

          

          36. 

          IN THE TUNNEL,
          Frank raises his voice still higher. It becomes a horrible
          drone to Tom.

          FRANK
          Six eighty-three with three game.-
          left, he only needs to average, ti.iat,
          a hundred and five, hundred and six
          yards a game? He hits a thousand and
          we're talkin' major scholarships, the
          kid could write his own ticket. That
          kinda thing's good for everybody,
          helps the whole neighborhood. He's
          goin' a hell of a lot farther than I
          ever did. Look at the quality of the
          tail he's already gettin'. He passed
          me in that department when he was
          about fourteen.
          He passes Tom the bottle. This time, he takes a swig.

          EXT FOOTBALL FIELD NIGHT
          They come through the tunnel and into the stands. Below, the
          field is brightly lit. Frank's voice is, thankfully, drowned
          out by the enthusiasm of the crowd.
          They make their way to the first open seats in the bleachers
          and sit down. The crowd is delirious with anticipation, and a
          bit loaded -- there's a lot of schnapps in that crowd, and
          beers snuck in here and there. And that's the grown-ups.

          ON THE FIELD,
          the visitors kick off.

          IN THE STANDS,
          the crowd ROARS. Tom tries to concentrate on the game, but
          he's totally distracted. He looks to the right, drawn by a
          flash of light.
          A car is pulling into the parking lot at the end of the field
          with its high beams on. Tom stares at the lights. The
          BUZZING sound comes back, louder the longer he stares.
          The crowd ROARS its approval of something. Tom turns back,
          tries to follow the game. He wipes sweat from his forehead.
          Maggie is staring at him. She takes his hand and leans over,
          SHOUTING into his ear.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          37. 

          CONTINUED:

          MAGGIE

          WHAT'S WRONG?
          As Tom turns to her, his eye is drawn by something just over
          her head.
          A GIANT LIGHT STANCHION towers over them. When Tom s\ares
          directly into the dozen large globes, the BUZZING souni
          overwhelms him, nearly deafening. His hands shoot up to his
          ears --
          -- and he leaps to his feet.

          TOM
          Sf"S TAXING BIM AWWAY!

          MAGGIE

          WHAT?!
          Tom fights his way out of the row, climbing right over people.
          They SHOUT their objections.

          INT TUNNEL NIGHT
          Tom races down the now-empty tunnel. A light shines at the
          far end, BUZZING madly. A few seconds later, Maggie starts
          into the tunnel.

          MAGGIE
          Tom, wait!

          EXT BUSY STREET NIGHT
          Tom bursts out onto the busy sidewalk, threading his way
          between PEOPLE and cars as fast as he can. Maggie follows a
          few moments later.

          EXT OUR BLOCK NIGHT
          Tom races around the corner and onto his block. He bolts
          across the street, forcing a car to lock `em up at the last
          second. The Driver SHOUTS: Tom keeps running.
          He reaches the sidewalk just in front of his house and stops
          in his tracks, staring at the house, wild-eyed.
          All the lights are off.

          TOM
          Oh, no.
          He bounds up the steps and tries the door. It's locked. He
          fumbles in his pockets for the keys.

          

          

          

          

          INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT
          Tom unlocks the door and bursts inside.

          TOM
          Jake?!
          No answer. He races up the stairs.

          INT JAKE'S ROOM NIGHT
          Tom SMACKS open the door to Jake's room and flicks on the
          lights. In Jake's bed, the covers are pulled back, the sheets
          are rumpled.
          But Jake Js gone.
          Tom races out. Still staring at that empty bed, we can hear
          other doors in the house being thrown open, lights being
          switched on, and Tom's outraged voice calling out for his son.

          EXT STREET NIGHT
          Maggie comes hurrying up the steps of the porch just as the
          front door flies open.

          MAGGIE
          What the hell is the-

          TOM
          She took him.

          MAGGIE
          What?!

          TOM

          SHE TOOK HIM, HE'S NOT THERE, SHE TOOK

          HIM SOMEPLACE!

          MAGGIE
          Oh, my God!
          She bounds up the steps, calling out for Jake.

          TOM
          She can't be that far!
          He runs to the corner, desperate, and looks up and down the
          street in both directions. There are a lot of people out, she
          could be anywhere.

          

          

          

          

          39. 

          CONTINUED:
          He turns, looks up and down the side street. Nothing in the
          first direction, but when he looks the other way, he hears a
          faint BUZZING sound in the distance. He doesn't hesitate,
          just takes off toward it.

          TWO BLOCKS AHEAD,
          Tom is running as hard as he can. He stops, abruptly. The
          buzzing sound is gone. He looks to his right. Behind a wall,
          there is a large parking lot filled with buses.
          He turns around. A dull white glow comes from the windows of
          the place on the corner. He looks up, at the sign.
          It's a Greyhound bus station.
          Tom hurries back toward it, reaching the door just as Maggie
          comes running up from the opposite direction.

          TOM
          Wait right here, keep your eyes open!
          He opens the door and goes inside.

          INT BUS STATION NIGHT
          Tom steps into the station, still breathing hard. The BUZZING
          sound returns. But from where? Is it in his mind this time,
          or really here, in the bus station?
          The place is empty except for one person, sitting on a wooden
          bench with their back to him, near the departure doors. Tom
          walks slowly across the place to the figure. It's Dorothy.
          As he draws closer, he sees Jake's face, over Dorothy's
          shoulder. Jake's eyes are open, and he's staring up at the
          ceiling.
          Tom follows his son's gaze. Jake is staring up at the lights,
          the old-style fluorescent tubes that give the place its
          cancerous look. The tubes BUZZ loudly. It's the sound Tom's
          been hearing.
          Jake sees his father and smiles. Tom puts a finger to his
          lips -- "Shhhh." Jake yawns, closes his eyes, and drops his
          head onto Dorothy's shoulder. He goes back to sleep.
          Tom walks slowly around the end of the bench. Dorothy is
          SINGING softly, an old nursery rhyme.
          She looks up suddenly and sees Tom. She starts to jerk to her
          feet. Tom puts a hand out -- take it easy. Dorothy sits
          back, caught. Tom steps closer to her, carefully. He holds
          both his hands out, palms up.

          CONTINUED:

          TOM
          Give him to me.
          She shakes her head no. Outside, a SIREN WHINES and a police
          car flashes past the window, its red lights spinning. They
          both hear it and glance over, then look back at each other.
          Tom raises an eyebrow. She knows what he means.
          TOM (cont'd)
          Give him to me, Dorothy.
          Trembling, Dorothy reaches out, Jake in her arms. Tom gently
          takes the boy from her and holds him tight.
          The front door flies open and Maggie races inside. Tom gives
          Jake over to her.

          JAKE
          (half asleep)
          Oh, hi, Mommy.
          She's relieved, but livid.

          MAGGIE
          (to Dorothy)
          What the hell is the matter with you?!
          Dorothy jumps to her feet and races through the door that
          leads to the back, where the buses leave from.

          TOM
          (to Maggie)
          Take him home! I'll be there as soon
          as I can!
          He runs after Dorothy.

          EXT PARKING LOT NIGHT
          Dorothy races out of the bus station and into the forest of
          parked buses. Tom comes out a few seconds later, giving
          chase.
          Dorothy cuts between two parked buses --
          -- and is nearly hit by a third that's just arriving. Its
          horn BLARES as she trips and falls to the ground, the bus just
          missing as it ROARS past her.
          Tom reaches her. Dorothy writhes on the ground, sobbing,
          raking her hands through the gravel, hysterical.

          CONTINUED:

          TOM
          Sit up. Sit up, I want to talk to
          you.
          She manages to drag herself into a sitting position. She
          shoves back, against the wheel of a bus. Beyond them, the bus
          that nearly hit her stops on the far side of the lot.
          Dorothy is quivering, still crying. Tom squats in front of
          her, a few feet away.
          TOM (cant' d)
          Why were you taking my son?

          DOROTHY
          Go away.

          TOM
          Do you want me to call the police?
          (shakes her head no)
          Then tell me why you took him.

          DOROTHY
          He isn't safe in your house.

          TOM
          Why do you say that?

          DOROTHY
          He told me! He told me so!
          The DRIVER of the bus that nearly hit her is out of his bus
          now. He SHOUTS at them from the other side of the lot.

          TOM
          Jake said that?
          (she nods)
          What else did he say?

          DOROTHY
          Nothing. I was sitting there, I was
          watching him sleep, I was just
          watching him, like I'm supposed to,
          and... and he sat up in bed, he looked
          right at me, and he said "I'm not safe
          in this house." Two times, he said
          it, and then he went back to sleep.

          TOM
          Where were you taking him?

          real father, not --
          (like poison on her tongue)
          -- Duane. Jake would be safe at my
          father's house, we'd both be safe
          there.

          TOM
          You too?
          (she nods)
          Why aren't you safe here?
          She doesn't answer. The Driver is coming over to them, still

          SHOUTING.
          TOM (cont' d)
          Dorothy? Dorothy, why aren't you safe
          here?
          The Driver is still closer. Frightened, Dorothy gets up, to
          run again. Tom grabs her.
          TOM (coat' d)
          Hey, wait a sec-
          As his hands close around her arms --

          AN IMAGE
          flashes through his mind. A MAN'S FACE, sweaty and unshaven,
          leers over us, too close.

          IN THE PARKING LOT,
          Tom abruptly pulls back from Dorothy. He is enraged.

          TOM
          Who is he?!
          She just looks at him, frightened. He shakes her, violently.
          TOM (cont' d)

          WHO IS HE?!

          CUT TO:

          INT DOROTHY'S HOUSE NIGHT
          DUANE, fortyish, slouches on a sofa, watching Moe hit Curly
          with a rake. Duane's drinking bourbon. In his defense, he is
          using a glass. Duane's face is the one Tom just saw in the
          image in his mind.

          DUANE
          You're early. Your mom's still at
          work. Hey, do you know if she bought
          any more who the fuck are you?
          Tom is storming across the room toward him.
          DUANE (cant' d)
          Hey hey hey hey HEY!
          Tom already has Duane by the collar. He wrenches him to his
          feet.
          DUANE (cont' d)

          WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE

          DOIN'?!

          TOM
          Are you Duane?

          DUANE
          Who?! I don't even know who you're-
          Duane looks over Tom's shoulder. Dorothy is standing in the
          doorway, frightened.
          DUANE (cont' d)
          Dorothy, who the fuck is this guy?!
          Tom hurls Duane across the coffee table, knocking over Duane's
          bong. Duane hits the floor hard. He starts fumbling in his
          pocket, but Tom is on him, ripping him to his feet again.

          TOM
          She's a little girl, you son of a
          bitch! She' s fifteen years old, and
          you fucked her!? What the hell is the

          Look, man, I don't know who you are or
          what she told you, but-
          Tom hurls Duane across the room. He SMASHES into a bookcase,
          breaking the glass shelves and knocking a bunch of pictures
          and knickknacks to the ground. Duane SCREAMS, tries to roll
          away to escape Tom, but Tom picks him up by the back of his
          collar and his belt, like a dog.

          TOM

          GET OUT!
          He hurls Duane toward the stairs. Duane CRUNCHES down hard.
          Before he can get up, Tom hauls him to his feet and hurls him
          furthe: up. He's kicking Duane's ass up the stairs.
          At the +,)ttom, Dorothy watches, her hands over her mouth.
          She's thrilled.

          AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS,
          Duane lands, a few feet ahead of Tom. This time he's got a
          second or two, and he manages to dig the butterfly knife he
          was groping for out of his pocket.
          He whips it around, opening it, but Tom is fast and crazy with
          rage, he just grabs the thing by the blade and rips it away
          from Duane. Blood flows over Tom's knuckles as he tightens
          his grip on the knife. He twists it around, holding it by the
          butt. There's madness in Tom's eyes.

          TOM
          (wielding the knife)
          You got ten minutes. Pack your shit.
          You don't leave a note, you don't try
          to call, and if you ever, ever come
          back here again, I'll know, I'll find
          you, and I'll stick this so far into
          you they'll never get it out. You got
          it?
          Duane nods, terrified.

          DOWN IN THE LIVING ROOM,
          Dorothy sits on her hands at the edge of the sofa, waiting
          nervously. Tom comes down the stairs. He folds the knife,
          uncertainly, never handled one of these things before. He
          shoves it in his pocket.

          TOM
          I'll stay until he's gone.
          Upstairs, dresser drawers SLAM, Duane CURSES. He's packing.
          TOM (cont' d)
          Shouldn't be long.

          You're bleeding.

          She hurries into the kitchen. Tom looks around, at the mess
          he's made. He's embarrassed, frightened by his own rage.
          Dorothy comes back with a dish towel. She takes Tom's hand,
          wipes the blood away and wraps the towel around it.
          DOROTHY (cont' d)
          Than : you.
          He starts to pick up the things that were knocked off the
          bookcase.

          TOM
          Tell your mother I'll pay for this.

          DOROTHY
          It's okay.
          He picks up a framed photograph. Broken glass falls out of
          the frame as he turns it over. Tom freezes.
          DOROTHY (cont'd)
          What's the matter?
          Tom just stares at the picture.
          DOROTHY (cont' d)
          What?
          Tom turns the picture around to show Dorothy. The woman in
          the picture is about eighteen or nineteen, bears a faint
          resemblance to Dorothy --
          -- and is the same woman he saw in his living room.
          DOROTHY (coast' d)
          Yeah?

          TOM
          Who is this woman?

          DOROTHY
          My sister.

          TOM
          Did she have a black dress, kind of a
          diamond pattern on it?

          DOROTHY
          Yeah.

          TOM
          She wore a lot of bracelets, those
          thick ones, different colors, all up
          and down her arms?

          DOROTHY
          Yeah, all t2;+ time, she probably still
          does. How d., you know that?
          Upstairs, there is a tremendous SLAM as a closet door closes
          and Duane SHOUTS.
           DUANE (o.s.)

          CRAZY MOTHERFUCKERS IN A CRAZY FUCKING

          HOUSE!

          TOM
          Where is she?

          DOROTHY
          I don't know.

          TOM
          Can I talk to her?

          DOROTHY
          No.

          TOM
          Why not?

          DOROTHY
          She ran away. About six months ago.

          TOM
          Where did she go?

          DOROTHY
          I don't know! She don't write or
          nothin'.
          Tom looks down at the photograph again.

          TOM
          What's your sister's name, Dorothy?

          DOROTHY

          INT TOM i MAGGIE'S HOUSE NIGHT
          The red light glows on the baby monitor, and Jake's breathing
          can be heard from in his bedroom. Tom and Maggie sit on the
          couch in their living room, the nonitor beside them, just one
          light on. He has his arms arounc' her, holding her tight. His
          hand is bandaged. They're shaker..

          MAGGIE
          Samantha?

          TOM
          That's what she said.

          MAGGIE
          Where have I heard that name before?

          TOM
          Dorothy said she ran away about six
          months ago.

          MAGGIE
          But she could still be around! Hiding
          or something. I mean, she could have
          actually been here when you saw her!

          TOM
          If she was, she's very quick getting
          in and out of a room.

          MAGGIE
          Where was she? When you saw her,
          where was she exactly?

          TOM
          On the cushion right next to you.
          Maggie looks down at the empty half of the couch, freaked out.
          She pulls in closer to him.

          MAGGIE
          What was it like? At the game, I
          mean, how did you know about Jake?
          Did you see anything?

          TOM
          It's hard to explain. I just got this
          -- feeling.

          MAGGIE
          Like when I was drowning?

          stronger.

          MAGGIE
          Does it hurt when it happens?

          TOM
          Like you wouldn't believe. Fecls like
          my brain is tearing in half.

          MAGGIE
          God, Tommy, what's the matter with
          you?

          TOM
          Why do you assume it's bad? Maybe
          this is a good thing.

          MAGGIE
          If your brain is tearing in half?

          TOM
          I told you there was somethin' in me.
          Maybe it's comin' out.

          MAGGIE
          I like it better in.

          TOM
          Just roll with it. What's the worst
          that can happen?

          MAGGIE
          You'll go insane. Kill yourself.
          Kill me and Jake first.

          TOM
          Well, yeah, that...

          MAGGIE
          I want you to go see my cousin
          Elizabeth. Make sure there's nothing
          wrong. Just tell her about the
          headaches, that's all she needs to
          know, you don't have to bring up the
          other stuff.

          Hey, know what?
          (she looks at him)
          It is a girl.
          She furrows her brow, "how do you know?", then follows his
          gaze down to her belly, where his hand is resting.

          INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR DAY
          Tom, dressed in a patient's gown, walks down a hospital
          corridor with DR. ELIZABETH NOONAN, fortyish. Elizabeth makes
          notes on a clipboard, walking and talking fast, all business.
          Elizabeth does not have the human touch.

          ELIZABETH
          Do you have any metal plates in your
          skull?

          TOM

          ELIZABETH

          TOM

          ELIZABETH
          Any shrapnel lodged anywhere in your
          body?

          TOM
          No.

          ELIZABETH
          No cardiac pacemaker, I assume -- iron
          filings near your eyes?

          TOM
          Huh?

          ELIZABETH
          You don't work with sheet metal, do
          you?

          TOM
          No.

          ELIZABETH
          Left here.

          They turn down another corridor.
          ELIZABETH (cont' d)
          Do you have an inner ear transplant?

          TOM
          No.

          ELIZABETH
          Aneurism clips in your brain?

          TOM
          No thanks.

          ELIZABETH
          Do you suffer from claustrophobia?

          TOM
          Only in, like, really small spaces.
          (she looks at him, straight

          FACED)
          You have a great sense of humor.

          ELIZABETH
          Right, then jog left.
          They do.

          TOM
          Do we really gotta do this?

          ELIZABETH
          You've had no head trauma, no serious
          viral infections you can recall, you
          haven't been out of the country,
          you're not a drug user, you have no
          history of migraines... I suppose I
          could open up your skull in the
          operating room and then decide what to
          do, but I'd rather take a few pictures
          first, wouldn't you?
          She pushes through a set of double doors.

          INT MRI ROOM DAY
          The MRI machine is a long tunnel with a body slab sticking out
          obscenely, like a tongue. TWO NURSES stand on either side of
          it. One wall of the room is glass, behind the glass are the
          TECHNICIANS -- and Maggie, who waves supportively.
          Tom swallows.

          TOM
          How's it work?
          Elizabeth goes to a computer terminal and types in some
          commands.

          ELIZABETH
          It creates an electromagnetic field
          thirty thousand times stronger than
          the earth's. That stimulates your
          brain's protons to align themselves.
          Then we shoot radio waves into you,
          which knocks the protons out of
          alignment. They then realign
          themselves, sending out radio signals
          we record on the scanner. The
          computer reads the signals and makes a
          series of detailed cross-sections of
          the layers of tissue.
          Tom looks at the machine, then back at her.

          TOM
          Can I have another Valium?

          A FEW MINUTES LATER,
          Tom lies down on the "tongue." The Nurses wrap sheets around
          his arms and tuck them in under his body, immobilizing them.
          He looks at one of them questioningly.

          NURSE
          So your arms don't touch the sides of
          the machine.

          TOM
          That would be bad?
          She smiles and nods. The other Nurse puts a white cloth over
          his hair.

          NURSE 2
          Your party hat.
          He tries to smile, but he is unnerved. Elizabeth leans in,
          staring down at Tom.

          ELIZABETH
          It's so nice you and Maggie finally
          came to see me at work.

          

          

          

          

          IN THE CONTROL ROOM,
          a Technician hits a series of switches.

          IN THE MRI ROOM,
          the tongue starts to move, sliding into the tunnel. Tom lies
          still, staring upward as he is pulled inside, like a corpse in
          a drawer sliding back into the wall of the morgue.

          INSIDE THE MACHINE,
          it's only about two feet across, and less from top to bottom.
          Tom blinks, staring up at the ceiling as the tongue comes to a
          stop. It's incredibly claustrophobic.

          TOM
          Kinda hot in the coffin.
          ELIZABETH'S VOICE comes blaring out of speakers mounted on
          either side of the tunnel.

          ELIZABETH

          YES, IT USUALLY IS AT FIRST, BUT IT

          COOLS DOWN ONCE THE HAMMERS START

          MOVING.

          TOM
          Yo, hey, hey, woah, I'm right here.
          Can you turn it down a little bit?

          ELIZABETH

          NO, YOU'LL WANT IT LOUD. WE'RE

          STARTING NOW.

          IN THE CONTROL ROOM,
          Elizabeth leans back from a microphone and turns to a
          Technician.

          ELIZABETH
          Go ahead.
          The Technician enters some commands on a keyboard.

          IN THE MRI ROOM,
          the giant "hammers" that are contained in the cylinders that
          surround the tunnel start to move, slowly at first.

          IN THE CONTROL ROOM,
          Elizabeth turns to Maggie.

          Did he bring any music?

          MAGGIE
          Yeah, right here.
          She hands him a cassette. Elizabeth puts it into a tape deck
          and pushes "play."

          IN THE MRI ROOM,
          the hammers pick up speed, and these things move. It gets
          noisy fast.

          IN THE TUNNEL,
          Tom's eyes widen. The hammers whip faster. Their POUNDING is
          tremendous. Tom's music starts playing from the speakers.
          It's The Doors, "People Are Strange."
          The hammers whip faster. Elizabeth was right, it's good the
          music is loud, because the sound coming from the hammers is
          deafening, like gunshots going off all around his head.

          ELIZABETH

          TRY TO RELAX. THIS'LL ONLY TAKE AN

          HOUR OR SO.
          Tom, in spite of himself, bursts out laughing.

          IN THE CONTROL ROOM,
          they can hear the thundering hammers, the blaring music, and
          above it all, Tom's crazy kind of laughter.
          Elizabeth looks at Maggie.

          CUT TO:

          INT CONTROL ROOM DAY
          Three electronic screens, two red and one whitish-blue,
          display various cross-sections of Tom's brain. Graphs and
          columns of numbers are listed alongside.

          ELIZABETH
          No tumors, no growths, no scars or
          lesions, no intrusions or damaged
          tissue of any kind. Except for one
          tiny abnormality, your brain anatomy
          is textbook. Physically, anyway.

          MAGGIE
          What abnormality?

          ELIZABETH
          Well, it's so insignificant it's
          hardly worth mentioning.
          She leans forward to one of the screens and points to a spot
          on a cross-section.
          ELIZABETH (cont' d)
          It's the parietal lobe. Here.
          There's a slight distension, just the
          tiniest bulge here in the arc of the
          crescent. That's uncommon.

          MAGGIE
          How uncommon?

          ELIZABETH
          One in a half million, maybe, it
          doesn't really have a name. But it
          isn't consequential. Wouldn't have
          any effect on cognitive processes.

          TOM
          Great. There's nothing wrong with me,
          I gotta get back to work.
          (stands and shakes hands)
          Thank you for everything, Elizabeth, I
          owe you a giant one, hey, you think I
          can get some of that Valium to go?
          Elizabeth scowls at him.
          TOM (cont' d)
          Worth a try. Take care, say hi to
          Michael.
          (to Maggie)
          I'll pick up Jake, I told him I'd take
          him to the Pier tonight.
          He heads for the door, eager to get the hell out of there.
          Maggie lingers, looking at Elizabeth, hopeful.

          MAGGIE
          There's really nothing wrong with him?
          Nothing at all?

          ELIZABETH

          INT BEDROOM DAY
          Maggie is in the bedroom, cleaning up. She picks up Tom's
          pair of jeans from the floor and folds them over one arm.
          Something THUNKS to the floor. She picks it up.
          It's the butterfly knife, the one he took from Duane. She
          stares at it, fascinated and frightened. She lets it drop
          open. There is dried blood on the blade.
          Gingerly, she closes it again. She opens a drawer and puts it
          in, then thinks better of that. She takes it out again, looks
          for a place to put it.
          She drops it in her purse and zips it shut. She'll deal with
          it later.

          EXT NAVY PIER NIGHT
          Navy Pier is an amusement park/shopping mall built on a pier
          jutting out into Lake Michigan. It's a nice night, the pier
          is crowded, just enough urban edge to be interesting. A
          figure bobs along above the crowd -- Jake, sitting on Tom's
          shoulders. They stop and join a CROWD watching a JUGGLER, a
          good one, keeps five burning pins in the air.
          Jake suddenly looks up, confused by something. He stares past
          the juggler, through the flames. Behind the juggler, a
          UNIFORMED COP is staring at the little boy -- it's the same
          Cop who was parked outside their house earlier. Jake stares
          back, the flaming pins flying up between them.
          Tom moves on, his boy still on his shoulders. The Cop turns
          and watches them go. Jake turns, looking back over his
          shoulder at the Cop. The Cop raises a hand and waves. Jake
          just stares.

          AT A TOY STORE,
          there is an elaborate model train set on display in the
          window.

          JAKE
          Daddy, look!

          TOM
          Woah, check it out.
          He stops, helps Jake down off his shoulders. Jake presses
          right up against the glass, staring at the train as it circles
          the track. Tom squats, admiring it with him.

          CONTINUED:

          BEHIND THEM,
          the Cop is still watching them. He walks closer, stops only
          about ten feet away, staring. Tom glances up, sees him,
          thinks nothing of it.
          The 'op steps closer.

          IN THE. WINDOW,
          Tom sees the reflection of the Cop. Closer now, staring. Tom
          turns and smiles, tight-lipped. He recognizes him from the
          other day. The Cop smiles back, doesn't go away.

          TOM
          (to Jake)
          Hey, look at that one!
          He carries Jake to the next window over, a different display.
          The Cop wanders closer. Tom finally turns to him, tense.
          TOM (cont' d)
          How ya doin'?

          COP
          Fine, fine.
          He's staring at Jake.

          TOM
          Is there a law against lookin' in the
          window now?

          COP
          Huh? Oh, no, `course not. I'm
          off duty. I live right up there.

          TOM
          That's great. See ya later.
          He sweeps Jake up onto one hip and starts to walk away.

          COP
          It's even stronger in him than it is
          in you.
          Tom stops. Turns back.

          TOM
          What?
          The Cop smiles and makes a face -- "you heard me."

          (CONTINUED)

          TOM (cont' d)
          I don't know what you're talking
          about.

          COP
          Jon't be afraid of it.
          Tom just star .s at the Cop, trembling slightly. The Cop walks
          forward. Fascinated, Tom does not back away. The Cop lowers
          his voice.
          COP (cont' d)
          You're not alone.
          Tom is too rattled to speak.
          COP (cont' d)
          You don't know about Cacophony yet?
          Tom shakes his head no. The Cop pulls out a note pad,
          scribbles something on a page, tears it out and holds it out
          to Tom.
          COP (cont' d)
          Come next time.
          His hand shaking, Tom accepts the paper. The Cop reaches out
          and tousles Jake's hair.
          COP (coast' d)
          Bye, Jake.
          The Cop turns and walks away.

          JAKE
          Bye, Neil!
          The Cop looks back over his shoulder and smiles. Tom looks at
          his son as if he's never seen him before.

          INT JAKE'S ROOM NIGHT
          Jake, fresh from a bath and in his pajamas, sits on the floor
          of his room, playing with model cars, intent. He's HUMMING a
          soft tune to himself, the same one he hummed during his bath
          in the opening.
          Tom and Maggie sit near him, staring at him. They're freaked
          out. What have they got on their hands here? Their tone is
          soft, gently probing.

          MAGGIE
          Jake, do you remember the other day
          when we were talking in the kitchen?
          Jake doesn't look up, just keeps playing and HUMMING.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          I was loo3.ing for a baby-sitter,
          remember?
          (Jake plays)
          And you said "Samantha" told you about
          Dorothy. Do you remember that?
          He keeps playing, HUMMING.

          TOM
          Jake? Mommy's asking you a question.
          Nothing.

          MAGGIE
          Is Samantha someone who talks to you
          sometimes, Jake?
          No answer. She tries a different route.
          MAGGIE (cont'd)
          Can you remember any of the things
          that Saman-
          Jake looks up sharply.

          JAKE
          Don't ask the boy any more questions.
          They freeze, staring at him. His tone was odd. And did he
          just refer to himself in the third person?
          JAKE (cant' d)
          Talk to me.
          He goes back to playing, and to that little tune. It's
          becoming rather haunting.
          Maggie and Tom look at each other. Good God.

          CUT TO:

          INT BEDROOM NIGHT
          Nighttime. Tom and Maggie are asleep in bed. Suddenly, Tom's
          eyes pop open.

          TOM
          She's downstairs.
          He sits up. His head is killing him again. There's a glass
          of water on the night table. le grabs it and drinks greedily.
          He turns and looks to the open -loorway. He swallows.
          He stands up. He looks down at Maggie, who's still sound
          asleep.
          He walks to the door.
          Maggie stirs, feeling him gone.

          INT HALLWAY NIGHT
          Tom walks down the narrow hallway, toward the staircase at the
          far end. He's scared.
          He starts down the stairs. Halfway down, he dares a look
          through the wooden posts that support the handrail.
          Samantha is standing in the middle of the room.
          She looks up at him. For a long moment, they just stare at
          each other. Steam rises lightly from her as she breathes.
          Tom is shaking, barely finds his voice.

          TOM
          Samantha?
          She speaks, but when her voice comes out it's horrible and
          distorted -- muffled in a strange way.
          He takes a few trembling steps down the stairs, closer to her.
          She walks forward a step or two. She speaks again, louder,
          but the voice is still unintelligible and bizarre.
          Tom reaches the bottom of the stairs. She reaches out a hand.
          He stares, terrified. The hand draws closer.
          Almost beyond his own control, Tom raises his own hand.
          She comes closer.
          Tom is frozen at the bottom of the stairs. Their hands draw
          closer still.
          Their fingertips touch.

          60. 

          CONTINUED:
          Tom GASPS, as if something very heavy were put down on his
          chest. His mouth drops open, his chest twitches. He can't
          breathe.
          They stand there, frozen in that position. Tom tries, but
          can't draw air.
          MAGGIE'S VOICE calls out from the top ci the stairs.

          MAGGIE
          Tom?
          He can't answer. He's panicked, but unable to move. With
          every twitch of his chest clouds of steam burst from his
          mouth, all the air going out, none coming in.
          From the top of the stairs, Maggie can see him, standing
          there, hand outstretched into the darkness, touching nothing.
          But from Tom's point of view, he's touching fingertips with
          Samantha. He's frozen, breathless, and now his cheeks start
          to turn pale, unnaturally white. Another few seconds of this
          and he'll pass out.
          MAGGIE (con t' d)
          Tom!?
          She races down the stairs.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)

          TOM?!
          Tom can't look at her, can't move. A tear rolls down his
          cheek as his lips begin to turn blue.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          TOM, BR. ATfHE!
          She grabs hold of him. As soon as Maggie makes contact, Tom
          collapses. He sees Samantha break away from him with a SHRIEK
          of irritation. She moves, not quite walking, but a herky-
          jerky kind of lateral movement toward the dining room, fast,
          like someone on a dozen espressos, an angry thing that has to
          slow itself down to a crawl just to talk to us.
          In the dining room, she flops over onto the floor, like a
          reflection appearing suddenly on the surface of a pond. Into
          the floor, she disappears.
          Maggie grabs Tom's face and turns it toward her. He takes a
          big lungful of air.

          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          Was she here?!
          Tom nods, sucking air greedily.
          MAGGIE (cont'd)
          Why?!

          TOM
          I think we better find out.

          CUT TO:

          EXT OUR BLOCK DAY
          It's a street party, and it's jammed. Police barricades are
          at both ends of the block. Half barrels of beer sit in big
          plastic garbage cans, ice dumped over them. Everyone seems to
          have agreed on which radio station to listen to, and most of
          the couple dozen cars parked in the driveways have their
          radios tuned to it, loud, the windows hanging open.
          Outside Bernie's Tap, the bar on the corner, a DOZEN DRUNK
          GUYS are running pass patterns out the front door, cutting
          left at the mailbox, and catching a football thrown from
          inside the bar, out an open window. Well, they don't actually
          catch the ball...

          AT ONE OF THE TAPS,
          the Homeless Guy we've seen on the street a few times is
          drinking right out of one of the beer taps while nobody is
          watching. Lenny, the local crank we met before, is outraged.

          LENNY

          HEY, GET THE HELL AWAY FROM THERE!
          He chases him off, trying to kick him in the ass but spilling
          his own beer in the process.
          LENNY (cont' d)
          (to no one in particular)
          You see what I'm talkin' about?! You
          see what I mean?!

          ON A FRONT YARD,
          Jake plays with a couple other NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS.

          AT ANOTHER KEG,
          Frank is giving a lurid lesson on the proper way to pump the
          keg to two ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMEN. Tom joins him.

          You know you're under surveillance
          here.
          He gestures to Sheila, Frank's wife, who's about ten feet
          away, keeping an angry eye on him.

          FRANK
          What can I do? Nature commands me to
          spread my seed. I hear and obey.

          TOM
          Sure, great, just don't be surprised
          if some day Sheila digs out your 38
          and buries a slug or two in your ass.

          FRANK
          Please. The woman can't even step on
          a spider.

          TOM
          Spider doesn't fuck around on her.

          A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY,
          Sheila is talking to Maggie, disgusted with Frank.

          SHEILA
          They change, Maggie. Ten or so years
          of marriage, a kid or two -- they
          become a different human being.

          MAGGIE
          Sheila, if you're so miserable, why
          don't you leave? Adam's almost out of
          school, he can handle it.

          SHEILA
          Oh, Frank would love that. No. I
          want him out. I like that house.

          MAGGIE
          How long have you guys been there?

          SHEILA
          Almost fifteen years.

          MAGGIE
          So... you know most of the people
          around here pretty well, right?

          

          

          

          

          IN FRONT OF BERNIE'S TAP,
          somebody actually manages to catch one of the passes coming
          from out of the bar and is immediately tackled by three
          drunks. On the pavement. Ouch.

          IN THE CROWD,
          Tom is now talking to Harry Damon.

          HARRY
          But, you know, what am I gonna do, I'm
          a single father with a son to support,
          I can' t just say fuck everything. So
          I scraped together enough money to
          make a few downpayments, and here I
          am. A landlord, for Christ's sake.

          TOM
          So you've been in this neighborhood a
          long time, right?

          MAGGIE
          is questioning Sheila.

          MAGGIE
          Did you ever hear of a girl named
          Samantha Muller?

          SHEILA

          (THINKS)
          From over by Baldwin?

          MAGGIE
          I think so.

          SHEILA
          Yeah, kinda, name rings a bell.

          HARRY DAMON,
          in response to the same question from Tom, calls over to his
          son Kurt, the good-looking football player, who is leaning
          against the front of his yellow Trans-Am, talking to a couple
          other guys.

          HARRY
          Hey, Kurt, you remember that Muller
          girl?
          (to Tom)
          Like he ever tells me anything.

          DO YOU REMEMBER THE -- COME OVER HERE !
          He gestures. Kurt drags himself off the hood and saunters
          over.
          HARRY (cont' d)
          Do you remember that Muller girl?

          KURT
          What, Dorothy?
          He makes a "big breasts" gesture.

          HARRY
          No, the other one. Samantha.
          Lenny, the crank, joins the conversation.

          LENNY
          You mean the retard? She ran away.

          HARRY
          She did?

          SHEILA
          is on the same subject.

          SHEILA
          She was always hanging around the
          guys, you know, she wanted to be with
          the "in" clique and everything. There
          wasn't much chance of that.

          HARRY DAMON,
          asks Tom a question.

          HARRY
          Why you wanna know about her?

          TOM
          Oh, Dorothy baby-sits for us sometimes
          and she started talking about her
          sister, wonderin' how she was doing
          and stuff. I promised her I'd ask
          around, see if anybody'd heard
          anything from her.

          )id she ever live in that house we're
          .n?
          Frank comes up, one arm around his son Adam.

          FRANK
          Who?

          HARRY
          No. You're the first tenants since I
          bought it.

          LENNY
          (to Harry)
          Harry, I saw those Dominicans back in
          the park again. By the basketball
          courts?

          HARRY
          What do you want me to do about it,
          Lenny?

          LENNY
          We could go talk to `em. Scare `em
          off, if there were enough of us.

          FRANK
          Yeah, Lenny, they're gonna be
          terrified of you.

          SHEILA
          keeps talking to Maggie.

          SHEILA
          She was a pretty girl, but real shy.
          Pretty simple. She had these crazy
          ideas she could be an actress, you
          know. She thought she was gonna be a
          big movie star. I mean, there was no
          way, but you couldn't tell her that.
          I thought it was kind of sad.

          Two hundred eleven.

          TOM
          I give up, Frank.

          FRANK
          (puts his son in a hammerlock)
          Two hundred and eleven yards rushing
          the other night. That makes eight
          ninety-four with two games to play,
          kid needs a hundred and six, that's
          only fifty-three a game. He could
          walk through the rest of the season
          and hit a thousand.

          ADAM
          (pulling free)
          Dad...
          Behind them, the guys playing football out of Bernie's Tap
          have now organized a full-fledged game of tackle in the
          street, over the objections of their wives and girlfriends,
          who shout at them to stop.

          FRANK
          I embarrass him. Are there worse
          things that can happen to a human
          being?

          TOM
          Hey, Adam, way to go, man.

          ADAM

          (SHYLY)
          Thanks.

          CONTINUED: (2)

          TOM
          (to Harry)
          Well, if you hear anything about her,
          lemme know, okay?

          FRAZ. X
          About who?

          HARRY
          Tom's askin' about that Muller girl
          from over by Baldwin, you know, the
          one that ran away?

          LENNY
          The retard.

          FRANK
          Jesus, Lenny, don't use that word.

          LENNY
          What, retard?

          FRANK

          (SARCASTIC)
          No, "the."

          TOM
          She was almost your age, Adam. You
          know anything about her?
          Adam doesn't answer right away. They all look at him.

          FINALLY:

          ADAM
          Huh uh.
          Suddenly, the guys playing football run a play right through
          the middle of them -- sweaty, middle-aged bodies fly in every
          direction. Everybody SHOUTS and lunges backward, protecting
          their beers. The conversation is broken up.
          But the football players are upset, and a fight breaks out.
          The crowd gets out of the way, half to watch the fight with
          glee, the other half to shake their heads and watch the fight.

          OVER AT KURT'S CAR,
          while the fight goes on in the background, Adam wanders away
          from the group and sits down on the hood of Kurt Damon's car.
          He's rattled. Kurt notices him and comes over. He sits next
          to him.

          CONTINUED:

          KURT
          You okay?

          ADAM
          Yeah.
          (Kurt is looking atIhim:
          I'm fine.

          KURT
          You don't look fine.

          ADAM
          Really, Mom? How do I look?

          KURT
          (hands up in surrender)
          All right, all right. Just, if
          there's, you know, if there's
          somethin' you wanna bullshit about or
          anything, just let me know. Might
          help.

          ADAM
          You could climb off my back, that'd
          help.
          Adam walks away.

          KURT
          Sorry.

          AT THE END OF THE BLOCK,
          two police cars arrive, their lights flashing. COPS jump out
          and wade through the crowd to bust up the fight. So much for
          the party.
          Sheila shakes her head.

          SHEILA
          It can't ever just be nice. Someone's
          always got to ruin it.

          Nighttime. The city lights are on. The sound of SOBBING
          rises faintly over them. We're on the roof of a house, and a
          figure with its back to us is doing the crying. The figure
          drinks from a bottle. A long, hard pull.

          INT BE. ROOM DAY
          Tom pries his eyes open, exhausted. Sunlight streams through
          the window, right into his face. He squints, looks at the
          clock. It's 10:26.

          TOM
          Oh, man...
          He sits up, painfully. A beam of sunlight cuts him right
          across the eyes.

          A MINUTE LATER,
          Tom pulls his jeans on. He sits on a chair, puts on a shoe.
          But the other one's gone. He feels under the chair. Not
          there.
          He opens the closet door. Not there.
          He looks under the bed. There it is. He grabs it.

          INT BATHROOM DAY
          A note is taped to the bathroom mirror -- "WENT TO THE PARK

          WITH JAKE. M."
          Tom takes it down and reads it.

          INT LIVING ROOM DAY
          Tom comes downstairs and heads for the kitchen. There's
          someone standing in his living room, in the doorway from the
          dining room. It's Frank, his neighbor from next door, wearing
          a red shirt. Frank is staring at the floor.

          TOM
          Frank? What are you doing here?
          Frank looks up at him. His face is sad.

          FRANK
          They're going to kill you, Tommy. You
          and Maggie both.

          Frank turns and walks to the front door. He opens it, walks
          outside, and sits on the top step of the porch, looking out at
          the street.
          Tom follows him.

          EXT FRONT PORCH DAY
          It's a beautiful day, but the street is still kind of a m..ss
          from the party yesterday. Tom comes out and looks down at
          Frank, who's just sitting there, staring out at the litter.

          TOM
          Why did you say that, Frank?

          FRANK
          (in his own world)
          This is a decent neighborhood.
          On the street, TWO KIDS ride their bikes straight at each
          other, full tilt, SCREAMING. At the last second, one of the
          kids swerves, the other taunts him with cries of "Chicken!"
          A bird swoops over Tom's head, too low, and Tom flinches. He
          walks across the driveway, toward Frank's house. The MAILMAN
          waves to him, headed down the block. Tom waves back.
          Tom walks up the steps to Frank's front door and knocks. A
          VOICE calls from inside.
          ADAM (o.s.)
          Come in!

          INT FRANK'S HOUSE DAY
          Tom opens the door and comes in. Adam, Frank's son, is
          standing in the middle of the living room floor, a big smile
          on his face and one arm behind his back.

          ADAM
          Hi!

          TOM
          Hi.

          ADAM
          Want to see what I've got?

          TOM
          Sure.
          Adam pulls his arm around from behind his back. He's holding
          a 38 with a carved white handle.

          (CONTINUED)

          Is that your dad's?

          ADAM
          Not today. Come here:
          Tom walks toward him.
          ADAM (cont' d)
          Closer.
          Tom walks closer. He's right in front of Adam.
          ADAM (cont' d)
          I bet you never saw this before.
          He points the gun barrel at Tom --
          -- then swings it around and points it at his own heart.

          TOM
          Oh, don't do that.
          Adam pulls the trigger.
          Tom SCREAMS as Adam collapses to the floor, blood pouring from
           his chest. His body convulses --

          INT BEDROOM DAY
          -- and Tom's eyes pop open, in bed. That was weird.
          Tom blinks, exhausted. Sunlight streams through the window,
          right into his face. He squints, looks at the clock. It's

          10:26.

          TOM
          Oh, man...
          He sits up, painfully. A beam of sunlight cuts him right
          across the eyes.

          A MINUTE LATER,
          Tom pulls on a pair of jeans. He sits down, puts on a shoe.
          But the other one's gone. He feels under the chair. Not
          there.
          He opens the closet door. Not there. Tom blinks, unsettled.
          This is kinda familiar.
          He turns and looks at the bed.

          CONTINUED:

          TOM
          Please don't be under there.
          He bends down, lifts the blanket, and looks under the bed.
          There's his shoe.
          TOM (cont' d)
          Shit.
          He grabs it.

          INT BATHROOM DAY
          A note is taped to the bathroom mirror -- "WENT TO THE PARK

          WITH JAKE. M."
          Tom winces as he takes it down and reads it. Again.

          INT LIVING ROOM DAY
          Shod, Tom comes down the stairs and into the living room.
          Frank's not there, thank God.
          Tom goes to the front door and opens it.

          TOM
          Uh... Frank?
          But Frank's not on the porch either. Tom steps outside.

          EXT FRONT PORCH DAY
          It's a beautiful day, but the street is still kind of a mess
          from the party yesterday. A SHOUT draws Tom's attention.
          Those same two kids ride their bikes at each other, full tilt.
          Tom walks down the steps of the porch, staring at them as they
          SCREAM. At the last second, one of the kids turns away. The
          other taunts him with cries of "Chicken!"
          Tom stands frozen on the sidewalk. A bird swoops low over his
          head; he really flinches this time. The Mailman waves to him,
          headed down the block. Too stunned, Tom doesn't wave back.
          He turns, panicked, and looks at Frank's house. He starts to
          walk toward it, slowly at first, then picking up speed,
          jogging across the driveway. He's halfway there --
          -- when a GUNSHOT rings out from inside.

          TOM
          Oh, God...

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          73. 

          CONTINUED:
          He races the rest of the way, bounds up the steps to the
          house, rips open the screen door. But the front door is
          locked. He POUNDS on it.
          TOM (coast' d)

          ADAM?! ADAM, OPEN THE DOOR!!
          He POUNDS harder, but there's no answer. He goes to the
          window beside the door and peers through it.

          THROUGH THE WINDOW,
          he sees Adam lying on the floor in the middle of the living
          room.

          ON THE PORCH,

          TOM
          Oh, God, no!
          Tom picks up a porch chair and heaves it through the window.

          INT FRANK'S HOUSE DAY
          Glass SHATTERS and sprays all over the floor. Tom knocks the
          rest out of the frame with his elbow and climbs into the
          house.
          He races over to Adam's body. There is a pool of blood around
          his chest and his body is convulsing. In his right hand, he
          clutches a 38 with a carved white handle.

          TOM
          Oh, God, no, Jesus, no, please...
          He grabs a blanket off a chair nearby, presses it to Adam's
          chest, trying to stop the bleeding.
          TOM (cont' d)
          This is really happening.., it's
          really happening...

          CUT TO:

          EXT OUR BLOCK DAY
          Tom sits on his front steps, shell shocked, red light flashing
          off his face. An ambulance and two police cars are parked in
          front of the house next door, radios SQUAWKING with official
          activity.

          CONTINUED:
          Tom just stares. A car comes barreling around the corner and
          SQUEALS to a halt in front of the house. Frank and Sheila
          leap out of the car and race toward the house.
          Tom watches as they're intercepted-by a COP who tries to
          restrain them for a second. But they're hysterical, they've
          obviously been told something serious has happened and they're
          desperate to get inside.
          They blow past the Cop and hurry up the stairs, just as THREE
          PARAMEDICS wheel a stretcher out of the house, headed for the
          ambulance. The sheet isn't over Adam's head, at least, but
          that's about the only good sign, they're working on him
          frantically.
          Tom buries his head in his lap as he hears the cries of Adam's
          parents -- Frank's anguished, disbelieving BELLOW, Sheila's
          horrified SCREAM.

          CUT TO:

          INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT
          CLOSE ON a torn off piece of notebook paper with an address
          and a time scribbled on it. The word "Cacophony" is legible.
          Maggie picks it up, stares at it for a moment, then hands it
          to Tom, who is by the front door, zipping his jacket. He
          takes it and shoves it in his pocket. He's nervous. They
          both are. She smooths his jacket. He turns to go, but she
          tightens her grip on his jacket. Doesn't want to let him go.

          TOM
          We need some answers, right? Maybe
          they're the only ones who have any.
          She nods. Thinking of something, she picks up her car keys
          from the table by the door and pulls something off the ring.

          MAGGIE
          I'm sure they're very nice people, but
          in case they aren't --
          She hands a thin black cannister to him.
          MAGGIE (coat' d)
          Mace the shit out of `em.
          He smiles and shoves it in his pocket. She kisses him.

          

          

          

          

          EXT DINGY STREET NIGHT
          Tom walks down a street in a dodgy neighborhood at night,
          checking addresses. He stops and looks up, at an old,
          formerly grand apartment building that's fallen on hard times.

          INT BUILDING - CORRIDOR NIGHT
          The corridor is even creepier. And massive. Tom reaches a
          door all the way at the end and knocks. A moment later, the
          door opens. A very heavy-set woman in a floral print dress
          (VIVIAN) smiles at him.

          VIVIAN
          I hope you like fondue!

          INT VIVIAN'S APARTMENT NIGHT
          Vivian sets a plate down on a TV tray in front of Tom. There
          is a pile of chunks of various hard-to-identify meats, a
          silver fondue spear, and a chocolate cupcake with an American
          flag stuck in it. Tom sits on an overstuffed couch that's
          leaking stuffing.

          VIVIAN
          Dip away!

          TOM
          Thank you. Listen, is, uh --
          Vivian gives another plate to a man sitting next to Tom,
          HERMAN, in his seventies, in a wheelchair, an oxygen tube
          running into his nostrils.
          TOM (coat' d)
          Is there a guy named Neil here? He's
          a cop?

          VIVIAN
          Well, of course he is!
          She turns and heads back into the kitchen, passing BEVERLY,
          her identical twin, who's wearing the same print dress, this
          one with a red background instead of blue. Beverly serves two
          people on the far couch, one a THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, the
          other a HOMEY in his early twenties.
          Tom picks up a ham chunk and looks at the steaming fondue pot,
          full of cheese. Beverly dips and eats, winks at him, and
          flits off across the room.
          Herman turns to Tom and asks something in a raspy voice.

          CONTINUED:

          TOM
          Excuse me?
          Irritated, Herman gestures for him to lean closer. Tom does.

          HERMAN
          What does it want you to do?

          TOM
          I don't... I'm sorry, I don't under-
          Herman wraps his bony fingers around Tom's wrist.

          HERMAN
          Then you're not listening!
          NEIL (o.s.)
          It's his first time, Herman. Give him
          a break.
          Tom turns. Neil, the cop he saw the other night, has come in
          from the kitchen. Tonight he's in street clothes.
          NEIL (cont' d)
          (points at Tom)
          Lemme guess. "Distended parietal
          lobe," right?

          TOM

          (AMAZED)
          Who are you guys?

          NEIL
          Don't have a name. Cacophony Society,
          somebody said once, that stuck for a
          while. You know, like too many voices
          in our heads? I think it's too
          melodramatic. How about "fellow
          sufferers?"
          Vivian comes in from the kitchen with two big gallon jugs of
          orange juice. There are AAAAHS1 of appreciation.

          No, Herman, you're a freak. "Mutants"
          is a better word for the rest of us.
          He pulls 'ip a chair and sits down opposite Tom. On the other
          side of tie room, Vivian and Beverly tell an animated two-part
          story to he teenage girl and the homey, finishing each
          others' se. .tences .
          NEIL (cont' d)
          Like any other part of our body, our
          brains have evolved a lot in a hundred
          thousand years. Our first thoughts
          were formless. Struggling
          consciousness. Sensation. An
          instinctive tie to our environment.
          But then our brains began to focus.
          We sacrificed the intuitions we first
          had so our thoughts could be directed,
          so we could master specific functions.
          That's where we are at the moment.
          We're brilliant with technique, but
          we've given up instinct. So the next
          evolutionary step, the step yet to
          come, or perhaps it's already in the
          making, is actually backward. To
          maintain our higher functions, but
          reawaken the part of our brain that
          was pure intuition. That was
          receptive to anything, because it
          didn't know enough not to believe.
          You're a freak of nature, pal, an
          evolutionary step. You're double-
          jointed.
          (taps his head)
          Up here.

          TOM
          Are we the only ones?

          NEIL
          Hardly. I've heard of groups like
          ours in San Francisco, New York,
          Minneapolis -- those are just the
          cities I've been to. Tom, you're what
          they used to call a medium. You're
          like a man in a dark tunnel with a
          flashlight, but the light only goes on
          once in a while. When it flickers on,
          you get a glimpse of something, but
          not enough of a glimpse to know what
          it is. Just enough to know it's
          there.

          Wright, if there's all these people
          who got this power, why doesn't
          everybody know about it? Why isn't it
          common knowledge?

          NEIL
          It is. A lotta people know.
          Unfortunately, the easiest people to
          convince, the believer types, they
          also tend to be the dumbest. And
          people who demand proof -- well, this
          isn't something we can control, it
          comes when it comes, so if you can't
          make it happen, how can you prove it?
          It's like that singing frog in the
          cartoon, but when the guy puts it on
          stage it just croaks and he looks like
          a jerk.
          Herman laughs, horribly. He likes that cartoon.
          NEIL (cont' d)
          Some of us try anyway. I say who
          needs that kind of aggravation?

          TOM
          This all started when I was
          hypnotized. Is that how it always is?

          NEIL
          First time I've heard that one. it
          comes all different ways. Sometimes
          it goes the same way it came.

          TOM
          So it does go away.

          Yeah. Twice. t. girl that disappeared
          from my neighborhood. Now the kid
          next door just tried to kill himself.
          I think he knew something, but now
          I'll never know what it was. And I
          gotta know.

          HERMAN
          Look, what'd the bitch want?

          TOM
          Why do you assume she wants something?

          NEIL
          They always do. Something they need
          finished, something they can't do any
          more.

          TOM
          Why me?

          NEIL
          Because she's confused. Doesn't know
          why other people won't answer her.
          She only knows that you will. If she
          hasn't asked for something yet, she
          will. And once they ask, it's very
          difficult to stop yourself from doing
          it.

          TOM
          What do you mean? She can, it can

          Oh, no. You'll want to. Badly. You
          won't think about anything else. You

          around you.
          Tom listens. The factory CHURNS softly outsioi the windows.
          A few CARS in the street below. His BREATHING.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          Now focus. Concentrate. Look at the

          movie theatre.

          INT MOVIE THEATRE NIGHT
          We're sitting alone in an empty movie theatre. The seats and
          walls are covered in black velvet.
          PHILIP (o.s.)
          It's very dark. Everything is covered
          in black velvet. The seats, the
          walls, the floor. In the whole pitch-
          black theatre, there's only one thing
          you can see. The white screen. You
          drift toward it, in your chair.
          Up ahead of us, the screen is a dazzling white. We move
          slowly toward it, floating over the seats.
          PHILIP (o.s.)
          There are letters up on the screen.
          Tall, thick, black letters, but
          they're out of focus. You drift
          closer to them.

          We do drift closer to the blurry letters, but our attention is
          diverted by something. Three rows from the screen, there is a
          figure in one of the seats, its back to us.

          INT PHILIP'S APARTMENT NIGHT
          Tom's eyes are sill closed. His face furrows in conctrn.

          There's someone in here.

          No, it's empty.

          There's someone else here.

          No, man, I said you're alone in the
          theatre.

          INT MOVIE THEATRE NIGHT
          But there is someone in the theatre with us, and we continue
          to drift forward toward them.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          You're comfortable in your black
          velvet seat, very comfortable...
          Actually, we're quite nervous, drifting closer and closer to
          that figure sitting in the third row, its back to us.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          Your feet and ankles are relaxed.
          Your legs are relaxed.

          INT MOVIE THEATRE NIGHT
          The figure in the seat is only a row or two ahead of us now.
          It's a woman. We keep drifting closer.
          PHILIP (o . s . )
          Your hands are limp and heavy. Your
          arms are relaxed. Your face.

          turns.
          It's Samantha. Her face is shrouded in plastic. Her mouth
          presses against the plastic, it forms a horrible round 0,
          contorted in a silent scream.

          INT PHILIP'S APARTMENT NIGHT
          Tom's eyes flicker madly under the lids. Philip's worried.

          I want you to look at the screen.

          (GASPING)
          I can't breathe!

          PHILIP
          Look at the screen, Tom.

          INT MOVIE THEATRE NIGHT
          Now Tom's not just an observer in the movie theatre, he's in
          the movie theatre, sitting right next to Samantha. She's
          pawing at him, it's all he can do to fight her hands off. In
          their struggle, his fingers close around the plastic that
          shrouds her face. He sweeps it off her head.
          PHILIP (o.s.)
          The screen, Tom, look at the screen!
          You can read the letters now!
          Samantha's face is bloodied and bruised, as the plastic comes
          off she GASPS for air and lets out a ghastly, inhuman SHRIEK
          that fills the theatre. Philip's voice gets louder as he
          struggles to maintain control of the hypnosis.
          PHILIP (o.s.)
          Look at the screen, Tom, you're close
          enough now, you can read the letters,
          you're right up next to them!
          Tom, still holding off Samantha's grasping hands, turns and
          looks up at the movie screen.

          The letters come into focus, they
          spell --
          Tom's eyes widen as he stares at the screen. Three huge

          against Philip's desk, scared out of his mind.

          PHILIP
          What?! What happened?!

          Couldn't breathe...

          Plastic, like sheets of plastic...
          He shoves Philip out of the way, finds the refrigerator on the
          other side of the room. He rips it open, searches for
          something to drink. Philip follows him.

          PHILIP
          I think you need to sit down, man,
          something very next level was
          happening there, you should have seen
          your face.
          Only beer in the fridge. Tom CRACKS one open and upends it.
          PHILIP (cont' d)
          Uh... want a brew?
          Tom drinks the entire can.
          PHILIP (cont' d)

          parking behind Tom's phone company truck. She gets out,
          dressed in work clothes, and pulls two bags of groceries out
          of the trunk. She looks at Tom's truck, then at her watch.
          Home already?

          Hey! You're home early!
          She struggles to take the keys out of the door while still
          holding the groceries.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          Can you pick up Jake? I'm exhausted!
          She comes in and kicks the door shut behind her. Tom's
          nowhere to be seen. From somewhere in back, there is a faint
          CRUNCHING sound.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          Hello?
          No answer. She heads into the kitchen with the groceries.

          INT KITCHEN DAY
          In the kitchen, a letter is waiting in the tray of an old fax
          machine on the counter. Maggie stops in the doorway, staring
          at the floor. Muddy footprints lead into and out of the
          kitchen, through the door to the back. Thick chunks of wet
          mud are everywhere.

          MAGGIE
          Hey, look what I'm not cleaning up.
          She sets the groceries down on the counter and pulls out a
          gallon of milk. She opens the refrigerator. She does a
          double take. The entire top shelf is jammed with cardboard
          cartons of orange juice.
          From outside, the CRUNCHING sound comes again. She follows
          the muddy footprints out the kitchen door.

          

          

          

          

          EXT BACK YARD DAY
          The back yard is smallish, but it's a nice little patch of
          grass. Used to be, anyway, because now there are three large
          holes in it, dug seemingly at random locations. Large piles
          of dirt and rock are heaved up next to the holes.
          Tom stands in one of t1.e holes, his back to Maggie, hoisting a
          large pick axe high over his head. CRUNCH. He brings the
          pick down, into the hole. Busy guy.
          Maggie is aghast. She walks slowly across the yard, past a
          pile of shovels and buckets and other tools. She draws closer
          to him.

          MAGGIE
          Tom?
          Tom raises the pick high and brings it down hard. CRUNCH.
          The hole he's in at the moment isn't more than two or three
          feet deep. But, hey, it's early.
          Maggie draws closer. In between swings --
          MAGGIE (coast' d)
          Tom.
          Tom whirls, the pick raised to defend himself. His shirt's
          off, his chest and face are streaked with mud and sweat.
          Maggie jumps back.

          TOM
          You scared me.
          And with that, he turns back to the job. Swing. CRUNCH.

          What do you mean?
          Zom shrugs. Swings the pick.

          TOM
          I'm supposed to dig.

          MAGGIE
          Who says?
          He just looks at her from under his sweaty brows. You know
          who.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          Oh.
          Tom manages to break apart the rock he was working on with the
          pick. He tosses the axe, which bounces crazily across the
          grass at Maggie's feet. She jumps out of the way. He hoists
          himself out of the hole and picks up the garden hose. He
          sprays water into the hole.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          Why are you doing this?

          TOM
          Water softens up the dirt.
          He tosses the hose aside and grabs a shovel. He jumps back in
          the hole and starts to dig.

          MAGGIE
          No, I mean... Could you stop for a
          minute?
          (he keeps digging)
          Would you please stop for a minute?

          TOM
          What don' t you get? I'm supposed to
          dig.

          MAGGIE

          TOM! I'M ASKING YOU TO STOP FOR ONE

          MINUTE!
          He looks up, supremely irritated, and leans on the shovel.
          "Well?"

          MAGGIE (coat' d)
          M2y are you digging?

          TOM
          (isn't it obvious?),
          I'm searching.

          MAGGIE
          What are you searching for?

          TOM
          The question isn't "what." We both
          know very well "what," even if we
          don't want to may it out loud. The
          question, Maggie, which, as you can
          plainly see, I am very busy trying to
          answer -- the question is "Where?"

          MAGGIE
          I think we should call the police.

          TOM
          And tell them what, exactly? Run it
          by me once. Practice, see how it
          sounds.
          (looks at his watch)
          Anything else?

          MAGGIE
          Why don't you come in the house with
          me? Take a break. I want to talk to
          you, you're not yourself right now.

          TOM
          This is just fucking typical, isn't
          it?
          He climbs out of the hole and walks toward her.
          TOM (cont' d)
          What do you want me to do, Maggie, you
          want me to go inside, sit down in
          front of the TV, drink eight or nine
          beers till I fall asleep in the chair?
          Like that? Maybe repeat the whole
          thing tomorrow and the day after and
          the day after and the day after and
          the day after and the day after and

          MAGGIE

          STOP!

          TOM
          -until I grab my chest-and die?!
          May )e I was already dead! This is the
          mos. important thing that's ever
          happâ¢ned to me, the most important
          thins I've ever done in my life,
          Maggie, my whole stupid life, and you
          want me to just STOP?!
          By the and of his tirade, TWO NEIGHBORS are staring over the
          back fence. He's only a few feet from Maggie now, the veins
          in his neck standing out. She holds her ground.

          MAGGIE

          (QUIETLY)
          I've known you since I'm nineteen
          years old, you never talked to me like
          that before. Not one time.
          He stares at her, furious --
          -- and then jumps in the hole and starts digging again.
          Maggie turns and stalks across the yard and into the house.
          Tom keeps digging for a moment, then hurls the shovel across
          the yard.

          TOM
          InterRUPtions!
          He picks up his tee shirt, snakes angrily into it, and marches
          across the yard toward the house.
          TOM (cant' d)
          (to the Neighbors)
          What are YOU lookin' at?

          INT KITCHEN DAY
          Maggie site at the kitchen table, reading the letter that came
          in on the fax. Tom comes into the room behind her, pauses in
          the doorway, composing himself. She keeps reading. He sighs,
          heavily. She doesn't turn around.
          He goes to the refrigerator and takes out a carton of orange
          juice. He takes two glasses from a cupboard and sits down at
          the table opposite her. He fills both glasses and puts one in
          front of her. She looks up at him as he drains his. He
          pauses, staring at her.

          TOM
          You gonna drink that?
          She doesn't answer. He takes her glass, drinks some.
          TOM (cone' d)
          I'm sorry.
          No answer.
          TOM (coat' d)
          Okay, I'm not sorry.
          She ignores him. He looks at the letter in her hands.
          TOM (cont' d)
          Who's that from?

          MAGGIE
          My brother Steve. My mother's going
          back in the hospital again.

          TOM

          (IMMEDIATELY)
          No, sh-
          He stops himself. She looks at him.

          MAGGIE
          What?
          He shakes his head.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          What?

          TOM
          Nothing.
          They stare at each other. Tom's face is pale. Maggie is
          concerned.
          The phone RINGS. Maggie stares at Tom. The phone RINGS
          again. She lowers her voice, pleading.

          MAGGIE
          What is it?
          Tom can't look at her. The phone RINGS again. Tom gets up,
          opens the door that leads to the back yard, and goes outside.

          

          

          

          

          EXT BACK YARD DAY
          Tom takes a few steps out of the house, putting his hands to
          his head in pain. Whatever it is, he knows. In the house,
          the phone rings a fourth time. Maggie's voice drifts through
          the open doorway as she answers i;.

          MAGGIE ( - 9.)
          Hello?
          Tom closes his eyes.
          MAGGIE (o.s.)
          Steve, I was just going to-
          She stops. There is a long silence. Tom opens his eyes. A
          tear runs down his cheek. He wipes it away.
          He turns and walks back toward the house, slowly. There is
          dead silence inside. As he nears the doorway, he hears the
          sound of the telephone being placed back in its cradle.
          Maggie reaches the doorway at the same time Tom does. She
          looks up at him, her eyes filled with tears. He puts his arms
          around her and she breaks down. He holds her.
          He holds her for a long moment.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          You knew.
          (no answer)
          You knew, didn't you?

          TOM
          When's the funeral?

          MAGGIE
          Sunday. We should leave as soon as we
          can.

          TOM
          We?
          She stiffens.
          TOM (cont' d)
          Oh, you, uh... you want me to go with
          you?
          She looks at him, deeply hurt. Then enraged. She pushes him
          away from her, hard. He stumbles back into the yard.

          MAGGIE
          Do I WANT you to come with me:! To my
          MOTHER'S FUNERAL?! Of COURSE L want
          you to come, why the hell WOULLV'T you
          come?!
          But he's looking past her, at the holes in the yard.

          TOM
          I'm just... kind of in the middle of
          something here.
          She looks at him, absolutely incredulous --
          -- and then storms back into the house, SLAMMING the door so
          hard two of the glass panes spiderweb.

          EXT DRIVEWAY DAY
          Jake, twisted around in his car seat, looks out the back
          window of Maggie's car. He raises one hand, waving.
          Tom stands in the open doorway of the garage, still in his mud-
          stained jeans and tee shirt. He waves back.
          The car pulls out of the driveway, fast, and ROARS off down
          the block. Jake and Maggie are gone.

          EXT BACK YARD DAY
          There are now five large holes in the back yard, and Tom is
          running out of places to dig. Nevertheless, he drags the hose
          across the yard to an untouched patch of grass in the far
          corner.
          He stops short. Hose won't reach.

          AT THE SPIGOT,
          he unscrews the hose and carries it across the yard.

          AT ANOTHER SPIGOT,
          this one in the far corner, he reconnects the hose and turns
          on the water. Nothing comes out.

          TOM
          Come on!
          Tom curses and trudges back toward the house.

          INT KITCHEN DAY
          Tom gets a screwdriver from a tool drawer in the kit-hen.

          INT DINING ROOM DAY
          Tom stomps into the dining room and goes to a closet on the
          far wall. He opens the door and tosses aside a carpet flap
          that covers the floor. He shoves the screwdriver into a crack
          in the floor and pries up a trap door, two feet square, in the
          middle of the closet floor.
          Through the hole, he can see a ladder resting up against the
          wall below. He feels for the rungs with his feet and starts
          to climb down.

          INT BASEMENT DAY
          As Tom climbs down, he reaches out for a chain that hangs from
          a bare bulb in the ceiling and turns it on. They have only a
          partial basement, a ten by ten foot space about eight feet
          deep. The rest of the area under the house is just crawl
          space, barely enough to wriggle through.
          Tom reaches the bottom and goes to the far side, where a mess
          of water pipes all converge. He picks through them, finds the
          valves that lead outside, turns one off and another one on.
          WATER surges through the pipes, headed out to the far spigot.
          He turns to climb back up the ladder.
          And stops.
          He looks down, at the floor. It's dirt.
          He kicks at the dirt with his shoe, thinking.

          A FEW MINUTES LATER,
          the pick axe falls. Tom has brought all his tools into the
          basement and is now digging in the middle of the basement
          floor. The bare bulb throws his exaggerated shadow on the
          earthen walls.
          He works.

          

          

          

          

          EXT OUR BLOCK DAY
          It's quiet in the neighborhood. The CRUNCHING sound of Tom's
          pick axe falling echoes over the block.

          INT BASEMENT DAY
          Tom digs. The hole is almost four feet across, five feet
          deep. He's uncovered a large rock, a major chunk of stone,
          right in the middle of where he wants to dig. He's excavated
          all around the edges of the thing and is trying to wedge it
          loose with a pry bar, but it won't budge.
          Tom collapses onto the floor, leaning against the pile of mud
          and stone he's already hauled out. He thinks.

          CUT TO:

          INT YARD SUPPLY WAREHOUSE DAY
          Tom walks down an aisle along one wall in a huge yard supply
          warehouse. Tools are mounted on the wall for sale -- shovels,
          picks, post hole diggers. Got all that. Tom keeps walking.
          The tools get bigger. Huge shovels. Tractor blades. Hand
          pile drivers. Almost, but not quite. Tom keeps walking.
          At the end of the row, underneath a sign that says "FOR RENTAL
          ONLY" is an industrial-size jackhammer, the kind road crews
          use to bust through whatever's in their way.
          Tom's face lights up.

          EXT STREET DAY
          The jackhammer rides in the back of Tom's pickup truck,
          rattling along as the truck bounces over potholes. Tom pulls
          into his driveway, comes around, and drops the gate.
          Using all his strength, he wrestles the jackhammer out of the
          back of the truck. It's incredibly heavy, it takes all his
          strength to haul it up the stairs, kick open his door, and
          bring it into the house.

          IN THE STREET,
          Lenny, the neighborhood crank, is washing his car. He hears a
          CRASH from over at Tom's place and turns. He sees Tom at his
          pickup, lugging a huge air compressor out of it.
          Tom fights his way into the house with the compressor.
          Lenny stares at him.

          Sheila, carrying flowers and looking like didn't sleep last
          night, comes out of her house and heads for her car. She
          stops and stares too.

          INT BASEMENT DAY
          In Tom's basement, the compressor descends through the trap
          door above, seemingly of its own accord -- than we see it's at
          the end of a rope and Tom is up in the trap door space,
          sweating and straining, lowering the thing down.
          It settles on the floor next to the jackhammer.

          A BIT LATER,
          Tom reaches up to the hanging light bulb, which also has an
          electrical outlet in its fixture, and plugs in a yellow safety
          cord.
          He flicks a switch on the compressor and it RATTLES to life.
          He follows a hose over to where it plugs into the side of the
          jackhammer, which now quivers with unleashed power.
          Tom picks up the jackhammer. He hauls it over to the rock
          that's been in his way. He positions the jackhammer's spike
          on the top of the rock. He lowers a pair of goggles over his
          eyes. He swings his weight up, onto the jackhammer, and
          squeezes the handles.
          The jackhammer ROARS to life. It's deafening. Tom's whole
          body quivers. It's like riding a bull, but the rock begins to
          split in half.
          Tom WHOOPS with joy, barely heard over the din that echoes in
          his basement.

          EXT STREET DUSK
          As the sun goes down, the sound of the ROARING jackhammer is
          plainly audible on the block. The familiar Homeless Guy stops
          and SHOUTS something at Tom's house.
          Across the street, Kurt Damon comes out his front door and
          stares at Tom's house. What the hell is that guy up to?

          INT STEVE'S BEDROOM NIGHT
          The door is ajar, people visible through it as Maggie dials a
          nu-rber on a bedside telephone. The phone rings on the other
          enc. And rings. And rings. Just as she's about to hang up,
          Tom answers.
          TOM (o.s.)
          (sounds angry)
          Hello?

          MAGGIE
          It's me.
          TOM (o.s.)
          (changes his tone)
          Oh, hi. How ya doin'?

          MAGGIE
          I'm okay.
          TOM (o.s.)
          How's your family?

          MAGGIE
          You know. Drunk. Fighting with each
          other.
          TOM (o.s.)
          Listen, Maggie, I'm sorry. I was an
          asshole. I should be there with you
          right now.

          MAGGIE
          Yeah, well, what can I say? You are
          kind of an asshole. How do you feel?
          TOM (o.s.)
          Fine. A lot better. Much, much
          better. Everything's fine here. Real
          good.

          MAGGIE
          Have you had any-
          TOM (o.s.)
          Nope. Not even one.

          Why don't you come up here with us?
          This time of night you could make it
          in an hour.
          TOM (o.s.)
          Well, I can't, really.

          MAGGIE
          Why not?
          TOM (o.s.)
          (a lame lie)
          I'm, uh, not supposed to use the truck
          for personal trips.

          MAGGIE
          (trying to keep her cool)
          Alright. I'll come down there and get
          you. I'll leave right now.
          Behind her, the bedroom door swings open. Jake stands there.
          He looks terrible. She doesn't hear him come in.
          TOM (o.s.)
          No, no, no, no, no, what do you want
          to do that for? Don't come down here.

          JAKE
          Feathers everywhere.
          Maggie turns back to Jake -- and GASPS. He's peeing his
          pants, the urine drizzling down over his shoes.

          (into phone)
          Oh, my God, I gotta go. I'll be there
          in an hour.
          TOM (o.s.)
          Maggie, wait, no, Mag-
          She hangs up the phone and races over to her son.

          MAGGIE
          Honey, what happened? Why didn't you
          tell me you had to go to the potty?
          Jake turns and looks at her.

          JAKE
          Help Daddy.

          CUT TO:

          INT TOM & MAGGIE'S DINING ROOM NIGHT
          Tom SLAMS down the phone. He's standing in the dining room,
          which is now so mud-spattered it looks like the inside of a
          cave. The table has been shoved against the wall, legs
          sticking out into the room. One corner is filled with a pile
          of broken-up chunks of rock. Tom strides across the room in
          two steps, lowers himself, and drops his legs through the open
          trap door.

          INT BASEMENT NIGHT
          Tom sails down into the basement and lands nimbly on the
          floor. Doesn't even use the ladder anymore.
          The rock is gone, broken apart by the jackhammer, and the hole
          is now eight feet long and as many wide, and about four feet
          deep. Tom leaps down into it and goes back to work.

          CUT TO:

          INT STEVE'S HOUSE NIGHT
          In the front hall of the house, Maggie is putting on her coat.
          Jake sits on the steps, his coat on the carpet next to him.

          MAGGIE
          Jake, come on, we have to go.

          JAKE
          I'm staying here.

          CONTINUED:

          MAGGIE
          What?

          JAKE
          I want to stay at Uncle Steve's, I
          don't want to go home.

          MAGGIE
          Why not?

          JAKE
          Because I'm not safe there. Because
          of the feathers.

          MAGGIE
          What does that mean, Jake?
          He shrugs. Philip, Maggie's brother, stands in the doorway to
          the other room.

          PHILIP
          It's okay, I can watch him.
          Maggie, in a hurry, agrees. She bends over and kisses Jake on
          the forehead.

          MAGGIE
          Be good.
          She opens the door and heads out. As it's swinging shut:

          JAKE
          Don't stop for the train, Mommy.

          EXT UNCLE STEVE'S HOUSE NIGHT
           Maggie hears that just as the door closes behind her. She
           misses a step, thinking about it, then starts walking to her
          car.
          She walks faster.
          Then she runs.

           CUT TO:

          INT BASEMENT NIGHT
          In the basement, Tom abruptly stops digging, staring at the
          dirt. The corner of something shiny is sticking out from the
          pile. He bends down and pulls it out.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          101. 

          CONTINUED:
          It's a piece of clear blue plastic sheeting, about two inches
          square. Tom's hand starts to shake as he holds it.

          AN IMAGE
          flas.es through his mind again, the one he's seen twice
          befoi-. A FACE, too close to his, sting at him through that
          blurr blue, like through bad eyeglasses.

          IN THE BASEMENT,
          Tom turns and leaps into the hole, shovel in hand. He begins
          to dig, wildly, flinging dirt in all directions. At one end
          of the hole, his shovel slips, the dirt spilling off it as it
          sticks on something. Something buried.
          Tom drops the shovel. He falls to his knees and uses his
          hands to rake the dirt away from whatever it was.
          More blue plastic.
          Tom tugs out about eight inches of the plastic, gets a good
          grip on it with both hands. He pulls it up.
          Like a rope pulled out of the sand, the edge of the blue
          plastic rises up, unearthing itself in a line down the middle
          of the pit.
          Breathing hard, Tom grabs the shovel again.

          THE DIRT,
          flies away from the plastic as Tom works furiously.

          TOM'S FACE
          is of a man possessed. He digs as fast as he can.

          FINALLY,
          Tom stands back, staring down at what he has unearthed.
          Above him, we see what it is. A long piece of blue plastic,
          wrapped around something about five and a half feet long and
          two and a half feet wide.
          Tom bends down and lays one hand on the plastic. He flinches.

          AN IMAGE
          pops into his mind, another familiar one. A FIGURE IN Afl
          OVERCOAT, standing on the front porch of Tom's own house in
          winter, waving to us to come up.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          102. 

          CONTINUED:

          IN THE BASEMENT,
          Tom jerks his hand off the plastic. He swallows.
          He goes to hi= toolbox and pulls out a utility knife. He
          slides the ra or blade forward.
          He goes to one and of the plastic, bends down, and jams the
          knife through the sheeting. He walks the length of it, making
          a slit down the middle. He reaches out with shaking hands and
          pulls part of the plastic back.
          The first thing he sees is a partially decomposed human hand.
          Around the withered wrist, there are a half dozen multi-
          colored bracelets.
          Tom yanks the rest of the plastic away, revealing the half-
          decomposed body of Samantha Muller, still in the black dress
          with the diamond pattern. Tom stands there, his chest
          heaving.
          He looks at her hand, thinking.
          He sits down next to her.
          He reaches out for her hand, then pulls his own back.
          Can't do it.
          But he's gotta. He opens his hand, reaching out for hers. He
          slides his hand underneath --
          takes a deep breath --
          -- and closes his living fingers around her skeletal ones.
          He GASPS.
          His face turns a horrible shade of pale, his lips go ice blue,
          and STEAM comes out of his mouth, the way it did hers when he
          first saw her in his living room.

          EXT TOM'S HOUSE DAY
          It's a wintry day. That same steam rises up in front of us,
          coming from our own mouth. We're looking at the front porch
          of Tom's house as we walk past it. The house is being
          remodeled, it's surrounded by scaffolding, its windows covered
          with plastic Duvateen.
          The Figure in the Overcoat waves to us.

          We look back, over our shoulder, then back at the Figure. You
          mean me? This close now, we see the Figure is Kurt Damon.

          SAMANTHA
          You want to show me something?
          Her manner of speech is childish, like a grade-schooler's.

          KURT

          (CHARMING)
          Well, of course! I don't see anybody
          else around!
          We start up the steps of the porch. Kurt smiles, beguilingly,
          and holds a hand out to us.

          SAMANTHA
          What is it?

          KURT
          It's a surprise.
          He tugs. She resists.

          SAMANTHA
          What kind of surprise?

          KURT
          Well, if I told you, it wouldn't be
          much of a surprise, would it?
          We let him pull us through the door.

          INT HOUSE DAY
           Kurt leads us into the living room. The windows are covered
           with tinted plastic, casting an eerie blue light through the
          place.
          Adam McCarthy is in the living - loom too, drinking from a
           bottle of schnapps. He's drunk, slurring. He sees us.

          ADAM
          Happy St. Patrick's Day.

          SAMANTHA
          What's the surprise?

          ADAM
          Uh... don't you have it?
          He giggles.

          KURT
          Oh yeah, the surprise.

          ADAM
          The surprise.
          They laugh and look at each other. Kurt drinks, then forces
          the bottle back at Adam.
          ADAM (cant' d)
          I'm too wasted.

          KURT
          Drink, motherfucker, drink
          motherfucker, drink motherfucker

          DRINK!
          He wrestles with Adam, forcing him to drink. Half of it runs
          down Adam's chin.

          SAMANTHA
          I don't think there is a surprise.
          We turn and start for the door. Kurt hurries around,
          intercepts us.

          KURT
          Yeah there is, yeah there is.
          He puts his arm around us, leads us back into the room.

          KURT (cont' d)
          The surprise is... we decided we want
          to be your friends.

          SAMANTHA
          You do?

          ADAM
          Oh, yeah, so bad.
          He laughs.

          SAMANTHA
          Why do you want to be my friend?

          KURT
          Are you kidding? Look at yourself!
          Kurt turns Samantha toward an old mirror that hangs over the
          fireplace. She's good-looking, if she knew it. Terribly
          insecure, doesn't even like looking at herself. We turn away,
          embarrassed.
          KURT (coast' d)
          Ah ah ah, look!
          He makes us look in the mirror again.
          KURT (cont' d)
          Mama, you are hot.
          He turns her toward him, looks at her, closely.
          KURT (coast' d)

          (SOFT)
          Come on, let's be friends.

          SAMANTHA
          Well.., you can kiss me if you want
          to.
          Kurt leans in close, kisses us. After a moment, we force our
          head away, looking down. Kurt's hand is on Samantha's breast.
          We push him back.
          SAMANTHA (cont'd)
          Not like that!
          But Kurt pulls us closer, roughly. We struggle.

          KURT
          Come on, Samantha, I'll be your
          friend, I swear I will.

          You're a good girl, aren't you?

          SAMANTHA
          I have to go home.
          We struggle some more. He gets his powerful hanis on our
          shoulders and starts to push us down.

          KURT
          Come on, baby, how `bout a little
          helmet wash?
          His belt buckle comes into our view, and his hands on it. We
          tear away, get up and run for the door.
          From behind, something hits us very hard. The floorboards
          race up at us, all of a sudden. We land on them, hard, bounce
          off, our own blood spraying out on the unfinished wood.
          Our head lands sideways on the floor. We see Adam McCarthy,
          vomiting in the corner.
          Abruptly, we're rolled over and are staring at the ceiling.
          Kurt Damon is on top of us, his face too close. Her hands
          rise up, try to push him off, but he's stronger.
          Samantha starts to SCREAM. Hands close over our face. She
          bites, and the hands are pulled away. She SCREAMS again.
          KURT (cont' d)

          SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
          Kurt holds her down, begins to try to undress her. She
          writhes and SCREAMS. She gets one hand into Kurt's hair and
          pulls as hard as she can. He SHOUTS in pain.
          In the corner, Adam McCarthy has his hands over his ears.

          ADAM

          MAKE HER STOP! MAKE HER STOP

          SCREAMIN', MAN, MAKE HER STOP!
          But she keeps screaming. Adam staggers to a boom box that's
          sitting on the fireplace mantle and flicks a switch. A SONG
          comes on, loud. It's a haunting tune, we recognize it.
          St's the song Jake has been humming.
          Kurt continues his fumbling, drunken attempts at rape, tearing
          her hand out of his hair.

          SOMETHING'
          Adam lunges to the wall and tears down a sheet of the blts
          plastic Duvateen. He races over to us with the sheet --
          -- and everything turns blue. Now our sights and sounds aye
          muffled and distorted through the blue plastic. We see the
          image that has haunted Tom, the face of Kurt Damon, a blue
          demon as he grapples on top of us.

          IN TOM'S BASEMENT,
          Tom is sprawled out beside the corpse, their hands locked
          together. His color is cadaverous. He's suffocating. He
          thrashes.

          IN THE HOUSE,
          back in Samantha's point of view, we struggle, we thrash, it
          seems to go on forever. Slowly, the sounds become fainter and
          fainter and fainter...
          and everything stops. We hear the muffled voices of Kurt
          and Adam SCREAMING at each other.
          The sheet is ripped off. We stare up at them as Kurt and Adam
          stand above us, chests heaving, revolted looks on their faces,
          looking at us like we're a dog they just killed with their
          car.

          ADAM
          Oh, my God.

          KURT
          What the fuck did you do that for?

          ADAM
          Is she dead?

          KURT
          No shit she's dead.

          ADAM
          Oh, my God.

          KURT
          Look at her tongue, man.

          KURT
          I never saw nobody dead before.
          We start to fall back, and down, as if sinking into the floor.
          Kurt and Adam grow taller, further away. Their voices fade.

          ADAM
          I wish I wasn't here.

          KURT
          It's fuckin' gross.

          ADAM
          This isn't happening.

          KURT
          Fuckin' plastic over her face. Good
          thinkin', Adam.

          ADAM
          What do we do now?
          Kurt and Adam are very far away, blobs of light at the end of
          a black tunnel that's closing in around us. Just before
          everything goes completely black --

          INT BASEMENT NIGHT
          Tom's fingers twitch open and his hand pulls free of
          Samantha's. He opens his eyes and gulps air. The color
          returns to his face as he pulls his hand away from hers.
          But as he does so, he stops, staring intently at something in
          her fingers. We don't see what it is.
          Tom draws himself to his feet and climbs the ladder that leads
          upstairs.
          As he goes, we pause, looking between two rungs near the top
          of the ladder. In the darkened crawl space under the rest of
          the house --
          -- a pair of eyes stare at us.
          It's Kurt Damon. He twists around quickly and scoots back out
          under the house, the way he came in.

          EXT TOM'S HOUSE NIGHT
          Under the front porch, a wood frame access panel lies on the
          grass next to the foundation of Tom's house, where it has been
          removed. Kurt Damon wriggles out from under the house and
          comes onto the grass.

          CONTINUED:
          But the sound of the front door of Tom's house opening sends
          him scurrying back into the shadows. TOM'S FEET come down the
          steps and head off across the driveway.
          A moment later, Kurt darts out from'his hiding place and
          hurries across the street, toward his own house.
          "om, nearing the front steps of Frank's house next door,
          thought he heard something. He turns back, but Kurt is gone.
          Tom climbs the steps to Frank's house. Bouquets of flowers
          have been left here and there on the steps, along with a few
          candles and handwritten signs -- "Hang in there, Adam," "We
          Love You," that sort of thing.

          ON FRANK'S FRONT PORCH,
          Tom knocks on the front door. A moment later, Frank opens it.
          He looks devastated, shell-shocked, his eyes sunken from
          crying. He's wearing a red shirt we've seen before.

          TOM
          How's he doin'?
          Frank shrugs. Can't talk much.

          FRANK
          He might make it. Might not.
          Sheila's over there now, I'm headed
          back.

          TOM
          Frank, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
          because... I think I know why Adam
          shot himself. And I have to call the
          police about it. But I don't want you
          to hear it from them, I don't want
          Sheila to read it in the paper. You
          have the right to know before anybody
          else.

          FRANK
          What are you talking about?

          TOM
          Come with me.
          He nods toward his own house. Frank stares at him,
          frightened, but what could possibly be worse than what's
          already happened?

          FRANK
          Hang on a second.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          
          no. 

          CONTINUED:
          He turns and heads into the house. A few moments later he
          reappears, carrying his jacket.
          Tom leads him across the driveway. The Damon house is visible
          across the street. One by one, the 'lights flick on in its
          windows.
          Tom doesi.'t see. He and Frank reach the steps of his house
          and start up.
          FRANK (cont' d)
          This better be important.
          Tom doesn't answer, just opens the door and gestures for Frank
          to go first.

          INT DAMON GARAGE NIGHT
          In the Damon garage, HANDS scramble frantically through
          drawers and come up with a handgun. Now the hands find a box
          of bullets, shake them out onto a workbench.
          The hands load the gun.

          INT TOM & MAGGIE'S HOUSE NIGHT
          Tom closes and locks the front door. Frank looks at him ---
          well?
          Tom leads him toward the dining room.

          INT DAMON HOUSE NIGHT
          In the Damon house, the same hands pull on a pair of leather
          gloves. The gloved hands screw the top off a bottle of
          bourbon, raise the bottle to lips that drink heavily.

          INT DINING ROOM NIGHT
          Frank reacts to the ruined dining room. He looks at Tom.

          FRANK
          What the hell is goin' on around here?
          Tom goes to the trap door and lowers himself halfway through.
          Frank follows.

          INT DAMON HOUSE NIGHT
          The gloved hands carry the bottle of bourbon into the Damon
          living room, still under construction. The hands raise the
          bottle and offer it --

          -- to Kurt Damon. Harry, his father, is the one wearing the
          gloves. Kurt looks terrified.

          HARRY
          Drink up. You got this'started,
          you're God damn well gonna help finish
          it.
          Kurt takes the bottle and drinks. He starts to lower it, but
          his father forces him to drink more, and more, until he nearly
          retches.

          INT TOM'S BASEMENT NIGHT
          Tom and Frank stand on opposite sides of the grave, staring
          down at the corpse of Samantha Muller. Frank is horrified.

          FRANK
          How did you find this?

          TOM
          Does it matter?

          FRANK
          You don't know it was Adam and Kurt.

          TOM
          It was.

          FRANK
          But there's nothing to... you're
          talking like a nut, that's what people
          will say. This is just a body, it
          doesn't prove anything.

          TOM
          No, it doesn't.
          He bends down and lifts Samantha's lifeless hand. He pries
          open her fingers.
          She's clutching a tuft of hair.
          TOM (cont' d)
          But this probably will.
          Frank stares for a long moment, struck dumb. Finally, he
          turns his back. His shoulders heave as he cries, silently.

          EXT OUR BLOCK NIGHT
          In the misty night, the figures of Harry and Kurt Damon come
          out of their house and skulk across the street, toward Tom's.

          EXT ROAD INTO TOWN NIGHT
          Maggie drives, as fast as she can. Up ahead, red lights flash
          and gates fall in front of a set of railroad tracks. Train
          coming. Cars are stopped, waiting for it.
          Maggie pulls to a stop at the back of the line --
          -- then thinks better of it. She drops the car in gear, hauls
          it around the others, and bolts for the tracks. The train,
          nearly upon her, BLARES its horn.
          Maggie flies across the tracks and SLAMS through the gate on
          the other side, a split-second before the train HURTLES
          through the intersection behind her.
          She cuts it hard to the right to miss the waiting cars on the
          other side, and pulls it back on the road.
          She drives on, shaking like a leaf.

          INT BASEMENT NIGHT
          Frank is still sobbing, his back to Tom. Tom takes a step
          toward him, to comfort him.

          TOM

          FRANK-

          FRANK
          I mean...

          TOM
          Frank, we have to-

          FRANK
          I mean, what were we supposed to do?
          Tom stops.
          FRANK (cont' d)
          The kids come to us, she's already
          dead, the damage is done, there's
          nothin' gonna bring her back. But
          those boys, they've got everything
          ahead of them.
          Frank lets his jacket drop to the floor, revealing his right
          hand.
          He's holding the 38 with the carved white handle.
           He turns and looks at Tom.

          FRANK (coast' d)
          What were we supposed to do? Send our
          boys to jail for the rest of their
          lives? Our own flesh and blood? Over
          her?

          E3 T HOUSE NIGHT
          Hairy and Kurt Damon reach the front steps of Tom's house.
          They look up and down the block. There's no one out. No one
          to see.

          INT BASEMENT NIGHT
          Frank still has the gun hanging at his side, tears streaming
          down his cheeks.

          TOM
          Who you planning to shoot with that?

          FRANK
          Who do you think?

          TOM
          I think you haven't decided yet.
          He's right, and Frank knows it.

          FRANK
          Get out of here.

          TOM
          What are you gonna do, Frank?
          Frank raises the gun, in a fury.

          FRANK

          I BEEN LIVIN' WITH THIS FOR ALMOST A

          YEAR, YOU THINK ANYTHING YOU SAY IS

          GONNA MAKE ONE BIT OF DIFFERENCE TO

          ME?! GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!

          TOM
          Frank, I won't go until you-
          Frank aims the gun just to the left of Tom's head and pulls
          the trigger. The bullet CRACKS off the ladder.

          FRANK

          GET OUT! GET OUT!
          Tom starts up the ladder.

          INT DINING ROOM NIGHT
          Tom crawls out the trap door and hurries out of the dining
          room.

          INT LI"ING ROOM NIGHT
          Tom races ak. ross the living room, scoops hi: truck keys off
          the desk, opens the front door --
          and finds himself face to face with Harry Damon and his son
          Kurt. Harry SLUGS Tom in the face with the butt end of the
          gun.
          Tom falls to the floor, moaning. They step inside, quickly
          closing the door behind them. They don't speak.
          Kurt starts to drag Tom, who is still stunned, across the
          living room floor. Harry pulls a folded sheet of blue plastic
          from inside his jacket and spreads it out on the carpet.
          Kurt drags Tom into the middle of the plastic and drops him
          there. Tom is staring up at them, starting to regain his
          senses.

          KURT

          DON'T LOOK AT ME!

          HARRY

          ROLL HIM OVER!
          Kurt does. Tom, regaining his strength, starts to struggle,
          but Kurt puts his knee in the middle of. Tom's back and pulls
          his head back.
          Kurt is blubbering, hysterical.
          HARRY (con t' d)

          SHUT THE FUCK UP!
          Harry pulls the gun from his belt and raises it, putting it to
          the back of Tom's head.
          But then he lowers it, his hand shaking so hard he can barely
          hold onto it. He works up his nerve --
          HARRY (cont'd)

          AHHHHHH!!
          -- raises the gun again, puts it to the back of Tom's head,
          cocks it --

          and a spray of headlights splashes across the far wall of
          the room.
          Nobody moves.
          Outside, they hear k car pull into the driveway and park. The
          engine shuts off.
          Kurt looks at his father, panicked.
          Harry looks down at Tom.
          Tom closes his eyes and prays.

          EXT DRIVEWAY NIGHT
          Maggie-pulls the keys from the ignition and gets out of the
          car. She walks toward the house, looking anxiously around the
          neighborhood.
          As she reaches the steps, the light in the living room window
          abruptly clicks off.
          She stops.
          She starts forward again, slowly. Now the porch light clicks
          off.
          It's real dark.
          Maggie digs the car keys out of her pocket and feels for
          something on the key chain. Something that's not there.

          MAGGIE
          Mace... shit.
          She starts up the stairs. She reaches the top. The last
          light that was on inside clicks off. Now the house is totally
          black inside.
          Remembering something, she pulls her purse around and feels
          inside it. She finds the butterfly knife, the one she found
          in Tom's pants. She holds it in her left hand, keys in her
          right.
          She goes to the door. She unlocks the deadbolt.
          Inside, she hears a SCURRYING sound.
          She unlocks the knob.
          She puts the keys back in her purse.

          She switches the knife to her right hand, keeping it closed,
          concealed.
          She opens the door.

          INT LIVING ROOM NIGF.T
          The room is pitch black, so b:Aggie leaves the door hanging
          open. Some light spills in from the street.

          MAGGIE
          Tom?
          No answer. She steps inside and fumbles for a light switch.
          She flicks it. Nothing happens.
          MAGGIE (cont' d)
          Are you here?
          She crosses the room to another light and CLICKS its switch.
          As the light floods the room:
          Harry, who was hiding behind the front door, BANGS it shut.
          Kurt Damon is still kneeling on Tom's back, holding one hand
          roughly over his mouth, trying to keep him quiet.
          MAGGIE (cont'd)

          WH-
          Harry raises the gun in his hand and points it at Maggie.
          She lunges toward Tom, but Harry grabs her by the arm and
          flings her roughly to the ground.
          Tom takes advantage of the moment to flip Kurt off his back.
          As the kid flies, Harry whirls, training the gun on Tom.

          HARRY

          DON'T MOVE!
          But Tom tries to scramble to his feet. Harry starts to
          squeeze the trigger --
          -- and SCREAMS in agony.
          Looking down, he sees Maggie has plunged the knife into his
          thigh. She rips it out and plunges it in again. Harry's arm
          flies up, the gun goes off, and the bullet RIPS through the
          ceiling.

          On the second floor, in Jake's bedroom (which Jake is not in)
          the bullet CRACKS up through the floorboards, tears through
          his mattress, and bursts through the little boy's pillow.
          The pillow explodes in a cloud of fea-hers, which fly
          everywhere.
          Feathers everywhere.

          INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT
          Tom crawls over to Maggie and grabs hold of her, putting
          himself between her and Harry, who still has the gun.
          Over at the fireplace, Kurt Damon pulls the poker out of its
          holder.
          Harry aims the gun.
          Kurt lunges forward with the poker.

          BANG! BANG!
          Two shots ring out from the doorway to the dining room. Harry
          clutches his chest and drops to the floor.
           They all turn. Frank stands in the doorway to the dining
          room, clutching his 38. Kurt rushes toward him, SCREAMING,
          poker raised high.
          Frank pulls the trigger two more times.
          Kurt goes down.
          Maggie SCREAMS. Tom huddles over her.
          Frank lets the weapon slip from his fingers. It hits the
          hardwood with a CLATTER.
          Tom and Maggie look up. Frank looks at them. In that red
          shirt, he is exactly the image Tom saw of him in his dream.

          FRANK
          They were gonna kill you, Tommy. You
          and Maggie both.
          Frank turns and walks to the front door. He opens it, walks
          out onto the porch, and sits down on the top step, facing the
          street.
          Tom looks at Maggie. They're both in shock, can hardly speak.

          They hold each other.

          EXT FRONT PORCH NIGHT
          Tom comes out of the house. Frank, sitting on the top porch
          step, makes no attempt to flee. Tom sits down beside him.
          From all around the block, voices are starting to rise up --
          "Did you hear that?" "What the hell?!" "Somebody call a
          cop!" Frank shakes his head.

          FRANK
          Cold-blooded murder. I can't let
          something like that happen. Not here.
          He looks at Tom.
          FRANK (con t' d)
          This is a decent neighborhood.
          A few tentative faces gather across the street, staring at
          Tom's house, wondering what the hell. A SIREN wails in the
          distance.

          TOM
          I thought so, Frank. I sure as hell
          always thought so.

          INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR DAY
          A NEWBORN BABY stares up at us from inside a rolling bassinet.
          The bassinet is wheeled swiftly down a hospital corridor by a
          NURSE. It's a long trip, wherever it's going, but the baby
          waits patiently, staring up at the ceiling, eyes open.
          Above the baby, the lights streak by, white blurs.
          The Nurse leans down and looks at the baby. To the baby,
          she's just a fuzzy blob.

          rooms whiz by, brown smears.
          NURSE (cont' d)
          Just around this corner!
          She rolls the bassinet around a corner and toward one or in
          particular.
          The baby sees a bunch of shapes inside the room.

          INT HOSPITAL ROOM DAY
          Maggie, who has recently given birth, struggles to sit up in
          bad as the Nurse rolls the bassinet into the room. Tom,
          grinning, gets up from the chair he's sitting in with Jake.

          NURSE
          Meet the family!
          She picks up the baby and holds her out to Maggie, who takes
          her eagerly.

          MAGGIE
          Hi, baby, did you sleep well? I sure
          didn't.
          The baby sees Maggie's face, blurry, but friendly.
          Tom leans in.

          TOM
          So you're the one that's been kicking
          my wife!
          The baby sees Tom's blurry face. Jake steps up, onto a step
          stool, so he can see over the edge of the bed.

          JAKE
          Let me see, let me see!
          Maggie turns the baby so she's facing Jake. The infant looks
          at her older brother. At first, his face is as blurry as
          everybody else's. But slowly, Jake's face becomes crystal
          clear, even though everything around him stays out of focus.
          JAKE (cont' d)
          Can I hold her?

          MAGGIE
          If you're very, very careful. Climb
          up here.

          (CONTINUED)


          

          120. 

          CONTINUED:
          Jake climbs up on the bed. Maggie puts some pillows around
          him and carefully places the baby in his lap. Jake looks down
          at the infant. His expression becomes very serious. Gently,
          he reaches out with one hand and puts his fingertips on the
          baby's forehead, the same way he did to Tom's forehead that
          first night.
          The baby and Jake stare at each other for a long moment. So
          long, in fact, that the adults become uncomfortable.

          NURSE
          Well, they... certainly get along,
          don't they?
          Suddenly, Jake breaks into a wide grin and looks up at his
          parents, thrilled. Then he looks back at his sister. He
          leans down and whispers softly in her ear.

          JAKE
          Don't be afraid of s t.
          Tom and Maggie look at each other.

    from a story by James Cameron

    AUGUST 11, 1993

    --------------------------------------------------------------

    1:06 AM DEC 30, 1999

    Blackness.  We hear:

                             VOICE
              Ready?

                             SECOND VOICE (LENNY)
              Yeah.  Boot it.

    A burst of bright white static exploding across the
    darkness.  A high whine on the audio track gives way to
    street sounds and rapid breathing.

    AN IMAGE wavers and stabilizes: A nervous POV.  We're in a
    car, sitting in the backseat, and we're nervous, the view
    swinging around, showing the street rolling by outside the
    windows, then whipping back to the two guys in the front
    seat.

    Our POV looks down at a SMALL RECORDING DEVICE in "our"
    hands.  A red LED is flashing.  We slip the recorder into
    a coat pocket.

                             OUR VOICE
              Okay.  It's goin'.  I'm recording.

    The guy riding shotgun, LANE, is just pulling a pantyhose
    over his head, smearing his features into a pig-like mask.
    He turns, DIRECTLY TO THE LENS, pissed off.

                             LANE
              Good one, dickhead.  Thanks for
              waitin' till I get this fuckin thing
              on.  You tryin' ta I.D. me, or
              what?

    He tosses another pantyhose right at us and we catch it.
    Our POV looks down, into the pantyhose, which comes up
    over our field of view.

    We realize: this is not some ride-along verite video.

    WE ARE ONE OF THESE GUYS.  Real honest-to-God point of
    view, with no cuts, no music.  This is not film, it is
    human experience.

    The driver is a Hispanic guy named "SPAZ" DIAZ.  Lane is a
    white guy who looks very strung out.  Couple of
    crackheads.  The car is a mid-seventies barge, piebald
    with primer.

                             LANE
              Next alley... just pull in slow.
                      (turning to us)
              Hurry up will ya.  Here.

    He hands us a big stainless steel revolver.  The POV looks
    down as our shaky hands snap open the cylinder, check the
    rounds, snap it closed.

    Diaz pulls the barge into an alley.  The headlights
    illuminate overflowing dumpsters.  A Chicano busboy is
    making trash runs out the back door of a restaurant, which
    he has chocked open.  The busboy goes back inside.

                             LANE
              Let's go.

    Out of the car, quickly, our own breathing loud in our
    ears.  We even hear our own heartbeat, racing now.
    Through the door, after Lane, moving fast.

    Into the kitchen.  Fluorescent glare.  The busboy turning,
    surprised, Lane putting the shotgun in his face.  Freezing
    him.  Lane puts a finger to his lips: "quiet" in any
    language.

    Our hand puts the magnum in the THAI COOK's face.  We get
    them down on the greasy floor, Lane controlling them with
    the shotgun.  He looks at us, snaps his eyes toward the
    front room.

    We hear voices as we approach the swing door.  Go through.

    Whip pan left, then right.  Scoping the layout.  Low-rent
    THAI place.  Red wallpaper.  Closing time.  Middle-aged
    Thai OWNER, by the cash-register, counting money.  Young
    Thai WAITRESS, cleaning up.  They look up, stunned, as we
    put the gun on them.

                             OUR VOICE
                      (shouting, edgy)
              Don't move, don't talk, don't do
              nothing.

    Our POV is whipping around, from the front door to the
    owner to the kitchen where Lane is standing in the doorway
    covering the cook and busboy, back to the owner as he
    steps back from the cash-register.

    We scoop up the big wad of bills: seven, eight hundred
    bucks in tens and fives.

    Now yelling, herding the owner and the waitress into the
    kitchen, the owner trying to calm the girl in singsongy
    Thai, Lane shouting at him to shut up.

    Into the walk-in cooler.  The steel door closes on four
    scared pair of eyes.  POV looking around, seeing... a
    dish-rack.  Our hand pulls out a spoon, drops the spoon
    handle through the hole in the cooler door-latch.  Locking
    them in.

    Lane heading out the back door.  Laughing, as he looks at
    the wad of cash our hand is waving in front of him.
    We follow Lane to the car.  Snap a look down the alley one
    way, then the other.

    Shit!  Cop Black-and-White pulling into the far end of the
    alley.  Heartbeat goes triple time.  Scrambling into the
    car.

    Door not even closed and SPAZ has it in reverse, burning
    rubber as he launches back down the alley.
    SCRUNCH!  The car grinds along one wall as SPAZ steers
    wildly backward.  Sparks right next to us.  Then--
    KBOOM!  As we slam into a dumpster and push it right out
    into the street.

    The cop has his lights and siren on, and is roaring at us
    as SPAZ cranks the wheel and punches it down the street.
    He curses in English and Spanish as he weaves between
    cars.  We pull off the stocking to see better.

    The cop car surges onto the street behind us.

    Looking ahead.  A red light.  Cars stopped, blocking the
    way.  Cutting to the right, onto the sidewalk, around the
    cars, into the intersection.

    A near miss with cross traffic, then accelerating.
    Another red light ahead.

                             LANE
              Don't stop!

    Truck entering the intersection.  Everyone yelling.  SPAZ
    cuts the wheel but too late...

    Clipping the truck and spinning.
    The street outside smearing past like the view from a
    Tilt-a-whirl.

    Then KBLAM!  Hitting something, God-knows-what, and
    launching up and over, and--

    KRUNCH!  Crushing metal and an explosion of broken glass.

    It gets quiet and still.  Tinkling glass as Lane moves.
    Then SPAZ is screaming.  The car is upside down.

    Crawling out of the side window.  A frenzy now.
    Whip pan to see the cops pulling up.

    Then whipping back to the wreck.  The engine is burning.
    Flames spreading rapidly.  SPAZ inside, pinned, upside
    down, blood pumping across his face.

    Our hands pulling Lane out.  He comes up running.

    We run after him, sprinting toward the welcoming darkness
    of an alley.

    Panting breath and heartbeats and sirens and somebody
    yelling.
    Gunshots.  Looking back.  Cops next to their car, firing.
    Ahead, Lane running into shadow.

    Then a door opening, a man coming out of a metal firedoor.
    Lane grabbing him, throwing him out of the way, holding
    the door open as we dive through into--

    A stairwell.  Lane sprinting up, two steps at a time.
    Trying the door at the second floor landing.  Locked.
    Shit.

    Running up.  Dizzying whirl as we run, up and up.

    The POV is finally broken by a...

                                                 CUT TO:

    INT.  UNDERGROUND GARAGE

    But we don't know where we are yet.  We see a man in
    extreme close-up: just his eyes and mouth.  The eyes are
    closed, the eyeballs tracking under the lids, like he is
    watching a movie in there.  This is LENNY.

                             LENNY
              This is great... the doors are all
              locked.  Who are these losers,
              friends of yours?

                                                 CUT TO:

    BACK TO POV as we reach the fifth floor landing.  Lane is
    coming unglued as he finds this door locked.  We look
    down, see cops coming two floors below.  One cranks off a
    couple rounds at us and we snap back from the railing.
    Pounding up the last flight.  Finally!  The door is
    unlocked.

    Blasting through it, behind Lane, onto the roof.  Running
    all out past AC units and pipes, air vents.  Looking up:
    an LAPD helicopter orbiting close.  It flicks the xenon
    onto us and we are running in a vibrating circle of blue
    daylight.

    Running along the edge of the roof.  Looking down.  Car
    burning upside down in the street below.  The gas tank
    explodes, filling the street with orange light.  We don't
    slow.  We're running all out.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              Wow... the gas tank is a nice touch.
              Oh, oh, end of the line boys.

    Ahead, in POV we see the edge of the roof coming up.
    Beyond it is another building, about ten feet lower and
    separated by a 20 foot alley.

    But Lane doesn't slow down.  He leaps across the void and
    makes it to the other building, landing in a sprawl.
    We reach the edge and look down.  Six stories.  No ladders
    or fire-escapes.  Whip to behind us.  Cops running across
    the roof.

                             LANE
              Come on!  Fucking jump man!

    The POV backs up from the edge and then runs toward it...
    Out into the void.  Moving... airborne... then...
    WHAM!  Right into the parapet wall.

    Slipping down.  Brick wall right in our face.  Bloody
    fingers grabbing for a rusty piece of pipe running along
    the edge.

    Looking down... feet dangling over a sixty foot drop.
    A cat walking through a patch of light in the alley below,
    oblivious.
    Breathing raspy.  Snapping a look up as the pipe gives
    way.
    A keening whine coming from us as we scramble to climb up
    but...
    Snapping a look down--
    Walls rushing past, sound of wind, and our own raspy
    scream--
    Ground rushing up--

    Split second impression of a cat, looking up, yowling and
    running out of the way as--
    Pavement fills frame.  A burst of violent red light.
    Sound like a gunshot... but no echo.

    Only silence.  And blackness.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE

    Lit by miles of fluorescent.  Empty and echoing.  Close on
    Lenny.  He has something on his head.  Something that
    looks like a mutated set of Walkman headphones, except
    they have little gecko fingers that fit along the temples
    and over the forehead.  PLAYBACK "TRODES".  Lenny whips
    off the trodes, gasping as if he got gutpunched.

                             LENNY
              Goddamnit!  You know I don't deal in
              snuff.  How many times I hafta tell
              you?!

    Lenny is with a guy everybody knows as "TICK", a pale-
    skinned creature of the night in T-shirt and leather
    jacket.  Tick is a bottomfeeder in the techno-underground
    of the near future.

                             TICK
              Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Well you could've at least warned
              me.  You know I hate the zap... when
              they die.  It just brings down your
              whole day.  Jeez, Tick.

                             TICK
              Sorry.

    LENNY NERO is low thirties.  Handsome.  Charming.  And you
    better check to see if you still have your ring after you
    shake with him.  He is wearing an expensive Italian
    jacket, and what he thinks of as a "power tie." His Rolex
    isn't real.  His greasy hair is too long and curls around
    his collar.  He needs to shave.  A little sleazy.  But he
    has energy, and heavy street smarts.

    Lenny is sitting on the hood of his '97 BMW 1035i.  Tick
    is facing him, sitting in the back of his beat-to-shit
    70's van.  There are a lot of tapes and tech stuff piled
    inside the van.  Lenny has a Haliburton case open next to
    him, like a drug dealer.  In fact the whole setup looks
    like a drug deal, but it's not.  Though it is illegal.
    The case holds Lenny's personal playback deck, his trodes,
    and a rack of the little tapes in which he deals.  They
    are about the size of DAT tapes, and hold about 30 minutes
    of sensory experience... everything a person sees, hears,
    and feels... recorded directly from the cerebral cortex at
    the moment it is happening.

                             LENNY
              How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't
              the cops put it in evidence?

                             TICK
              With all the blood I guess they
              didn't see the rig.  Guy had it
              under a wig.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, but how'd it get to you?

                             TICK
              I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.
                      (off Lenny's impatient
                       look)
              Okay, okay... I got a deal with some
              a the paramedics.  My guy pages me
              and I pick it up at the morgue.  So
              whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be
              worth at least a grand.  Right?

                             LENNY
              Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I
              don't deal this kind of product, you
              know that.  I'll give you four for
              it, cause I've gotta cut off the
              last bit.  And my customers want
              uncut.

                             TICK
              Fuck that!  The last part's the
              best.  You dry-dive six stories and
              blammo!  Jack right into the Big
              Black.

                             LENNY
              I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's
              policy.  I got ethics here.

                             TICK
              Yeah, when did that start?  Come on,
              man!  It's what people want to see,
              and you know it.

                             LENNY
              So lay it off to somebody else.

                             TICK
              Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I
              got to get this rig fixed.  Look at
              it...

    Tick holds up a zip-lock bag containing the Walkman-sized
    stainless steel CORTICAL RESONANCE RECORDER, the record
    deck we saw earlier in the POV.  Also in the bag is the
    SQUID NET, a matrix of sensors designed to conform to the
    human head (this is different from playback trodes).  The
    whole works are covered with congealed blood.

                             TICK
              Give me six at least.  This's a good
              clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, well, the first part's okay.
              Better than the usual soaps you
              bring me.

                             TICK
              Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always
              bring you choice.

    Lenny fishes around in a cardboard box at Tick's feet,
    pulling out a tape.

                             LENNY
              Sure, like this low-grade shit here,
              some girl in a fight with her
              boyfriend... it's a test-pattern.
              Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.

                             TICK
              Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me
              real life.  Bring me street life.
              And, like, one man's mundane and
              desperate existence is another man's
              Technicolor.'

                             LENNY
              I said that?  Look, I'll take it for
              five, and you'll make out okay,
              because in this case it's pure
              cream, you don't have to cut
              anything back to the wearer.

                             TICK
              Ha!  That's for fucking sure.

                             LENNY
              What else you got?

                                                CUT TO:

    MONTAGE/SERIES OF SHOTS

    Lenny in his BMW, driving through the LA streets.
    Streetlights and neon flare across the windshield in a
    calligraphy of light.  Lenny works the cellular, gets
    messages on his DIGITAL PAGER, weaves in and out of
    traffic -- punches the buttons on his radio, changing
    stations all the time.  Raw, nervous energy: like a kid
    who can't stay still.  It's a hard hustle in the big food
    chain.

                             LENNY
              Look, Jerr.  I'm nothing if not a
              man of my word.  I'll drop the money
              by tomorrow, next day latest.  It's
              a little crazed right now.  Yeah, on
              my mother's eyes, I swear.  Thanks,
              buddy.
                      (hangs up)
              Prick.
                      (to the car ahead
                       honking)
              What kinda move you call that?!
              Lemmings.

    Lenny turns up the radio.  SELECTED DRIVE-BY IMAGES, as
    the talk-radio provides commentary.

    Lenny's car passing under glowing Santa Clauses on the
    light-poles.  Banners proclaiming the coming "Millennium
    LA" festivities.

                             TALK-RADIO HOST
              ... it's a little after 2 am on
              December 30th, 1999... the second to
              last day of the whole darn century,
              and the phone lines are open.  Dan
              from Silverlake, you're on the air.

    Transition to a rougher section of town.  Buildings roll

              Uh, hi.

                             HOST
              So Dan, are you looking forward to
              the New Year?

    A building is burning out of control.  In the foreground,
    silhouetted, a drunk sleeps soundly on a bus-bench.

                             DAN
              Not really.  I mean what's the
              point?  Nothing changes New Years
              day.  The economy sucks, gas is over
              three bucks a gallon, fifth grade
              kids are shooting each other at
              recess... the whole thing sucks,
              right?  So what the hell are we
              celebrating?

    A shanty-camp of homeless people under a freeway overpass.
    Homes made of cardboard and carpet remnants.  Their lives
    in shopping carts.

                             HOST
              You're a glass-is-half-empty kind of
              guy, aren't you Dan?  Well I for one
              happen to think that us making it
              2000 years is worth celebrating--

    Lenny cuts him off, punching to another station, and MUSIC
    blasts.  Something fast... a rap-metal hybrid.  Anger and
    energy.

    WE CUT IN fast blitzes of images like a burst of automatic
    weapons fire: helicopters on patrol, people running in the
    streets, buildings smoldering, fists raised, shouting
    people, paramedics rushing a body into an ambulance,
    Korean store owners armed to the teeth, a body covered by
    a yellow plastic sheet, blood running down the gutter.
    Cops in riot gear, with M-16s, on patrol in a Hispanic
    neighborhood.

    BACK TO LENNY coming out of a bar with a nervous
    businessman.  We don't hear the conversation.  MUSIC OVER.
    Lenny palms a roll of bills from the guy as he slips a
    squid tape into the pocket of the businessman's suit
    jacket.  Lenny claps him on the shoulder and walks away.
    Lenny's beeper goes off and he pauses to look at the
    number.

    ON LENNY DRIVING.

    Ahead, through the windshield we see a police checkpoint.
    The cops have thrown a block across the street and are
    shinning their lights in the cars as they creep through.
    Lenny slaps his ID against the side window with one hand,
    not missing a beat in his conversation.  This is just part
    of life in LA.

                             LENNY
                      (on cellular)
              Jimbo.  I'm there, Jimmy.  Right now,
              can't you hear me knockin'?

    CUT TO LENNY working his way through a crowded club, music
    pounding.  Strobe lights.  We don't see much.  He hears
    his phone rings and pulls the tiny DIGITAL CELLULAR out of
    his breast pocket.  Sticks a finger in his other ear and
    answers.

    CUT TO LENNY, back in the BMW, on the streets.  On the
    move.

                             LENNY
              -- so you line up the talent, shoot
              the clip, get it to me by Monday.
              OK?  Client wants a guy and two
              girls, the guy wears... yeah, I
              know, thinks he's being original.
              Girls have to be young.  So don't
              use your mother like you usually do.
              Yeah, you too, pendejo.  And no big
              tits... French tits.  That's it...
              like Champagne glasses... you got
              it.  What a pro.  Page me.

    LENNY PULLS UP to the security checkpoint of a gated
    community.  The white upper-middle class hiding behind
    walls and paid security.

                             LORI
              If you read the Bible, Mark, you'd
              know that there won't be another
              thousand years.  Right now we are in
              the Last Days, as foretold in the
              book of--

                             HOST
              The Last Days?  You mean the coming
              of the Apocalypse, right?  The
              Rapture?

    Lenny fishes around in the glove compartment, flipping
    through about twenty plastic security passes for different
    parts of town, all bogus.  He finds the right one and
    flips it onto the dash.

                             LORI
              Yes, that's right.  You only have to
              look at the signs... there are wars
              and rumors of wars--

    The RENT A COP at the guardshack hits him with his light.

                             LENNY
                      (lying)
              I live here.

    The cop waves him through.  Lenny is the right color.

                             HOST
              Now just so the rest of us know how
              much time is left, when is the
              Rapture supposed to hit, exactly?
              Is it midnight New Year's Eve?

    And WE CUT to a burst of news videotape, enlarged, noisy,
    distorted... images of a great gathering in the desert,
    the faithful waiting for God's sign as the millennium
    approaches.

                             HOST
              Is that midnight LA time, or Eastern
              Standard or what?  I mean, what time
              zone is God in, anyway?

                             LORI
              I pray for you all.

    Lenny's BMW cruises past an overturned burning car.  There
    is no-one around.  He barely glances at it.  Common sight
    these days.  If it is the end of the world, Lenny's not
    going to let it break his rhythm.

                             LENNY
                      (cellular)
              I just got something in, Bobby, you
              might appreciate.  A 211 at a Thai
              joint goes south, and these three
              scuzzballs end up in a gun-and-run.
              It's a beauty, two thumbs up.
              Parental discretion advised.  I'm
              talking it's the master, not some
              stepped-on copy.  One of a kind.

    LENNY INSIDE A GLOOMY BAR.  He slides into a booth with
    NORM SKINNER, a paunchy guy with thinning hair who dresses
    too young.  A pretty, stoned-looking girl is leaning
    against Skinner.

                             LENNY
              Yo, Skinner.  The Skin Man.
                      (fingering his
                       jacket)
              Red leather.  Nice feminine touch.

                             SKINNER
                      (laughing)
              Fuck you, Nero.

                             LENNY
              Whattya got for me?

    CUT TO: POV of a woman writhing above us in ecstasy.
    Lovemaking in point-of-view.  We look down, see OUR BODY,
    a woman's body... our hands moving over the other woman's
    torso.  The image is dark, a primal impression.  Sound of
    harsh breathing, rustling sheets.

    BACK TO LENNY in the booth with Skinner.  Lenny has
    Skinner's tape running in a playback deck clipped to his
    belt, next to his pager.  He is hunched over the table,
    "sampling" the merchandise by touching a few of the trode
    pads to his temple without putting on the whole headset.
    Like a coke dealer taking a little on the fingernail.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, I can use this...
                      (to the stoned girl)
              ... but honey you gotta move your
              eyes slower next time.  It's too
              jerky.

                             SKINNER
              It was her first time, Lenny.  Cut
              her some slack.

    TIGHT SLOWMO SHOTS... ABSTRACT: SQUID tapes and money

    TIGHT CU LENNY, through the windshield of his car.  Neon
    moving over him.

    NEWS FOOTAGE: LAPD Aerospatiales circling, their xenon
    lights turning night into day, giving the impression of a
    futuristic war zone.

    INSIDE THE COCKPIT, the infrared camera shows green-screen
    images of people in cars, in their homes... like footage
    of hyenas shot at night in total darkness.

    The impression is of a society under siege, an occupied
    nation... a watched society where the camera eye and the
    police spotlight define our reality.

              My name's DeWayne, and I got a New

              Hey, yo Five Oh, you better get down
              with 2-K.

    CRASH Unit cops with a bunch of Salvadoran gang kids
    racked up against a storefront.  A dozen 16 year-old girls
    and guys, hands against the wall, acting bored, as the
    cops walk up and down, reading IDs.

                             HOST
              2-K?  What's that DeWayne?

    A group of cops have two black guys proned out.  Nearby a
    crowd jeers, shouting insults.  A black kid throws a beer
    bottle and one of the cops chases him into the crowd.

                             DEWAYNE
              2-K.  The big two thousand.  Comin
              tomorrow night.  Out with the old

              He like to keep it the way it is.
              But we going to take it, make it
              new, make it our own.  History gonna
              start right here, right now--

    LENNY cuts him off as his cellular call connects.

                             LENNY
              Hi, Dave, this is Lenny.
                      (pause)
              Nero.  Lenny Nero.  That's right.
              Oh, is it late?  Sorry.  It's just
              that I have something that might be
              of interest, and since I always call
              you first--
                      (pause)
              Uh, huh.  Well, what would be a good
              time?  Okay, sure.  Catch you then.

                                                CUT TO:

    A GAME ARCADE.  Light and noise as the customers drop
    quarters for synthetic thrills.  Lenny is talking to a
    nice-looking street kid in his early 20's named EDUARDO.

                             EDUARDO
              Let me get this straight... you
              gonna pay me 200 bucks to put on a
              hair net and bang some beautiful
              babe.  I don't know, I gotta think
              about this.

    Lenny smiles and pulls out a SQUID-net.  He motions
    Eduardo into the shadows.

                             LENNY
              Okay, let's get you wired up.  I
              hope this axle grease you got in
              your hair doesn't screw up the squid
              receptors.

                             EDUARDO
              What's all this squid shit?

    As Lenny works, fitting the network of sensors over
    Eduardo's head, he holds class.

                             LENNY
              Superconducting QUantum Interference
              Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's
              gonna be a test.

                             EDUARDO
              Hey, fuck you, man.

                             LENNY
              Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a
              sense of humor at all times.  Okay,
              the receptor rig... what I'm putting
              on your head... sends a signal to
              the recorder.
                      (Lenny holds up the
                       recorder)
              See we call it "being wired," but
              there's no wire.  You gotta keep the
              recorder close... five, six feet
              away max, like in your jacket pocket
              by the bed or wherever you're going
              to close escrow, know what I mean?

                             EDUARDO
              Yeah, right.

    Lenny fits a wig from his briefcase over Eduardo's head,
    turning him into a headbanger.  Eduardo scowls at this
    set-back to his suavete.

                             LENNY
              Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes
              around.  Don't look in the mirror or
              you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a
              half hour of tape, so give me some
              lead-in to the main event.  But
              don't wait too long, I don't want to
              be going out for popcorn.  And don't
              act natural.  Don't act at all.
              Just forget the thing is on.  Got
              it?

                             EDUARDO
              No problem.

                             LENNY
              A star is born.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  TRAIN YARD - NIGHT

    A woman's feet moving along the steel rail of a train
    track at night.  The woman has no shoes, her feet bare.

    IRIS stumbles along the track, clutching one shoe
    pointlessly to her chest.  She is swearing and crying,
    runny mascara leaving two tragic streaks down her pale
    face.  Despite this we see that she is attractive, though
    her dress and make-up seem designed to convey overt
    sexiness.  Her white skin is complemented by a wild mane
    of curly red hair.

    She is in her early twenties, and the harshness of her
    life has just begun to harden her features.  She looks
    lost and without hope, in fear of her life.  Her breath
    comes in hitching sobs, and her eyes are wild.

    She runs between cold steel walls of freight cars, looking
    behind her frequently.  A police helicopter is circling.
    Its xenon beam plays over the train yard, sweeping over
    the cars.  She hunches into the shadows of a freight-car
    as the beam passes over.  Looking under the cars she sees
    an LAPD patrol car cruising down a street adjoining the
    yard, its searchlight sweeping toward her.  It moves on.

    She continues her run, moving away from the direction of
    the patrol car.  She reaches a chain-link fence.  Crying,
    she scrambles over it, cutting her hands and ripping her
    dress.  Another patrol car passes two blocks away.  She
    crouches in the tall grass until it rounds a corner out of
    sight.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  ALLEY AND STREET - NIGHT

    Iris sprints down an alley between buildings.  Rats
    scatter into the shadows ahead of her.  She doesn't seem
    to notice.  All she cares about are the police lights, and
    the sound of the helicopter droning, circling.

    She pauses at the mouth of the alley, scanning the well-
    lit street beyond.  There are people here: downtown low-
    life street people.  A half-block away is a brightly lit
    sign marking the entrance to a Red-Line subway station.

    She walks along the sidewalk, her eyes on the sign,
    feeling exposed as she walks openly, her heart pounding.
    She is a mess, but in this section of town people barely
    glance at her.

    LOW ANGLE on her bare feet, standing out amid the shoes
    and boots of winter.

    SHE CROSSES the street, and reaches the sidewalk just as a
    black-and-white rounds the corner at the end of the block,
    behind her.

    IN THE CRUISER are TWO COPS, who are scanning the street.
    They look intense.  Revved up.  They are BURDEN SPREG, a
    massive, barrel-chested street-lifer in his mid-forties,
    and DWAYNE ENGELMAN, an aggressive hard-on in his twenties
    with a brush cut, a Nautilus body, and a face like a
    ferret.

                             ENGELMAN
              She's a hooker, vice'll have her in
              the book.  We can pick her up later.

                             SPREG
              No.  Now.

    IRIS knows the cops are behind her.  She is terrified to
    turn.  Finally she can't stand it any more.  She breaks
    into a run.  The patrol car speeds up suddenly, roaring
    after her.

    Iris sprints along in her bare feet, all-out like a track
    runner.  The black-and-white screeches to the curb next to
    her and the cops jump out.

    Iris hits the stairs down to the subway station at a full-
    tilt boogie, knocking down some poor old guy whose
    groceries go flying.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  SUBWAY STATION AND TRAIN

    Iris trips on the landing, spins sprawling across the
    filthy tile floor, and comes up running.  Panting with
    fear and exertion she clears the turnstiles like a
    hurdler.

    The cops pound down the stairs two at a time.  Spreg draws
    his 9mm.  In his eyes we see an unaccountable craziness...
    a hunter who has as much at stake somehow as the prey.

    Street people fall back as Spreg thunders through them.
    They aren't about to get in the way of this juggernaut cop
    and his boy wonder.

    The two cops reach the platform.  No Iris in sight.

    MOVING WITH THEM as they slow to a walk, scanning.  A
    couple of low-lifes standing around, waiting for trains,
    eye them warily as Spreg gets a call on his Rover.

                             DISPATCHER (V.O.)
              Do you request back-up?

                             SPREG
              Negative.  Suspect is a black male,
              age 35 to 40.  We're handling it.

    A train pulls into the station with a whoosh of air.  A
    few people board.  There is only the sound of the cops'
    footsteps as they move along the empty platform.  With a
    pneumatic hiss the train's doors begin to close.

    Suddenly Iris breaks from behind a column up ahead at a
    full sprint.  Spreg unleashes his size 13 cop shoes,
    thundering along the platform to intercept her.  Engelman
    straight-arms his pistol.

                             ENGELMAN
              FREEZE!

    Iris clears the doors just as they hiss shut.  Her
    momentum carries her clear across the car, where she slams
    into the far wall and staggers back, almost falling.  She
    gasps for breath and looks up to see...

    ... Spreg crashing against the outside of the doors she
    just came through as the train starts to move.  He tries
    to force the doors apart... can't.  He aims his gun
    through the window.

    Thinking fast Iris dives to his side of the car and
    presses herself up against the solid wall next to the
    door, where he can't see her.

    OUTSIDE, Spreg is running next to the accelerating train.
    He swings his pistol, smashing the window with the butt.

    Iris screams as Spreg lunges through the opening next to
    her like some uniformed nightmare and grabs her.  He is
    still running alongside, pulling on her.  Trying to drag
    her right out through the window.

    She struggles.  Bites his beefy hand.  He swears and lets
    go.  Then makes one last grab.  Gets his fingers into her
    long mane of hair.  Yanks on her.  She comes half out the
    window, screaming.

    Then... RIP!  The hair pulls off her head.

    Spreg drops away, behind the speeding train, holding a
    red wig.  He looks at it stupidly, then raises his pistol
    and fires at Iris.

    She jerks back through the window and drops to the floor.
    A couple of shots hit the metal outside.  We see Iris has
    short hair, platinum white.  In it are a few of the many
    pins which held the wig securely in place.  She gasps for
    air, sobbing and hugging her knees, trembling all over.

    SPREG STANDS on the platform, watching the train
    disappear, as Engelman runs up.  Spreg looks at the wig in
    his hand, disgusted.  He turns it and looks inside, at the
    cap.

    CLOSE ON THE CAP inside the wig: there is an intricate
    network of sensors in a grid over the entire underside of
    the wig.  The sensors are connected by wires, in a pattern
    like the veins of a leaf, bundling to a small, flat metal
    box, the size of a cigarette case.  It is a SQUID NET.

    Iris was wired.  Spreg just stares at the SQUID NET, eyes
    going crazy wide.

                             ENGELMAN
              Oh shit.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT./ INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    IT'S 4 AM.  Lenny trudges through a heavy security gate
    into the center court of his ratty building.  The pool
    furniture is in the pool.  Gang graffiti marks the walls.
    Bars on all the windows.  One of the doors looks like
    somebody opened it with an ax.  The pool lights give the
    place an eerie, dead glow.  Can out slick Lenny really
    live in this dump?

    Through a barred window we see Lenny approaching as we
    hear the OUTGOING MESSAGE on his answering machine in the
    F.G.

    BEEP.  And...

                             IRIS (V.O.)
              Lenny, goddamn it, you got to be
              there, you got to help me, come on,
              pick up, pick up...

    Through the window we see Lenny fishing in his pocket for
    his keys.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  ALL NIGHT GAS STATION - NIGHT

    Iris at a pay phone in the cold of an all-night gas
    station.

                             IRIS
              ... you got to be there for me...
              COME ON!  Shit, I'll call later.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    As Lenny unlocks the door, all he hears is Iris' "I'll
    call later." He picks up the phone as the connection
    breaks.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  ALL NIGHT GAS STATION - NIGHT

    Iris continues to grip the phone even after she has hung
    up.  She looks desolate, without hope.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    LENNY doesn't stop to play back Iris' message, or any of
    the twenty others on his machine.  He just deadbolts the
    door and locks a steel bar across the door frame, then
    carries his Haliburton...

    ... toward the bedroom.  And we see the truth of his
    reality.  Lenny's crib is a shit-box.  It is a small one-
    bedroom, barely furnished.  A couple of chairs.  Swap-meet
    couch.  Cardboard boxes full of tech gear stacked in the
    corners, unidentified electronics components piled on a
    table, cables strung everywhere.  God knows what this
    stuff is.  There is aluminum foil taped to all the
    windows.  Fast food cartons, empty Coke cans, pizza boxes
    everywhere.  The bachelor apartment from hell.  High-tech
    low-life.

    He goes into the bedroom.  Mattress on the floor.  Same
    infernal interior decoration, but this room is dominated
    by racks of tapes... Squid tapes.

    Lenny pours himself a vodka from a bedside bottle, takes
    off his clothes and hangs them over a chair.  He sits on
    the bed in his underwear, looking lonely and depressed.
    This is the private Lenny: No plans.  No dreams.  Nothing
    to look forward to but another day of the hustle.

    He puts a set of playback trodes carefully on his head,
    fishes around in a shoe box among a bunch of tapes,
    squinting at the hand-written labels: they all say
    "FAITH." Only the dates are different.

    He selects one and inserts it in the deck, makes some
    minute adjustments.  Sips his vodka.  Leans back.  Closes
    his eyes.  And hits PLAY.

    PLAY BACK SEQUENCE/ POV:

    We are moving along the Venice boardwalk, following a
    YOUNG WOMAN on Rollerblades.  By our motion, it is obvious
    that we are on Rollerblades too, and not doing so well.
    The woman is laughing, turning circles around us, cracking
    up at our discomfort.
    We hear Lenny's voice complaining a mile a minute, and we
    realize the POV is his.  The girl takes our hands, skating
    backward, towing us along the boardwalk.  It is a sunny
    afternoon, and it is the usual boardwalk freak show all
    around us.

    The woman is FAITH JUSTIN, a singer.  Lenny is desperately
    in love with her.  It's not hard to see why.  She is
    beautiful, in an alive, dynamic way.  Her hair is a wild
    dark mane, and her eyes are spectacular... intense.  She
    moves with a lithe, sinuous grace.  We are staring at her
    eyes instead of concentrating on skating.

    Whammo!  The POV spins and we are sitting, looking up at
    Faith as she circles, laughing.  She skates over to help
    us up.

    CUT TO LENNY, on his bed, smiling.  He punches Fast
    Forward.

    BACK TO POV.  A kinetic blur of digital hash, then...

    We are following Faith, now holding her skates, up the
    steps to a beach apartment.  Inside it is funky and
    comfortable.

    Music from a disk player she left on.  Bob Marley singing
    "Three Little Birds".  Faith, covered with a sheen of
    sweat, sways to the music as she goes into a bedroom.  We
    follow her.

    She comes out of the small bathroom with a towel, starts
    to dry off.  Sunlight comes in the window lighting up
    Faith like she is in a spotlight.  We move up behind her
    and take the towel away, and now we see Lenny standing
    behind Faith in the mirror over the dresser.

    He puts his arms around her and they sway together to the
    music.  He runs his fingers in lazy circles over her
    sweaty belly.  Then leans down and licks the sweat off her
    shoulder, all the while watching her in the mirror.  A
    voyeur recording his voyeurism through his own eyes, so he
    can replay and relive the moment.

    Their eyes meet in the mirror.

    They both watch as Lenny slides his hand up under her
    halter and caresses her nipples.  She moans softly,
    responding.  She turns to him, and our POV shifts directly
    to her.  She is right in front of us, in TIGHT CLOSE UP.
    The intimacy is power.

                             FAITH
                      (laughs)
              Hey, you going to watch or you going
              to do?

                             LENNY
              Watch and see.

    We lean toward her, until her eyes fill frame as they
    close in a kiss.  We (Lenny) keeps ours open.  Our hands
    pull her halter over her head.  Then she pulls up on
    Lenny's T-shirt, laughing.  We see it go over our eyes,
    blocking the view for a moment.

    Then Faith kisses Lenny's bare chest.  We are looking down
    at her, looking down across our body, Lenny's body, as
    Faith kisses lower, kneeling in front of us, unbuckling
    our belt and we--

    CUT TO LENNY in the here and now.  Lost in playback memory
    bliss.  He inhales sharply behind a wave of electronically
    recorded pleasure.

    BACK TO POV.  Lenny pulls Faith up to his face, kissing
    her, then pushing her gently to the bed, where we lie down
    together in a pool of sunlight slashing across the tangled
    sheets.  She looks up, right at us...

                             FAITH
              I love your eyes, Lenny.
                      (she touches our
                       eyelids)
              I love the way they see.

    CUT TO LENNY, lost in the swirl of sensation.  He touches
    his tongue to his fingertip.

    IN POV we look down at Faith as we enter her.  She gasps
    and closes her eyes, grabbing the headboard with both
    hands.  There is only the sound of gasping breaths, the
    creaking bed frame.  She rocks with the rhythm of our
    thrusts, borne away by the intensity until she cries out.

    CUT TO LENNY, reliving the past, under the electrodes.  He
    reacts to the past orgasm.  The tape ends, Lenny slowly
    takes off the trodes.  There is a tiny tear at the corner
    of his eye.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT/SERIES OF SHOTS

    2:14 PM, DECEMBER 30

    Lenny cracks an eye as the Sony 35" blinks on in alarm
    mode: news flashes of the day before New Year's Eve...
    police preparations for the epic Millennium L.A. shebang
    downtown, the National Guard doing riot prep, etc.

    Sunlight comes like lasers through holes in the aluminum
    foil over the windows.  Lenny goes to the kitchen in his
    underwear, searches for breakfast in the fridge, which is
    empty except for a red-white-and-blue 2-stick popsicle.
    Good morning.

    The TV screen shows a murder scene with cops milling
    around, yellow plastic over three crumpled forms on the
    ground.  It cuts to a file photo of a severe-featured
    black man.

                             ANCHORWOMAN
              ... bodies of two men found early
              this morning under the Hollywood
              freeway have been identified as rap
              star Jeriko One and bandmember James
              Polton, known to fans as "Replay".
              A third body, that of a woman, has
              not yet been identified.  With his
              band, the Prophets of Rage, Jeriko
              One's outspoken political stance
              and violent lyrics have stirred
              nationwide controversy...

    CUT TO: A little later.  Lenny sucks on the popsicle while
    he puts the night's wardrobe together.  This is a ceremony
    he observes carefully.  Suit laid out on the bed, shirt
    beneath the jacket.  Lenny matches a tie to the ensemble
    -- well, maybe -- tries another -- that's the one.

                                                CUT TO:

    Lenny, behind the wheel of the BMW.  He is revved up, his
    look dialed-in.  He's on the move.  Seizing the day.

                             LENNY
                      (on cellular)
              You know I can get you anything you
              want, anytime you want it, just not
              right now.  We'll hook up at the
              club later.  Around eleven.  Yeah.

    Lenny wheels into a parking lot, finds a space, grabs his
    Haliburton and steps out, heading for the front door of
    the Coral Lounge.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORAL LOUNGE

    The decor is sort of Polynesian.  Goofy tropical motif
    murals on the walls.  The place has a mixed bag of
    customers, including upwardly mobile low-lifes who have
    graduated from the streets and use it as a kind of office.
    It is a crossroads for druggies, upscale hookers, junior
    entertainment suits slumming after a day in the pressure
    cooker.

    Lenny cruises through like he owns the place, greeting a
    number of the early regulars.  We get the impression he
    knows everybody, all the time, everywhere he goes.  He
    leans on the bar.

                             BARTENDER
              Hey, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Anything without an umbrella.

    He gets backslapped by a guy in a satin racing jacket:
    Fabrizio.

                             FABRIZIO
              Lenny my man, I think you want to
              meet a friend of mine.

    Lenny follows Fabrizio's look to a guy, dressed LA power-
    casual, sitting at a booth across the room.

                             LENNY
              Looks like money to me.

    Lenny grabs his drink off the bar and follows Fabrizio
    across the room.

                             FABRIZIO
              Don't forget your friends.

                             LENNY
              10 percent, Fabri, like always.

    They slide into the booth with KEITH.

                             FABRI
              Keith, this is Lenny.  Guy I was
              telling you about.  He can get you
              anything you--

                             LENNY
                      (cutting him off)
              Just a second.  Not to be rude,
              Keith, but I got to ask, are you a
              cop?

                             KEITH
              I understand.  No, I'm not.

                             LENNY
              You understand?  Attorney!  Right?
              Am I right?

                             KEITH
              That's right.

    Lenny sizes the guy up, looks around the edge of the
    table.

                             LENNY
              Tassel shoes.  Entertainment law,
              would be my guess.
                      (off the guy's scowl)
              Relax.  I just like to guess, is
              all.  It's my job to know people and
              what they want... what's behind
              their eyes.

                             FABRIZIO
              Lenny gives people their heart's
              desire.  Ain't that right, Lenny?

                             LENNY
              That's right.  My second question I
              gotta ask, so we get our bearings
              here... have you ever jacket in?
              Have you ever wiretripped?

                             KEITH
              No.

                             LENNY
                      (a winning grin)
              A virgin brain!  Well we're going to
              start you off right.  So what do you
              know about this?  Save us some
              time...

                             KEITH
                      (shrugs)
              Just what I've read.  That the
              technology was developed for the
              Feds, to replace the body wire.  And
              now it's gone black market.  So, uh,
              do I get the deck from you?

                             LENNY
              I'll set you up, get you a deck at
              my cost... since my thing is the
              software.

                             KEITH
              Clips.

                             LENNY
              That's right.  Clips.
                      (Lenny leans in,
                       working the guy)
              Look, I want you to know what we're
              talking about here.  This isn't like
              TV only better.  This is life.  It's
              a piece of somebody's life.  Pure
              and uncut, straight from the
              cerebral cortex.  You're there.
              You're doing it, seeing it, hearing
              it... feeling it.

                             KEITH
              What kind of things exactly?

                             LENNY
              Exactly anything.  Whatever you
              want.  Whoever you want to be.
                      (handing Fabrizio a
                       twenty)
              Fabri, get us another round, would
              you.

    Fabrizio gets the hint and heads for the bar.

                             LENNY
              You want to go skiing without
              leaving your den, you can.  But I'm
              assuming a guy like you, you wanna
              go skiing you fly to Aspen.  That's
              not what you're interested in here.
              It's about the stuff you can't
              have... right?  The forbidden
              fruit.

    Keith nods, mesmerized by Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Like running into a liquor store
              with a .357 magnum in your hand,
              feeling the adrenalin pumping
              through your veins.  Or...
                      (pointing discreetly)
              ... see that guy, with the drop-dead
              Philipino girl friend?
                      (Keith looks)
              Wouldn't you like to be that guy for
              twenty minutes?  The right twenty
              minutes.  I can make it happen.  And
              you won't even tarnish your wedding
              ring.

    Keith touches his ring self-consciously, then grins.

                             KEITH
                      (hooked like a carp)
              Sounds good.

                             LENNY
              I can get you what you want.  You
              just have to talk to me.  I'm your
              priest, your shrink, your main
              connection to the switchboard of
              souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa
              Claus of the Subconscious.  You say
              it, you even think it, you can have
              it.  You want a girl, you want two
              girls?  I don't know what your thing
              is or what you're curious about...
              you want a guy?  You want to be a
              girl... see what that feels like?
              You want a nun to tie you up?  It's
              all doable.

                             KEITH
                      (flushed, sweating,
                       ready)
              Talk to me about costs, here.

                             LENNY
              Listen, before we get into numbers,
              I want you to try a taste.  I got a
              deck with me.

                             KEITH
              What?  Right Here?

                             LENNY
                      (grinning)
              Step into my office.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORAL LOUNGE/MEN'S ROOM

    Close on Keith's face, as he sits on the sink counter
    reacting to a Squid tape.  He jerks... his mouth drops
    open... he gasps.  His hands start to move over his body,
    feeling it wonderingly.  He gasps again, tilts his head
    down, moans... and Lenny hits Pause on the Playback.
    Keith opens his eyes to a grinning Lenny.

                             LENNY
              You were just an eighteen year old
              girl taking a shower.  Are you
              beginning to see the possibilities
              here?

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  PARKING LOT/CORAL LOUNGE

    A figure moves stealthily from the shadows and approached
    Lenny's car: Iris, hair dyed black now, wearing jeans and
    a coat but still showing scars from last night's pursuit.
    She tries the door of the car: locked.  She looks toward
    the Coral Lounge, debates whether to go look for Lenny.
    Better not.

    She takes a Squid tape from her pocket, and scribbles a
    note on the label: "HELP ME.  IRIS." She drops the tape
    through a 2-inch gap in Lenny's sun roof... and it bounces
    off the seat, onto the floor.

    She looks through the windshield, totally distraught,
    trying to see where the tape landed... and sees the
    reflection of cop cruiser lights coming down the street.
    She crouches next to the BMW, trying to blot herself out.
    And when the cruiser passes, she slumps to the ground,
    crying, afraid to move.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORAL LOUNGE

    A man in his late 30s: longish hair, no shave since the
    weekend, army jacket bulking over a massive frame.  A
    daunting figure as he approaches the bartender.

                             MAN (MAX)
              Where is he?

    Bobby, the bartender, cocks his eye toward the restrooms.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORRIDOR/CORAL LOUNGE

    Lenny unlocks the men's room door and walks down the dingy
    corridor with her new customer, Keith.

                             KEITH
              Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get
              someplace a little less public?

                             LENNY
                      (grinning)
              You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops
              have more to worry about in this
              city than the squid-trade, believe
              me--

    Behind them, the door of the women's bathroom whips open
    and the guy in the army jacket grabs Lenny from behind and
    SLAMS him face-first into the wall, jamming a .45 against
    his skull.

                             MAN (MAX)
              Don't move!  That's it, assume the
              position you miserable techno-perv
              puke.

    Cop style, the man in the army jacket kicks Lenny's feet
    apart.  Starts to cuff him.

                             MAN
                      (to Keith)
              Beat it fuckwad.

    Ash-white, Keith lays a smoke trail down the hall.  On the
    main floor of the club, Fabrizio sees him splitting and
    hurries after him.

    Back in the corridor, Lenny spins around and shoves his
    attacker against the opposite wall.  The guy offers no
    resistance.  In fact, he's too weak from laughing.

                             MAN (MAX)
              Gotcha.

                             LENNY
              Damnit, Max, I was with a client!
              You think that's funny?  To mess
              with a man's livelihood?  It's not
              funny!

                             MAX
              You see the look on that preppy
              puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his
              Topsiders.

                             LENNY
                      (laughing a little)
              Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me
              money.

                             MAX
              Come on, amigo, the world's full of
              marks.  And nobody knows how to work
              'em like you do, pal.  You could
              sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a
              wedding ring!  Let me buy you a
              drink.

                             LENNY
              Least you can do.

    Max Peltier, which he mispronounces "Pelcher", slings his
    arm fraternally over Lenny's shoulder.  They cross to the
    bar.  Max roars greetings to several regulars, pushing
    between strangers like an out of control tractor.

                             REGULAR
              Yo, Pelcher!  Mad Max!

                             MAX
              Fuckin' A right I'm mad!  I might
              kill every man in here.  But first
              I'm buyin' my buddy here a drink.
                      (seeing another
                       regular)
              Hey O'Neal!  You were right, your
              wife does give good head.

    Max lurches onto a barstool and hunches there like a
    misanthropic bear, pounding the bartop.

                             MAX
              Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor!
              Double shots.  Make it Tres
              Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the
              best for my good friend Lenny, the
              finest cop that ever got thrown off
              the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.

                             LENNY
              Thanks, Max.

                             MAX
              D'you always have to dress like a
              fuckin' pimp?

                             LENNY
              This tie cost more than your entire
              wardrobe.

                             MAX
              That's not sayin' much.

                             LENNY
              It's the one thing that stands
              between me and the jungle.

    Max raises his double shooter.

                             MAX
              To the jungle!  Where outa the blue
              some shitbird can cap you in the
              back of the head and ruin your whole
              day.

    He downs it in two fierce gulps.

                             LENNY
              You were lucky, Max.

                             MAX
              Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with
              a .22-short floating in my brainpan,
              and a cop pension I can't live off
              of.  Good thing I wasn't any
              luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter
              right here!

    Bobby pours for Max.

                             MAX
              You seen Faith lately?

    Lenny reacts visibly to the name, his whole demeanor
    sagging.

                             LENNY
              Naw.  She won't call me.

                             MAX
              Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get
              past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by
              far the most outstanding woman a guy
              like you could ever hope to get, I
              mean it's completely and deeply
              humiliating that she's gone, but
              it's over, campadre.

                             LENNY
              Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your
              concern.

    CUT TO: Iris, working her way from the front door, staying
    on the fringe of the crowd, wary, moving toward Max and
    Lenny at the bar.

                             MAX
              I just hate to see you pining away.
              It makes me want to vomit, frankly.
                      (philosophically)
              Broken hearts are for assholes.

                             LENNY
                      (seeing Iris)
              Hey, Iris, you okay?

                             IRIS
              Lenny, I got to talk to you, it's
              serious...

                             MAX
                      (looking at her face)
              What happened, honey, some john get
              rough on you?

                             IRIS
                      (to Lenny)
              I mean talk private.  Please, I'm in
              trouble, and so is Faith.

                             MAX
                      (as Lenny reacts to
                       the name)
              There it is, the magic fuckin' word.

    Lenny takes Iris by the arm and pulls her away from the
    bar.

                             IRIS
              Can we go to your car?  There's
              something you have to see right
              away.

    He nods and steers her toward the front door of the Coral
    Lounge.

                             LENNY
              What's going on?

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  CORAL LOUNGE/PARKING LOT - NIGHT

    Lenny and Iris come out the front door.

                             IRIS
              It's a bad situation... if they get
              me I know they're going to -- OH
              SHIT!

    She bridles like a startled horse.  Lenny looks at what
    she sees: a red beam, sweeping the parking lot.  Must be
    the cops.  He turns back...

    She's gone.  What the hell?

    He looks back at the red light... and edges around the
    corner to see what the cops are up to...

    It's not a cop car.  It's a tow-truck, with Lenny's BMW on
    the hook.  Lenny runs to the TOW DRIVER, who looks like a
    biker only meaner.

                             LENNY
              Hang on, that's my car--

                             TOW DRIVER
              Not anymore.  Belongs to the bank.

                             LENNY
              Hey wait a second...

    Ignoring him, the driver has started the hydraulic lift,
    and Lenny makes the mistake of grabbing his beefy arm.
    The guy whips around, putting the muzzle of a .38 in
    Lenny's face.

                             LENNY
              Oh, yeah, that's the answer!  Two
              million years of human evolution and
              that's the best idea you can come up
              with?
                      (driver continues
                       with the hoist)
              Okay.  Look, whattya get to repo a
              car?  Two hundred?  Two fifty?  I'll
              pay you three fifty, right now.  All
              you gotta do is drop it off the hook
              and say you came by, your mark
              wasn't here.  Simple.  Make a few
              bucks.  Do a good deed.  Huh?

                             DRIVER
              You got the cash on you?

                             LENNY
              I was going to write you a check, if
              that's--

    The guy is getting into his truck.

                             LENNY
              Okay, okay, I totally respect that
              call.  I would want cash.  They'll
              take my check inside... I can see
              you're pressed for time, just give
              me two minutes... here keep my watch
              for collateral.

    He hands the guy his watch.

                             LENNY
              It's a Rolex.  Be right back.  Two
              minutes.

    Lenny gets to the front door of the Coral Lounge, turns
    just in time to see the tow-truck pulling out.  Lenny runs
    after his car, yelling, watching it recede.

                             LENNY
              Son of a bitch!

    Lenny walks back to the bar.  He sets his Haliburton up on
    the truck of a car and pops it open.  He takes out a tiny
    digital cellular phone and dials a number.  While it's
    ringing he takes another, identical Rolex knock-off out of
    the briefcase and slips it on.

    Follow the hand and phone to the face of a black woman.
    LORNETTE "MACE" MASON.  Late twenties.  Striking features.
    Hair pulled back tight to her skull.  She is driving, but
    we don't see the car, or anything but her face.

                             MACE
              Hello?  Hey Lenny, whatup?
                      (listens a beat;
                       then)
              Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Sure.  So what
              happened to your car this time?

    EXT.  CORAL LOUNGE - NIGHT

    A black limo pulls into the lot.  It is a Continental
    armored stretch, downsized from today's standards.  The
    door opens and Mace gets out.  She is compactly built,
    dressed in black slacks, a conservative black jacket,
    heavy rubber-soled shoes.  She glances around as she heads
    for the Coral Lounge entrance, the unconscious sweeping
    gaze of a security professional.

    Mace scopes the room quickly, professionally, then heads
    for the bar.

    ON Max and Lenny at the bar.

                             MAX
              See, if you packed your piece you
              could've made the guy see sense.

                             LENNY
              Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the
              line of a fine jacket.

                             MAX
              An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's
              embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen
              with you.
                      (as she slips up
                       behind them)
              Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?

    She plants herself between Max and Lenny and takes a
    generous handful of their nachos.

                             MACE
              Greetings, gents.
                      (to Lenny)
              So let's hear this week's sad story.

                             LENNY
              They jerked my wheels, d'you believe
              it?  I mean it's outrageous, the
              computer errors the banks are making
              lately.  Have you noticed?

    Mace and Max exchange a weary look.

                             MACE
              No.  I haven't noticed because I
              make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher,
              how's the P.I. business?

                             MAX
              Sucks.
                      (attention caught by
                       TV)
              Hey, Bobby, turn that up.

    The Bartender obeys: it's more news about the Jeriko One
    killing.  There's file footage of Jeriko and his band, the
    Prophets of Rage; interview with a lot of furious fans,
    mostly black inner city kids; and a news clip of Jeriko at
    an outdoor rally, exhorting the crowd with near religious
    fervor:

                             JERIKO ONE (ON T.V.)
              The LAPD is a military force turned
              against its own people.  We live in
              a police state!  The mayor and the
              city council sit up in their offices
              with their social programs that
              don't work... they're rearranging
              deck chairs on the Titanic.  But the
              new day is coming!  Two-K is coming!
              The day of reckoning is upon us.
              History ends and begins again right
              here!  Right now!

    Max raises a glass in salute to the TV screen.

                             MAX
              To the end of all things!
                      (slugs down the shot)
              You know how I know it's the end of
              the world?  Because everything's
              been done, every kind of music's
              been tried, every government's been
              tried, every fuckin' hairstyle.
              How you gonna make it another
              thousand years, for Chrissake?

    On the TV, clip of Jeriko's speech has been replaced by an
    interview with Jeriko One's manager.  TRAN VO.  Tran is
    Vietnamese, and around Lenny's age.  He's angular, suave,
    cool as an early frost.  Dialed in.  Lenny sees his face
    on the screen like a personal nightmare.

                             MAX
              I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used
              it all up--

                             LENNY
                      (riveted to the TV)
              Shutup a second!

                             MACE
              Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?

                             MAX
              Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.
                      (to screen)
              Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden
              goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer
              guy.

                             MACE
              But I mean isn't he Faith's new--
                      (she mouths the word
                       "boyfriend")

                             MAX
              Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You
              may trigger a maudlin display which
              will force us to tranquilize him.

    ON THE SCREEN, Tran is being jostled as he walks,
    answering the reporters questions in a glare of minicam
    lights.

                             REPORTER
              The LAPD have said they believe
              this is a gang-related incident.
              Can you comment on that, Mr. Vo?

                             TRAN
              We have no facts yet.  All we know
              for sure is that we have lost a
              great artist, that a great voice for
              change is now silent...

    Lenny, scowling, pushes away from the bar.  Mace goes with
    him.

                             LENNY
              Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just
              have a few stops, mostly on the west
              side--

                             MACE
              Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd
              drop you home, but I'm not taking
              you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've
              already pulled twelve hours today.

                             LENNY
                      (upbeat again)
              Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a
              big night.  Can't you feel it?  The
              energy in the air?  There's money to
              be made, dreams to sell.

                             MACE
              Sleaze to peddle.

                             LENNY
              Just a couple of hours.  It'll be
              fun--

                             MACE
              Excuse me.  What part of NO don't
              you understand?

                             LENNY
              Mace, you're my friend.  I need you.
              Plus I'll give you 25% of what I
              make tonight.

                             MACE
              Lenny, this may be a hard concept
              for you, but friends don't have to
              pay their friends.

    Lenny starts to whine like a puppy.  Mace gives up.

                             MACE
              Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got
              a pickup at the St. James.  I'll
              take you there, you can get a cab.

                             LENNY
                      (an arm around her
                       like a buddy)
              Mace!  You're a life-saver.

    INT.  LIMO - NIGHT

    As Lenny and Mace cruise the night streets, passing the
    ongoing pageant of cops and decay.  Mace glances at Lenny,
    sitting next to her in front, and at his omnipresent
    Haliburton.

                             MACE
              So, what's up with you?  Another
              busy night selling porno to
              wireheads?

                             LENNY
              No, wrong... I sell experiences.
              Sex is only part of it.

                             MACE
              Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.

                             LENNY
              Way I look at it, I actually perform
              a humanitarian service.  I save
              lives.

                             MACE
              Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.

                             LENNY
              Okay, take some executive... bored
              with his life, bored with his
              wife... he picks up a hooker or some
              girl at a bar.  Then he goes around
              for months, torn up worrying that
              he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his
              wife.  And maybe he really does
              catch something--

                             MACE
              Price he pays for being a
              scumsucking pig.

                             LENNY
              Everybody needs to take a walk to
              the dark end of the street sometime,
              it's what we are.  But now the risks
              are outa line.  The streets are a
              war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So
              you slip on the trodes, you get what
              you need and it keeps you from
              jumping your tracks.

                             MACE
              Lenny, this shit's illegal.

                             LENNY
              Define illegal.

                             MACE
              Me bailing your sorry pale ass out
              of jail twice in the last six
              months.

                             LENNY
                      (kidding)
              Yeah, but that was for love.

                             MACE
              Define love.

    EXT.  ST. JAMES CLUB - NIGHT

    Mace's limo wheels up to the hotel on the strip.

    A soberly-dressed Japanese executive is waiting next to
    the doorman.

    INSIDE the car, Mace spots him and scowls.

                             MACE
              Dammit, Lenny, you made me late.

    Lenny opening the door before the car stops.

                             LENNY
              What's his name?

                             MACE
              Fumitsu.

                             LENNY
              Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir,
              Leonard Nero, Security Express.
              Lornette Mason here is just
              completing our routine driver
              evaluation.  We do it to make sure
              that out VIP clients, such as
              yourself, are always treated as
              honored guests.  I just need to ride
              up front and take some notes, if you
              don't mind.

    Fumitsu nods politely and Lenny opens the car door for
    him.  Lenny jogs around behind the car to the front
    passenger door.

                             MACE
              Um, excuse me.
                      (can't stand to say
                       it)
              Sir.  Excuse me.  Mr. Nero.

    She walks calmly to him.

                             MACE
                      (hissing through her
                       teeth)
              What the fuck are you doing?

                             LENNY
                      (winning smile,
                       innocent)
              Coming with you.

                             MACE
              You will not live to see the
              morning.

    EXT.  HANCOCK PARK HOUSE - NIGHT

    As the limo stops at an elegant home in this top-bucks,
    old-line residential area.  There is a loud party in
    progress, with a couple of hundred guests spread through
    the house and backyard.  Mace scowls deeply as Lenny gets
    out of the car and starts into the party with Mr. Fumitsu.
    They are laughing uproariously and getting along like old
    friends.

    EXT.  HANCOCK PARK HOUSE - NIGHT

    Mace, having a cigarette with other security drivers,
    watches Lenny through the tall windows of the old Spanish
    house.  She sees him working the room, rubbing up against
    the money, networking.  No dialogue.  A pantomime of Lenny
    working his prime turf.  She stares at him for a while,
    then looks at her watch.  Sighs.

    EXT./ INT.  HANCOCK PARK HOUSE/GARDEN - NIGHT

    ... as a tall, stern figure suddenly slides into Lenny's
    path, a top cop named PALMER STRICKLAND.

                             STRICKLAND
              Nero.

                             LENNY
                      (uh-oh)
              Strickland.

                             STRICKLAND
              Commissioner Strickland.

                             LENNY
              Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you
              shitcanned my career, I don't even
              have to call you sir.  One of life's
              small pleasures.

                             STRICKLAND
              Aren't you peddling your wares a
              little far from your usual gutter?

                             LENNY
              I was invited here by a close
              friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right
              over there.

    Lenny waves.  Fumitsu waves back from across the room.

                             STRICKLAND
              I don't like disappointments, Nero.
              And do you know what disappoints me
              very much?

                             LENNY
              Your sex life?

                             STRICKLAND
              Your existence.

    EXT.  HANCOCK PARK HOUSE - NIGHT

    Mace sits in her limo, talking on the cellular.

                             MACE
              Now listen to me... you have to get
              to bed young man.  I mean it.  No
              watching "Tales from the Crypt".  I
              don't care what Cecile says.  I'll
              see you in the morning, baby.
              Night, night.

    As she hangs up, she glances out the window in time to
    see...

    Lenny flying over a hedge.  He lands on the sidewalk, then
    scrambles up and brushes himself off as TWO SECURITY TYPES
    loom toward him.  He adjusts his wardrobe and walks with
    dignity (but quickly) toward the car.

                             MACE
              Are we having a bad night?

                             LENNY
                      (glancing back)
              Let's talk in the car.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  MACE'S LIMO - NIGHT

    As Mace pulls out, Lenny starts fitting a pair of playback
    trodes to his head.  Mace glances at him in disgust.  He
    hits his playback button.

    Lenny's POV as he talks to Faith.  Back when things were
    good.  He's wiring her.  They are playful, like a couple
    of kids.

                             FAITH
              I feel like you're turning me into a
              VCR.

                             LENNY
              I just want to see what we're like
              together through your eyes.

    He turns OFF the record button.  STATIC.  Then TAPE
    RESTARTS.  We see the two of them standing together,
    reflected in a mirror.

    We are Faith now.

                             FAITH
              I don't feel anything.  Is it on?

                             LENNY
              Forget it's there.

                             FAITH
              Make me forget it, baby.

    He turns her to him.  They begin to make love.  Faith's
    face fills our field of view, eyes closed in dreamy
    passion.

    A sudden FLASH OF LIGHT.  Lenny opens his eyes to see...
    Mace's glowing countenance.

    She has stopped the car, torn the trodes from Lenny's head
    and tossed them out the window.  Now she's yanking him out
    of the car by his lapels.

                             LENNY
              Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is
              Armani.
                      (he looks at her)
              You angry?

                             MACE
              I've had enough of this shit.
                      (getting back into
                       the car)
              You're on foot, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              In LA?  Are you crazy?

    Mace starts to peel out, but Lenny leaps and plasters
    himself on the hood.  Mace pretends she doesn't see him.

                             LENNY
                      (as they drive along)
              Can I come in please?  I'm having a
              hard time hearing the stereo.

    Mace jams on the brakes and Lenny slides off in front of
    the car.  Now she starts to move forward...

                             LENNY
              I need my case.  It's still in the
              back.

                             MACE
              Get it.

    He quickly moves around the car and climbs in the back
    door.  Lenny grabs his Haliburton but instead of getting
    out, he leans through the divider window, next to Mace.

                             LENNY
              Listen, can we talk a little bit
              here, like two rational adults?

    Mace hits a button on the dash.  The privacy divider rises
    suddenly, pinning Lenny to the ceiling.

                             LENNY
              That would be no.

                             MACE
              I've had it.  No more wirehead shit
              in my car.  You understand?  You
              want to poach your lobes, do it
              somewhere else.

                             LENNY
              Okay, you got my attention, but this
              is cutting off the circulation to my
              head, here.  D'you mind?

    She lowers the divider, releasing him.  Lenny straightens
    his jacket and tie.  Runs a hand through his greasy hair.

                             LENNY
              I thought we were friends.

                             MACE
              No, see a friend is more than one
              person constantly doing favors for
              another.  You just suck people along
              with your schemes and your scams and
              your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I
              got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex-
              husband someplace who doesn't send
              me a dime of support... I'm just
              trying to hold on here.

                             LENNY
              So am I.  Just trying to get by.

                             MACE
              No, you're just trying to get off.

                             LENNY
              Macey... I've never seen you like
              this.

                             MACE
              Lenny, you're turning into some
              kinda squid-head low-life.  You're
              always broke, you just go from one
              score to the next.  And you're
              getting strung out... you don't even
              see it.  Getting high on your own
              supply like some crack dealer.

                             LENNY
              I know you wouldn't be saying all
              this if you didn't care about me.
              Thanks, Mace.  Really.

                             MACE
              Look, I gotta get some sleep.

                             LENNY
              You still like me, don't you?  We're
              still buddies?

    She hates it that she can't resist his pathetic charm.

                             MACE
                      (a tiny smile)
              Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.

                             LENNY
              Macey, I know you're tired, but can
              you drop me at the Retinal Fetish?
              It's on your way.

                             MACE
              Jesus, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic
              behavior at all?  Will that help?
              Faith's there tonight, and I've got
              to talk to her.

                             MACE
              Sure, Lenny.
                      (she puts the car in
                       gear)
              The only thing worse than a junkie
              is someone in love.

    EXT.  RETINAL FETISH - NIGHT

    As Mace pulls to a stop in the parking lot and Lenny opens
    the door.

                             LENNY
              Come on, let me buy you a drink.
              Let's drink and make up.
                      (Mace shakes her
                       head)
              Alright, I'm going to see Faith.
              That means you can watch me suffer.
              I'll be in agony, you'll feel so
              much better.  Total and thorough
              payback, whatdya say?

    Mace smiles, shaking her head in wonder at this madman.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH

    Mace accompanies Lenny into the pounding din of the
    Retinal Fetish.  The place is a fringe hangout, a
    converted schmata factory transformed into a warren of
    dark rooms and corridors off the main dance floor.  A
    thundering labyrinth.  Steel cage-like partitions of
    chain-link give the place a harsh, concentration-camp
    atmosphere.  The music is a bass tech-thump, and the
    clientele are young and on the rough side.  Cybergrunge.

    There are many large video screens running a continuous
    montage of wild graphics and images... a flurry of
    disturbing videos: MTV baptized by William Burroughs.

    The Fetish is a street-tech hangout, a meeting place for a
    lot of digital-underground types that Lenny knows.  You
    can buy and sell what you want here: illicit hardware and
    software, as well as chemicals for the wetware (brain).

    Lenny and Mace are greeted inside by two suited guys with
    metal detectors.  They barely notice as they are scanned:
    it's routine there days.  Mace shows her gun, a Sig Saur
    9mm, and her state carry-permit.  The security guys check
    her pistol like a coat, giving her a claim check.

    Through the crowd in the lounge Lenny's eyes go
    immediately to one table.  It seems to be in a pool of
    light all it's own; or maybe this is just in Lenny's mind.
    SLOW MOTION: Lenny watches a man at the table holding
    court, with a beautiful young woman sitting next to him.

    It is TRAN VO.  He's a mover and shaker in the record
    business: he produces, he manages, he tries to keep
    everyone in his orbit.

    The woman is FAITH JUSTIN.  We recognize her from playback
    as Lenny's ex-girlfriend.  But now her hair has been dyed
    jet black and frames her face in a wild tangle.  She is
    wearing as expensive custom leather jacket over a sheer
    silk top.  She has on too much make-up, which gives her
    features a feral-doll quality.  Faith looks like what she
    is, a rock star wannabe.  But the look is red-hot.

    Tran looks around the room.  His eyes miss nothing.  And
    show nothing.  His hand -- unhurried, graceful, remarkable
    -- brushes past Faith's cheek, barely touching her.  His
    fingers pick up a strand of hair, tuck it like a treasure
    behind her ear... fingers touching her head now... a
    moment of suspended time.

    ... and she trembles.  Just a little.  For a second.

    Tran and Faith are flanked on either side by an entourage
    consisting of music types, various hangers on, and Tran's
    personal security force of four: JOEY CORTO, a whippet-
    thin skinhead; DUNCAN, a none-too-bright armbreaker in the
    classic mold; a massively built ex-jock type called WADE
    BEEMER; and a sixteen year old Asian stone fox, CINDY
    MINH, aka 'VITA', possibly the most lethal of the four.

                             LENNY
              Who's the new side of beef in Tran's
              posse?

                             MACE
              Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a
              running back for the Rams in '96 and
              '97.

                             LENNY
              Rams... that's football, right?

    He can't take his eyes off Faith.  Mace scowls at the
    tableau and pulls Lenny toward the bar.

                             MACE
              Forget her.

                             LENNY
              She still loves me.

                             MACE
              She thinks you're a bucket of dog
              vomit.  Trust me on this.

                             LENNY
              She's my destiny.

                             MACE
              Destiny?  You living in a perfume
              commercial?  She's a hard-climber
              that dropped you like a used tampon
              when she got a better ride.

                             LENNY
              You'll see.

    Mace gives up, shakes her head and Lenny plunges into the
    crowd... toward Faith.  Several patrons greet him, just as
    in the Coral Lounge, but uncharacteristically, Lenny
    virtually ignores them.

    Approaching the main table now.  Ringside.  Tran sees him;
    no reaction.  Now Faith sees him: her reaction's a little
    tougher to read.  Pissed off, maybe, or just tense.

    Tran's security force has seen Lenny coming.  But they
    stay casual.

    Lenny doesn't break stride.  It's like a game of chicken
    without cars.  Beemer stands, covering Lenny with his
    shadow.  Vita looks up at Lenny with cobra eyes.  Tran
    gives him a glance; royalty amused by Lenny's presumption.

                             TRAN
              You come to peddle me some tapes,
              Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a
              couple bucks for the holidays?

                             LENNY
              You're not a client anymore, Tran.
              I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a
              dead dog's balls.

                             TRAN
                      (glancing at Faith,
                       back at Lenny)
              I already got everything I need from
              you.

                             FAITH
              Cut it out, Tran.

                             LENNY
              Too bad about your guy Jeriko.
              Tough break.

                             TRAN
              Show a little respect, Nero.  The
              man was an important artist.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, important for your label.
              Which no doubt is why you're in
              mourning.  Don't worry, his
              records'll sell out now he's dead.
              You'll make out.

                             TRAN
              I always do.

                             LENNY
              Faith, can I talk to you a second?

                             FAITH
              I don't think that's a good idea,
              Lenny.

                             LENNY
              I just got to talk to you for one
              second.

                             TRAN
              About what?

                             LENNY
              That would be between me and Faith,
              wouldn't it?

    Tran takes one of his beautiful hands and passes it slowly
    in the general area between his table and Lenny.

                             TRAN
              I don't feel anything between you.
              See, your trouble is you assume too
              much, Lenny.  You assume there's
              something where there's nothing.
              You assume you have a life.  But
              you're only hustling pieces of other
              lives on tape, and broken parts of
              your own.

    Faith glances at Tran, then cuts her eyes to Lenny.

                             FAITH
                      (icy)
              We have nothing to talk about,
              Lenny.

                             TRAN
              Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely
              to his car.

    Joey smirks, glances at Beemer who rises like a wall.

                             LENNY
              Faith, call me, okay?

                             FAITH
              No, Lenny.

    Wade gets Lenny in a wrist-grip come along hold and starts
    him moving.  She looks at him -- slowly, gaze unwavering.
    As Beemer ushers Lenny through the crowd, Tick greets him
    coming the other way.

                             LENNY
              Tick, listen, I can't stop right
              now.  but I'll call you tomorrow
              about that thing we were talking
              about.

    He's working the room even as he's getting dragged
    outside.

                             TRAN
              Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of
              stolen dreams.

                             FAITH
              Leave him alone, Tran.

                             TRAN
              He's no concern of mine, as long as
              you don't talk to him.  Don't talk
              to anybody.  You understand?  Not
              with everything that's going on
              right now.

                             FAITH
              You're too goddamned paranoid.

                             TRAN
              Paranoia's only reality on a finer
              scale.

    EXT.  RETINAL FETISH

    Beemer deposits Lenny on the curb and goes back inside.

    A SMALL CROWD of people enters the club.  Lenny brushes
    off his jacket, falls into step at the rear of the
    entering crowd.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH

    Lenny climbs to a landing overlooking the dance floor.
    Through chain link he sees a swirl of activity below.  And
    one face, looking up at him.  Kind of casual.  Lenny
    clocks the guy: cop instincts coming out.  Decides he
    doesn't know him.  But we do.  It's Spreg.  Lenny walks
    on, crosses to a door, and enters...

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  VJ BOOTH/RETINAL FETISH

    A tiny room overlooking the dance floor.  Crammed with
    electronic gear, at the center of which is Tex Arcana,
    whipping from one deck to another, hands flying.  He's in
    a wheelchair, which pivots nimbly, managing to high-five
    Lenny as he walks in.

                             LENNY
              So, those rascals still haven't
              grown back yet, huh?

                             TEX
                      (peering under the
                       blanket on his lap)
              Nope.  Guess not.  Any day now,
              though.

                             LENNY
                      (handing Tex a Squid)
              Present.  Something I had made.  Let
              me know what you think.

                             TEX
              Hey, alright.  Got something here
              for you, too.
                      (passes him an
                       envelope)
              It just showed up tonight, don't
              know who left it.

                             LENNY
              Fan mail from some flounder?

    Lenny looks at the envelope, which has "Nero" hand-printed
    in block letters.  Tex takes a pull from a flask as he
    takes a squid-deck out of a drawer and sticks the tape in.
    He puts on the headset and pushes PLAY.

    IN POV we are on a beach.  Early morning.  We are running
    flat out, with the wind.  Looking down... we are barefoot
    on the wet sand.  Foaming water races up the sand and
    breaks around our strong male legs.  Looking up again, to
    see our running companion... a beautiful lithe woman in
    shorts and T-shirt.  She laughs and we speed up.  An
    exquisite moment of pure life force.

    TIGHT ON TEX'S FACE... as a tear leaks from the corner of
    his eye.  He is smiling like he is listening to beautiful
    music.  We see the quiet magnificence of Lenny's gift.

    Tex opens his eyes.  Looks for Lenny to say thanks: but
    Lenny's gone.  Not a guy to hang around for thanks-yous.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH

    As Lenny comes down the stairs from the VJ booth, tearing
    open the envelope.  An unmarked Squid tape falls into his
    hand.

    The HOUSE LIGHTS dim and the STAGE LIGHTS come up.  And
    Faith is standing there.  Like she beamed in.  She is
    wearing a revealing leather outfit, showing a lot of her
    milk-white skin.  Her black hair frames her eyes, giving
    her an intense feral look.  Faith starts to sing.
    Beautiful, unearthly, clear notes.

    SUDDENLY the band kicks down with a wall of thundering
    sound.  Faith explodes into motion.  Her body convulses
    like a 440 volt mainline is hooked up to her.  Her voice
    becomes a scream, an inchoate wail, a police siren.  The
    pain and rage of an entire, hell-bent tormented planet on
    its eve of judgment.

    Lost in the song, Faith has found herself.  She wheels
    across the stage, slashing her head up and down so that
    her hair bursts in the strobe-flashes like flak.

    A techno-erotic pagan.  A force of nature.

    Lenny is mesmerized.  He has seen this before, many times.
    But it always has the same effect on him.  He is
    transported into another world by her, a world in which
    there is only the two of them.

    TIGHT ON MACE, eyes on the stage... a big piece of the
    puzzle suddenly fits.  She's never seen Faith perform
    before.  Holy shit.

    Faith doesn't play to the audience, or engage them in any
    way.  She is merely taking what's in her head and letting
    it out.  She doesn't care if they are there or not.  Now
    shrieking into the silence after a climatic downbeat, and
    holding the note... holding it longer than you believe she
    possibly could.  Then nothing.

    When it is over she just drops the microphone and walk
    away.  Fuck you.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH/BACKSTAGE & DRESSING ROOM

    At BACKSTAGE, Lenny wends his way through the warren of
    corridors... past dim rooms full of wire junkies and
    playback freaks, all trapped into Squid nirvana: post-
    modern opium dens.  Sinister and scary.  He glimpses
    Faith, going into her dressing room.  He hurries...

    ... but she doesn't even look around when his reflection
    appears in the cracked mirror above the crummy vanity
    table.  She is drenched with sweat.  Spent.  Chugging a
    beer.  This is the first time they have been alone
    together in real-time for months.  Pain and the memory of
    joy.

                             LENNY
              Hi, baby.  I've missed you.

                             FAITH
              I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you
              talking to me he'll hurt you.

                             LENNY
              I'm already hurting.

    She doesn't turn.  Just watches him in the mirror.  Most
    of the scene plays this way.  It is a cold parody of their
    love-making playbacks.

                             FAITH
              You have to go.  I mean it.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just
              answer one question.  Is anything
              wrong?  Iris said you might be in
              trouble.

                             FAITH
                      (startled, turning
                       to him)
              You talked to Iris?  When?

                             LENNY
              Tonight.

                             FAITH
              Well I haven't seen her in months.
              Who knows what's going on in her
              head.  You're really running out of
              excuses to come around, aren't you?

                             LENNY
              I know you Faith.  You're afraid of
              something.  What's going on?

                             FAITH
              Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take
              care of itself.

                             LENNY
              It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is
              poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's
              got you walled in on all sides.  And
              he uses the wire too much, he gets
              off on tape, not on you.

                             FAITH
              That's a good one, coming from you.

                             LENNY
              Why don't you just split?  You don't
              love him, anybody can see that.  And
              to him you're just some kinda
              possession, like a Ferrari,
              something to show the other guys.

                             FAITH
              He has his uses too.

                             LENNY
              What?  He gonna record you on his
              label?

                             FAITH
              Maybe.

                             LENNY
              Come on, Faith!  He's just toying
              with you.  And when he gets bored,
              you'll be yesterday's papers.

    Lenny is right behind her now.  He puts his hands on her
    shoulders, tenderly.

                             LENNY
              Look, baby, I've watched you create
              yourself out of nothing.  You're
              like a goddamn cruise missile,
              targeted on making it.  And you
              will.

                             FAITH
              Damn right.

                             LENNY
              It's you up on that stage, not him.
              You don't need him.

    She shrugs away from his touch.  Cold again.

                             FAITH
              You have to get out of here.  If
              Tran catches you he'll... he's
              acting crazy.  He's doing way too
              much playback and he's getting
              completely paranoid.  He's such a
              control freak, he's even paying Max
              to follow me around.

                             LENNY
              Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?

                             FAITH
              Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny,
              just stay away from Tran, okay?  And
              stay away from me.  Stop trying to
              rescue me.  Those days are over.
              I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to
              save me, okay, because I don't need
              saving... Just... give up on me.

                             LENNY
              Can't do it.

                             FAITH
              You know one of the ways movies
              still have Squid beat?  Because they
              always say "The End." You always
              know when it's over.  It's over!
              Now please leave.  I have to go on
              again in a couple of minutes.

    She looks at him and, after a moment, he nods and leaves.
    As the door closes behind him, Faith tosses her towel on
    the table.  She looks frightened and alone.

                             FAITH
              Hell.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH/CORRIDOR AND MAIN FLOOR

    Turning a corner from the dressing room into the CORRIDOR,
    Lenny runs into Max.

                             LENNY
              Shoulda told me about your new gig,
              buddy.

                             MAX
              I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just
              a job.  I feel like shit about it.

                             LENNY
              You should feel like shit.

                             MAX
              I figured, what the hell, I could
              take the prick's money and make sure
              Faith was OK at the same time.  Do
              us both good.  Right?

                             LENNY
              Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for
              you.
                      (already over it)
              Hey, at least you got a job!
                      (slaps him on the
                       back)
              Watch her for me.  Stay on her.

                             MAX
              I'm on her.

    Lenny climbs the stairs to the MAIN FLOOR, pushing his way
    through the crowd.

    Vita, watching the backstage area leans over to Tran,
    whispers in his ear.  Tran makes a sign to Beemer, and he
    stands to go after Lenny.

    Mace, at the bar, sees the Tran-Vita-Beemer action, looks
    around for Lenny.  Can't find him.  But figures there's
    got to be only one reason Beemer's on the prowl: he's
    looking for Lenny.  She whips out her cellular.

    CUT TO: Beemer, grabbing Lenny in a painful come-along
    hold and hustling him toward the back of the club.

    Lenny's cellular rings.

                             LENNY
              Can I get that?

    He reaches for his cellular, connects with...

    MACE, over by the bar.

                             MACE
              Hey Lenny, where the hell are you, I
              think Tran's got Beemer looking for
              you.

    BACK TO: Lenny, as he's hustled out the rear door.

                             LENNY
              Thanks for the tip.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  ALLEY/RETINAL FETISH - NIGHT

    Beemer shoves Lenny into the alley and shuts the door
    behind him.

                             LENNY
              I recognize you.  You're Wade
              Beemer.  Running back for the Rams,
              am I right?

    Beemer, who was about to go to work on Lenny, pauses.

                             BEEMER
              Yeah, that's right.

                             LENNY
              I saw you play, man.  You were good.
              Like a fucking freight train I
              remember saying.  So what happened,
              injuries or what?

                             BEEMER
              Bullshit politics.

                             LENNY
              It's always politics.  Like this
              thing we're in here, he's paying you
              to tune me up, right?  But I could
              pay you more not to.  See what I
              mean?  I could write you a check
              right now--

                             BEEMER
              Come on, let's go, I got to get
              back.

                             LENNY
                      (pulling money out
                       of his pocket)
              Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's
              everything I have on me, what do you
              say?  How about a Rolex?

                             BEEMER
                      (barely a glance at
                       it)
              I already got a real one.  Come on,
              it won't be too bad.  It's not
              personal.

                             LENNY
                      (taking off the
                       Armani carefully)
              Just not the eyes.

    Beemer swings.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  PARKING LOT/RETINAL FETISH - NIGHT

    As Lenny approaches the car, moving painfully, dabbing at
    a bloody nose.  Mace looks at him pityingly.

                             LENNY
              They oughta get some lights back
              there.  A person could get killed
              slipping on those stairs.  Let's go.

    CUT TO: an eerie NIGHT VISION SHOT of Mace and Lenny
    getting into the limo.  Then we see: Spreg and Engelman,
    the two street Hun cops.  Watching.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  MACE'S LIMO

    Lenny slumps in the back seat.

                             MACE
              You're some piece of work, you know
              that.  Just calmly backstroking
              around in the big toilet bowl, and
              somehow you never let it touch you.
              I mean, between Vice and this so-
              called occupation you're in now, you
              must've seen it all.

                             LENNY
              I have crawled through the gutter...
              through every wrinkle in the human
              brain.

                             MACE
              What I'm saying.  But you still come
              out this goofball romantic.

                             LENNY
              It is my sword and my shield, Macey.

    Lenny finds the anonymous tape in his pocket.  He looks a
    it, puzzled.

                             MACE
              What's that?  Present from Faith?

                             LENNY
              No idea.

    He opens his briefcase, pops the tape into the deck, puts
    the Squid rig on and closes his eyes.  Maybe he can forget
    about Faith a minute.  He punches PLAY.

    POV SEQUENCE: the first thing we notice is that the POV is
    distorted visually.  The colors are de-saturated.  Almost
    black and white.  Yet the detail is crisp and clear,
    almost hyper-real.

    WE ARE WALKING down a windowless hallway at a large hotel.
    An apparently endless row of doors.  The Wearer's glance
    goes to the numbers on the doors from time to time.

    We come to a particular door.  There is a DO NOT DISTURB
    sign on the door.  The Wearer moves to the room next door.
    Looks both ways.  The corridor is empty.

                             LENNY
              It's a test pattern so far.

    "Our" hands appear, quickly pulling on latex surgical
    gloves.  They look like male hands.  The snapping of the
    rubber is the only sound in the corridor.  The POV hunches
    down to the lock and we see the hands go to work with
    lock-picking tools.  Several seconds and the lock is very
    professionally picked.

                             LENNY
              Alright, a little B&E action.

    We enter the dark room, which is vacant.  The drapes are
    open and we see city lights.  It is night.  One gloved
    hand picks up the guest directory and looks at it in the
    moonlight coming in the window: the SUNSET SHERATON.

    The Wearer drops the directory and the hands reappear
    holding... a black ski-mask.  He pulls it on, leaving the
    subsequent POV seen through the eye-holes of the mask.

    The Wearer now looks into a mirror on the dresser.  He has
    avoided his reflection up until now.  We see a man,
    dressed in a jogging suit and black fanny-pack, and of
    course the ski-mask.  Totally anonymous.

                             LENNY
              Hey, getting good.  Solid suspense
              build.

    The Wearer crosses to the balcony door.  Opens it quietly
    and goes outside, moving to the wall dividing this room's
    balcony from the one next door.

    The Wearer climbs the railing and, six stories above the
    pavement, slips around the wall, stepping down onto the
    other balcony.  We hug the wall, looking furtively into
    the room.  It is a suite.  In the living room we see a
    woman making herself a drink at the mini-bar.  She
    turns...

    It is Iris.  She is wearing a T-shirt and panties.
    Probably ready for bed.  She looks like she can't sleep.
    Pours the Scotch shakily.

    CUT TO LENNY, the streetlight washing across his face.  He
    gets suddenly serious with a flash of premonitory dread.

    IN POV we see Iris go into the bedroom, out of sight.  We
    can hear the television on in there.  Using a steel jimmy
    the Wearer slips the latch on the balcony slider and
    silently opens it, slipping inside.

    We stalk quietly to the bedroom door, listening to her
    movements.  Water running in the bathroom.  We come around
    the door frame.  Bedroom dark, bathed in TV glow.  Iris in
    the bathroom, washing her face with cold water.

    We move toward her.  Crossing the room as she reaches for
    a towel.  We are now only a couple of feet away.  She
    comes out of the bathroom, walking right past us, drying
    her face.  She lowers the towel, turning away... her eyes
    whip back.  Widening in terror.

    She reacts with surprising speed, diving across the bed.
    We go after her.

    Her hand goes under the pillow and comes out with a small
    automatic.  She whips it around toward us but we grab it
    and twist it away before she can fire.  She smashes the
    palm of her hand into our face and rolls off the bed,
    lightning-fast.

    We follow her as she scrambles up, running through the
    bedroom door.  Across the living room and down the short
    hall to the front door.  Closing rapidly on her as she
    somehow gets the chain off the door and gets out into the
    hall.

    Slam!  We tackle her against the far wall of the corridor.
    Our right hand comes into view holding a small electric
    stunner.  ZAP!  We nail her right in the back between the
    shoulder blades.

    She sags to the floor, gasping.  We zap her again.  The
    Wearer's glance does a 180 both ways down the corridor...
    nobody in sight.  We clamp our hand over Iris' mouth and
    drag her back into her room, locking the door.

    ON LENNY, reacting.  Going white.

                             MACE
              What is it?

                             LENNY
              Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT
              NOW!  Just go!  GO!

    Lenny goes back under the wire, seeing...

    WE ARE DRAGGING a semiconscious Iris into the bathroom...
    propping her up with her back against the white tile
    wall... grabbing her hands and handcuffing them one by one
    to the steel towel rack above her.  She is moaning.  And
    crying.

                             IRIS
                      (voice distorted)
              I haven't seen your face... I
              haven't heard your voice... you can
              still let me go...

    ZAP!  The Wearer hits her with the stunner again.  She
    jerks and gasps for breath.  We see our latex-gloved
    finger come up in front of us and hear SSSHHH.

    Moving quickly now.  Our hands unbuckle the fanny pack.
    Pull out something... a set of playback trodes.  Our hands
    place them on her head.  She stares uncomprehending.
    What?  We catch a glimpse of some electronics stuff inside
    the pack... a record deck, some wires, a small metal box.

                             LENNY
              Holy shit.  He's jacking her in to
              his own output.  She's seeing what
              he's seeing.  She's seeing herself.

    Iris can now see herself as the Wearer sees her... wide-
    eyed with terror, white-lipped, weeping.  Helpless.  And
    she can feel what he feels.

    The Wearer's hand goes back into the fanny-pack and pulls
    out something else.  A black athletic headband.  We slip
    it over her head, down over her eyes.  A blindfold.  Now
    she can only see what the wearer sees.

    And also from the bag we pull... a yellow plastic object.
    With our thumb we extend the five inch blade of the razor
    knife, the type with tips that can be broken off by
    segments when they get dull.  It extends with an ominous
    clicking sound.

    We lower it toward her and cut up the middle of her T-
    shirt, laying it open.  Exposing her torso.  We then look
    down and slide the knife under the side band of her
    panties, slicing them off.  We put the knife up to her
    throat, and she whimpers, afraid to cry out, and then we
    draw the flat side of the blade across her body as if to
    tease her with the prospect of her death.

    MACE LOOKS AT LENNY'S EXPRESSION of dawning horror and
    pulls the car to the curb about a half-block from the
    Sunset Sheraton.  Lenny is hyperventilating, shifting in
    his seat as if ants are crawling over him.  He is
    experiencing the stalker's exhilaration.

    IN POV we see the Wearer pull his jogging pants down below
    his knees (R-rated please) and reach for Iris.  Kneeling
    in front of her, he pushes her legs apart and pulls her
    hips forward onto him, pushing into her.

    Iris is feeling and seeing what he sees and feels... She
    feels her own pain and humiliation swirling with the
    killer's exhilaration.

    ON LENNY, sweating and barely able to breath.  Mace stops
    the tape... concerned by Lenny's reaction.  He opens his
    eyes... Mace see the fear there, of what the tape may
    reveal.  But he shakes his head.  He has to know.  He
    pushes her hand away and punches PLAY.

    IT FLOODS INTO HIS HEAD AGAIN.  The sweaty, grunting
    horror.  The stalker picks up her slit T-shirt and quickly
    wraps it around her neck.  He knots it tight and twists
    one powerful hand into the knot.  The muscles in his
    forearm look like cables as he turns the knot tighter.

    The stalker viciously twists the knot a full turn and the
    T-shirt fabric almost disappears into the skin under her
    jaw.

    Via her trodes, Iris watches herself die.  Her death comes
    at the moment of his orgasm which is fed to her...
    blasting off the planet on total overload... terror, pain,
    death merging with ecstasy and exultation at the same
    instant.

    ON LENNY, crying out and grabbing for the trodes, but he
    just holds onto them, as if they are sucking his brains
    out of his skull.

                             LENNY
                      (like a mantra)
              On my God.  Oh my God.

    BACK TO POV, a glimpse of the Wearer's hand relaxing the
    knot.  Iris' head lolls.  Her mouth is slack and open.  We
    remove her blindfold.  Her eyes are half-lidded.  Very
    dead looking.  Our fingers gently push them wide open.

    BACK TO LENNY, looking like he has been gut kicked.  He
    gasps for breath.

    TO POV, as the killer's hand calmly moves Iris' head from
    side to side... studying her dead face.  Her staring eyes.
    He leans very close to her and stares into one dead eye,
    the pupil wide, seeing nothing.

    A burst of static.  End of tape.

    Lenny opens his eyes.  He fumbles open the car door and
    practically rolls out onto the sidewalk.  The trodes pull
    off his head as he lurches up, reeling across the sidewalk
    to a darkened storefront where he leans for support.  He
    doubles over and heaves up the contents of his stomach.

    Mace circles around the car and catches him as he sags to
    his knees.  She holds his shoulders while he throws up
    again.

                             MACE
              My God, Lenny.  What is it?

                             LENNY
              Black.  Jack.

                             MACE
              Blackjack?  I don't understand--

                             LENNY
              Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said
              she needed my help and I... aw
              Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker
              killed her.

                             MACE
              Are you sure it's real?

    Lenny looks up, in the direction of the hotel.  Mace
    follows his glance.  They notice for the first time: cop
    lights; cop cars; ambulance; coroner's wagon.

    CLOSE on Iris' body, in a bag, being loaded into the
    coroner's van.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  PARKING LOT/DIM SUM JOINT/LITTLE TOKYO - NIGHT

    Neon reflections on the roof of Mace's limo as it pulls
    into the lot and slides up to Max's car.  Max is sitting
    in the open door, feet on the pavement, eating dumplings
    from a take-out carton.  He looks up as Lenny and Mace get
    out of the limo.  Sees their expressions.

                             MAX
              Ohhhh shit.

    TIME CUT: Lenny, sitting on the hood of Mace's Lincoln,
    has his head propped in his hands.  His eyes are
    distant... replaying.  Still shocked to his soul.  Mace
    paces nearby.

    Max sits in the open door of his car ten feet away, trodes
    on, playing back the tape.  His face is transformed into
    an ashen mask lit by neon... mouth open in shock.  With
    shaky hands he stops the deck.

    Opens his eyes.  Long beat.  He glances down at the dim-
    sum carton in his hands.

                             MAX
              Well... I've lost my appetite.
                      (lofts it into a
                       nearby dumpster)
              For about a year.

    He gets to his feet, offering the deck and trodes to Mace.

                             MACE
              No way.

    Max pulls a hip-flask full of tequila from his army jacket
    and takes an eye-watering pull.  Offers it to Lenny, who
    follows suit.

                             MAX
              You alright?  Y'okay?

                             LENNY
              Yeah.  No, not really.

                             MAX
              Let's work it.

                             LENNY
              Not now... I don't want to think
              about it--

                             MAX
              Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good
              at this stuff.  Play it down.
              What's the perp doing?

                             LENNY
              He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then
              he does her...

                             MAX
              And he records it.  Thrill kill.
              Wants to see it again.  And again.

                             LENNY
              He records himself raping and
              killing her--

                             MAX
              But at the same time he's sending
              the signal to her--

                             LENNY
              So she feels... what he feels...
              while he's in her.  The thrill while
              he's killing her... is sent to her,
              heightening her fear... which in
              turn heightens the turn on for him.
                      (turns to him)
              I've seen a lot, Max.

                             MAX
              So've I.  Too much.

                             LENNY
              But this is a bad one.

                             MAX
              Top ten.

                             LENNY
              He makes her see her own death,
              feeds off the reaction... killer and
              victim merging... orgasm and agony
              merging.  And he records it all.

                             MACE
              And gives it to you.

                             LENNY
              Wants to share.

                             MAX
              That's right.  He wants to share.
              Needs an audience.  This is one sick
              puppy.

                             LENNY
              Why me?

    Mace is hugging herself.  Edgy and tense.

                             MACE
              Cause you're the man, right?  The
              Magic Man.  If it's got something to
              do with the wire, sooner or later it
              washes up on your beach.

                             LENNY
              I've never dealt in black-jacks.
              Never.  Everybody knows that.

                             MAX
              He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying
              to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing
              you to do something.

                             MACE
              Maybe he just figures Lenny will
              appreciate what he's created.  It's
              the dark end of the street, Lenny.
              How do you like it now?

                             LENNY
              Jesus, Mace.  Back off.

                             MACE
              This guy is someone you know, one of
              your squid-head contacts.

                             MAX
              Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.

                             MACE
              Take the tape to the cops.

                             LENNY
              Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.

                             MACE
              So some psycho wire-freak gets to
              keep running around--

                             MAX
              Naw, he's right.  They'll figure
              Lenny's the perp, or go through his
              client list, ruin his life... such
              as it is.  Look, I'll call the guys
              in Homicide... tell them she was a
              friend of mine and they'll keep me
              in the loop.  Get me the forensics
              and all that.
                      (he opens his car
                       door)
              Get some sleep.  I'll call you when
              I get something.
                      (he starts his car)
              And Lenny... I'd keep moving if I
              were you.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  ELEVATOR AND TRAN'S LOFT

    The elevator is huge -- big enough for a truck -- and
    Lenny seems small in the huge space, while shadows crawl
    across his body as the old machinery pulls him up
    toward...

    FAITH, in the loft above.  She looks into the vast
    bedroom...

    ... at Tran sitting in a chair, tranced out under playback
    trodes, his eyes closed.  She softly closes the sliding
    door and walks across the cavernous main room.  The place
    is lit by the flickering reflections from a series of huge
    television screens along both walls.  Otherwise there is
    little light.  The cavernous loft is sparsely but very
    expensively furnished.  Haute-tech design.  Total contrast
    to Lenny's ratty digs.

    LENNY'S POV through the cage-door of the elevator as it
    reaches the loft and Faith is revealed, waiting for him in
    the shadows.  He slides open the cage-door and she moves
    quickly to him.

                             FAITH
                      (whispering, furtive)
              You're crazier than I thought,
              Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just
              in there.

                             LENNY
              Iris is dead.  She was murdered.

    Faith stiffens.  We see the fear, now, exposed.

                             FAITH
              Who did it?

                             LENNY
              Don't know.  But this guy's real
              damaged goods.  Iris knew someone
              was after her... and she said you
              were in danger too.
                      (he grabs her
                       shoulders)
              Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever
              you're hiding, whatever's going on,
              you have to get out of here now.
              Come with me right now.  Don't even
              think about it.

                             FAITH
              Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You
              going to protect me?  Big tough guy.
              You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't
              even have a gun.

                             LENNY
                      (hurt)
              I have a gun.  It's under my bed.

                             FAITH
              You don't know what you're fucking
              with here.

                             LENNY
              Tell me.

    A VOICE from the shadows, like the whisper of a blade in
    the air.

                             TRAN
              Go ahead, Faith.  Tell him.

    Tran steps forward, totally at ease with the situation.
    Out of the shadows behind him step Joey Corto, Duncan and
    Vita Minh.

                             FAITH
              Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to
              give me some bad news.  An old
              friend of mine has been murdered.
              You remember Iris?

                             TRAN
              A tragic story, no doubt.
                      (to Lenny)
              How'd you get up here?

                             LENNY
              Charm.

                             TRAN
                      (looks at Faith)
              Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you
              an offer.
                      (he grabs Faith by
                       the arm, steps
                       closer)
              Take her.  Right now.  If she wants
              to go, if she's unhappy here, she
              can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith
              always knows what she wants.
                      (he turns her loose)
              Hands off.  See?

    Lenny glances at the open elevator right behind him.  So
    close.  She just has to take one step to him... and they
    will be out of there.  Together.

                             LENNY
              It's alright.  He means it.

                             TRAN
                      (to Faith)
              I do mean it.
                      (to Lenny)
              And I mean this... if Faith stays
              you go away and never come back.
              You scuttle back into your cockroach
              hole and never cross my vision
              again.  You understand?

    She glares at them both for a long moment.  Emotions play
    across her face, complex and unreadable.  She steps back,
    taking her place at Tran's side.

                             FAITH
              I made my choice, Lenny.

                             TRAN
                      (to Lenny, nodding
                       toward the elevator)
              You're going down.

    Joey Corto and Duncan shove Lenny roughly backward into
    the elevator.  Corto slams the gate shut and slaps a
    button to lower the lift.  The last thing Lenny sees as he
    descends is Faith's face, above him.

                             FAITH
              I don't love you, Lenny.  Give up.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  BEDROOM AREA/TRAN'S LOFT

    Faith is crying as Tran comes up behind her.

                             FAITH
              You said you were going to get her
              out of this.

                             TRAN
              Maybe now you appreciate the danger
              we're in.
                      (he moves very close)
              It was touching the way you stood by
              me in there.  "Stand by your man".
              I was moved.  You were very good.  I
              don't think he even understands that
              you did it for him.

                             FAITH
              He doesn't know what's going on.
              Leave him alone.

                             TRAN
              I'd love to.  But he keeps showing
              up.  And you keep talking to him.  I
              can't have that--

    And he slaps her.  Really hard.  Decks her.  He's
    trembling with rage... and something else.  Fear.

                             TRAN
              The only time a whore should open
              her mouth is when she's giving head.

                             FAITH
              Fuck you.

                             TRAN
                      (walking away)
              Maybe later.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  ELEVATOR/TRAN'S LOFT

    The huge elevator, with Lenny its sole occupant, descends
    through the shadows toward the first floor.  Lenny watches
    the shadow patterns on the wall through the iron grillwork
    door.  He's still thinking about Faith...

    ... even when the elevator reaches the first floor and
    Mace comes into view.  She's waiting for him.  He steps
    forward.  But he can't open the grillwork door.  And the
    elevator doesn't stop.  It keeps going down.  Lenny,
    spooked, works the door hard... as Mace disappears from
    view above him...

    ... and the elevator bumps to a stop in the basement.
    With Vita and the beef squad waiting for Lenny, stoney-
    faced.  Last stop.  All out.

    Lenny tries to keep the door shut, but Duncan wrenches it
    open.  Vita grabs Lenny and twists his arm painfully
    behind him in one fluid move.  They hustle him toward a
    dank basement room near the elevator.

                             LENNY
                      (speed-rap)
              Listen, can we be smart here?  I
              could make it really worth your
              while... I could cut you a check for
              500 each... hell, make it an even
              grand... I'm not saying you don't
              land a couple shots, just go light
              is all I'm saying... here, take my
              Rolex.

                             CORTO
              Lemme see.

    A glimmer of hope in Lenny's eye as he whips it off his
    wrist.  Corto doesn't even look at it.  Gets it over his
    hand about mid-way, then -- using the watch like a pair of
    brass knuckles -- clobbers Lenny in the face.  Watch parts
    go flying as Corto steps away and Duncan slams Lenny up
    against a column.

    Vita weighs in... gut-punching Lenny savagely.  She works
    him expertly, with a series of painful jabs.

    He sags to his knees.  Not only is this painful.  It's
    goddamn humiliating.  And Duncan and Corto enjoy every
    second of it.

                             CORTO
              We tried to find a smaller girl, to
              beat the shit out of you, Lenny...
              but it was short notice.

    Vita grabs Lenny by his hair and pulls him up with one
    rock-hard arm.  She is cocking back the other arm for a
    pile-driver punch when...

    Suddenly a dark shape materializes behind her.  Mace
    drives Vita head first into the steel column.

    Duncan lunges in and grabs for Mace.  This is a mistake.
    Mace doesn't fight fancy.  And she doesn't fight fair.
    She fights to win.  And she is awesomely fast.  Her moves
    are street moves, coupled with arm-locks and come-alongs
    she has been trained to use as a security driver.

    Lenny recovers enough to size up Vita, who is still a
    little stunned.  She has blood dripping in her eyes and
    can't see too well.

    But she charges him.  And -- being the gent that he is --
    he busts her over the head with a dusty old folding chair.

    Mace drops Duncan about the time Vita is hitting the
    ground, leaving...

    CORTO, who fumbles out a Beretta 9mm and sticks it in
    Mace's face.  He sniggers, loving the upper hand.

                             MACE
              Safety's on.

    And like a jerk, he looks.

    She snaps sideways in a headfake and closes blindingly
    fast, twisting the gun out of his hand.  She continues to
    twist his wrist brutally and Corto goes down to one knee,
    groaning.  She takes his Beretta and backhands the barrel
    hard across his face.  Mace releases his wrist and he
    crumples in a heap.

    She and Lenny back out the door.  Then Lenny runs back in
    and kicks Corto in the ribs.

                             MACE
              Lenny!

    Mace grabs him and pulls him out of the room, then slams
    the metal firedoor behind them, locking it with a piece of
    junk wedged behind the release bar.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

    Mace and Lenny hotfoot it toward the parked limo.  Mace is
    disassembling the Beretta without looking at it.  She
    chucks pieces over a chain-link fence as they go.  Lenny
    brushes himself off, checking his jacket for damage.  He
    is high from winning the fight.

                             LENNY
              Is this great fabric or what?

                             MACE
              You ever wonder why you get beat up
              a lot?

                             LENNY
              Never really thought about it.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    Squid POV: the killer enters the vacant hotel room,
    passing the mirror on the dresser.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              Come on... look in the mirror.  You
              know it's there, you're keeping your
              eyes off it, you bastard... SHIT!
              Who are you?

    CUT TO: Lenny, yanking the wire off his head, Mace near
    him.

                             LENNY
              He knows what he's doing.  He's worn
              before... a lot.

                             MACE
              So that gives you something.

                             LENNY
              It gives me... I don't know... maybe
              two hundred people who I know wear.

    As he talks Lenny fiddles with some custom electronics
    gear.  The back is off the deck, and he has a ribbon wire
    connecting it to some kind of amplifier black-box which he
    is using to boost the gain.

                             MACE
              Don't crank the gain any more.
              You're gonna fry yourself.

                             LENNY
              I need to see more... get more
              detail.  Something.  I feel his
              presence, so strong...

    Mace watches, concerned, as Lenny puts the trodes back on
    and hits playback.

    Squid POVs: strobe-like images of Iris' rape and death,
    separated by burst of static...

    ... as Lenny keeps hitting the forward and rewind buttons,
    searching the tape for clues, reacting to the feelings on
    the tape, trying to manage his revulsion...

    ... until Mace yanks the trodes off and Lenny sags back on
    the couch.  He rubs his eyes.  He is seeing ghosts,
    afterimages burned into his visual cortex.  The room is
    alive with them, shimmering.

                             MACE
              No more, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.

    Lenny see Iris' terrified face.  Literally.  It floats
    iridescent on his living room wall, fading slowly.

                             LENNY
              She came to me for help.  I should
              have read it better... I just
              figured, y'know... another strung-
              out hooker having a bad night.

                             MACE
              It's not your fault.

    Lenny gets up, staggering to the kitchen.  She goes with
    him.

                             LENNY
              Sex killers act alone.  So there's
              no information on the street, which
              is how cases get made.  Cops know
              they'll never nail this guy the
              second they look at the scene.

    Lenny sucks down four Tylenol with a long pull from a
    bottle of vodka.

                             LENNY
              And anyway, nobody gives a shit
              about a dead hooker.  They're
              roadkill.

    Requiem for Iris.  Mace watches Lenny rubbing his eyes,
    waiting for the Tylenols to hit.

                             LENNY
              See, it's all about what they see
              walking in.  A dead hooker,
              handcuffs, penetration... they'll
              see a trick gone wrong.  Random
              kill.  The kind you never solve.

                             MACE
              But that doesn't add, does it.

                             LENNY
              No it doesn't.

                             MACE
              Because Iris knew somebody was after
              her.

    Lenny, wound up like a Swiss movement, starts pacing.

                             LENNY
              She said "If they get me".  They.
              Which means the whole sex-killer
              thing is a cover, which means
              somebody whacked her for a reason.

                             MACE
              So the guy's not a sicko.

                             LENNY
              If he could do what's on that tape,
              he's a sicko.

                             MACE
              Okay, so he's a freak who thinks
              he's sane pretending to be a freak.
              The point is, he was a hitter.
              Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But
              why not just put a little lead in
              her ear?

                             LENNY
              Because it had to look random.  Not
              connected to anything or anyone.
                      (he seems to run out
                       of energy)
              But then why give the rape to me?

                             MACE
              That's where it gets a little
              strange.

                             LENNY
              And what about the guy that was
              following me?

                             MACE
              Now you're really getting paranoid.

    Lenny collapses on the couch, rubbing his temples.

                             LENNY
              The question is not whether I am
              paranoid, but whether I am paranoid
              enough.  You want to rub my neck?

                             MACE
              Sure.

    Mace sits next to him and starts to work.  Strong, knowing
    fingers.  Lenny starts to relax a little.

                             LENNY
              How's Zander?

                             MACE
              OK.  He asks about you all the time.
              It's been weeks since you've seen
              him.

    Lenny sort of keels over.  His head slumps in her lap.

                             MACE
              I'm sorry about getting on your case
              earlier.  I just see you getting
              sucked in deeper and deeper, and I
              -- anyway.  I'm sorry.

                             LENNY
                      (drifting off,
                       joking)
              S'okay.  I know you still love me.

    She looks down at him, gently brushes his hair off his
    sweaty forehead in an unconsciously maternal gesture.  He
    is out cold.

    Mace gazes at Lenny's sleeping face in a way we haven't
    seen before: unguarded.  Caring.  Loving.

    And we get it: she does love him.  It makes no sense, and
    it is a great burden to her that he doesn't see her... but
    there it is.

    She shakes it off: she doesn't want to deal with it now.
    Maybe not ever.  She leans her head back against the ratty
    top of the couch, sighs.  And keeps her hand moving
    soothingly on his head.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT./ INT.  MACE'S HOUSE/INGLEWOOD - DAY

    Mace pulls the limo into the driveway of a modest stucco
    house in Inglewood.  It's dawn.  A neighbor is walking the
    dog.  Mace heads into the house, picking up a couple of
    toys left scattered in the front yard.

    Inside, ZANDER, age 6, is watching TV in his pajamas and
    eating a bowl of cereal.  Behind him, on the couch, is
    Mace's younger sister CECILE, zee'd-out.  Zander frowns at
    her and looks at a red-plastic (toy) watch.

                             ZANDER
              Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a
              guy?

                             MACE
              Just Lenny.

                             ZANDER
              Right.  That explains it.

                             MACE
              Are you going to make me beg?

    Zander scrambles over to his mom, throws his arms around
    her.  Big hug.

                             MACE
                      (looking at weird
                       stuff in cereal)
              What is that?

                             ZANDER
              Cheerios and wieners.  I made it
              myself.  It's good.

                             MACE
              Well give me some then... I'm
              starving.

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    2:20  P.M.  DEC 31

    Lenny wakes up to the sound of the phone ringing.  He is
    on the couch, still clothed.  He hears Max's voice on the
    answer machine and groggily grabs the receiver.

                             MAX (V.O.)
              Hey, the last day of the world and
              you spend it in bed.

                             LENNY
              W'sup, Max?

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  A.M.E. CHURCH AND STREET/SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY

    Max, on the cellular, across the street from a church
    where mourners stream out of a memorial for Jeriko One.
    The sidewalk and street are clogged with fans, and further
    off -- a cordon of very anxious-looking crowd control
    cops.

                             MAX
              Not a whole hell of a lot.  They've
              just been saying words over Jeriko.
              Tensions running pretty high down
              here.  I'm telling you.

    WHAT MAX SEES across the street... SLOWMO as Tran comes
    out of the church with Faith next to him.  Corto, Vita,
    Duncan and Beemer form a loose protective shell around
    them as the press bears down, shouting out questions.
    Tran ushers Faith into a waiting limo and climbs in after
    her.  The rest of the muscle keeps the press away from the
    car as it pulls away.

    CUT TO: Max, still on the phone to Lenny.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              Faith OK?

                             MAX
              Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I
              got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris
              checked into the Sheraton last night
              under a false name.  Paid cash.

                             LENNY
              Looks like she was holding out.

                             MAX
              Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in
              on Tran last night.  Another slick
              Lenny move.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              He's in this somehow... I don't know
              how.  Just stay close to Faith.

                             MAX
              I'm on her, amigo.  No worries.
              Gotta jam.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    As Lenny is hanging up he notices something.  A MANILA
    ENVELOPE stuck between the steel bars and the glass of his
    front window, next to the door.  "NERO" is printed on the
    envelope.

    Oh shit.  He opens the door, looking both ways.  No-one is
    around.  He fishes out the envelope from behind the bars
    and takes it inside.  Of course it contains a tape.  He
    stares at it with dread.

    Lenny sits down and put the tape in his playback deck.  He
    picks up the trodes and places them on his head.  He
    notices his hands are shaking.  He takes a deep breath and
    punches PLAY.

    POV SEQUENCE: DAY.  As expected we see the de-saturated
    signature look of the killer's vision.  The Wearer is
    walking through the courtyard of Lenny's apartment
    building.  We recognize it by the unkempt pool, the sunken
    deck furniture.  We walk through a breezeway to an ally-
    like courtyard behind the building.  We approach a door...
    the back door to Lenny's apartment.

    The killer picks the lock on the back door.  Opens the
    door and enters.  The apartment is dark, blacked out.  We
    are in the kitchen.  We stop and listen.  Water dripping
    in the sink.  Soft snoring from the living room.

    Moving to the other room.  Slowly, silently.  Furtively
    looking around the door frame to the living room.  There
    is Lenny, crashed out on the couch.

    Now moving stealthily toward him.  Kneeling down beside
    him.  Lenny, burned out from the night before, is deep
    under.  Our hand comes into view, holding the yellow
    plastic razor knife.  With his thumb, the killer extends
    the blade... click, click, click, click.

    The blade flashes in a beam of sunlight as it moves toward
    Lenny.  The killer lays it gently against Lenny's throat.
    Draws it slowly across... not leaving a mark.

    The POV backs away and -- static as the tape ends.

    LENNY, IN THE PRESENT, whips off the trodes, freaking.  He
    feels around his throat with one hand... can't feel
    anything.

    Crossing quickly to a mirror near the front door, he
    inspects his neck minutely.  There is a hair-line red line
    over his carotid.  He looks around the room wildly, his
    heart hammering.  Slowly, he gets his breathing under
    control.

    Then... he hears something in the kitchen.  A tiny click.

    His eyes go wide.  Hyperventilating, Lenny moves silently
    into the bedroom.  He fishes around under the bed and
    pulls out a GLOCK 22 .45 auto pistol.  He stalks silently
    toward the kitchen.

    Then he looks at the butt of the pistol-grip: no magazine.
    He un-stalks back to the bed and finds a loaded magazine
    under a bunch of dirty socks.  He inserts it quietly,
    wincing as he chambers a round.

    Heart thudding, he works his way to the kitchen door.  He
    edges around the frame, pie-ing the room.  Cop reflexes
    intact.

    Mace is sitting at the kitchen table, giving him a funny
    look.  She is drinking a cup of coffee, made from the
    bottle of instant on the counter.  She is dressed
    casually, in bicycle pants, work boots and oversized nylon
    jacket over a tank-top.

                             MACE
              Whatup Lenny?

                             LENNY
                      (hands shaking)
              Jesus, Mace!

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    A little later.  As Lenny tosses stuff into a folding bag:
    clothes, a playback deck, a box of .45 hollow points.  He
    grabs his grimy old Second Chance body armor from the LAPD
    and stuffs it into his Haliburton.  When Mace sees him do
    that, she knows things are freaky.

                             MACE
              Where we going?

                             LENNY
              Anywhere.
                      (finger to his lips)
              We'll talk about it in the car.

    Mace glances around... unnerved by the possibility of
    audio surveillance.

                             LENNY
              Hand me that box of tapes, will you?

    He's pointing to a shoe box full of "Faith" tapes.  Mace
    hands them over with obvious distaste.  He throws them in
    the bag, starts to zip it...

    ... then sees his reflection in the bedroom mirror:
    something's the matter.

                             MACE
              What is it?

                             LENNY
              This tie doesn't go with blue!

    He yanks off the tie and grabs another.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  MACE'S LIMO AND STREET - DAY

    Mace and Lenny drive through the streets of LA on the last
    day of this millennium.  There are cops in body armor and
    helmets on some street corners, holding automatic rifles.
    Helicopters orbit endlessly.  And a National Guard tank
    rumbles down the street.  State of siege.  The car radio
    is on, with KROQ's poor Man hyping the impending
    Millennium LA party.

                             POOR MAN
              ... the New Years Eve mega-bash of
              the century.  Ten square blocks of
              madness, with live music, fireworks
              and the actual rich and famous of LA
              hobnobbing with us peons.  Also
              yours truly the Poor Man will be
              there at the KROQ bandshell, giving
              away "Millennium LA" and "KROQ 2-K"
              T-shirts by the truckload--

    Lenny is keyed up and tense.  He keeps looking out the
    back window.

                             MACE
              Will you relax.  There's nobody back
              there.

                             LENNY
              Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my
              throat.  In my living room.
              Relaxing might be right out, okay?!

                             MACE
              You better keep a low profile for a
              while.

                             LENNY
              No shit.  You got someplace in mind?

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  BACKYARD/MACE'S HOUSE - DAY

    On Zander, face lighting up, giving Lenny a high five.
    Lenny drops his bag, shakes, does a little silly hand
    choreography -- a goof on a bro grip -- that makes Zander
    laugh.  Mace watches this ritual and smiles herself.
    Zander can call out a part of Lenny that Mace would like
    to see more of.

    Cecile is there, hanging out with her boyfriend CURTIS,
    and Curtis' friend VEJ.  These two guys are about 18,
    dressed in gangsta garb.  They are listening to "The
    Prophets of Rage" on a CD player, and watch Lenny with a
    dispassion that flirts with distaste.

                             ZANDER
              What do you got?

                             LENNY
                      (pulls a tape out of
                       his pocket)
              Today I have...

                             MACE
                      (seeing the tape)
              Lenny, have you lost it completely?

                             LENNY
              Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is
              audio only.
                      (hands tape to
                       Zander)
              John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme."
              Give it a listen, let me know what
              you think, maybe you won't go for it
              now, but it'll get in your head and
              grow like a seed into something
              really beautiful.

                             ZANDER
              Let's play it now!

                             LENNY
              Later.  Your mom'n I are heading
              right back out.

    Groans of outrage and protestations of unfairness from
    Cecile, Vej and Curtis follow this bad news.  Cecile even
    musters the gumption to speak up.

                             CECILE
              Hey, come on, I been baby-sitting a
              full 24 hours, I have to get ready
              for the party tonight...

                             MACE
              Cecile.

    Mace frosts her with a look.  You don't mess with Mace.

                             MACE
                      (to a disappointed
                       Zander)
              You're not the only little boy I
              have to look out for, honey.

    Zander nods: OK.  Lenny gives him the grip.  Zander's hand
    outmaneuvers his, and the boy smiles in triumph.

    INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE

    POV: squid tape of Iris' death.  Quick barrages of the
    savage imagery interspersed with bursts of static...

    ... until Tick slips off the trodes.  He's been totaled by
    what he's seen.

                             TICK
              Whoa.  That is one unbelievable
              piece of eyefuck.

                             LENNY
              Skip the art criticism, Tick, what
              can you tell me about the wearer.

                             TICK
              Well... the guy's fucked up.

                             MACE
              We know that, Tick.

                             TICK
              No, I mean the killer's got some
              kind of distortion in his visual
              cortex.  The color and gray-scale
              values are all messed up, like color
              blindness.

    He gives the tape a fast run through his processing
    equipment.

                             TICK
              Lookit, you see the peak period
              ratios there?  Could be some kind of
              tumor or brain lesion or something.
              Some kind of trauma
                      (shaking his head)
              This is not good.  I don't like this
              at all...

                             LENNY
              What?

                             TICK
              Well, it's cutting awful close to
              me.  I mean she was just here.

                             LENNY
              Who was just here?

                             TICK
              Iris, man.  Pay attention.

                             LENNY
              Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris
              was here?!

                             TICK
              Yeah, she came by last night.
              Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to
              make a copy of some clip.

                             LENNY
              What clip?  What was it?

                             TICK
              I don't know, man, she wouldn't let
              me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to
              see it.  She said she was going to
              give it to you to hold for her.
              Like insurance or somethin'

                             LENNY
              She never gave me a tape.

                             MACE
                      (to Lenny)
              Think back about what she said.
              Exactly what she said.

                             LENNY
                      (revved up)
              She wanted to go out to my car,
              something about my car...

                             MACE
              Something in your car...

    Lenny and Mace swap a look: oh shit.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  SAN PEDRO IMPOUND YARD - DUSK

    6:05  P.M.

    The last night of this millennium is falling.  Mace's limo
    pulls to the curb.  The yard is located in the vast no-
    man's land of storage lots, cranes and warehouses near
    harbor piers.  The impound office is locked.  Closed for
    New Years Eve.

    CUT TO Lenny and Mace cutting the chain off the gate with
    the long-handled bolt-cutters.  They enter the yard.  Mace
    is carrying a blunt object that looks like a ray-gun.  A
    TAZER.

    Right on cue a huge Rottweiller bounds out of the shadows
    at them, growling, its head low on an attack run.  Mace
    fires and the tazer lights up the with 120,000 volts (low
    amperage, not lethal).  It whines and flips over twice,
    then runs off behind some parked cars.

                             LENNY
              That's a handy little attitude
              adjuster.
                      (sees his car)
              Damn.  I'm boxed in.

    Lenny and Mace approach his BMW, blocked in by ten other
    cars, so he's not getting it back this trip.  He unlocks
    the door and looks inside with a tiny Mag-Lite while Mace
    covers them with the tazer.  A puppy-like whine comes
    occasionally from behind some cars nearby.  We catch a
    glimpse of the puzzled, snuffling Rottweiller eyeing them
    warily.

    Lenny finds the tape on the floormat, passenger side,
    still wrapped in the note.  He reads the note: "HELP ME.
    IRIS."

                             MACE
              What's it say?

    He crumples the note.

                             LENNY
              Nothing.  Let's go play this back.

    CUT TO LENNY AND MACE returning to the limo.  As they
    reach the car they are hit by two flashlight beams.  It is
    the two cops, SPREG AND ENGELMAN, out of uniform, but
    looking very serious with their pistols aimed at Lenny and
    Mace.  They have been following Lenny, knowing sooner or
    later he would lead them to the tape.

                             SPREG
              Give me the tape.  Right now.

                             LENNY
              What tape?  I'm just trying to get
              my car back but the place is
              closed--

                             SPREG
              Shut the fuck up Nero.

    Engelman grabs a fist-full of hair at the top of Mace's
    head and jams his 9mm into the back of her skull.

                             MACE
                      (cool and even)
              Lenny, give them the tape.

                             LENNY
              It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going
              to open my case...

                             ENGELMAN
              Facing us, where we can see it.

    Lenny slowly opens the Haliburton.  He takes out the tape
    and holds it out toward Spreg.

                             LENNY
              Take it and turn her loose.  Okay?

                             SPREG
              Absolutely.

    And you see in his eyes that it isn't going to go that
    way.  Spreg edges forward and takes the tape.  Then he
    points his pistol at Lenny's head, about to fire--

    Which is when the pissed-off Rottweiller shoots through
    the open gate like a black torpedo and tears into
    Engelman's leg.  Engelman screams in pain.  Mace twists
    out of his grip.  Engelman shoots the dog.

    Lenny swings up his Haliburton, using it as a shield, and
    dives for the car.  The case takes three rounds from
    Spreg's 9mm before Lenny gets behind cover.

    Mace just seems to vanish.  She reappears over the trunk
    of the limo and puts two rounds squarely into Spreg's
    chest, knocking him down.  Lenny and Mace scramble into
    the car, starting it up.

    Spreg sits up, pulling up his shirt to make sure his body
    armor stopped the slugs.  No blood.  He comes up firing.
    He and Engelman empty their magazines at the limo as it
    pulls away.  No damage.  They realize the limo is a bullet
    proof security model and run to their pickup truck, parked
    nearby, to give chase.

    Spreg's face is a mask of rage.  He slams the truck in
    gear and accelerates after the limo before Engelman even
    has the door closed.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  LIMO AND SAN PEDRO STREET - NIGHT

    Mace has the big car floored.  She looks in the rear-view
    as the truck gains on them.  Mace is doing her thing...
    what she's trained for.  Security driving.  She whips some
    moves in the big car, but the truck is closing on them.

                             LENNY
                      (holding on)
              Oh no, we're not being followed,
              Lenny, Don't be so paranoid, Lenny.

    They hear rounds hitting the car, and look back.  The
    truck is right behind them.

                             LENNY
              Shit!

                             MACE
              Take it easy.  The glass is bullet
              resistant.

                             LENNY
              Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened
              to bullet proof?

                             MACE
              Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I
              do.

    THE LIMO slides broadly through a turn, side slamming a
    parked van.  Mace accelerates.  The truck stays with them.

    Engelman is leaning out the passenger side window with an
    AK-47 assault rifle.  He rips off several burst which
    riddle the limo, cracking the glass in starburst patterns.
    The Lexan-laminated windows are cracked to hell, but the
    rounds don't come all the way through.

    Spreg's truck comes alongside, ramming them.  The impact
    drives them sideways.  Mace swerves to miss a light-
    standard and finds herself roaring between warehouse
    buildings which front the harbor.

    The truck stays right with them.  Engelman fires bursts at
    the tires, shredding them off the rims.  The limo thunders
    along on steel rims, throwing rooster-tails of orange
    sparks.

    Mace finds herself boxed in by the buildings.  No way to
    turn.  Ahead is a short concrete pier.  She hits the
    brakes and the limo skids on its rims out onto the pier,
    stopping before it reaches the end.

    They are trapped.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  SAN PEDRO PIER - NIGHT

    Engelman and Spreg jump out of the truck, taking cover
    behind it.  They rake the limo with bursts from their AK-
    47s.

    INSIDE THE CAR.  Lenny and Mace keep their heads down
    below the door frame.  It sounds like they are inside a
    steel drum in some psychotic Calypso band.  But the
    armored body panels hold.

    Lenny is punching his cellular.

                             LENNY
              Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!

                             MACE
              It's okay, Lenny
                      (he looks at her
                       hopefully)
              They'd never get here in time
              anyway.

    Mace has reloaded her Sig and is trying to open the door
    on her side (away from the bad guys).  It is jammed from
    the sideswiping.

    Spreg reaches into the bed of the truck and pulls out a
    gallon gas can.  He uncaps it and throws it across the
    pavement.  It slides under the limo, glugging its contents
    onto the ground.  Spreg grabs a road-flare from under the
    seat of the truck and strikes the cap, lighting it.

    He tosses the flare under the limo...

    KA-WHOOMPH!!  The gas can explodes in a fireball.  The
    Continental is engulfed in flames.  From the inside all
    Lenny and Mace can see is fire.  All the windows are
    covered in roaring flames.

                             MACE
                      (matter-of-fact)
              This is bad.

                             LENNY
              The gas tank's going to go any
              second!

    Mace slams the car into gear and floors it.  The powerful
    Lincoln thunders forward.  It crashes through a chain-link
    fence and launches right off the end of the pier.  A
    fireball plunging in a meteoric arc into the oily black
    water.

    Inside, they are slammed forward by the impact.  The car
    sinks.

    UNDERWATER: The car hits bottom, twenty feet down, sitting
    there amid the junk.  Shafts of light play down from the
    big streetlights at the end of the pier.

    INSIDE, Lenny and Mace are in a flooding black tomb.

                             LENNY
              Are you out of your fucking mind?!

                             MACE
              Fire's out, isn't it?

    She scrambles into the back seat.  She wrenches at the
    rear seatback, pulls it free... and crawls half-into the
    huge trunk.  Water is up around their legs.  She grabs her
    shotgun: a sawed-off ten-gauge.

                             MACE
              Get in here.  Come on Lenny, move
              it.  MOVE!!

    Mace yanks him toward her and he tumbles in.

                             MACE
              Get ready to hold your breath.

    She aims the ten-gauge at the trunk latch mechanism.

                             MACE
              Lenny, kick out hard, then just
              follow me. Okay?

    He nods.  BLAM!!  She blows the trunk latch into shrapnel.
    The trunk lid belches open in a whoosh of bubbles.  Lenny
    and Mace kick out, heading toward the lights of the pier.

    ON THE SURFACE: Mace breaks the surface slowly alongside
    the slimy concrete wall.  Lenny comes up beside her,
    spluttering.  Her hand goes over his mouth.  They are in
    the inky shadows under a massive bumper made of rail-road
    ties.

    Engelman and Spreg are standing above them, scanning the
    black water over the barrels of their AKs.

                             SPREG
              Let's get out of here.

    They run back to the truck and high-tail it out of there.

    Down below, Lenny and Mace are clinging to the pier,
    chest-deep in the water.  They hear the truck pulling
    away.  They let out a big exhalations of relief.

    CUT TO LENNY AND MACE walking on the pier, shoes
    squishing.  They leave a shiny trail behind them.

                             MACE
              I can't believe we had to give them
              the damn tape.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my
              favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot
              tub on my birthday.  I'm going to
              really miss it.

    He feels around in his jacket pocket.  He pulls out the
    MYSTERY TAPE... nice and dry in its plastic case.  He
    holds it up to show a grinning Mace.

                             LENNY
              Are we impressed yet?

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  FREEWAY AND CURTIS' CAR - NIGHT

    7:45  P.M.

    Lenny and Mace, still wet, riding in the back seat of
    Curtis' car.

                             CURTIS
                      (pissed)
              I got better things to do on New
              Year's Eve than be some kinda damn
              chauffeur...

                             MACE
              Hey Curtis?  Just drive.

    Curtis swears.  But he shuts up and drives.

                             LENNY
              Those two guys were cops.

                             MACE
              You sure?

                             LENNY
              It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway,
              they'll run your plates and get your
              address.  We gotta keep moving.

    Mace takes it in.  She nods.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  MACE'S HOUSE

    Mace comes in the front door and walks straight to the TV,
    switching it off.  Zander and Cecile are shocked.

                             CECILE
              Lornette, girl... what's going on?

    Lenny goes past them and starts grabbing his stuff...
    wardrobe bag, playback gear.

                             MACE
                      (to Zander)
              We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey.
              We're going to watch fireworks from
              there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.

                             ZANDER
              Aw, Mom!

                             LENNY
              Come on Zander.  You can ride on my
              shoulders.  Here you go.

    Lenny hoists him overhead and goes out the door.  Cecile
    catches up to Mace in the hall, just as she is opening a
    locked cabinet and pulling out a little .380 auto, holster
    and ammo.

                             MACE
              Cecile, get in the car.  Now.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  STREET AND CIVIC - NIGHT

    Sirens pierce the night.  Two pillars of fire are visible
    blocks away.  There are dark crowds of people everywhere.
    People on the sidewalks, lighting fireworks.  There are
    flashes and explosions.  It could be a celebration, or a
    war zone.  Maybe both.  Or one about to turn into the
    other.

    Mace is driving, scanning the streets.  She has her .380
    auto in her hand, resting in her lap.  Lenny is riding
    shotgun, while Curtis, Cecile and Zander are in the back
    seat.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    It is gang territory pure and simple.  Blacks and
    Hispanics.  Graffiti everywhere.  Burned-out buildings.
    Lenny sees abject poverty, here.  Even so, people are
    partying.

    They pull up to the front of Cecile's apartment building
    and get out.

    There are some homeboys chillin' on the front steps who
    give Mace the local hand-sign.  She returns the sign
    automatically as she carries Zander past them.

                             ONE OF THE BOYS
              Yo, Mace.  Whatup wit you, homegirl?
              You never come roun' here no more.

    Lenny follows with his wardrobe bag.  The homeboys give
    Lenny the eye as he brushes past them.  Mace chills them
    with a glare.

                             MACE
              He's with me.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    A small and dingy place.  Cecile has done her best to make
    it a home.

    Mace and Lenny go into the kitchen and shut the door.

    He quickly sets up his playback deck on the table.  He
    puts on the trodes and pulls the tape out of his pocket.
    Then he pauses, looking at it apprehensively... knowing
    that it contains the answer to all this madness.

    He puts it into the deck.  The deck closes.  He punches
    PLAY.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

    Mace watches Zander lighting bottle rockets with Curtis on
    the balcony of the apartment... visible through the
    window.  Staccato fireworks nearby sound like automatic
    weapons, making her flinch.  She goes back into the...

    KITCHEN.  Where she sees Lenny sitting at the table,
    trodes in his hands.  Stunned.  Face the color of old
    cement.  Hands shaking.

                             MACE
              Tell me.

                             LENNY
              I can't tell you.  You've got to
              see.

                             MACE
              Uh unh.  I won't do it.

                             LENNY
              Mace.  I know what you think about
              the wire.  But I'm asking you to do
              this.  It's that important.

    Mace sees how serious he is.  She nods: OK.  He puts the
    trodes on her.

                             LENNY
              Sorry this has to be your first
              playback.

    He hits play and Mace reacts as the sensory input hits
    her.  She opens her eyes...

                             LENNY
              Keep your eyes closed, or you'll see
              double.

    She bites her lip as the sensation of being another person
    floods through her.

    POV SEQUENCE: We are Iris.  Riding in a car.  Fixing our
    makeup in a mirror on the passenger side sun visor.  Iris
    flips the sun visor back up, revealing the moving street.
    It is night.

    We look down, and recognize the dress Iris was wearing
    when we first saw her, two nights ago.  She puts her
    lipstick into a purse which is belted to her waist.  Iris
    turns her head and we see the driver.

    It is JERIKO ONE.  He is laughing, talking to someone in
    the back seat.  Iris looks and we see REPLAY, Jeriko's
    sideman, and another woman, DIAMANDA.  They are amorously
    entwined.  Then they are all laughing and passing around a
    bottle of Jim Beam.  The car stereo is thumping loudly.

    Iris' POV swings around and looks down, seeing Jeriko's
    hand caressing her thigh.  She puts her hand on his chest
    and leans close to him.  Jeriko grins, then looks up and
    swears at a wash of red/blue cop flash.

                             JERIKO
              Shit.  Fuckin' Five-O

    Our POV swings to the rear-view mirror and we see an LAPD
    car behind us, with the gumball machine on.  A spotlight
    hits us and we hear a single whoop on the siren.  Jeriko
    pulls over, but they are on an overpass... no shoulder.

                             COP VOICE
                      (on bullhorn)
              Go to the bottom of the ramp.

    Jeriko and Replay are both swearing.  He pulls the car
    down the ramp, stopping on a deserted street in a
    warehouse district.  Our POV looks around nervously.
    Black shadows and concrete pillars.  No-one around.  Cars
    whoosh by on the bridge above but they might as well be on
    Mars.  The car is stopped next to a train yard.  We hear
    the rumble of diesels nearby, the clank of freightcars.

    We see the outlines of TWO COPS advancing through the beam
    of the spotlight, their guns drawn.

                             JERIKO
                      (jumping out of the
                       car)
              Goddamn, now what you pull me over
              for?  If I was going any slower I'd
              be parked--

                             COP VOICE 1
              Get down on your knees and put your
              hands on your head.  Now!

                             COP VOICE 2
              Everyone else, out of the car and
              down on the ground.

    Our POV comes up and out of the car.  Jeriko is
    righteously pissed off.  He's not following orders.

                             COP VOICE 1
              Put your hands behind your head
              right now!

    He goes along, madder than ever.  The cops get Replay down
    on his knees as well, in the wet gutter next to the curb.

    The cops are closer now.  We see that they are SPREG and
    ENGELMAN.

                             ENGELMAN
                      (to us)
              Put your hands on the hood of the
              car and don't move.

    We exchange a look with Diamanda.  Fucking cops.  But
    Jeriko is winding them up.  Not giving them the pleasure
    of the humiliation.  You can see it escalating.

                             JERIKO
              I suppose you stopped us cause you
              had suspects fitting our description
              in the area, what you're gonna tell
              me.  What was the description?  Two
              black males in a car?  Yeah, right,
              I heard that one before...

    As Engelman pulls out Jeriko's wallet, looks at his ID,
    Jeriko checks name tags.

                             JERIKO
              Well you stopped the wrong black
              male tonight officer... what is it?
              Spreg.  Officer Spreg.  Cause I'm
              the 800 pound gorilla in your mist,
              fucker.  I make more in a day than
              you make in a year, and my lawyers
              love to spend my money dragging
              sorry-ass Aryan robocops like you
              into court.  Get a man down on the
              ground with no probable cause.  Fuck
              you!

                             SPREG
              Shut the fuck up!

    He kicks Jeriko down on his face.  Jeriko hits the ground
    hard.

                             DIAMANDA
                      (yelling)
              Leave the fuck off of us, we weren't
              doing anything...

                             SPREG
              Shut up!  Don't make me walk over
              there.

    Engelman shows the ID to Spreg, saying something we can't
    hear.

                             SPREG
              You're that rap puke?  Jeriko One?
              You're the one getting all the
              gangbangers to form citizens groups
              and go downtown... trying to rake
              the LAPD over a cheese grater?

                             JERIKO
              That's right.  And you're gonna be
              in my next song, motherfucker, it's
              called Robo-Spreg.

    Replay starts laughing.  Diamanda stifles a giggle.  Spreg
    is white-lipped with rage.  Years of frustration coming to
    a head.  Too many disciplinary actions, too many
    suspensions, too little appreciation of the tough job they
    do.

                             JERIKO
              It's a song about a cop who meets
              his worst nightmare, a nigger with
              enough political juice to crush his
              ass like a stink bug.  You're gonna
              be famous.

    Spreg looks around the empty street.  Looks at Engelman.
    Down at Jeriko, proned out on the pavement.  Replay's
    laughter in his ears.

                             SPREG
              I don't think so.

    And shoots him BLAM!  BLAM!  Twice in the back of the
    head.  Just like that.

    Diamanda screams.  Replay tries to roll to his feet.
    Spreg shoots him twice in the stomach.  Replay is
    screaming.  Rolling around, holding his guts.

                             SPREG
                      (shouting)
              Hey... I don't hear you laughing!

    Engelman's yelling something at him we can't hear.  Spreg
    turns, eyes wide with adrenaline.

                             SPREG
              Get the bitches.

    Engelman hesitates and then spins toward us.  Diamanda is
    screaming, backing away from Engelman.  Spreg shoots
    Replay four more times.

    We spin one-eighty and start to run.  Hear shots... BLAM!
    BLAM!  BLAM!  Spin back... to see Diamanda dropping to her
    knees.  Engelman shoots her again.  Then raises his gun
    toward us.

    We spin away.  The world becomes a kinetic blur.  The
    sound of shots.  We see puffs of dust on the ground in
    front of us.  Missed shots.  We tumble over a guardrail
    and roll down an embankment... get up and keep running.

    Train tracks ahead.  Looking back... here come Spreg and
    Engelman down the embankment, overtaking us.  We hear the
    thunder of a train... spinning again to look forward.
    Freight-train doing fifty on the nearest track.  Almost to
    us.

    We leap forward.  Over the track.  The diesel roars past
    behind us.  Looking back... a black wall of moving steel.
    Backing away from it.

    We see Engelman and Spreg crouching down... trying to aim
    through the wheels.  Hear the impotent pop of their guns
    over the roar of the train.

    Turning to run again.  We see a tiny hole appear in a sign
    right in front of us with a metallic SPANG.  Running and
    running.

    Looking back.  No pursuit.  Train still rolling by.  Can't
    see the cops.  Running, running.  Heart pounding and lungs
    heaving.  Sobbing sounds coming from somewhere, seeming to
    fill the night.

    Looking down... one shoe on, one shoe off.  Iris' hand
    takes off the remaining shoe, clutches it to her chest.
    We move forward into the dark train-yard as--

    THE TAPE ENDS.

    And Mace sits stone still.  Shakes.  For a beat.  And
    another.  Then she tears the trodes off and throws them
    across the room, near where Lenny is on the cellular.

                             LENNY
                      (into phone)
              Hang on.  Hang on, Max.
                      (looks at Mace)
              You see?

                             MACE
              I see.
                      (trembling)
              I see the earth opening up and
              swallowing us all.

                             LENNY
              Yeah I know.
                      (into cellular)
              So what do we do?

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  MAX'S CAR - NIGHT

    As Max drives along a crowded downtown street.

                             MAX
                      (into phone)
              Don't talk to anybody.  Anybody.
              You're invisible.  Okay?  Just meet
              me at Tick's in a half hour.  And
              Lenny... don't get pulled over.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    Lenny pushes "End" on his cellular and looks at Mace.  The
    first-time impact of the Squid experience, and the killing
    of Jeriko, still haunts her.  We've never seen Mace
    scared.  But she looks scared now.

                             LENNY
              We got to make another copy of this.
              Little life insurance.

                             MACE
              You know what this tape could do if it
              gets out.

                             LENNY
                      (tucking Glock in
                       his waistband)
              I've got a good idea, yeah.

                             MACE
              People finding out... seeing... that
              the LAPD just flat out executed
              Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they
              ought to see.

                             LENNY
              Maybe.  But tonight is probably not
              the best night.  Come on, we're
              rollin'.

    EXT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    Cecile catches them on the steps as they are leaving.

                             CECILE
              Lornette, when you gonna stop laying
              off everything on me?  We had plans
              tonight--

                             MACE
                      (steely)
              Listen to me, little sister.
              There's something going on, and it's
              very big.  Now you've got to take
              care of Zander.  And stay off the
              streets tonight... you hear me on
              this?

    Cecile gets the message.  She nods.

                             MACE
              Curtis.  What about you?  Do we
              understand each other?  You stay
              put.

                             CURTIS
              Yeah.  I'm wit it.

    Mace and Lenny go on down the steps to the car.

                             CURTIS
                      (to Cecile)
              Damn!  She worse than you.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  CIVIC AND STREET - NIGHT

    Lenny and Mace see helicopters circling as they maneuver
    the dark streets.  Xenon searchlights crisscross the
    rooftops nearby.  They see patrol cars passing on cross-
    streets, lights flashing.  It feels like the entire LAPD
    is looking for them.

    Everywhere in the street there are small crowds, street
    parties in progress.  People drinking and firing bottle
    rockets.  The police watch everything.

                             LENNY
              So, let's see, I've got Tran's
              goons, some squidhead psycho and the
              LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy
              new year, Lenny.

                             MACE
              Well, look at the plus side.

                             LENNY
              There's a plus side?

                             MACE
              Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape
              to save me.  That's real progress
              for you.

                             LENNY
              It was a tough call.

                             MACE
              I still can't square the psycho
              smarts of whoever did Iris with
              those two cops.

                             LENNY
              I don't think those cops did Iris.
              I think whoever Iris was wearing for
              killed her.

                             MACE
              Why?

                             LENNY
              To break the trail.  If those cops
              had gotten hold of her, they would
              have beat it out of her who she was
              wearing for, and then gone after
              them too.  Our killer is running as
              scared as we are.  Which makes him
              really dangerous.  Judging by how
              scared I am.

    They pull up to the checkpoint; Lenny squirrels into the
    seat, hiding in the shadows, as Mace flashes her security
    pass and the cop waves them on.

    Lenny lets his breath out slowly.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  UNDERGROUND GARAGE/TICK'S VAN

    Lenny and Mace pull in with a SQUEAL of brakes and park
    the car.  Sound of rock music -- some kind of refried
    psychedelia -- coming from Tick's van down the ramp.

    Mace and Lenny get out, approaching the van.  Hearing
    tires squeal, they turn to see Max pull up.  He gets out
    wearing an ill-fitting rental tux.  Music louder, echoing
    in the empty garage, even though the van is shut tight.

                             MAX
              Sounds like Tick's already
              celebrating.

                             LENNY
              You may be a little overdressed for
              this party.
                      (Lenny pounds on the
                       van door)
              Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!

    Mace slips out her .380, on alert.

                             LENNY
                      (knocks again, then opens
                       rear van door)
              Tick, I got to talk to you, man...
              oh shit.

    Tick's slumped in the back of the van with playback trodes
    on his head.  He's breathing, but otherwise he's still.
    Near lifeless.  A cyborg after a power outage.  All the
    equipment in the van is trashed.

                             LENNY
                      (as he starts to
                       examine Tick)
              He's been cooked-off

                             MAX
              Is he dead?

                             LENNY
              No.  But his frontal lobes are like
              two runny eggs.  They put an
              amplifier in-line to boost the
              signal till it french-fried his
              brain.

    Mace hits "Off" on the built-in CD player.  The sudden
    silence is creepy.  Lenny gets right in front of Tick's
    eyes, shouting at him, at the top of his lungs.

    TICK'S POV: We see a roaring blizzard of inchoate static.
    Somewhere in the middle of it is a suggestion of Lenny's
    face, almost invisible.  We hear the tiniest ghost of his
    voice, like a radio playing two blocks away.

                             LENNY
              He's totally cut off from the outer
              world.

                             MACE
              How long does it last?
                      (off Lenny's look)
              Oh.

                             MAX
              Those two psycho cops are on a
              slash-and-burn to find the tape and
              cover their tracks.

                             MACE
              This seems a little sophisticated
              for them.  These are not subtle
              guys.

                             MAX
              There's more to this whole thing
              than you think.

                             LENNY
              Whattya mean?

                             MAX
              All I'm saying... you don't know how
              high up the food chain this thing
              goes.  I've heard stuff.

                             LENNY
              What stuff?

                             MAX
              Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff
              about a death squad.  A group a guys
              loyal to the hardline school.  Guys
              that've had too many years of city
              hall and the review boards and the
              goddamn media pissing down their
              necks, suspending cops right and
              left, tying their hands... while
              outa the other side a their mouths
              these same people're squealing save
              us, save us, do something you
              fucking morons, crime is totally out
              of control.

    Lenny takes this in.  All the fight goes out of him.  This
    is just too overwhelming.

                             LENNY
              Jesus.

                             MAX
              Yeah.  So don't walk near me in
              public, alright.

                             LENNY
              Thanks, buddy.  See... things
              weren't bad enough.  They weren't
              fucking bad enough!

                             MACE
              The only card we have to play is the
              tape.  You know, we get it to the
              media somehow...

                             LENNY
              Yeah, right, blow it open.

                             MAX
                      (interrupting)
              Mace... no disrespect... but you run
              this on the 11 o'clock news, by
              midnight you got the biggest riot in
              history.  They'll see the fucking
              smoke from Canada.

                             LENNY
              Okay... what about Strickland?

                             MAX
              No.  Bad idea.

                             MACE
              Who's Strickland?

                             LENNY
              Deputy Commissioner Palmer
              Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick
              who busted me out.  His ass is so
              tight when he farts only dogs can
              hear it.  I know this guy.  If
              there's one cop who's not dirty
              it's him.

                             MAX
              Listen to me, Lenny... stay away
              from cops.  All cops.  You have no
              way of knowing who you can trust.

    Mace looks from one to the other with a growing expression
    of outrage.

                             MACE
              So you're saying we just pretend is
              didn't happen?  It happened!  The
              LAPD executed one of the most
              important black men in America!  Who
              the fuck are you to bury this?!

                             MAX
              Fine.  Do you want blood running
              waist deep in the storm drains?  The
              gangbangers'll spread like a wave
              through this city and burn it to the
              ground.  And when the fires start
              the street cops'll be capping off at
              anything that moves.  It'll be all-
              out war and you know it.

                             MACE
              Yeah, well maybe it's time for a
              war!

                             MAX
              You really want that on your head?

                             LENNY
              Hey, Max, Mace... whoa... time out.

                             MAX/MACE
                      (together/annoyed)
              What!?

                             LENNY
              Whoever killed Iris did Tick.  It's
              the same sick wirehead shit.  Same
              reason... to burn the trail.  If
              Faith knows anything about this, and
              I think she does, then she's on the
              list.  So... who's driving?

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  RETINAL FETISH/ALLEY - NIGHT

    Roadies are loading out gear through the back doors of the
    club into a van in the alley.  Lenny and Mace ENTER FRAME
    and we follow them between the roadies, going through the
    doors into...


    INT.  RETINAL FETISH

    A grungy black corridor.  The thunder of music gets louder
    with each step as Lenny and Mace walk down the corridor
    with purposeful strides.

    Through chainlink partitions and banks of dark equipment,
    Lenny catches glimpses of the stage.  He can see Faith in
    a blue-white spotlight.  She is a whirling dervish,
    convulsing with the divine madness of her music.  Beyond
    her, beyond the lights, in the gloom... Lenny can just see
    Tran and his entourage.  Dressed in tuxes, they look out
    of place... clearly on their way somewhere else as the
    evening progresses.

    Faith whirls to a stop as the band crashes in a final
    downbeat.  The spotlight goes out and the set is over.

    ON TRAN, clapping.  Watching.

    NEARBY, Max arrives through the crowd, scanning for
    Tran... spotting him.

    BACKSTAGE... FAITH, bathed in sweat, walking along a dark
    corridor backstage.  WE TRACK WITH HER, as she walks
    through the shadows, like a fighter returning from the
    ring, soaked and breathing hard.

    A HAND shoots from a black doorway and covers her mouth,
    pulling her into the shadows.  Terrified for a split
    second... before she recognizes that it is Lenny.  He
    pulls her into the room and closes the door.  It is Tex
    Arcana's VJ control room, full of monitors and constantly
    changing graphic images.  Tex is not there.

                             FAITH
              Lenny!  Jesus!  You scared the Hell
              out of me.

    Faith sees that Mace is standing there, in the shadows,
    waiting.  She turns back to Lenny with a frown.

                             FAITH
              What's going on?

                             LENNY
              Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris
              made me a copy of the tape.

                             FAITH
              Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep
              you out of this.

    But she seems relieved now that he knows, now that there
    is someone to talk to.

                             LENNY
              How did it happen?  What was Iris
              doing riding around with Jeriko
              wearing a wire?

                             FAITH
              We should talk alone.

                             LENNY
              No.  Mace is in this.

                             MACE
              Tell us.

                             FAITH
              Tran's gotten obsesses with
              playback, a total wiretrip junkie.
              And he's such a control freak, he's
              been having people followed,
              videotaped... recording his business
              partners' calls.  Wiring up people
              left and right.

    INT.  CLUB/MAIN FLOOR

    Tran looks at his watch and gets up from the table,
    impatient.

                             TRAN
              Let's go get her.  We're late.

    Max shows up suddenly, right in front of him.  Stopping
    him.

                             MAX
              Tran, listen.  I was wondering how
              you want me to work it tonight, down
              at the Bonaventure.  You want me
              downstairs at the party or upstairs
              at the suite?  Where you going to
              be, mostly?

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  TEX'S ROOM

    While Max stalls, Faith talks.

                             FAITH
              Tran and Jeriko weren't getting
              along.  He was afraid Jeriko was
              getting ready to dump him, but he
              wasn't sure, so he started with the
              surveillance.  A couple nights ago
              he wires up Iris and sends her and
              the other girl, Diamanda, over to
              Jeriko's table.

    CUT TO: TWO NIGHTS AGO, Iris, wearing a wig, leaves Tran's
    table with Diamanda and moves toward... a booth in the
    Retinal Fetish where Jeriko One sits with Replay.  Iris
    stands over Jeriko for just a moment.  Then he nods,
    smiles a little, and moves over to make room for her in
    the booth right next to him.

                             FAITH
              That night Iris calls up, freaking.
              She comes over and Tran watches the
              tape.  He just loses it.  He can't
              believe the disaster she's gotten
              him into.  He's terrified the cops
              will beat it out of her who she was
              working for, and come looking for
              him.

    CUT TO: TRAN'S LOFT as a tear-streaked and frantic Iris is
    telling Tran about how the cops tried to kill her (we
    don't hear).  Tran backhands her furiously, his face thin-
    lipped with rage.  She crumples to the floor, sobbing.
    Tran keeps looking at the squid tape in his hand like it's
    poison.

                             LENNY
              Kinda guy you can count on in a
              pinch.

                             MACE
              Why didn't he just go public with
              the tape?  Save himself that way.

    CUT TO: An image of Tran burning the squid tape.  It
    blazes in his hand and he hurls it into the fireplace like
    a venomous snake.

                             FAITH
              The scandal would wipe him out.  If
              it got out that he had his own
              artists under surveillance... he'd
              lose all his other acts.  He'd be
              over.

    Now we see Tran, more composed, comforting Iris.  He wipes
    at her tear-streaked face.  Hands her a wad of bills.

                             FAITH
              So finally he gives Iris some cash
              and tells her to check into the
              hotel under a wrong name till he
              figures out what to do.

                             LENNY
              Yeah... he figured out what to do
              all right.

                             FAITH
              You think Tran killed her?

                             LENNY
              The killer knew right where she was.
              Because he put her there.

                             FAITH
              What a nightmare.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  MAIN FLOOR

    Tran impatiently gestures to Corto.

                             TRAN
              Go get her, Joey.  Stupid bitch.
                      (to Max)
              We'll talk about this later.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  TEX'S ROOM

    Mace is getting the sixth sense feeling that seconds
    count.

                             MACE
              Come on.  We're out of here.

    Lenny gets close to Faith, taking her face in his hands.

                             LENNY
              Leave here with me, right now.

    Mace sighs heavily, rolls her eyes toward the ceiling.
    Faith considers her options.  Then she smiles at him.

                             FAITH
              Okay, Lenny.  My guardian angel.

    Faith hugs him, and he clutches her.  Mace locks her jaw
    and looks away.  This is hard for her.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORRIDOR

    Mace leads the way, with Lenny following, gripping Faith's
    hand like Orpheus leading Eurydice out of Hell.  They push
    through shapes of people in the thundering dark corridor.
    Half-lit, in alcoves, far-gone wireheads loll in semi-
    consciousness.  Faith looks back and sees:

    TRAN'S POSSE rounding a corner... spotting them.  They
    start shoving through the crowd like juggernauts, knocking
    protesting people out of the way.

    Mace, Lenny and Faith break into a run, pounding down the
    corridor.

    Behind them, Duncan leads the charge.  Suddenly TEX ARCANA
    shoots into the hallway, intentionally blocking their path
    with his wheelchair.  Duncan crashes over him, toppling
    the chair, and they both sprawl to the floor.  Vita,
    Beemer and Corto go around the sprawl.

    Tex, like many legless men, has incredibly strong arms.
    Lenny looks back to see him pounding Duncan's head against
    the floor...

                             TEX
              Teach you...
                      (pound)
              to mess with...
                      (pound)
              a helpless cripple!

    Lenny et al reach the main floor of the club where they
    shove through the buffeting crowd amid strobe-flashes and
    a wall of sound.

    Behind them we see Corto and Beemer hurling partiers
    aside, cutting a swath, while Vita moves like a mongoose
    through tall grass.  Mace drops back, going tail-end-
    Charlie... her bodyguard mode kicking in.

    ON LENNY AND FAITH, charging through the jostling crowd,
    Lenny is looking back, then he looks ahead and...

    TRAN is right in front of him.  In the whirling shapes and
    colors of the crowd, he is an island of composure in a
    white tux.  He holds a glass of champagne in one hand, the
    bottle in the other.  In one lightning-fast move he
    uppercuts with the bottle, clipping Lenny under the jaw.
    Faith screams as Lenny staggers.  Tran swings again,
    smashing the bottle over the back of Lenny's head.  Lenny
    sprawls on the floor amid champagne foam and glass.

    Lenny, blood flowing in his eyes, rises blearily to see
    Faith being pulled away by Tran, who has her arm twisted
    viciously behind her back.  They go around a chain-link
    divider and double back, heading for the exit.  Lenny
    staggers to the chainlink, sagging to his knees again as
    Faith passes within a few inches of him.  He slips down
    the chainlink, into unconsciousness, as her image is lost
    in the pounding darkness.

    Mace gets to him through the crowd, and then whirls like a
    cat as the Posse arrives.  She stands guard over him like
    a rabid dog, her .380 auto straightarmed and covering them
    expertly.  Corto eyes her with hatred.  The stitches on
    his nose and the bruised swelling are a reminder of his
    last run-in with her.  He backs off.

                             CORTO
                      (to the others)
              Not here.  Lets go.

    They back off, fading into the crowd... catching up with
    Tran at the exit.

    Mace watches them recede.  Then she bends to Lenny.  Max
    arrives a moment later and they lift him to his feet.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  RETINAL FETISH/ALLEY - NIGHT

    Max and Mace support a semi-conscious Lenny, hustling him
    to the car.  As they are putting him in the car, TWO LAPD
    OFFICERS come through the crowd, eyeing the bleeding
    Lenny.

                             MAX
              Everything's cool.  Too much to
              drink.

    Lenny picks this moment to slump sideways, falling half
    out of the car.  The squid tape of the Jeriko kill falls
    out of his jacket pocket and clatters to the pavement.
    Mace's eyes go wide.  The boot of one of the cops is
    inches from it.

                             MACE
              Yeah, uh... he slipped on the
              stairs.  We're taking him to
              emergency.
                      (to the nearest cop)
              Excuse me.

    The cop steps back, giving Mace room to push Lenny back up
    in the seat.  She surreptitiously kicks the tape under the
    car, over to the driver's side.

                             COP
              Go to Cedars.  It's closest.

    Mace nods and goes around the car.  Max starts asking them
    questions and the cops turn away, distracted.  She picks
    up the tape and gets in.  Closes the door.  Let's out a
    big breath.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  PARKING GARAGE/BONAVENTURE HOTEL - NIGHT

    A line of expensive cars waiting to valet park.  Tran's
    limo jumps the line and swoops up parallel to the elevator
    doors.  The posse get out, scowling at the valet who
    swallows his protest.  Tran emerges, helping Faith out
    with a firm grip on her arm which he does not release as
    they head for the elevators.

    They push through a group waiting for an elevator... men
    in tuxes, women in gowns and diamonds.  The elevator opens
    and Tran's entourage sweeps inside.  Beemer and Duncan
    block any civilians from entering.


    INT.  ELEVATOR

    They ride in silence a moment.  Faith is pale, her jaw
    clenching.  Tran has her arm in a tight grip.  There is a
    march-to-the-gallows feel about the moment.

                             FAITH
              Well, I'm certainly in the mood for
              a party.

                             TRAN
                      (to Wade)
              Take her up to the suite.
                      (to Faith)
              Have a glass of champagne... or
              six... I'll be up in a while to help
              you ring in the New Year.

                             FAITH
              I live for the moment.

    The elevator doors open, revealing...


    INT.  FOYER AND BALLROOM

    The heart of the MILLENNIUM L.A. New Year's ball.  A
    glitterati event in full swing.  Red carpet, minicam
    lights and paparazzi.  Limos pulling up outside four deep.
    Movie stars rubbing elbows with politicos, music movers
    and shakers chatting with city hall types.  This is a
    party to celebrate the millennium, sure, but its main
    function is to celebrate the celebrants: if you're here,
    there's no need to be anywhere else.  There is a heavy
    police presence, as well as lots of private security.

    Tran exits the elevator with Vita Minh, Joey Corto and
    Duncan.  They wedge through the crowd, Tran smiling.
    Nodding to people he knows.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    Lenny is in a chair in the kitchen, listening to Max on
    the cellular.  He is holding a dish-towel full of ice
    cubes on his scalp.  It is soaked with blood and his
    Armani jacket and silk shirt are spattered.  Mace lifts
    the ice pack to check that the bleeding has stopped.

                             MACE
              You are a pussy-whipped sorry-ass
              motherfucker, you know that?

    She slaps the ice pack back down.

                             LENNY
              Owww!!  Take it easy.
                      (to phone)
              Uh huh.  So where are they now?

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  BALLROOM/BONAVENTURE HOTEL

    TIGHT ON MAX, leaning against a pillar.  He looks over his
    shoulder, around the column.

    MAX'S POV: through a dense throng of glitterati we see
    Tran and his entourage seated at a table, holding court
    with music types and politicos.

                             MAX
              He's got her up in the room, under
              guard.  And he's still working the
              party... acting smooth like nothin's
              nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work
              a trade.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              What do you mean?

                             MAX
              Give him the tape.  See?  It's
              fucking brilliant!  The tape for
              Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I
              can set it up.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              This is what we laughingly refer to
              as a plan, right?

                             MAX
              Come on!  If he gives us any shit,
              we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?
                      (same old Max)
              Just get your butt down here.  If
              I'm not at the shindig downstairs
              go to the room.  It's 2203.  You
              writin'?

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  APARTMENT

    On Lenny, at the table.  He dabs his finger in the blood
    on the ice pack and writes the number on the table top.

                             LENNY
              2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.

                             MAX (V.O.)
              I intend to.

    Lenny punches END.  Mace looks at the number written in
    blood on the white formica.  Her eyes ratchet up, boring
    into Lenny.  Not noticing, he gets up, still woozy, and
    staggers to his wardrobe bag across the room.

                             LENNY
              Okay, we gotta get over there.
                      (opens the bag)
              Can you borrow a dress from Cecile
              or something--

                             MACE
              I'm not going.

                             LENNY
              Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's
              gonna do her right there unless--

                             MACE
              Lenny... shutup.  Just park your
              mouth and listen.  It's a set-up.
              Think about it!  Why's he been
              sending you tapes?  To freak you,
              get you to rush in without thinking.
              Then they put one in you, put one in
              her, put the gun in your hand...
              crime of passion.  This guy's bent
              enough to think of that.

    Lenny nods, hearing what she is saying.

                             LENNY
              That sounds right.
                      (but it changes
                       nothing)
              I'm going.

    He reaches into his wardrobe bag... pulling out the box of
    "Faith" tapes and setting it aside, then pulling out the
    suit.  Mace's frustration explodes as anger.

    She grabs his shoebox full of tapes.  Holds them up to
    him.

                             MACE
              You gonna get yourself killed for
              this?  This toxic-waste bitch!

    She dumps the box of tapes on the floor.  She starts
    stomping on them with one heel, crunching several into
    junk.

                             LENNY
              What the fuck are you doing?!

    Lenny freaks out and scrambles to pick them up, trying to
    stop her, push her away.  They struggle for a pathetic,
    tragic moment.

    Mace snaps.  She grabs him by the lapels and swings him
    around, slamming him back against a wall.

                             MACE
              Lenny!  This is your life, Lenny!
              Right here.  Right now.  This is
              realtime... not playback.  Real...
              time.  Time to get real.  Understand
              what I'm saying... she doesn't love
              you.  Maybe she did once, I don't
              know, but she doesn't now.  These
              are used emotions.  It's time to
              trade them in.

    Mace's tone becomes more gentle.  We see that her outburst
    is, beneath it all, coming from a place of compassion.

                             MACE
              Lenny, memories were meant to fade.
              They're designed that way for a
              reason.

    Lenny seems to crumple.  He knows he has to let go.  But
    it is so painful.

                             LENNY
              Have you ever been in love with
              somebody who didn't return that
              love?

    Mace gives him a look like, jeez Lenny, are you dumb
    sometimes.

                             MACE
              Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.

                             LENNY
              It didn't stop you from loving them.
              Right?  Or understanding them, or
              being able to forgive them...

                             MACE
              I guess.

                             LENNY
              And it didn't stop you from wanting
              to protect them.  Did it?

                             MACE
              No.  It didn't.

    Lenny's eyes are brimming with tears.  He makes no attempt
    to hide it... doesn't brush them away.

                             LENNY
              I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent
              Crimes... and I saw every known
              depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In
              outer darkness.  Then I busted this
              strung-out little teeny-hooker.
              When I met Faith she was just
              another runaway giving twenty dollar
              blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost
              soul.

                             MACE
              You never told me.

                             LENNY
              But she was different.  There was a
              light in her eyes... and she had
              this voice.  It was scary, all that
              pain coming out of that little body.
              Like she could take all the hurt and
              rage of the entire world and lift it
              up to heaven in one voice.  I helped
              her.  And I promised her that I'd
              always be there... to protect her.
                      (long pause)
              See?  It's not about what's in her
              head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't
              let go of the promise.  It's...
              like... it's all I have left.

                             MACE
              No, it's not.

    Mace takes his face in her hands.  She kisses him lightly
    on the cheek, where the tear-track is.

                             MACE
              Come on, Lenny.  Let's go to a
              party.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET AND BONAVENTURE HOTEL - NIGHT

    11:07  P.M.

    IT IS THE MOTHER OF ALL PARTIES.  IN AN AERIAL SHOT we see
    there must be 100,000 people jamming the closed streets of
    downtown L.A.  Arc lights sweep the sky.  There are two
    outdoor bandstands, with live music pounding.  There are
    lasers, strobe-lights.  People are literally dancing in
    the streets... if they can move at all.  Huge projection
    video screens are set up all over the place.

    LA is connected to other cities all over the world by
    satellite, sharing in the celebration in different time
    zones.  The excitement has been building all evening as
    midnight sweeps across the country toward the West Coast.
    It looks like a U2 concert 10 blocks long: a multimedia
    blow-out.

    Madness in the streets.  And Lenny and Mace are stuck in
    it.  The Civic can't move in the middle of this millennial
    Mardi Gras.  People swarm around, pounding on the Civic as
    they go by, or press their faces against the glass.  It
    may be the party of the century, but it looks like the
    middle of a third world revolution.

                             MACE
              That's it.  Let's bail.

    And she's out of the car, leaving the keys, ignoring the
    protesting horns behind her.  And we see that she's
    wearing a short black cocktail dress.  Lenny comes around
    the car, through the wild crowd.  He's in his other suit.
    Snappy.

    Mace unselfconsciously hikes up her dress and slips her
    .380 auto into a holster velcroed to her leg.  She pulls
    the dress down and you can't see the gun, hidden between
    her upper thighs.

    In fact, it looks like she couldn't be concealing a
    quarter anywhere on her body.  The dress is cut low at the
    top and high at the bottom, showing plenty of muscular
    legs.  High heels doing great things for her calves.  Her
    braids now loose and full, like a mane.

    Lenny glances at Mace and does a double take.  He is
    caught by a sudden realization:

                             LENNY
              Mace... you're a girl.

                             MACE
              Good, Lenny.  I can see why the
              detective gig didn't work out.  Come
              on.

    They push their way through the swirling mass of humanity.
    Mace moving like a wedge, security training coming to the
    fore.  The whole street is vacuum-packed with people.
    Filled with cars deserted in the general euphoria, an
    unparted Red Sea of man and machine.

    They will move through the various strata of society as
    they work their way in to the party's inner sanctum.  It
    is like all of LA, from poorest to richest, compressed
    into a few square blocks.  There are cops everywhere.
    Cops on motorcycles, cops in cars, cops in riot gear.

    Lenny scopes out the security at the front entrance...
    metal detectors, cops... plus you have to have a 500
    dollar-a-plate ticket.

                             LENNY
              Got your ticket?

                             MACE
              No.  They must have sent it to my
              beach house by mistake.

    Lenny motions toward the back of the hotel and Mace
    follows.  They pass a uniformed cop who is standing thirty
    feet away, his back to them.

    REVERSE ANGLE: It is SPREG.  His black eyes scan the
    crowd.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  HOTEL KITCHEN

    ON LENNY AND MACE moving with purpose through the vast
    steaming factory of the kitchen where a thousand dinners
    are being prepared.  They are ignored by the bustling
    staff.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  HOTEL BALLROOM

    Lenny and Mace emerge from a service door into the
    glitterati crowd, heading into the ballroom.

    They scan the room.

                             LENNY
              You see Tran?

                             MACE
              Uh unh.

    Lenny whips out his cellular and recalls Max's number.  He
    hears the phone connect.  It starts to ring.

    LENNY'S POV... as the crowd parts for a moment.  He sees
    PALMER STRICKLAND talking to a city-hall type.  Lenny
    turns away before Strickland sees him.

                             LENNY
                      (to the ringing
                       phone)
              Come on, Max.  Come on, buddy...
                      (two more rings)
              Damnit.

    He looks around now.  Starting to feel the creeping edge
    of panic.  No Tran.  No Max.

                             LENNY
              Alright.  We're going up.

                             MACE
              And do what?  Take on his whole
              posse?

                             LENNY
              I still got one ace to play.  Tran's
              got what I want... and I've got what
              he wants...

    Lenny pulls the Jeriko tape out of his breast-pocket and
    holds it up.  Mace just stares at him completely outraged.

                             MACE
              That's the original.  There are no
              copies.

                             LENNY
                      (not getting it)
              Exactly.  That's why it's a make-
              able deal.

    Mace gets very, very close to Lenny, and her voice drops
    to an odd, cold... lethal-sounding... growl.

                             MACE
              Look.  That tape is a lightning bolt
              from God.  It's worth more than you,
              more than me, more than Faith.  You
              understand?  It can change things.
              Things that need changing before we
              all go off the end of the road.  And
              you do not have the right to use it
              for currency.
                      (Lenny's eyes are
                       wide)
              You go... you go alone.  This is
              where I draw the line.  I care about
              you Lenny... a lot more than you
              know... which makes us both pretty
              stupid.  But you pawn that tape, you
              mean nothing to me.

    Lenny doesn't know what to say.  Tough choice.  He
    clenches his jaw...

    And turns away.  He strides into the crowd, heading for
    the lobby and the elevators.

    ON MACE, watching him go.  Wanting to run and stop him.
    But she's said what there is to say.  She turns away,
    desolate and churning with emotion.  The moment lengthens
    as she wrestles with it.  You see her fury, her sadness...
    and her protective instincts.  Her resolve fails her.
    Ultimately, she must protect him if she can.

                             MACE
              Ah, hell.  Lenny--

    She turns, running toward the lobby.  And...
    BOOM.  Slams into him.  He came back.

    Lenny takes her hand and puts the tape in her palm.
    Closes her fingers on it.

                             LENNY
              See that guy?
                      (pointing)
              The one with the ramrod up his ass.
              That's Strickland.

    Mace follows his look to Strickland, across the room.

                             LENNY
              Take it to him.

                             MACE
              A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!

                             LENNY
              No.  Trust me.

    He unclips his playback deck from his belt and hands it to
    her.

                             MACE
                      (nodding slowly)
              Oh boy.
                      (she takes a deep
                       breath)
              What if you're wrong?

                             LENNY
              Then we'll be right where we are
              now.

                             MACE
              Yeah, right.  Fucked.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  BONAVENTURE ELEVATOR

    It is a glass-cage scenic elevator, running up the outside
    of the building.  10th floor.  The last passengers step
    out.  When the doors whoosh closed and Lenny's left alone
    there's only the sound of Muzak Christmas carols.  The
    elevator rises, the lights of LA spread out below.  He is
    hyperventilating.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  HOTEL BALLROOM

    Mace threads her way past tables circling a dance floor
    full of dancers and makes her way through celebs air-
    kissing each other.

    But as she gets near Strickland's table, he stands up and
    excuses himself.  He starts toward the men's room.  And
    Mace follows him.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  MEN'S ROOM/HOTEL

    A few guys in tuxes tending to themselves.  Strickland
    enters, crossing to a urinal.  He unzips.

    Mace steps up beside him.  Guys behind her looking on,
    slack-jawed.  Mace pays no attention to them.  Strickland,
    stern and flinty-eyed, raises one eyebrow.

                             STRICKLAND
              Yes?

    She puts the playback deck on top of Strickland's urinal.
    He scowls.

                             MACE
              There's a tape in there you need to
              see.  I mean right now.

    While see is looking at Strickland, a young LAPD OFFICER
    comes out of a stall, and goes to the sink.  He glances in
    the mirror at Mace.

                             STRICKLAND
              If it wasn't New Year's Eve, I'd
              arrest you for possession of illegal
              equipment--

                             MACE
                      (interrupting)
              Just look at the tape!  You want to
              know who killed Jeriko One?  Go in
              the stall right now and hit Play.

    The young cop steps up behind her.

                             YOUNG COP
              Sir, is there a problem here?

    Mace turns.  Oh shit.  She backs away from them.

                             MACE
              Damn!  I knew it--

    Strickland motions with his eyes and the cop grabs for
    her.  Mace twists viciously out of his grip, knocks him
    down and vanishes out the door.

    STRICKLAND hefts the recorder, pondering it.  His
    expression is opaque.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  HALLWAY/BONAVENTURE HOTEL

    Lenny comes out of the elevator.  Standing at the corner,
    where he can watch the elevators and the corridor, is Wade
    Beemer.  Lenny doesn't break stride.  Just walks toward
    Beemer.  He's not afraid anymore.  He's pissed off.
    Beemer moves toward him.

                             LENNY
              Now, Wade, can we talk here, like
              two human beings--

    We think he's starting the usual negotiation.  But when he
    gets in range he lets fly with a line-drive right,
    straight into Beemer's face.  We're talking a John Wayne
    haymaker punch.  He staggers back, surprised and dazed,
    and Lenny knees him right in the gut as hard as he can.

    He drops to his knees, sucking wind.  Lenny draws his
    Glock and puts it behind Beemer's ear, pulling a pair of
    handcuffs off his belt.  Okay, we're starting to believe
    he might have been a cop once.

                             LENNY
              It's not personal.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  BALLROOM

    Mace, moving fast as she can through the crowd and past
    the tables when...

    ... she's grabbed by DUNCAN.  He gets her in a good tight
    come-along.  Like any good security person, the hold is
    not so obvious that the party around them is disrupted.
    VITA MINH steps up next to her, closing ranks.

    MACE IS WALKED around behind the bandstand.  Joey Corto
    walks up to her, looking mean and smug.

    Mace twists one hand free and snaps it out in a blur.  Her
    open palm breaks Corto's nose with an audible crunch.
    Corto screams and grabs his face.

                             CORTO
              Aw, not the fucking nose!!

    She slams her foot down on Duncan's instep and snaps her
    head back simultaneously in a reverse head-butt.  He keeps
    the hold.  Mace drives her free hand back into the
    approximate position of his nuts.  Even though Duncan
    looks like he bench-presses Buicks, this has the desired
    effect.

    Mace jerks away from him, shoving him back through a
    buffet table.  Vita draws a knife in a lightning move
    but...

    Suddenly Mace is standing there with her dress hiked up
    and her pistol straight-armed, with the muzzle right in
    her face.  Vita says the smartest line of the night.

                             VITA
              Hey, enjoy the party.

    Mace spins and sprints through dumbfounded glitterati, her
    gun innocuously tight to her side.  She spots a red "Exit"
    sign above a fire door and goes through.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  STAIRWELL AND PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE

    Lenny closes the stairwell door, giving us a quick glimpse
    of Beemer handcuffed to the steel railing.  Lenny moves
    down the empty corridor.

    He approaches suite 2203.  The door is ajar.  Always a bad
    sign.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

    Mace finds herself back in the millennium madness, among
    the street crowd who don't even notice her.  She holsters
    the gun and moves away from possible pursuit.  The sky
    explodes with purple light as huge fireworks go off
    overhead.  A crack like thunder follows.  Then more
    flashes.

    The countdown to midnight has begun.  The party is
    building to a crescendo.  It seems to have a surreal,
    nightmarish quality.  She passes a MIME in a clock suit,
    who keeps adjusting the hands closer to midnight.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  SUITE 2203

    As Lenny enters the suite.  It is very quiet.  Dark.

    Lenny's heart is pounding.  He moves through the luxurious
    suite, gun in the low-ready position.

    Lenny can barely breathe from the tension.  He notices
    that one balcony door is open.  The roar of the crowd
    comes in like the sound of surf from far below.  Fireworks
    explode across the sky, and the cheers sound like distant
    screams of slaughter.

    His feet crunch on broken glass... a shattered champagne
    bottle.  A lamp is knocked over.  He reaches the door to
    the bedroom and looks in.  The room is empty.  The bed is
    unmade, the bedspread and sheet pulled off.  This isn't
    right.  None of this is right.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET PARTY/HOTEL

    Mace is scanning warily as she circles the hotel, looking
    for a way back in.  She turns and sees ENGELMAN in the
    crowd, not twenty feet from her.  He is looking right at
    her.  Not recognizing her for a moment.  Then... he
    realizes who she is.

    He starts toward her and Mace pushes people out of the
    way, breaking into a run.  Engelman charges after her,
    pulling out his rover to call Spreg.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE

    Lenny looks back at the living room.  Suddenly he notices
    something on the coffee table.  It is an envelope, with
    NERO hand-printed on it.  He is drawn to it, hypnotically.
    He opens it...

    ... and with a nightmarish sense of destiny a SQUID TAPE
    falls out into his hand.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

    Now both Spreg and Engelman are stalking Mace through the
    crowd.  Spreg catches a glimpse of her running and he
    charges after her, like a bull, with his gun drawn.  He
    hammers through anybody that gets in his way.

    Mace kicks off her high heels and goes flat out, an Indian
    runner.

    Sprinting through the crowd, she sees an apparition ahead
    of her... a guy wearing Death's Head make-up and a black
    shroud, carrying a huge cardboard scythe in one hand and a
    doll (New Year's Baby) in the other.  Death watches her
    pass.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE

    LENNY, moving as if he's in a trance, puts the trodes on
    his head.  TIGHT ON THE PLAY BUTTON as his finger punches
    down.

    IN POV we approach room 2203.  It is the familiar
    monochromatic vision of the killer.  Our hands open the
    door quietly with a keycard.  We enter the suite.

    Some of the lights are on.  We see Faith out on the
    balcony.  Watching the sea of madness below.  She comes
    back in, carrying an empty champagne glass.  She grabs a
    bottle off an end-table and up-ends it.  Empty.  She hurls
    it across the room, and it shatters against the wall.

    We approach her, standing with her back to us.  Closer.
    Only a few feet now.  She whips around, startled.  Gasping
    loudly.  But then... she recognizes the wearer.

                             FAITH
              Oh.  I didn't hear you come in.

    THE RECORDING STOPS, in a blast of static.  Lenny jerks at
    the discontinuity in the input, he is so keyed up.

    THE RECORDING RESTARTS: A new image resolves out of
    static.  Faith is pushed roughly down on the bed.  We
    climb onto the bed, straddling her, and she gasps.  We
    turn her onto her back.

    She has been blindfolded.  The Wearer goes SSSHHH.  A
    warning.  Like the hiss of a snake.  Our hands seize her
    wrists and handcuff them one by one to the iron frame at
    the head of the bed.

    The hands go out of sight and then reappear holding a set
    of trodes.  They are placed on her head... the spidery
    gecko-hand device almost disappearing in her black hair.

    LENNY'S guts have turned to water.  He is shaking his head
    in horror...

                             LENNY
              No, no, no...

    IN POV we see one of our hands come up holding the yellow
    plastic razor knife.  The blade clicks out to its full
    length.

    Our hands reach down and slowly slit her dress open,
    starting between her breasts and going down out of sight.
    She groans, squirming away from the cold knife.  The
    killer's hands open the material, exposing her white body,
    which in his peculiar vision is pure ivory.  The knife
    deftly cuts off her panties.

    We unbuckle our pants and reach for her, grasping her
    hips, pulling her to us.

    ON LENNY, gagging.  Overcome by revulsion and horror,
    mixing obscenely with the pleasure flooding into him from
    the tape.

    BACK TO POV as we pull our belt out of the belt loops of
    our pants and wrap it around Faith's neck.  Faith begins
    to pant in tiny rapid breaths.  We tighten the belt
    slowly.

    LENNY tears the trodes from his head.  He clutches his
    stomach, gasping for breath.  Carrying the playback deck,
    he staggers into the bedroom... to the bed.  He stares
    wildly around the room.

    One whole wall of the bedroom is mirrored.  In the mirror
    he spots a shape, on the floor beyond the bed.  It is
    covered in the bed sheet, but it is clearly a human form,
    propped up against the wall on the far side of the night
    stand.  He missed it in his earlier look from the bedroom
    door.

    Lenny moves around the bed and reaches down to the foot of
    the figure, grasping the edge of the sheet with a
    trembling hand.  With horrified apprehension he pulls on
    the sheet.

    It reveals the head and upper body of... Tran Vo.

    The last thing he expected.  Lenny leans close and sees
    that Tran is breathing shallowly, but his eyes are vacant.
    He looks like Tick did.

    Lenny sits on the bed and puts the trodes back on.  The
    fireworks and screaming outside sound like some
    nightmarish war, like the sound of the world coming to an
    end.  But all Lenny cares about is what's on the tape.  He
    hits PLAY.

    THE POV CONTINUES where it left off.  Faith's body lurches
    with the Wearer's thrusts.  His hand tightens the belt.

    Lenny feels the climax building.

    Faith's body shakes as the killer comes... she cries out
    herself, in pain... or is it?  The killers hand releases
    the belt.  We see Faith gasping for breath and moaning.

    Suddenly the POV whips sideways to the mirrored closet
    doors along one wall.  In the mirror is a reflection of
    the bed and on it Faith.  And on her...

    ... MAX.

    Pants down, her legs pulled up around him.  They are both
    gasping for breath, spent, following their shattering
    orgasms.  He runs his hands over her sweat-slick belly.

    LENNY is stunned beyond his power to imagine.  He does not
    have the strength or the will to stop the tape.

    IN POV Max's hands remove her blindfold.  She looks right
    at us, still gasping with the aftershocks of her pleasure.
    Max's hands undo the handcuffs, freeing her.  She reaches
    for us, her eyes glittering with sated lust.  We slump
    forward onto her, and her face fills the POV.

                             FAITH
              I love you.

    Lenny is reeling with these revelations.  His best friend
    is the killer.  And the woman he loved loves him.  But the
    tape is not over...

    THE POV CONTINUES as Max's eyes whip around in response to
    a sound behind them.  The bedroom door is opening.  Tran
    is standing there, stunned.  Maybe the first time he's
    ever been surprised in his life.  What a way to start.

    Like lightning we are off the bed snatching our .45 from
    the night stand and whipping around... putting the muzzle
    right in Tran's face.  We pull him roughly across the
    room, too stunned to resist.

                             TRAN
              You're going to die, you're both
              going to fucking die.

    We slam him back against the mirror wall and jam the
    muzzle of the gun right in his mouth: a deadly gag.  Using
    the gun we push him down until he is sitting on the floor
    with his back to the mirror.

    Our eyes whip to Faith.  She is freaking out.  We see
    Max's reflection in the mirror as he talks to her, talking
    fast.

                             MAX
              This piece of puke hired me to kill
              you, baby.  Do you believe that?
              Isn't that right, Tran?  You
              pinhead.

                             FAITH
              Oh my God.  I don't believe this is
              happening.

                             MAX
              Believe it.  Now bring me the
              trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.

                             FAITH
              What're you going to do?

    Still in a kind of stupor, she hands him the trodes.  Max
    puts the trodes on Tran's head, then pulls something out
    of his pocket.  It is a booster box.  He plugs it into the
    deck.  He takes the gain control and cranks it all the way
    up.  He's setting up a cook-off.  Tran's eyes go wide when
    he figures that out, starts to splutter.

                             FAITH
              You can't just... kill him.

                             MAX
              I'm not.  Just a little poach job.

                             FAITH
              Jesus.

                             MAX
              Hey, he was going to kill you.  And
              this ratfuck paid to have Iris
              killed, to save his own sorry ass.

    Tran freaks at that point but Max jams the gun deep into
    his throat, up to the trigger guard, choking off his
    words.

                             MAX
              You shut the fuck up, right now,
              I'm gonna pull this fuckin' trigger!

    K-BANG!  Faith shrieks, thinking Max shot him.  But it's
    just the start of the fireworks outside (remember all this
    has already happened relative to Lenny entering the
    suite).

                             MAX
              Look, baby, it's now of never... the
              guy is a known input junkie, so a
              little OD won't surprise anybody.
              It's the only way we can be
              together.  You know it's true.

                             FAITH
              My God.

    We don't know if her reaction is to the horror of what is
    about to happen, or to the realization that she has the
    capacity to let it happen.

                             MAX
              Here's how much I love you, baby.

    She stares, transfixed, as Max reaches for the deck.  He
    punches PLAY.  Max puts his hand over Tran's mouth to
    muffle his screams as the input hits his brain like a
    screaming chainsaw of static from Hell.  The screaming
    outside, the pandemonium, give the moment a special
    madness.

    The POV turns, looking out the window... staring fixedly
    at burst after burst of brilliant fireworks.  Like the
    fireworks inside Tran's head.

    THE TAPE ENDS.

    Lenny takes off the trodes.  He is wrung out, drenched
    with sweat.  We see that there is a figure standing in the
    doorway behind him.  Lenny turns, not surprised to see Max
    there with his .45 aimed at Lenny's chest.  Max's surgical
    gloves look incongruous with his tux.

                             MAX
              Don't make any assumptions about our
              friendship, Lenny.

    Lenny stands up, slowly.

                             LENNY
              No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know
              you were colorblind, Max.

                             MAX
              Only way I could stand your ties.

    Max moves up to him cautiously, and takes the Glock out of
    Lenny's waistband.

                             MAX
              I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.

                             LENNY
              Where's Faith?

                             MAX
              I sent her to the party.  I figured
              I'd wait up here until you killed
              Tran.

                             LENNY
              What makes you think I'm gonna kill
              Tran?

    Max looks out the window at the fireworks.  Waits for a
    flash, knowing that the bang will follow.  Keeping his own
    .45 on Lenny, he aims Lenny's Glock at the catatonic Tran.
    BLAM!  One right into Tran's forehead.  The crack of
    thunder from the fireworks masks the sound.

                             MAX
              You just did.

                             LENNY
              Jesus!

                             MAX
              You know, statistically that's the
              second most common word people say
              right before they die.  Shit being
              number one.

    Max sticks Lenny's Glock in his waistband, keeping his own
    .45 trained on Lenny.  Lenny knows the next bullet is for
    him.  He does what he does best... talk.

                             LENNY
              So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran
              in, being on his payroll, and shot
              me.

                             MAX
              That's pretty much the way it
              happened.

    CUT TO FAITH in the living room, moving silently up to the
    edge of the door frame.  She looks through the crack
    between the door and the jam.  Her POV: Max with the gun
    on Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering.
              I killed Iris too, didn't I?

                             MAX
              That's right.  They'll find the
              original of her snuff clip in your
              apartment.  The one I left for you
              at the club was a copy.

                             LENNY
              Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do
              Tick too?

                             MAX
              You bet.  Did you like it?

    Lenny drops the cutesy role.

                             LENNY
              So why Max... why d'ya have to do
              Iris?  She never hurt anybody.

    CU FAITH, reacting to this.

                             MAX
              Picture it... I feel like I gotta
              share this with somebody.  It's too
              perfect.

                             LENNY
              I won't say anything.

                             MAX
              I know.  So, I'm working for this
              puke, right?  And he says he'll pay
              me quite large to do the hooker.
              But also I gotta do his bitch
              girlfriend cause she knows the whole
              score and she's totally out of
              control.

    Lenny nods.  Starting to see it.

                             MAX
              Only he doesn't know about me and
              Faith.  So I say to myself, if I
              turn the job down, he just gets
              somebody else.  And I lose Faith...
              to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I
              do the skank.  I still gotta do
              something about Tran... I figure
              it's him or me... but I can't cap
              him without a chump to take the
              fall.  And who better than his
              girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a
              known criminal... who has been seen
              hassling them in public numerous
              times.

                             LENNY
              And who was, regrettably, also your
              best fucking friend.

                             MAX
              No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey,
              cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten
              minutes anyway.

                             LENNY
              You must be so pleased, I followed
              your jellybean trail right here,
              like a good little chump.

                             MAX
              You got froggy on me a couple times.

    CUT TO: The Underground Garage, where Tick has been
    cooked-off.  We see Max running his number on Mace and
    Lenny.  Lenny buying it.

                             MAX (V.O.)
              I thought that riff about the Death
              Squad was pretty good.  I hadda keep
              you from bringing the cops into it.

    AND BACK again to REAL TIME.

                             LENNY
              So there never was a death squad.

                             MAX
              Naawww.

                             LENNY
              Just those two loose-cannon cops
              running around covering their butts.

                             MAX
              Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this
              shit caused by a random traffic
              stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing.
              You know that.  Look around... the
              whole planet's in total chaos.  You
              gotta take what you can, while you
              can.  Cause some shitbird can come
              up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back
              a your head any second.

    CUT TO: A brief, violent flash from the Jeriko tape: Spreg
    shoots Jeriko.

                             LENNY
              How did you hook up with Faith?

                             MAX
              This dink hires me a month ago to
              eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows
              me from you, right, so she comes up
              to me and says, 'Hey Max why you
              following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you
              a drink and explain.' And she says...

                             FAITH
              'So, do you enjoy watching me?'

    Max turns and sees her in the doorway.

                             MAX
              You were supposed to go downstairs,
              baby.

                             FAITH
              I know.  I don't always do exactly
              what I'm told.
                      (she walks slowly
                       toward them)
              So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching
              me?'  And you said -- come on Max.

                             MAX
              I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for
              free.'

                             FAITH
              Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good,
              because I like the feeling of
              someone watching me.  I acquired
              the taste from Lenny.'

    Lenny looks between Faith and Max, feeling like the
    asshole of the western world.  Faith moves up close to
    Max.  She puts her hands lightly on his shoulders,
    caressing them.  Max grins, realizing she is 100% with
    him.

                             MAX
                      (to Lenny)
              And then she said, 'Since we're
              going to be spending so much time
              together--'

                             FAITH
              'We might as well make the best of
              it.'

                             LENNY
                      (crushed)
              Jesus, Faith.

    Faith runs her hands appreciatively over Max's shoulders
    and arms.  Then, in an eyeblink, she grabs his forearm in
    both hands and deflects the gun.

                             FAITH
              Lenny!!

    Lenny jumps in, wrestling Max for the gun.  Faith pulls
    the Glock out of Max's waistband and throws it across the
    room.

                             MAX
              Fucking bitch!!

    BLAM!  BLAM!  Max fires wildly, trying to hit Lenny, who
    is just barely keeping the muzzle out of his face.  Faith
    grabs Max's hair, trying to pull him away...

    His "hair" comes off in her hands.  A prosthetic wig,
    containing the squid-net array.  Max's head is shaved to a
    Sinead O'Connor stubble.  He looks demonic, grimacing with
    effort as he struggles with Lenny.

    He continues firing.  The shots hit the mirrors.  ANGLES
    of the reflected images of them shattering.  Faith,
    screaming, reflected, her face fragmenting into shards.
    The crystal chandelier shatters, reigning glassy snow on
    them from above.

    Max is stronger and heavier than Lenny, but Lenny has one
    advantage: Max has managed to make him really angry.
    Lenny gives a guttural cry and drives Max backward into
    the doorframe.  They tumble together into the living room,
    falling together over the couch.  Lenny pounds Max's hand
    against the glass coffee table, shattering it.  He forces
    Max's hand along a glass edge, cutting it, and Max drops
    the gun.  Lenny reaches for it, but Max kicks it away a
    split-second before his hand touches it.  It skitters
    under the couch, out of play.

    Max punches Lenny brutally in the face, then in the gut,
    and grabs him with both hands.  He hurls him against the
    wall.  Lenny staggers off the wall into several vicious
    punches from Max.  We feel the tide turning.  Lenny goes
    down to one knee.

    Max pulls out his knife and flicks it open.  Lenny throws
    a lamp.  Max ducks and charges through.  Lenny spins away
    from the downthrust.

    The knife embeds itself in his shoulder blade, sunk into
    the bone.  Lenny punches Max in the throat and jerks away,
    pulling the knife handle out of Max's hand.  Max tackles
    him and they crash together through a sliding glass door
    onto the balcony.  Explosion of flying glass.

    Max pulls a dazed Lenny to his feet and rushes him
    backward toward the railing.  At the last instant, Lenny
    twists with all his strength and spins Max into the
    railing, using his weight against him.  He pushes hard and
    Max topples.

    As he is going over, Max grabs Lenny's tie, pulling him
    over.  Max is dangling 12 stories above the oblivious
    crowd, his entire weight hanging from Lenny's tie.  Lenny
    has one arm and one foot hooked around the railing, and he
    is being strangled by the tie.

    Lenny is starting to black out.  In agony he gropes with
    his free hand to his own shoulder blade, finding the
    handle of the knife.  He jerks it out of himself.  Max
    sees it coming a split second before it happens.

    Lenny slashes the knife across the tie, just above Max's
    hands.

    Max takes the express elevator to Hell.  He hits 12
    stories down, on top of a video truck.

    Lenny stands there panting, bleeding down the back of his
    jacket.  Faith runs to the railing and looks down.  All
    the strength goes out of her legs.  She sags to the floor.
    Fireworks continue to boom across the sky.

    Lenny looks down at her, gazing at the object of his
    quest.  She looks up at him, her wet eyes seemingly at the
    bottom of a deep well from which he cannot save her.

    He turns and walks away.  It's hard.  But he keeps
    walking.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

    DOWN BELOW, in the madness of the crowd, we move with
    Spreg as he searches for Mace.  He sees her from behind,
    walking near one of the stages.  He moves up behind her,
    aiming his pistol at the back of her head.  She turns
    and...

    ... it isn't Mace.  Another girl in a similar dress.
    Spreg curses and looks around.

    Engelman catches a glimpse of Mace running.  He points to
    her position and Spreg charges after her.  He has his
    baton laid back along his forearm and is clubbing people
    out of the way as he runs.

    Mace sprints barefoot through the crowd, pushing people
    out of her way.  Strobe-lights from the stage and flashes
    from the fireworks give the crowd a nightmarish look.

    Spreg fires at her.  People drop, their screams drowned
    out by the pandemonium.  The gunshots don't register above
    the concussions from the fireworks.  No one notices the
    shootings.  Spreg continues to fire, missing her as people
    block his shots.  Mace won't fire back in the crowd.

    ON SPREG, coming to a stop at the base of a lighting
    tower.  He has lost sight of her.  He starts to reload his
    pistol.  Mace comes up to him silently from behind the
    tower and hammer punches him behind the ear with the butt
    of her pistol.

    Spreg comes around with a roar, slamming the baton across
    her forearm.  Her .380 clatters to the ground.  Mace
    bodyslams him back against the steel tower, smashing her
    palm up under his chin.  His head raps off the metal.
    Mace is like a she-panther.  She rips the baton out of his
    hands and cracks him once across the windpipe.  He drops
    to his knees, gagging and unable to breathe.

    A shot hits the metal space-frame next to her head.  She
    spins to see Engelman, charging toward her.  Before he can
    fire again she drops behind the kneeling, gasping Spreg,
    using him as a human wall.  She clamps an arm around his
    neck, controlling him, and pulls his tazer from his belt.

    She shoots Engelman in the chest from 8 feet.  He
    convulses and drops instantly to the pavement, flopping
    like a fish.  She holds the current on him while she goes
    over and kicks his gun away.

    She takes Engelman's cuffs from his belt.  Spreg glares at
    her through the blood running into his eyes.  She raises
    the baton.

                             MACE
              All the way down!  RIGHT NOW!!

    He slowly drops to the pavement, face down.  Now that
    she's got them both proned out, she quickly handcuffs one
    of Spreg's hands to one of Engelman's.

    The crowd of partiers stares.  Can't believe what they're
    seeing.  Mace takes Spreg's cuffs and attaches his other
    wrist to the base of the tower.  That's when THREE LAPD
    COPS in riot gear burst through the surrounding crowd and
    see a black girl crouching over two of LA's finest with a
    police baton.  The cops advance toward her.

                             MACE
              Wait.  Let me tell you what's going
              on here--

    The nearest shoots her with a tazer.  She spasms and goes
    to her hands and knees.  One of the cops kicks her down.
    She cries out, trying to explain, but she can't get the
    breath as the batons start to fall.  The crowd around them
    watches fascinated, gasping.

    Mace sees another cop arrive and start to uncuff Spreg.

                             MACE
              NO!!  NO!!!

    They crack her with their batons, telling her to stay
    down.  Another one kicks her in the stomach.

    A BLACK KID in the crowd leaps onto one of the kicking
    cops.

    And then they come out of the crowd... one, then three,
    then half a dozen.  Just normal people... black, white,
    Latino people... that can't watch this happen any more.
    They jump the cops, swarming them, wrestling them down.
    It becomes a brawl.

    Then cops are running in from everywhere.  We see the
    trigger point of a full-scale riot.  Cops in full riot-
    gear, with Lexan shields, push the crowd back, clearing a
    space.  A helicopter XENON comes straight down from above,
    like the divine light of God.

    Mace hugs herself, at the center of it, unable to get up.
    Within seconds there are twenty cops there, and more on
    the way, forming a human wall.  They get the crowd settled
    down.

    Through the phalanx of riot cops comes Palmer Strickland
    and several ranking officers.  He surveys the scene.
    Strickland looks down at Mace and then at Spreg and
    Engelman, who are getting to their knees, though still
    handcuffed to each other and the steel tower.  The beat
    extends... Strickland unreadable, face stern as Moses.
    Then...

    He points at the two prone cops.

                             STRICKLAND
                      (to the nearest
                       officers)
              These two are under arrest for
              murder.

    Strickland looks Spreg in the eye and holds up Lenny's
    squid tape.  Spreg and Engelman react, knowing they are
    over.  The helicopter Xenon gives the whole moment an
    otherworldly quality.  Like they are in some celestial
    court of judgment.

                             STRICKLAND
              Get some medical attention for this
              woman.

    Lenny pushes through from behind Strickland.  He runs to
    Mace and kneels next to her.

                             LENNY
              Are you okay?

    A trickle of blood runs down her face.  She nods weakly
    and reaches for him.  They hug, then they both wince in
    pain.  Mace sees the cops running in to arrest Spreg and
    Engelman.  One of them unhooks Spreg from the tower.

                             MACE
              I got 'em, Lenny.

    ENGELMAN LUNGES, grabbing a gun from the holster of the
    closest cop.  He waves them back with it.  Then puts it in
    his mouth and fires.

    He topples against Spreg, spraying him with his spurting
    blood.  Spreg clutches him, lowering him to the ground,
    bathing in his blood.  You see him going insane, right at
    that moment.  His face is suddenly demonic.

    SPREG, the street-monster cop, RISES IN SLOW MOTION.  His
    glare is fixed on Lenny and Mace.  He has Engelman's gun
    in one blood-drenched hand.

    Lifting the dead weight of Engelman by the handcuff, he
    begins to drag the body, lurching toward Mace.  He keeps
    the pistol down along his side.  Spreg exists at the
    center of a circle of cops who don't know what to do.  He
    has a gun so they can't rush him.  But he's a cop, so they
    can't shoot him.  Several officers shout at him to drop
    the weapon.  You barely hear them over the pandemonium of
    the crowd, the helicopter, the fireworks.

                             LENNY
              SHOOT!

    Like a scene from a nightmare the blood-drenched Spreg,
    completely unhinged, lurches toward them.  Engelman's body
    slides over the ground, leaving a snail-track of blood a
    foot wide.

                             SPREG
              YOU FUCKING NIGGER BITCH!!

    He raises Engelman's pistol, points it at her and...

    Lenny throws himself across her, turning his back to take
    the fire, and...

    POW POW POW!  The LAPD executes Spreg in a hail of fire.
    He drops like a sack of cement.

    The smoke clears.  Lenny blinks... realizing he is alive.

    He faints.  Mace shakes him, thinking he is shot.  He
    opens his eyes.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, what?

    CUT TO SEVERAL MINUTES LATER.  Mace and Lenny are being
    escorted through the crowd by Strickland and a number of
    cops who part the rowdy mob before them.

    Lenny and Mace are both limping, bruised, cut up.  Lenny's
    arm is drenched with blood from his shoulder wound.  They
    support each other like two soldiers after a battle.

    Mace sees Faith... FAITH, escorted by a couple of cops,
    passing near them.  She is in handcuffs and her eyes are
    dull.  Mace turns back to Lenny...

                             MACE
              Are we under arrest?

                             LENNY
              Naw.  They just have to ask us a
              few questions... for about six
              hours.

    They pass DEATH, with the (plastic) BABY still in his
    arms.  Life out of Death in the endless continuum.  Lenny
    pushes the scythe out of the way so they can get past.

    They reach a row of police cars and an ambulance.  The EMT
    guys run to Lenny, helping him painfully out of his suit
    jacket.  Strickland motions Mace toward a waiting squad
    car.  Lenny sees...

    The CLOCK MIME, who smiles at him and puts his hands at
    midnight.  We hear a roar passing through the crowd.  A
    huge chanting and cheering, that becomes thunderous as
    everyone begins to shout the countdown to midnight.

                             CROWD
              TEN!  NINE!  EIGHT!...

    Lenny and Mace look around... the wonder of it sinking in.

                             CROWD
              SEVEN!  SIX!  FIVE!...

    Mace and Lenny let it wash over them... the deliverance
    from darkness.

                             CROWD
              FOUR!  THREE!  TWO!  ONE!  HAPPY NEW
              YEAR!

    The exultation of the moment flows through them as the
    people lift their voices in a great cheer.  Balloons are
    released, confetti and streamers fly in a blizzard.
    Couples grab each other and kiss passionately.

                             MACE
                      (grinning)
              Hey, Lenny.  We made it.

                             LENNY
              Yeah.  We did.

    She hugs him.  Then pulls back.  Friends... yes.  And
    always.  But there's that line that she can't cross.  Only
    he can do that.

                             MACE
              Well...
                      (she shrugs)
              Get going.  You're still bleeding.

                             LENNY
              See you downtown.

                             MACE
              Yeah.  See you there.

    TRACKING WITH LENNY as he walks toward the ambulance.
    They open the back door for him.  The walk is
    hallucinatory... with confetti falling like snow, and the
    hysteria of the crowd.  He looks back at Mace as the
    paramedics help him up into the ambulance.  The back doors
    close.

    ON MACE, watching him go.  A cop gently takes her arm,
    opening the squad car door for her.  She turns away, her
    face sad amid the exultation of the crowd.  She gets into
    the back seat.  The door slams.  Strickland gets in next
    to her.  The driver starts the car.  They start to move,
    and...

    There is pounding on the glass, startling her, and...
    The door is wrenched open...
    A hand comes in, grabbing her arm, pulling her out...

    Lenny.  His eyes are full of emotion.
    He grabs her in his arms, fiercely, and kisses her... like
    there's no tomorrow.  She grabs his head and won't let him
    break, even if he wanted to, which he doesn't.

    Strickland, in the car, rolls his eyes and looks at his
    watch.  Reflex.  Because if there's one time you don't
    need a watch, it's...

    12:01  A.M.  JANUARY 1, 2000

    PULL BACK AND UP as Lenny and Mace stay locked together,
    while the cops wait for them, and the world begins again.

                             THE END

                                                   December 16, 2010


                         
          OVER BLACK WE HEAR THE DULL SOUNDS OF INDUSTRY; A MUFFLED
          MASS OF MACHINES, GEARS, STEAM. FADE IN ON:
                         
          A SIGN. Twelve feet across. Painted decades earlier, grim-
          covered black, white and red. It reads in large 40's era,
          hand-painted type, "SAFETY IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN!" Then:
          "DAYS SINCE LAST ACCIDENT" and below that, NUMBERS, painted
          on hanging metal cards. Four possible digits can hang here,
          but there are currently three: "784."
                         
          SLOWLY PUSH IN on this sign as a MAN APPEARS, rising on a
          forklift, in a greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit. Removes
          the "4" from its hooks. Then removes the "8." Then the "7."
                         
          Finally, he hangs up a number. "1."
                         
          The man LOWERS out of frame as we creep even closer to the
          hanging single digit, wondering about the accident... and how
          bad it was and the FACTORY SOUNDS GROW DEAFENING -- AND AS IT
          BUILDS TO A CRESCENDO, WE CUT TO SILENT BLACKNESS.
                         
                         
          EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - PORCH - DAY
                         
          Shiny black loafers. Black pants, three inches too long. We
          BOOM UP, stopping at a boy's hand reaching into the black
          suit jacket pocket. Pulls out a WOMAN'S GOLD NECKLACE with a
          LOCKET. He holds the locket. Rubs it gently with his thumb.
          CONTINUE TO BOOM UP. We now SEE THE BOY'S FACE.
                         
          This is JOE LAMB, 14. On the precarious edge of adulthood. He
          looks out at the horizon with stricken eyes.
                         
          He moves forward and we PAN, so we're BEHIND HIM NOW. In the
          frosty distance, past countless leafless trees and modest
          homes, is a STEEL MILL. Smokestacks and structures. The
          lifeblood of this late 70's town.
                         
                         
          INT. LAMB LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Close on CHARLES' MOTHER AND FATHER, funeral attire. She
          looks out of the window sadly; heartsick and concerned.
          Behind her, he picks at his plate of food.
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           I'm so worried for that boy.
                         
                          CHARLES' FATHER
           Joe's gonna be okay.
           2.
                         
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           ...she was everything to him.
                         
                          CHARLES' FATHER
           Jack's gonna step up. He's a good
           man.
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           But he was never really a
           father...I don't think he
           ever...understood Joe.
                         
                          CHARLES' FATHER
           (maybe a little concerned
                          HIMSELF)
           Joe's gonna be okay.
                         
          But his wife isn't so sure.
                         
          Then, BOYS' HUSHED VOICES:

          CHARLES (we'll see him in a moment) LEANS FORWARD, reaching
          for food on a buffet table. Charles' leaning has revealed
          CARY, a blonde kid in a dark blue sport jacket and tie, and
          PRESTON, pale and smart, in a DARK SWEATER:

           No, I'm eating macaroni salad.
                         
          We now see CHARLES, big and in an ill-fitting BLACK SUIT, and
          MARTIN, good looking, in a shirt and tie, at the buffet:
                         
                          CHARLES
           I was thinking that, about the

                          MARTIN
           I don't know how you guys can eat.

           delicious.
                         
          CUT WIDE TO REVEAL that we are in a modest Ohio house in the
          year 1979. At a wake. Forty-odd friends and neighbors, darkly
          dressed. Quiet discussions. Some crying.

          jumped on a guest, for food. JACKSON LAMB, Joe's father, 42,

          EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          A WIDE SHOT. A grey, snow-covered, early February day here in
          LILLIAN, OHIO. Many cars are parked outside the house,
          notably a SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SQUAD CAR in the driveway.
          Joe, a vision of black on white in his too-big black suit,
          now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years.
                         
          He solemnly looks down at the LOCKET he still holds. No doubt
          trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around
          his mother's neck. Then a SOUND. Joe looks up. A CAR has
          arrived -- a distinct 1968 BUICK GSX -- a YELLOW MUSCLE CAR
          with a BLACK RACING STRIPE down its center. Joe watches as
          the car sits there for a moment. Then a MAN gets out. Someone
          Joe has seen before, but doesn't know personally. A man in
          his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt. He's not exactly
          sloppy, but if you look closely, you could tell he's been
          drinking. This is LOUIS DAINARD.
                         
          Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the
          porch and inside the house. Joe's eyes glued on the house for
          a while. Then he looks back to the locket. He OPENS IT, and
          stares at the picture inside (which we do not see). And as he
          stares, TEARS come to his eyes.
                         
          A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Joe turns
          toward the house. After a beat, the SOUND of something
          BREAKING -- something glass. Then the house BACK DOOR bursts
          open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never
          forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED
          Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad
          car. When he slams the back door, he sees Joe. Sort of
          freezes as their eyes lock. But Jack's more uncomfortable
                         THAN COMFORTING:
                         
                          JACK
           I'll be home soon.
                         
          And Jack gets into the car and drives away. Joe watches them
          drive off. And after a beat, he looks down at the locket
          again. Mom's just gone. Finally he CLOSES IT -- and we hear
          an oddly LOUD SNAP and our SCREEN GOES BLACK.
                         
          Over darkness: APPLAUSE -- then a LONE VOICE: "I want you...
          to want me!" DRUMS kick in, CHEAP TRICK BLASTS. CUT TO:
           5.
                         
                         
          EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          Hundreds of KIDS eagerly leave their last day of school for
          the year, winter a memory. GIRLS emphatically embrace each
          other good-bye. BOYS run off, just happy to be out. Lots of
          "Have a great summer!"
                         
          DOLLY WITH Joe, who walks through the crowd alone, backpack
          on shoulder.
                         
          Suddenly Charles is there, red-faced -- he hands Joe PAGES:
                         
                          CHARLES
           That was the longest day ever--

          They head across the street to the 7-Eleven. Suddenly Cary is
          there, a BURN WRAP on his right arm now:

           I was returning that book on codes

           "Screw it." So I asked her if she'd
           play Hathaway's wife.

          INT. BUILDING 47 - DAY (SUPER 8)
                         
          DARKNESS. Then a DOOR OPENS. It's DETECTIVE HATHAWAY (played
          by MARTIN), in silhouette. He enters. It's an old WAREHOUSE,
          dirty, cobwebbed, crowded with CRATES, old MACHINERY,
          CHEMICAL BARRELS and JUNK. The Detective turns on his
          FLASHLIGHT -- aims it -- sweeps it across the space -- the
          light HITTING THE LENS for a moment.
                         
          The Detective walks through the spooky, dark space. A low,
          growling industrial DRONE makes the whole place oddly creepy.
          Then: A SOUND -- quick but strange -- slithering -- and the
          Detective aims his flashlight -- tense. He watches. Waits. We
          see where he's aiming the light, which cuts through THICK
          DUST in the air. It's an old office door, ajar.
                         
          Hathaway is still. Nervous. Watching the door -- waiting for
          it to open... and then -- from the darkness BEHIND HIM -- a
          terrifying open-mouthed ZOMBIE APPEARS -- ATTACKS -- and the
          Detective TURNS -- his flashlight KNOCKED TO THE GROUND --
          and Hathaway falls too -- the wild-eyed gaping-mouthed Zombie
          DROOLING as it tries to bite Hathaway's flesh -- we recognize
          that the Zombie is CARY. Actually, not a bad performance. The
          Detective pulls out his GUN -- but the Zombie grabs his wrist
          -- they wrestle with the gun -- the Zombie wanting to rip
          into Hathaway's neck -- but Hathaway sees three SHARP-TIPPED
          NAILS sticking out of an old piece of WOODEN CRATE -- and
          after a significant struggle, Hathaway PUSHES THE ZOMBIE BACK
          so his head is IMPALED BY THE NAILS -- which we see ENTER HIS
          SKULL!!! The Zombie (stuck to the crate via the nails)
          SCREAMS AND DIES and just at Hathaway catches his breath THE
          IMAGE DIMS AND FREEZES; the projector has just been STOPPED.
          We are in:

          No sports memorabilia. Charles turns on the lights, looks
          anxiously at Joe:
                         
                          JACK
           That was a good zombie murder.

          Jesus, that's what I've been
          explaining: in the scene
          we're filming tonight, the
          wife telling the detecting
          she's scared for him, that
          she loves him-- Charles!
          -- I'M COMING!!!
          -- so when he investigates
          the zombie stuff you'll be
          scares -- you'll feel
          something -- because you
          don't want him to die because
          they love each other! Does
          that make sense?
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           I just can't believe you talked to
           Alice Dainard.
                         
                          CHARLES
           You're impossible.
                         
           CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.)
           CHARLES!
                         
                          CHARLES
           GOD, MOM! I'M COMING!
           (opens the door, whispers)
           Midnight. Okay? Don't forget.
           10.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           I won't forget.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Read this.
                         
          Joe just nods and looks at the magazine.
                         
                         
          INT. CHARLES' KITCHEN - DUSK
                         
          A hectic FAMILY: Charles' mother cooks. JEN, his smoking hot
          17-year-old sister, ANGRILY sets the table where his father
          pays bills. Pale 15-year-old sister PEG does a PUZZLE. Twin 9-
          YEAR-OLD BOYS bicker over an action figure. TV in the living
          room plays a MATCH GAME. Joe and Charles enter.
                         
                          JEN
           Mom, it's not fair that I can't go
           to Wendy's. Every single person is
           going except me!
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           Then every single person can tell
           you how it was --
                         
                          CHARLES' FATHER
           Move the puzzle, get the napkins.
                         
                          JEN
                          MOM---
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           It's your turn to babysit.
                         
                          JEN
           So...
                         
                          PEG
           Get off that thing.
                         
                          JEN
           Mom, why can't I switch with
           Charles?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Because you crushed Charles' top
           hat, you ever think of that?
                         
          Disgusted, Jen LOUDLY sets Charles' place as --
                         
                          JEN
           Oh, really, guess what? We're
           switching.
           11.
                         
                         
          Charles grabs a roll.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Guess what, no we're not.
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           Charles take these to the table!
           Benji, it's time for dinner. Hey,
                          JOE--
                         
                          JOE
           Goodnight, Mrs. Kaznyk--
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           Grab a seat, we have lots of food.
                         
                          JOE
           Oh no thanks, Ma'am, I'm okay.
           (to Charles, loaded)
           "See you tomorrow."
                         
                          CHARLES
           Later days.
                         
                          CHARLES' FATHER
           There's always a place for you
           here, you know that--
                         
                          JOE
           Oh, yessir. Thank you.
                         
          Joe leaves; Charles' parents share a look of pity for Joe.
                         
                         
          EXT. CHARLES' HOUSE - DUSK
                         
          An anomalous moment in this small steel town: the sun sets
          through the distant trees and it's beautiful, despite the
          distant belching SMOKESTACKS. Joe leaves Charles' house and
          CROSSES THE STREET to his own. SQUAD CAR in the driveway.
                         
                         
          INT. JOE'S HOUSE - DUSK
                         
          Joe comes into the kitchen through the BACK DOOR. Lucy the
          dog greets him. A TV is head somewhere. NIGHTLY NEWS reports
          on the ONGOING CLEAN-UP OF THREE MILE ISLAND. A half-empty
          BEER BOTTLE on the table. Joe peeks into the living room --
          but no one's there.
                         
          Joe looks around for his father. Heads down the hallway.
          Stops when he sees something off camera. We HOLD on Joe's
          face, sort of quietly stunned.
           12.
                         
                         
          And we se his POV: Jack, Joe's father, in uniform pants and T-
          shirt, sits on the edge of the bathtub, head in his hands,
          quietly CRYING.
                         
          Joe is stunned, staring at his dad. But he can't look away.
          And when he finally starts to head off, Jack looks up. Joe's
          mind scrambles for something to say, but Jack sniffles, gets
          it together, quick. Puts on a strong face.
                         
                          JACK
           Hey -- I'll be out in a minute--
                         
          Joe nods as Jack forces a smile and closes the bathroom door.
          HOLD ON JOE. Stunned and heartsick.
                         
                         
          INT. CAROL'S DINER - NIGHT
                         
          Commodores quietly sing "EASY" on the PA. Joe and his father,
          in civvies, sit beside each other at the counter. Jack eats a
          beef stew and reviews office paperwork, not looking at his
          son. Joe eats a grilled cheese, deeply lonely and not even
          knowing it.
                         
          Jack pulls out a PAMPHLET, and places it on the table:
                         
                          JACK
           It's a six-week program, hands-on
           training with college coaches.
                          (BEAT)
           You'll like it. I know I did.
                         
          Joe looks at the pamphlet for HEWITT SPORTS CAMP. Images of
          happy, smiling, healthy ATHLETIC KIDS. Not his thing.
                         
                          JOE
           I thought I was going to have the
           summer for myself--
                         
                          JACK
           Things have obviously changed for
           us. And it'd be good for you to
           spend some time with kids who don't
           run around with-- cameras and
                          MONSTER MAKE-UP--
                         
                          JOE
           I gotta help Charles finish his
           movie.
                         
                          JACK
           I have nothing against your
           friends. I like your friends.
                          (MORE)
           13.
                          JACK (CONT'D)
           Except Cary, who can't stop
           lighting things on fire. You'll
           like it there.
                          (FINALLY)
           It's what we both need.
                         
          Joe looks back at the pamphlet -- his other hand coming up
          from under the table -- and Jack sees that Joe is HOLDING HIS
          MOTHER'S LOCKET. Jack wants to cry again. He wants to throw
          that locket away, out of sight. But he just turns away.
                         
          Joe stares at the pamphlet. PUSH IN on the photo of beaming
          15-year-old KIDS. Then CUT TO THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME:
                         
                         
          INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          TIGHT ON QUASIMODO; a plastic, painted AURORA model. RACK
          FOCUS to the paintbrush that comes into frame -- FOLLOW IT TO
          JOE, holding the brush, at his desk, making a model. A boy's
          room recently devoid of a mother's oversight; a mess. COMIC
          BOOKS and other PLASTIC MODELS, all built and painted by Joe.
          CARS and CREATURES and a TRAIN. His bedside CLOCK RADIO
          (11:56 PM) quietly plays "BAKER STREET." Then a RADIO SQUAWK -
          - Joe grabs a KID'S WALKIE-TALKIE:
                         
           CHARLES (V.O.)
           Okay, it's time -- don't get
           caught, over.
                         
                          JOE
           I won't. Over.
                         
          Joe turns off the walkie -- and he grabs a small plastic
          FISHERMAN'S TACKLE BOX as we HEAR:
                         
           CHARLES (V.O.)
           Wanna hear something gross?
                         
           CARY (V.O.)
           I do.
                         
           MARTIN (V.O.)
           No please, if you're really asking.
                         
                         
          EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Midnight. Sitting on the curb with their GEAR and talking
          quietly, are Joe, Charles, Martin, Preston and Cary. Martin
          dressed in his detecting SUIT. Joe eats from a bag of
          Twizzlers.
           14.
                         
                         
                          CHARLES
           I sneezed so hard yesterday I shit
           my pants.
                          (THEY MOAN)
           I debated telling you.
                         
                          JOE
           Thanks.
                         
                          PRESTON
           That's called a "sharteeze" by the
           way.
                         
                          CHARLES CARY
          Well then I totally
          sharteezed in my pants. That's exactly what I'm
           talking about: the world is
           crazy, there's a name for
           everything...
                         
                          CHARLES
           Twizzler me.
                         
          Joe passes him a Twizzler.
                         
                          MARTIN
           So... people are turning into
           zombies because of the chemical
           factory, right?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Martin? I don't see how the guy
           playing Detective Hathaway can ask
           where the zombies are coming from.
                         
                          CARY
           Another classic from Smartin.
                         
                          MARTIN
           I told you, I don't like it when
           you call me that.
                         
                          CARY
           I'm sorry, Smartin.
                         
                          MARTIN
           Shut up.
                         
                          JOE
                          GUYS--
           15.
                         
                         
          All the boys look. Their faces BRIGHTEN. Headlights. The boys
          stand as the car STOPS beside them -- IT'S THE YELLOW BUICK
          WITH THE BLACK RACING STRIPE THAT PULLED UP TO JOE'S HOUSE
          DURING THE WAKE. But now, sitting in the driver's seat is 14-
          year-old ALICE DAINARD. She sees Joe.
                         
                          ALICE
           Joe Lamb?!
                         
                          JOE
           -- yeah?
                         
                          ALICE
           What the hell's he doing here?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Make-up, sound and special effects.
                         
                          ALICE
           He's the deputy's kid!
                         
                          CHARLES JOE
          -- what? (touch flattered)
           -- you knew that?
                         
                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           Charles, I don't have a license. I
           can't drive with him!
                         
                          CHARLES
           You want Joe to-- stay back? I--?
                         
                          ALICE
           It's too late! He's seeing me in
           this car right now.
                         
                          JOE
           You can trust me. My dad'll never
           know. I won't tell him anything.
                         
          Looking away, she's pissed. All the boys in silent wait. She
          considers, annoyed. Shakes her head. Finally:
                         
                          ALICE
           Get in.
                         
          The boys EXCITEDLY SCRAMBLE into the car.
                         
                         
          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT
                         
          The Buick crosses the nighttime horizon, leaving the small
          town, driving through a rural landscape.

           PRESTON (V.O.)
                          (TERRIFIED)
           You're driving very well. I'm
           impressed.
                         
                         
          INT. BUICK - NIGHT
                         
          Alice drives. The boys shoved in the back with the gear -- in
          front Charles struggles with his backpack and camera bags as
          he pulls out PAGES, arranging them. With her driving, there's
          an unusual, electric energy in the air. Joe eats his
          Twizzlers in the back, trying not to stare at Alice.
                         
                          CHARLES
           So I wrote a couple new lines, can
           I show you?
                         
                          ALICE
           What?
                         
                          MARTIN
           New lines? Charles-- what, I have
           new lines?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Shut up. There aren't a lot--
                         
                          ALICE
           I'm sorta trying to drive--
                         
                          CHARLES
           What would be great is: could you
           cry during the scene? Can you do
           that?
                         
                          ALICE
           ... no...?!
                         
          Cary messes with the radio. Alice moves his hand away.
                         
                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           Stop.
                         
                          CARY
           You know the first place I'm gonna
           drive when I get my license?
                         
                          JOE
           (offering to Alice)
           Want one?
                         
          Alice looks at him in the rear view. Their eyes hold a beat.

          She takes the Twizzler he offers and looks back to the road.
                         
                          MARTIN
           So I don't have any new lines,
           right? Because I just learned
           these.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Shut up.
                         
                          PRESTON
           I have never been a passenger in a
           vehicle without an adult driving.
           I'm unresolved as to how I feel
           about it.
                         
                         
          EXT. RURAL OHIO - NIGHT
                         
          The Buick WOOSHES PAST a solitary KELVIN GAS STATION. The car
          dips into the darkness, beneath a blanket of stars.
                         
                         
          EXT. TRAIN DEPOT - NIGHT
                         
          The Buick pulls up to this small, EMPTY TRAIN STATION in the
          middle of, essentially, nowhere. A series of HANGING LIGHTS
          illuminates the TRAIN PLATFORM. There's a small office,
          currently closed. No one around.
                         
          The kids get out of the car.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Guys, there's an electrical socket
           up here.
                         
                          MARTIN
           Hey, Charles, Charles, do I have
           more lines?
                         
                          CHARLES
           No. But you can pick up some stuff.
                         
          The boys carry many bags and the tripod.
                         
          PLATFORM - Charles looks at the scene through the "lens" he
          creates with both hands.

                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           Guys, this is going to be great.
           Get the lights and camera on that
           end, we'll shoot this direction
           first, like we talked about! Joe,
           get the mike plugged in-- make sure
           the new batteries are in the camera
           before you do the make-up!
                         
                          JOE
           Okay.
                         
          Joe walks past Alive, who watches him. It strikes her that
          Joe is Charles' lackey.

          Martin sits alone with his copy of the pages, quietly reading
          and memorizing his lines.
                         
                          MARTIN
           "-- Sweetheart, this is my job, I

           you..."
                         
          Cary grabs his paper and throws it to the wind, sending
          Martin running after it.
                         
                          MARTIN (CONT'D)
           No, no, no. Cary.

          Preston sets up the lights as Cary arrives to show him his
          backpack full of FIRECRACKERS:
                         
                          CARY
           I took apart two packs of cherry
           bombs and made my own M-80.
                         
                          PRESTON
           Your obsession with fireworks --
           and I'm saying this as a friend --
           concerns me. And my mother.
                         
                          CARY
           Well you're a pussy. And your mom
           has one.
                         
          Cary takes off. Martin returns with his paper.

          Charles writes in his notebook. He starts to get up...
                         
                          CHARLES
           Martin, I have a new line for you.
                         
          He gets up to reveal Joe putting make-up on Alice. He walks
          over to Martin, Cary and Preston. Charles and Martin AD LIB.
                         
          TIGHT ON JOE'S TACKLE BOX, which opens. Inside is an
          assortment of MAKE-UPS, sponges, cotton balls, brushes, derma
          wax, spirit gum, and a large jar of FAKE BLOOD. Joe is
          preparing to make up Alice, who sits in front of him,
          watching carefully as Joe prepares BASE MAKE-UP on a sponge.
          He looks to her. A beat.
                         
                          JOE
           You mind?
                         
          Alice shakes her head: nope. Joe starts stippling the make-up
          onto her face. He is now, via sponge, touching the face of a
          girl he's admired for some time. After a beat:
                         
                          ALICE
           My dad works at the mill.
                         
          And she looks at him. Almost as if she were looking for
          something. Joe stops stippling. The tension is almost too
          much for him to bear.
                         
                          JOE
           Close you eyes. Please.
                         
          He indicates the sponge: it's for the make-up. She does. Joe
          starts applying the make-up to her eyelids. There's something
          provocative for Joe, being so close to Alice, with her eyes
          closed. Then, PRE-LAP:
                         
           CHARLES (O.S.)
           So this is very emotional.

          The lights (plugged into the car cigarette lighter) and
          camera (a EUMIG) are set. Alice has been made up, wears a
          coat with purse. Martin, in his tie, faces her. They both
          look over their script pages as Charles adjusts the camera.

          Joe, observing, holds the boom mike (a condenser mike taped
          to a broom handle), Preston wears an overcoat.

                          ALICE
           I know, we read it, we get it.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Okay, I'm just directing. Martin
           get on your mark. Martin, you're
           going to have to reassure her. Do
           you know what "reassure her" means?
                         
                          MARTIN
           Yeah, I think so.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Okay-- we're starting on Alice's
           side first-- Preston: a couple
           seconds after "action" walk to the
           pay phone, make it look like this
           place is busy--
                         
                          PRESTON
           I know what that looks like.
                         
          POP! Everyone JUMPS -- Charles turns -- Cary, laughing, has
          just exploded a firecracker:
                         
                          CHARLES
           Asshole, could you stop blowing
           shit up for two seconds and deal
           with the camera?
                         
                          CARY
           Sorry man.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Let's rehearse this -- save your
           real performances for when we're
           filming, though.
                         
          Martin and Alice put away their pages -- Cary gets behind the
          camera. Charles stands near the camera, kneeling to camera-
          height. Joe wears headphones and holds the boom over the
          actors' heads. Preston holds a suitcase, ready to walk.
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           Ready? Here we go... action!
           21.
                         
                         
          Martin and Alice now perform as their characters, DETECTIVE
          JOHN HATHAWAY and MRS. REBECCA HATHAWAY:
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           I'm going to stay here and
           investigate. I think it would be
           safer if you leave town.
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           John. I don't like it. This case.
           These murders.
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           What am I supposed to do, go to
           Michigan with you?
                         
          Preston walks past them, acting in the background.
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           Mackinac Island's beautiful this
           time of year.
                         
          We're TIGHT ON JOE NOW, watching Alice. Slowly amazed at the
          unexpected depth and truth she brings to this role --
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           Sweetheart. This is my job.
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           The dead, coming back to life...? I
           think you're in danger--
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           I have no choice--
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           You do have a choice. We all do...
                         
          And holy shit, Alice actually starts to cry as she performs
          her lines. Not overdone, not hammy. Just fucking real.
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)
           John, I've never asked you to stop.
           I've never asked you to give up or
           walk away.
                         
          Charles watches -- in awe -- he's suddenly, giddily
          transported. But it's JOE who, as he stares, becomes
          galvanized; any vague interest in Alice has just set:
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)
           But I'm asking you now-- please.
           For me. Don't go back. Don't leave
           me.
                          (MORE)
           22.
           MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)
           I need to know this isn't the last
           time I'll see you.
                          (BEAT)
           I just love you so much.
                         
          Martin is thrown by the passion and heart of her performance.
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           ... I... I love you too...
                         
          And in the heat of it, Alice looks at Charles, unsure:
                         
                          ALICE
           Was that okay? Or... not really?
                         
          Charles is stunned -- almost crying -- can't talk -- and as
          he searches, behind him, a LIGHT --
                         
                          CHARLES
           -- uh, that was... I'm... that--
           yeah, good. Just like that.
                         
          Then a distant AIRHORN -- Charles looks: AN ONCOMING TRAIN.
          PUSH IN ON CHARLES, TIGHT. He turns to them all:
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           PRODUCTION VALUE!!! Is there film
           in the camera?!
                         
                          CARY
           -- I didn't put it in--
                         
                          CHARLES
           PUT IT IN!!! PUT IT IN!!! Joe, get
           the mike ready. Go, go, Preston,
           get in position. Costume, costume.
           Martin, get that tripod set up.
           Joe, help her with her costume.
           Hurry, hurry! Go! I hope we don't
           miss the train. Preston, get in
           position! Martin, you know you
           lines, right?! IS THE FILM IN THE
           CAMERA YET?!
                         
          As Charles runs to Alice, takes her script pages.
                         
                          ALICE
           I love how calm he is.
                         
                          JOE
           Yeah, he's a very relaxed guy.
           23.
                         
                         
          Joe laughs a little as he goes -- Cary RIPS OPEN a YELLOW
          SUPER 8 box -- Joe grabs the mike -- Cary INSERTS the film:
          CLICK! Joe plugs in the mike, Charles grabs the camera:
                         
                          CHARLES
           Everyone ready...?! Be extra loud
           when the train passes by! Oh God, I
           hope it stops! You ready?!
                         
          They're set to film toward Alice, the approaching train in
          her background -- Charles puts on the headphones --
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           And... ACTION!
                         
          And they're shooting:
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           I'm going to stay here and
           investigate. I think it would be
           safer if you left town for a couple
           of days.
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           John. I don't like it. This case.
           These murders.
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           What am I supposed to do, go to
           Michigan with you?
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           Mackinac Island's beautiful this
           time of year.
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           Sweetheart. This is my job.
                         
          Charles watches, beaming with excitement. Joe holds the boom,
          looks to Charles to make sure it sounds okay; this is when he
          notices something in the distance. HEADLIGHTS. A quarter mile
          away, a vehicle drives along the horizon. A beat. But the
          train is APPROACHING -- GETTING LOUDER -- which makes Joe
          turn back toward the train -- the thing almost upon them --
          LOUDER AND LOUDER, so the actors begin to YELL over the
                         GROWING DIN:
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           THE DEAD, COMING BACK TO LIFE?! I
           THINK YOU'RE IN DANGER!
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           I HAVE NO CHOICE!!!
           24.
                         
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           YOU DO HAVE A CHOICE! WE ALL DO!!!
           John, I've never asked you to stop.
           I've never asked you to give up or
           walk away.
                         
          Joe looks back at the headlights -- and sees something very
          odd: the distant vehicle TURNS ONTO THE TRACKS. PUSH IN ON
          JOE, unsettled -- as the train CROSSES THEM NOW -- Joe looks
          back toward Alice -- a BLAST OF AIR, shockingly LOUD!
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D)
           But I'm asking you now-- please.
           For me. Don't go back. Don't leave
           me. I need to know this isn't the
           last time I'll see you.
                          (BEAT)
           I just love you so much.
                         
          Alice and Martin continue to yell their lines -- Charles is
          almost LAUGHING at how good this looks -- but Joe LOOKS
          DESPERATELY BACK toward the headlights -- the train LIGHTING
          UP THE OLD PICK-UP THAT IS ABOUT TO CRASH INTO THE TRAIN!
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           I love you too!!
                         
          And Joe finally swings the mike down and YELLS:
                         
                          JOE CHARLES
          GUYS, WATCH OUT!!! Joe what the hell are y--?!
                         
          -- just then BA-BA-BA-BAM!!! THE TRAIN ENGINE, HUNDREDS OF
          YARDS AWAY, SLAMS INTO THE TRUCK -- THE KIDS GASP -- REACT --
          AS THE TRAIN ENGINE DERAILS!
                         
                          JOE
           Run!
                         
          THE TRAIN BEGINS TO CRASH -- ACCORDION -- THE KIDS SCREAM --
          RUN -- ENTIRE 50-TON CARS JACKNIFE AND CRASH UPWARD -- FLYING
          VERTICAL -- CHARLES' SUPER 8 CAMERA AND TRIPOD SLAM ONTO THE
          PLATFORM, LANDING SIDEWAYS, STILL FILMING as the CRASH WAVE
          APPROACHES AND PASSES THEM!
                         
          THE KIDS SCATTER, PRESTON AND MARTIN RUN ONE WAY. CHARLES,
          CARY AND JOE RUN ANOTHER. JOE STOPS AS ALICE RUNS AROUND THE
          BUILDING.
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           Alice!
                         
                          CHARLES
           Joe, we have to go.
           25.
                         
                         
          They run off.
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           I DON'T WANT TO DIE!!!
                         
          AS NEARBY CARS RIP OFF TRACKS, TUMBLE -- CARS FROM FATHER
          BACK JETTISON TOWARD THEM, SLAMMING INTO THE DEPOT,
          SHATTERING IT -- THE ENTIRE AREA IS DECIMATED IN AN INSTANT!
          And then --
                         
          IT'S OVER. Just the odd, dying CHUGS and SCREECH-SCREECH-
          SCREECH of TRAIN WHEELS running out of momentum, HISSES of
          STEAM, the unnatural bending of steel.
                         
          In the DUST, JOE lies frightened on the ground, eyes tightly
          shut. His mind races, his heart pounds -- and then: A LOUD
          METAL BANG! Joe stands up fast, faces a MOUNTAIN of twisted
          STEEL -- UPSIDE-DOWN TRAIN CARS PILED FRIGHTENINGLY around
          him. Just another few feet and he would've been crushed. But
          what was that sound? Something metal? Then again: SLAM! Joe
          BACKS UP, afraid -- it was almost a LABORED GROAN --
          MECHANICAL or ANIMAL?! A crazy SCREECH, another BANG, then
          AGAIN and AGAIN!!!
                         
          We see Joe TIGHTLY GRIPPING HIS NECKLACE LOCKET IN HIS HAND --
          THEN: CRASH! -- AWFUL-LOUD -- and a TWISTED TEN-FOOT SQUARE
          SHEET OF METAL EXPLODES FROM BEHIND THE OVERTURNED TRAIN CARS
          -- Joe covers his head as the metal STABS THE GROUND, twenty
          feet away: a TRAIN SLIDING DOOR. Joe turns to see it --
          stunned -- then back to the direction of the NOISE -- but it
          is GONE. Nothing.
                         
          TIGHT ON CHARLES' CAMERA -- on its side, FINISHING UP A
          CARTRIDGE OF FILM.
                         
           JOE (O.S.)
           Guys?!
                         
          Joe finds MARTIN, on his knees, THROWING UP -- Martin keeps
          throwing up, but pumps a THUMBS UP.
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           Martin, are you okay?! Preston, is
           that you?
                         
                          PRESTON
           I'm okay! Though I think I'm having
           a heart attack! And I have a
           scrape!
                         
          Joe MOVES FORWARD -- up to camera -- behind him, Cary
          appears, smiling. This kid enjoyed the crash:
           26.
                         
                         
                          CARY
           Guys, did you see those explosions?
           That was awesome.
                         
                          JOE
           Has anyone seen Alice?!
                         
           CHARLES (O.S.)
           I'm alive! Is anyone dead?
                         
          Through the debris, steel and dust. Joe moves forward --
          Charles, shaken, eyes wide, appears through the thick dust --
                         
          Joe moves forward, looking at, under a train WHEEL
          ASSEMBLY... BLOOD. A PUDDLE OF BLOOD and Joe's heart sinks as
          he moves toward it -- another woman he loves, crushed?!
          Charles and Preston and Cary see the blood --
                         
           CHARLES (CONT'D) PRESTON
          -- oh God-- -- no -- nonono...
                         
          Martin, still sick, calls out:
                         
                          MARTIN CARY
          -- what? Guys, what is it? ... shit...
                         
          Joe moves closer to the blood -- heartsick -- on the verge of
          DEEP, REAL TEARS -- everything stops -- but then:
                         
           ALICE (O.S.)
           -- what's all that blood?
                         
          Joe WHIPS AROUND -- standing in the dusty mess is ALICE --
          shaken, but absolutely alive. Joe just BEAMS.
                         
                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           What's the blood? -- did someone
           get hurt--?
                         
          But JOE SUDDENLY KNOWS -- he moves to the blood -- reaches
          below the wheels -- the others watch, freaked out --
                         
           KIDS (AD LIB)
           Joe, wait -- maybe you shouldn't
           touch -- what are you-- careful!
                         
          Joe pulls out his CRUSHED MAKE-UP KIT. He brightens:
                         
                          JOE
           It's my fake blood. It's fake!
                         
                          CHARLES
           What is this stuff?
           27.
                         
                         
          ALICE NOTICES THAT HE'S HOLDING THE NECKLACE. Joe notices
          this and POCKETS IT self-consciously. PRESTON calls out:
                         
                          PRESTON
           Guys, what are these things?
                         
          Joe looks -- they all move to Preston (except Cary, who heads
          off): CRATES have spilled from a nearby split car; many
          shattered, revealing THOUSANDS OF SMALL WHITE-METAL CUBES
          which now litter the ground. Joe kneels, picks one up:
                         
                          MARTIN
           Hey, don't touch it, what are you
           doing?
                         
                          CHARLES
           They look like white Rubik's cubes
           or something. They're heavy like
           metal or something. There's like a
           billion of them.
                         
          It's just a few inches per side, an UNUSUAL DESIGN. Behind
          them, having walked up the ANGLED SIDES of overturned train
          cars, Cary calls out:
                         
                          CARY
           Guys, get up here. You can see
           everything from up here.
                         
          They move up the mass of metal, revealing a VAST VIEW OF THE
          WRECK. It seems to stretch on forever. It is SOBERING.
                         
                          CHARLES CARY
          Oh my God. ... Look at that...
                         
                          PRESTON
           According to my Uncle Seth, an
           accident like this is exceptionally
           rare.
                         
                          JOE
           It wasn't an accident.
           (turns away, eyes on the
                          FIELD)
           There was a truck. On the tracks.
                         
                          CHARLES
           What? Driving on the tracks?
                         
          Joe's seen it. He points. Chilled.
                         
                          JOE
           There.
           28.
                         
                         
          Thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is THE PICK-UP
          TRUCK. SHEARED IN HALF UPON IMPACT and lying in the overgrown
          grass.

           How can a pick-up truck derail a
           train? That's impossible.

           Obviously it isn't.
                         
          BOOM UP from behind the SHATTERED PICK-UP as the kids
          approach from the wreckage. PUSH IN ON THEM as they arrive at
          the truck and STOP; what they see makes Joe's heart pound --
          they're stunned -- all of them. They just stop. Finally:

          WE SEE NOW: it's DR. WOODWARD -- 75, seat-belted, bloody and
          unconscious, stuck inside the crushed wreckage. Alice moves
          closer -- scared and sad for him --

           That trailer Woodward keeps in the
           school parking lot.
                         
          Joe moves next to Alice, who reaches out and gently NUDGES
          him -- you keep expecting him to suddenly grab her --

           ... Dr. Woodward?
                         
          But he's apparently dead; when she nudges him, he LEANS, his
          arm drops limp from the steering wheel, where he was HOLDING
          A PAPER, that has now fallen onto the ground. Joe picks it
          up. UNFOLDS IT: it's an OLD MAP -- thin, off-white paper.
          They hold it up, the map now backlit and obscuring Woodward.
          We see MARKER WRITING ON IT -- a BLACK LINE, from Nevada to
          Dayton -- and NUMBERS written along the way.

          But a SHADOW has appeared: A TREMBLING HAND -- before they
          can react, it RIPS THE MAP AWAY -- THEY ALL SCREAM AS OLD DR.
          WOODWARD IS REVEALED, BLOODY EYES OPEN, in a DAZE:

           Dr. Woodward! It's Charles Kaznyk!

          Charles arrives on the platform, grabs his camera.
                         
          Alice hurries past, hunting for her keys in that big purse --
          she eyes the FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer:

          Joe grabs his make-up kit -- another duffel -- runs for the
          car, past a whining Charles.

          As the FLASHLIGHT MEN APPROACH, Joe runs and gets in the

          into REVERSE, SCREECH-BACKS UP, narrowly avoids debris, then
          RIDES OFF -- the FLASHLIGHT MEN arrive -- SOLDIERS -- their
          adrenaline pumping. One man who WALKS UP TO THE CAMERA,
          eyeing the vanishing car with intense suspicion: COLONEL
          NELEC. He then looks to the ground in front of him.

          They all kind of look at each other. What a night. Charles,
          who looks at Joe for a beat, holds up his defunct camera on
          the tripod. Joe nods.
                         
          Alice finds something on the passenger seat and holds it out.

          is his desk, crowded with stuff. In focus, however, is the

          progresses, you may notice that THE CUBE HAS CHANGED SHAPE;
          THE VOLUME IS THE SAME, BUT THE CORNERS HAVE EXTENDED.

                         SHORTS):
                         
                          JEN
           Mom, come on!
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           No. You're not wearing that. No one
           in this house is wearing that.
                         
                          JEN
           Compared to Debbie's these are
           long.
                         
                          CHARLES' FATHER
           Just listen to your mother.
                         
                          JEN
           I can't wear these or go to Wendy's
           party? This is not fair.
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           Jennifer Anne, not fair is Africa.
                         
                          JEN
           Mom's racist.

           Are there anymore English muffins?
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           I don't know, go check.
                         
                          CHARLES' FATHER
           Peg, tell the twins to stop.
                         
                          PEG
           They don't listen to me.

                          CHARLES' FATHER
           Hi, Joe.
                         
          It all continues as Joe has entered from the front door.
                         
                          JOE
           Morning, Mr. Kaznyk--
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           Hi, Joe. Did you hear about the
           train accident?
                         
                          JOE
           Uh... no.
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           It's on the news.
                         
          Joe is moving toward the living room, where Charles sits on
          the sofa, eyes glued to the TV, A TRAIN CRASH BEING REPORTED
          ON THE LOCAL NEWS; HELICOPTER SHOT of the wreck. The CHYRON
          READS, "TRAIN DERAILED - AIR FORCE AIDS CLEAN UP." Joe sits
          beside Charles. They both watch, stunned, as a PHOTO OF DR.
          WOODWARD appears on the TV, with the heading "DRIVER OF TRUCK
          CRITICALLY INJURED, BEING TREATED." WHISPERED:
                         
                          CHARLES
           Can you believe this?
                         
                          JOE
           No.
                         
                          CHARLES
           It's on the news. That means it's
           real.
                         
           NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
           Meanwhile, local science teacher
           Thomas Woodward is still being
           treated by Air Force medical
           personnel after last night's train
           derailment. Woodward apparently
           fell asleep at the wheel of his
           pick-up truck, which was hit by the
           speeding train at approximately one
           AM. Eighty-two train cars were
           thrown from the tracks in the
           derailment, the largest such
           accident in Ohio's history. The
           condition of Woodward, who has
           taught at Lillian Middle School for
           the past six years, remains
           unknown.
           36.
                         
                         
          Both stare at the train crash, stunned. Finally, quietly:
                         
                          JOE
           ... Looks like a disaster movie,
           doesn't it...?
                         
          And we PUSH IN ON CHARLES, going from depressed and lost to
                         INSPIRED:
                         
                          CHARLES
                          (WHISPERS)
           ... oh my God, Joe... that's
                          AWESOME--
                         
                          JOE
           -- what?
                         
                          CHARLES
           We can use this -- we can film it --
                         
                          JOE
           (starts to smile)
           -- you wanna go back?!
                         
                          CHARLES JOE
           (turns to him) --okay--
          Holy shit, that's mint.
          You're a total brain--! We
          gotta get the camera fixed
          and the film developed from
          last night-- I gotta go steal
          some more money from my mom!
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - BRIDGE - MORNING
                         
          Joe and Charles ride their bikes into town, across a BRIDGE,
          the massive STEEL MILL in the background --
                         
                          CHARLES
           If any of the footage from last
           night is usable, that means we need
           Alice to play the wife again.
                         
                          JOE
           Yeah, I thought she was good.
                         
                          CHARLES
           She was mint, but she's never gonna
           do it.
                         
                          JOE
           I think she will.
           37.
                         
                         
                          CHARLES
           There's no way. You heard what she
           said.
                         
                          JOE
           But that was before the new pages,
           right?
                         
                          CHARLES
           You honestly think she cares about
           the scenes?
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - DAY
                         
          TILT DOWN from the town's WATER TOWER -- Joe and Charles ride
          their bikes underneath it, crossing Main Street -- two large
          MILITARY TRUCKS drive past, we may note the Airman in the
          passenger seat SCANS THE AREA with a handheld device.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Man, did you hear what she said
           last night? "I never should have
           done this!" Dude, she was totally
           wigged!
                         
                          JOE
           Yes, she was, we all were.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Did you see her face?
                         
                          JOE
           Yeah, I saw her face.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Man, what's wrong with you?
                         
                          JOE
           Nothing. I think she's going to do
           it.
                         
          They park their bikes outside OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI.

          DAINARD" and the phone number. We're in:

          Joe at the counter, DIALING THE ROTARY PHONE, Charles behind
          him with DONNY, the 19-year-old, dark-haired, bearded
          salesman with a big collared button-down shirt.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Lens is cracked. Focus ring broke.
                          (BEAT)
           Ya think it's fixable?
                         
          Joe HEARS Alice's phone number RINGING.
                         
                          DONNY
           I think it's cheaper to buy a new
           one.
                         
                          CHARLES
                          (TO JOE)
           We're screwed, man, it's over!
                         
           JOE ALICE (V.O.)
          We can use my dad's camera --
          it's got sound and-- Hello?
                         
                          JOE
           Alice-- hi, it's Joe. Lamb.
                         
          As Charles opens the camera, pulls out the film:
                         
           ALICE (V.O.)
           Hi...
                         
                          JOE
           So we have some new scenes. For the
           movie. We were hoping you'd be in
           `em.
                         
           ALICE (V.O.)
           Oh-- no. No, I'm done with that.
                         
          Joe twirls a hanging Kodak "RELIVE THE MEMORIES" SUPER 8 film
          PROMOTIONAL SIGN, speaking in a soft voice:
                         
                          JOE
           Really? `Cause these are really
           good scenes.
                         
          Charles hands the film cartridge to Donny.
                         
                          CHARLES
           We need this developed as soon as
           possible -- can you do overnight?
           39.
                         
                         
                          DONNY
           Asshole, no one can do overnight.
           You wanna buy some pot?
                         
          Charles reacts; he's never smoked anything.
                         
                          CHARLES
           ... no, thank you.
                         
                          DONNY
           You guys are weak.
                         
           ALICE (V.O.)
           I'm watching the crash on the news.
                         
                          JOE
           Yeah, I know, I saw it.
                          (CONCERNED)
           Are you okay?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Well, what's the fastest you can
           do?
                         
                          DONNY
           I can make it a rush, you get the
           film back in three days-- what's
           your sister up to? The hot one, not
           the other one.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I don't know.
                         
           ALICE (V.O.)
           I should go.
                         
           JOE ALICE (V.O.)
          -- wait, hold on -- lemme
          come over and show you the
          pages, okay? I'll be right
          there. No, d--
                         
                         
          EXT. ALICE'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Lower-lower-middle class house, set against woods. Joe with
          Alice at her front door. She seems unnerved:
                         
                          ALICE
           I don't care what Charles wants-- I
           said no on the phone.
           40.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           You totally did, that's true, I
           know, but--
                         
                          ALICE
           And now you're at my house.
                         
                          JOE
           I am, which-- under normal
           conditions I would nev--
                         
                          ALICE
           It's too weird after last night-- I
           don't understand how you guys can
           keep working on your stupid movie,
           I really don't.
                         
                          JOE
           We have to-- while the crash is
           still there.
           (waits, anxious, then,
                          VERY SOFTLY:)
           ... please...?
                         
                          ALICE
           (she considers, then:)
           No.
                         
          But Alice's eyes have flicked to the Buick, pulling up.
                         
                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           You should go.
                         
          Joe watches Louis get out of the car -- the man who got
          arrested at his mother's wake -- carrying a small grocery
          bag. He sees Joe and darkens as he approaches:
                         
                          LOUIS
           What's this?
                         
                          ALICE
           He was just inviting me to a party.
                         
          Joe steps back as Louis arrives; Louis seems to hate Joe, but
          at the same time, can barely look at him:
                         
                          LOUIS
           She's not going to your party.
                         
                          JOE
           Yessir.
                         
          Louis throws Alice a dark, resentful glare.
           41.
                         
                         
                          LOUIS
           You know better than this.
                         
          She nods, uncomfortable. Louis turns to Joe:
                         
                          LOUIS (CONT'D)
           You get outta her. You go home and
           don't come back, I don't wanna see
           you.
                         
          Louis goes back inside. Alice follows, turns to Joe. As
          awkward moment between them. Then, quietly, conflicted:
                         
                          ALIE
           I'll do it.
                         
                          JOE
           -- what?
                         
          She closes the door. Alone, despite it all, Joe is happy. Off
          his smile, we HEAR LOUD POPS: BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!
                         
                         
          EXT. HILLTOP - DAY
                         
          Martin -- as Detective Hathaway -- FIRES A GUN -- shooting
          CARY, dressed in a dirty suit, as a man TURNING INTO A ZOMBIE
          -- his eyes WIDE AND GLOSSY WHITE -- and as he is HIT BY THE
          BULLETS, he SLAMS HIS HAND ONTO HIS CHEST -- BLOOD BURSTS ALL
          OVER HIM and he FALLS PAINFULLY TO THE GROUND. We then find
          CHARLES, behind his camera, yelling out:
                         
                          CHARLES
           CUT! That was mint! So good! And it
           looked huge with the train! Wow!
           Joe: go reload the cap gun!
                         
                          JOE
                          OKAY --
                         
          WIDE SHOT, rising PAST SIX BICYCLES, thrown to the ground in
          a typical kid jumble. Charles, Joe and Preston, with Joe's
          dad's KODAK CAMERA on tripod, have been filming, their gear
          scattered. KEEP MOVING OVER THEM, to Martin and Alice, who
          were on camera. Beyond them, in the valley, the TRAIN CRASH
          seems to go forever. MILITARY TRUCKS, TENTS and SOLDIERS.
          HELICOPTERS buzz in the distant sky. Joe moves over to Alice,
          who looks out at the crash. During all this:
                         
                          CHARLES
           We'll get the other direction next -
           - Alice, that was mint-- Martin, go
           a little faster next time.
           42.
                         
                         
                          MARTIN
           I'll try, but I'm still crying
           about last night, I feel like I'm
           crazy.
                         
          Cary sits, pulls off the CUT-OUT PING PONG BALLS that were
          covering his closed eyes.
                         
                          CARY
           Did it really look good? My death?
                         
          CLOSE ON JOE as he arrives beside Alice, who looks out at the
          train, haunted. Quiet:
                         
                          ALICE
           ... what do you think happened...?
                         
          Joe stops reloading the gun, looks out, gets lost as well.
                         
                          JOE
           You mean why he crashed the train?
                         
                          ALICE
           I just got a horrible feeling.
                         
          Martin has arrives there too. Preston too:
                         
                          MARTIN
           Anyone else still shaking from the
           crash?
                         
                          PRESTON
           I got in my parents' bed last
           night. Haven't done that since I
           was eleven.
                         
          Joe suddenly WALKS AWAY FROM THEM, back toward the camera.
                         
                          PRESTON (CONT'D)
           ... did I just insult him?
                         
          Joe grabs the camera, near Charles:
                         
                          CHARLES
           -- dude, what are you doing?
                         
          Joe moves the camera back to Alice -- he looks through the
          lens -- uses the ZOOM -- and WE SEE JOE'S POV -- the CRASH,
          ZOOMED IN -- he PANS from ONE CAR TO ANOTHER.
                         
          Alice watches Joe, who peers into the camera for a long beat,
          finally standing up, looking out at the crash:
           43.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           That whole thing's an Air Force
           train.
                         
                          ALICE
           -- what?
                         
                         
          INT. DINER - DAY
                         
          The kids sit at a table at the window. The CAR LOT is across
          the street. They're talking excitedly but quietly:
                         
                          JOE
           I make models-- plastic ones-- you
           know, glue `em, paint `em--
                         
                          PRESTON
           And he's not embarrassed by that.
                         
                          CARY
           Looks who's talking, Math Camp.
                         
          A WAITRESS is there, delivering more FOOD --
                         
                          CHARLES
           Thanks, could I have a coffee,
           please? Cream on the side?
                         
                          WAITRESS
           (really?)
           Sure.
                         
          She heads off. Cary smiles at Alice.
                         
                          CARY
           He is so sophisticated.
                         
                          CHARLES CARY
          Shut up, I like coffee. No one likes coffee.
                         
                          ALICE
           Keep going.
                         
                          JOE
           Air Force trains -- even models --
           have these hooks...
                         
                          PRESTON
           Ooo! Ooo ooo ooo! They do -- for
           when their train cars are put on
           transport ships.
           44.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           Every car in that crash had hooks,
           every one...
                         
                          CHARLES
           Joe: stop talking about it.
                         
                          MARTIN
           Am I the only one who doesn't
           understand what this all means?
                         
                          CARY
           Probably, Smartin.
                         
                          MARTIN
           Shut up, I don't like that--
                         
                          JOE PRESTON
          Dr. Woodward had that map.
          He drove onto the tracks.
          Maybe there was something-- -- he wanted to destroy,
          he wanted to destroy? yeah.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Please shut up, all of you.

           I say he was just sick of being old
           and wanted to kill himself.
                         
                          JOE
           He had a gun, why not use that?
                         
                          PRESTON
           There are infinitely more effective
           ways to commit suicide: pills,
                          HANGING--
                         
                          CARY CHARLES
          Pussy, stop pulling the fries
          away. I ordered these for a reason.
          -- he gets all possessive
          with his fries, it's so
          annoying.
                         
                          PRESTON (CONT'D)
           You could jump from a building.
                         
                          MARTIN
           Fall down stairs.
                         
                          PRESTON
           Well, that's not really effective.

           So, if it's Air Force, what would
           the Air Force have on a train?
                         
                          CHARLES

           SHHHHJESUS! You heard what the Old
           Man said, we can't talk about this!

           Funny, Chompers, at least I don't
           use a booster seat.
                         
                          MARTIN
           What was your teacher even talking

           I don't wanna find out -- guys, we
           gotta forget we were there. Joe,
           seriously... you really wanna take
           a chance that something could
           happen to your dad, too?

          EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY
                         
          The massive train wreck that goes on for a mile. Hundreds of
          MILITARY work to clean up fast. A truck DRIVES PAST CAMERA,
          taking us to Jack and Nelec, who WALK together amid the
          debris. Choppers land and take off in the background:
                         
                          NELEC
           Yes, I understand, this crash has
           caused a whole mess of confusion.
           46.
                         
                         
                          JACK
           As you can expect, the local
           authorities are trying to figure
           out just what happened here as well
           as how to help you out.
                         
                          NELEC
           It's under control. It'll be a very
           fast clean-up.
                         
                          JACK
           Colonel, there isn't anything I
           should know, is there?
                         
                          NELEC
           Not that I can think of, Deputy. I
           understand you have concerns about
           our cargo.
                         
                          JACK
           I'd like to see that manifest, yes.
                         
                          NELEC
           That's not going to be possible.
                         
                          JACK
           Colonel, I've got a lot of people
           in my town that are gonna want to
           know what's taking place.
                         
                          NELEC
           -- what town is that?
                         
                          JACK
           ... Lillian.
                         
                          NELEC
           Deputy, if you're asking me if we
           had any dangerous property on board
           this train, I can assure you the
           answer's no.

           Excuse me.
                         
          Jack looks at Nelec -- not quite believing him...

          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
                         
          Jack is with Sheriff Pruitt, who stands, distracted, picking
          up reports from his desk, on his way out.
                         
                          JACK
           They gave me the run around for two
           hours before I was allowed to talk
           to anyone.
                         
                          PRUITT
           I'd say they have their hands full,
           wouldn't you?
                         
                          JACK
           Nelec -- the Colonel -- refused to
           show me their manifest, said they
           were carrying mostly airplane parts-
                         
                          PRUITT
           It's Air Force, Jack. Airplane
           parts sorta make sense.
                         
                          JACK
           Sheriff, I'm telling you, there's
           something else going on -- they're
           taking molds of tire tracks -- now
           why would they be doing that? Who
           are they looking for? And they're
           packing these weird little cubes
           into crates and they're--
                         
                          PRUITT
           Weird little cubes?
                         
                          JACK
           --yeah, into these red trucks,
           dozens of these trucks -- and I'm
           telling you, they're scrambling to
           get the hell outta there--
                         
                          PRUITT
           I'd say that's a good thing,
           wouldn't you?
                         
                          JACK
           Sheriff, I think you need to go
           check it out.
                         
                          PRESTON
           And I think you need a break.
                          (BEAT)
           Jack, I've been telling you this
           since Elizabeth.
                          (MORE)
           48.
                          PRESTON (CONT'D)
           You're a good deputy. But you need
           to take a vacation.
                          (BEAT)
           Go home. Take off your uniform. Go
           fishing. And give your son a hug.
                         
          Pruitt walks off. Jack, unsettled, watches him go.
                         
                         
          INT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT
                         
          FINGERS TAPPING -- they're fingers on a COUNTER, a WALKMAN
          sitting beside them. BOOM UP to 23-year-old BREEN, who digs
          the BLONDIE he's listening to. He is alone in the station
          store. Behind him, 60-year-old SHERIFF PRUITT enters.
                         
                          SHERIFF PRUITT
           Hey Breen, I'm not sure Edie's
           paying you to listen to the radio.
                         
          Breen doesn't respond. The sheriff throws a candy bar at him.
                         
           SHERIFF PRUITT (CONT'D)
           Breen.
                         
          Breen pulls off the headphones.
                         
                          BREEN
           Hey, Sheriff.
                         
                          SHERIFF PRUITT
           What's that?
                         
                          BREEN
           Walkman. It's like a stereo, play
           your own cassette tapes.
                          (OFFERS HEADPHONES)
           You wanna try it?
                         
                          SHERIFF PRUITT
           (pays for the candy bars)
           I don't think so. Kids walking
           around with their own stereos. Just
           what we need. It's a slippery
           slope.
                         
          He exits the store.
                         
                          BREEN
           ... yessir.
                         
          Pruitt heads out; Breen puts the headphones on again.
           49.
                         
                         
          EXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT
                         
          We see we're at the lonely gas station the kids drove past
          earlier. Pruitt's SQUAD CAR filling up, the only car here.
          High overhead, a yellow KELVIN sign TURNS atop a tall pole
          near the road. Pruitt crosses to his car. Peels the candy
          bar. Hearing something, he turns -- a PACK OF DOGS RUN BY. A
          DISTANT SHOT AS THE LIGHTS ALL MOMENTARILY DIM AND FLICKER.
          CLOSE UP of the PUMP'S SPINNING white NUMBER on black; the
          gallons and dollar amount blurring higher -- then A BIZARRE
          REFLECTION -- Pruitt sees it, turns -- and what he sees is
          TALL AND TERRIFYING -- he DROPS THE CANDY -- GOES FOR HIS
          GUN, BUT --
                         
                         
          INT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT
                         
          Breen, eyes closed, blasts his Walkman (we only hear TINNY
          MUSIC) as, through the window behind him, the rear of the
          squad car SUDDENLY SPRINGS UPWARD VIOLENTLY as if the FRONT
          SECTION WAS SUDDENLY CRUSHED! PRUITT SCREAMS, MUFFLED, as the
          CAR SLAMS back to the pavement -- LIGHTS FLICKER --
                         
                         
          EXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT
                         
          Gas PUMPING onto the asphalt, SCREAMS OF PRUITT, horrible,
                         CONFOUNDING --
                         
                         
          INT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT
                         
          PRUITT'S SCREAMS END as Breen OPENS HIS EYES AND RIPS off the
          headphones: the hell was that? He looks outside -- sees the
          car -- shattered windows. Confused, he heads out --
                         
                         
          EXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT
                         
          Breen moves tentatively toward the CRUSHED CAR -- quickly
          glances for Pruitt, who's missing. He gets close to the car,
          confounded by what he sees -- hands shaking, he rights the
          pump and replaces it. His heart pounds as he starts for the
          building -- but SLIPS ON THE GAS -- falls hard -- looks up --
          sees whatever's coming for him -- SCREAMS as he gets to his
          feet and RUNS LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER --
                         
                         
          INT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT
                         
          Breen RUSHES INSIDE -- we're WITH HIM as behind him:
          KKKRASH!!!! An EXPLOSION OF GLASS AND JUNK FOOD and --
           50.
                         
                         
          EXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT
                         
          WE LOOK DOWN UPON THE STATION FROM UP HIGH -- where the
          turning, lit KELVIN SIGN BLOCKS OUR VIEW FOR THE MOMENT -- we
          can only HEAR THE HORROR happening inside the station until
          FINALLY the sign REVEALS THE STATION -- everything inside
          looks like it's in a BLENDER -- THERE'S A SUPER-HUMAN
          UPHEAVAL HAPPENING IN THERE -- and Breen's SCREAMS CONTINUE
          as the turning Kelvin sign BLOCKS OUR VIEW AGAIN -- as the
          SOUND GETS UNBEARABLE, A SUDDEN CUT TO:
                         
          A FACE. A MAKE-UP BRUSH APPLYING MAKE-UP. It's ALICE, and
          she's becoming a ZOMBIE. We are:
                         
                         
          INT. CHARLES' KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          Joe makes her up -- a not half-bad, simple ZOMBIE MAKE-UP.
          Pale skin, sunken eyes and cheekbones. In the background, the
          other kids prepare to film.
                         
          He hands her a mirror, she gazes into it, sort of amazed.
                         
                          ALICE
           Where'd you learn how to do this?
                         
                          JOE
           Mostly the Dick Smith Monster Make-
           up Handbook.
                         
          She nods. Whatever. Charles is suddenly there, with Cary:
                         
                          CHARLES
           Hey! So I'm gonna need more shots
           of the train crash, obviously-- you
           know that train model you made? Can
           we blow it up and film it?
                         
          Joe doesn't want to do this at all. AT ALL. But...
                         
                          JOE
           ... sure.
                         
                          CHARLES CARY
          Mint. Gnarly!
                         
          Charles and Cary head off, planning the explosions. Alice
          looks at him knowingly.
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           I don't care, they can blow it up.
           I can show you the train, it's
           nothing, it's stupid.
                          (BEAT)
                          (MORE)
           51.
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           You wanna see it? Later? The...
           train? My train model? The train I
           made?
                         
          The LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE DIM -- BROWN OUT -- then back on.
                         
                          CHARLES MARTIN
          That's like the third time Dude. Bitchen.
          that's happened.
                         
                          ALICE
           So how am I supposed to be a
           zombie?
                         
                          JOE
           Oh. Just be a lifeless ghoul.
           Someone with no soul, dead eyes.
           Scary. D'you ever have Mrs. Mullin?
                         
                          ALICE
           For English? Yeah--
                         
                          JOE
           -- like her. But hungry, like
           hungry for human flesh. To make
           them turn into zombies, because
           that's what zombies do.
                         
          Alice considers this -- then, after a beat, starts doing her
          best zombie. Joe smiles, `cause it's pretty good.
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           Oh my God. That's really good...
                         
          And Alice slowly leans in toward him -- is this performance?
          Or is this something else--? And she PUTS HER MOUTH ON HIS
          NECK IN A FAKE BITE, which makes Joe go still -- a shiver
          down his spine -- he's never felt anything like this in his
          life. And when she pulls back, her performance over, she's
          smiling. He doesn't know what to say, tries to stay cool.
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           ... not bad.
                         
                         
          EXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - DAY
                         
          We're NEAR THE GAS PUMPS, LOW TO THE GROUND -- DOLLY as Jack,
          EDIE and MR. BLAKELY come out here. We pass SMALL SHATTERED
          PIECES OF RED AND BLUE PLASTIC and STOP AND RACK to the GUN
          Sheriff Pruitt dropped.
           52.
                         
                         
                          EDIE
           -- Careful, there was a gas spill.
           I don't even know how much fuel
           I've lost.
                         
           MR. BLAKELY
           -- You don't seem to be asking a
           lot of questions.
                         
                          EDIE
           -- Give this man some time, Mr.
           Blakely.
                         
           MR. BLAKELY
           He's just the Deputy, he's not the
           Sheriff...
                         
          Jack kneels by the Smith and Wesson Model 19. Jack pulls out
          a handkerchief, lifts the fun -- PUSH IN ON the engraved
          initials "H.P." JACK IS ROCKED BY THIS. He opens the cylinder
          to check if it had been fired.
                         
          CUT BACK WIDE. No squad car here. Jack checks out the broken
          BLUE AND RED PLASTIC as he makes a walkie call:
                         
           MR. BLAKELY (CONT'D)
           I think this is most likely a bear
           attack.
                         
                          EDIE
           Remember when I said you talk too
           much? Well, this is the time.
                         
                          JACK
           Vicky, ya heard from Sheriff Pruitt
           this morning?
                         
           VOICE (V.O.)
           Negative, still no word.
                         
                          JACK
           Vicky, I need you to have Dayton
           send a CS unit out to Edie's. You
           put out an APB on the Sheriff and
           Breen Haskell -- send units to
           their houses immediately. You copy
           all of that?
                         
           VOICE (V.O.)
           ... copy. And Jack, we're getting a
           lot of unusual calls.
                         
                          JACK
           ... what kind of unusual calls...?

           Never seen this kinda thing before.
                         
          Izzy opens ANOTHER CAR HOOD: PIECES MISSING.
                         
                          IZZY (CONT'D)
           What the hell am I supposed to do?
           Insurance company thought I was
           joking with him. Look at my
           Bonneville here-- look at this. I
           got a call about this car
           yesterday. What am I going to tell
           the customer?
                         
          ANOTHER HOOD -- PIECES MISSING.
                         
                          JACK
           Having trouble with anyone lately,
           Izzy?
                         
                          IZZY
           I was thinking, you should talk to
           Louis Dainard. I didn't help him
           out with financing last year,
           wouldn't be surprised if this was--
           some sorta sick retribution.
                         
          As Jack heads back to his car, THREE RESIDENTS move to him,
          walk with him, AD LIB:
                         
                          RESIDENTS JACK
          -- Some strange shit has been -- d'you call the station
          going on. My antenna's gone-- yet. You need to call the
          our dog is gone, he hasn't station. And file a report,
          come home this morning -- before anything can be done
          Jack, my lights keep going on about it. And then we can
          and off. Counting on you, take care of these things. If
          Jack. you do that for me, I promise
           you, I'll handle it myself.
                         
          He seems to have appeased them -- but as he turns, we see how
          stressed he is. He stops, noticing FOUR MILITARY TRUCKS
          DRIVING PAST, SLOWLY, ANTENNAS atop the trucks, and the men
          inside seemingly scanning the area. Jack is disturbed by
          this.
           54.
                         
                         
          EXT. HILL TOP
                         
          Joe rides along a hillside. Parks his bike. Walks toward the
          edge.
                         
                          JOE
           Lucy. Lucy. Lucy!
                         
          He stops to reveal the town of Lillian.
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN STREET - DUSK
                         
          Joe rides the street, calling out:
                         
                          JOE
           Lucy! ... Lucy!
                         
          WIDE SHOT as he DIPS down a neighborhood hill, sun LOW.
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - DUSK
                         
          A community CORKBOARD. Joe posts up a piece of paper; we SEE
          IT NOW IN CLOSE-UP. It's a MISSING DOG SIGN FOR LUCY. We're
          on Joe's face as he finishes pinning it up -- when something
          he sees makes him stop. He slowly takes a step back. Then
          another... his eyes glued to the board.
                         
          Then we see the REVERSE -- SLOWLY PULLING BACK -- REVEALING
          THAT THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF BRAND NEW "DOG MISSING"
          SIGNS POSTED ON THE BOARD. It's COVERED in them. Joe is so
          stunned, he doesn't notice the MILITARY TRUCKS that pass in
          the background behind him.
                         
                         
          INT. JOE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          KA-BAM: back door opens, Joe enters. EMPTY PIZZA BOX on the
          table. Jack and four POLICE OFFICERS in the living room,
          smoking, reviewing POLICE REPORTS, marking MAPS, taking notes
          -- WORKING ON THE PROBLEMS THEY'RE HAVING --
                         
                          OFFICER MIKE
           We need more help around here.
                         
                          OFFICER GORDON
           We've got four men on the Pruitt
           case alone. We've called into
           Dayton, they'll be out in the
                          MORNING----
           55.
                         
                         
                          JACK
           That's not enough. People don't
           feel safe here -- and you know why?
           `Cause they're not--
                         
          The officers agree. Joe moves into the doorway where his dad
          and other convene.
                         
                          JACK (CONT'D)
           -- the Air Force isn't answering a
           damn question: they've got trucks
           at Woodward's house, looking for
                          SOMETHING --
                         
                          OFFICER
           They've got trucks all over town.
                         
                          OFFICER JAY
           I saw a guy riding shotgun in one
           of those trucks -- had some kind of
           scanner in his hand --
                         
                          DEPUTY TALLY
           --like a Geiger counter or
                          SOMETHING--
                         
                          JACK
           I know. They're saying it's just
           clean-up at the train crash, but
           they're taking molds of tire
           tracks. Which means they're looking
           for someone-- now what's that
           about?
                         
          Joe has heard this and DROPPED HIS FLASHLIGHT -- the men all
          turn, silent. Joe, on the spot:
                         
                          JOE
           -- have you... seen Lucy?
                         
                          JACK
           I'm sure she's around. I put a
           couple of slices in the fridge for
           you there.
                         
                          DEPUTY TALLY
           -- oh-- I ate those. Sorry, Kid--
                         
                          JOE
           That's... okay, I'll find a--
                         
          Then the POWER GOES OUT -- the men react -- it FLICKERS ON
          AND OFF -- Jack grabs his radio a the POWER RETURNS:
           56.
                         
                         
                          JACK
           Vicky, you got power at the
           station?
                         
           DISPATCH (V.O.)
           On and off. Brook County's in the
           dark.
                         
                          JACK
           Get water and power out there now.
                         
                         
          INT. JOE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Joe paints his model on the floor of his living room,
          watching In Search Of and talking to Charles on his walkie
          talkie.
                         
                          JOE
           So the Air Force is looking for a
           car -- Alice's dad's car -- they're
           taking tire prints from the crash
           site. Over.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I don't wanna hear about it. They
           could be monitoring us right now!
           Jesus, shut up. Over!
                         
                          JOE
                          (VERY CONCERNED)
           And the military's at Woodward's
           house. Looking for his research.
           Whatever that means?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Joe -- YOU CAN NOT FLAKE OUT ON ME
           AND BE A DICK! Are you gonna come
           help me tomorrow or not? I need you
           to make Alice a zombie again.
                         
          And Joe tries to snap himself out of it. But is disturbed.
                         
                          JOE
           Okay... I'll do the make-up. Over.
                         
                         
          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
                         
          WIDE SHOT: middle of nowhere wooded area as an OHIO POWER
          CHERRY PICKER TRUCK drives up, parks beside a UTILITY POLE.
           57.
                         
                         
          INT. DWP CHERRY PICKER - NIGHT
                         
          ROONEY, 49. Cigarette in his mouth, makes notes on a
          weathered clipboard. Glances at the power line. Doesn't
          understand what he sees -- PUSH IN ON HIM. He radios in:
                         
                          ROONEY
           This is Rooney at Mary-10, was
           there re-routing on this line?
                         
           VOICE (V.O.)
           Negative, but the grid through
           Liberty is dark.
                         
                          ROONEY
           ... yeah, `cause there's no
           overhead lines on these poles.
                         
           VOICE (V.O.)
           -- come again?
                         
                          ROONEY
           No power, no comm cables. Stand by.
                         
          He DRIVES AGAIN -- we see a WIDE SHOT OF THE LANDSCAPE --
          HALF A DOZEN UTILITY POLES -- ALL BARE -- NOT ONE WIRE.
                         
                         
          EXT. SALVAGE YARD ROAD - NIGHT
                         
          The truck comes to a stop, roadside. Tall trees and a SALVAGE
          YARD behind them. PUSH IN ON ROONEY who calls in:
                         
                          ROONEY
           We got over a half mile of copper
           missing.
                         
           VOICE (V.O.)
           -- that-- doesn't sound possible.
                         
                          ROONEY
           Lines are back up at M-38.
                         
          In the cherry picker bucket, Rooney works the controls. He
          begins LIFTING; a WIDE SHOT shows him rising to the bare
          utility pole STEPDOWN TRANSFORMER. When Rooney finally gets
          to the top, with gloves hands, he inspects the transformer.
          After a moment, though, he stops. HEARS something else, past
          the sound of electricity. He looks over toward the SALVAGE
          YARD. Except it's mostly hidden by the trees. From here,
          Rooney can only see the tops of the JUNK PILES. A small
          METALLIC CRASH. Then ANOTHER.
           58.
                         
                         
          Rooney cranes his neck to get a view. Another METALLIC CRASH,
          this time GLASS BREAKING, too. Then, in the distance, at the
          middle of the salvage yard, SOMETHING FLIES INTO THE AIR,
          FALLING AND LANDING WITH A CLANG-THUNK.
                         
          Rooney strains his eyes to see -- what the hell was that? A
          tin can? A piece of a fender? Hard to tell from here.
                         
          Then, thrown into the air: A CAR TIRE. It lands with a THUD.
          Rooney then uses the bucket controls -- MOVES BACKWARD AND UP
          -- a touch higher toward the transformer -- not exactly
          watching how close he is getting. He stops. Watches.
                         
          An ENTIRE JUNKED MOTORCYCLE flies into the air, discarded,
          twirling, and CRASH LANDS, out of sight.
                         
          Rooney is stunned. As the METALLIC RUMMAGING SOUNDS CONTINUE,
          Rooney moves the bucket EVEN HIGHER -- when suddenly his
          bucket BEEP-BEEPS LOUDLY -- a warning he's too high -- and he
          suddenly stops it and the BEEPING STOPS --
                         
          But so do the rummaging sounds. SILENCE, save for the eerie
          HUM OF POWER. He waits. Nothing. Wants a better view, so he
          begins to LOWER THE BUCKET.
                         
          We're in a WIDE SHOT, seeing his DESCEND, PAINFULLY SLOWLY.
                         
          Then we're in a LONG LENS CLOSE UP of Rooney as he SLOWLY
          DROPS -- TIGHT ON HIM as he's looking over toward the salvage
          yard -- and it takes us a minute to realize there's fucking
          SOMETHING BEHIND HIM -- SO BIG WE DIDN'T SEE IT -- COMING OUT
          OF THE SHADOWS -- IT'S GOT MUSCLE AND FLESH AND IT MAKES AN
          UNGODLY SOUND AND IT INSTANTLY GRABS HIM -- THE TRUCK ROCKS
          AS WE CUT INSIDE THE CAB OF THE TRUCK, LOOKING OUT THE
          WINDSHIELD -- KEEEEEEESH!!! IT SPIDERS AS ROONEY'S LEGS
          IMPACT THE GLASS AND SUDDENLY WE'RE IN A WIDE SHOT OF THE
          CHERRY PICKER, ROCKING BACK AND FORTH IN INCREASINGLY SMALLER
          MOVEMENTS, UNTIL THE TRUCK IS MOTIONLESS. Empty. Alone.
                         
          Then: NOISE -- and an AMPLIFIED VOICE:
                         
           MRS. BABBIT (V.O.)
           I wanna know who took `em.
                         
                         
          INT. TOWN HALL - DAY
                         
          A LOUD TOWN MEETING. Two-hundred frustrated CITIZENS crowd
          the auditorium. Jack at the podium, TOWN OFFICIALS, including
          the local MAYOR sit on stage as well. Currently, MRS. BABBIT,
          52, speaks into the microphone on the floor:
           59.
                         
                         
           MRS. BABBIT
           Twenty microwave ovens: gone from
           my inventory. Brook County's
           without power -- this feels to me
           like a Russian invasion.
                         
          The town ROARS its approval -- Jack, impotent, tries:
                         
                          JACK
           Mrs. Babbit, I don't believe the
           Russians have anything to do with
           what's happening in town-- but I'm
           calling the curfew because w--
                         
           MRS. BABBIT
           Until you can tell me who's messing
           with us, I say it's the Soviets and
           we're at war. I like you, Jack, but
           we need Sheriff Pruitt back.
                         
          The town ERUPTS in agreement --
                         
                          JACK
           We have good people working on
           that. Mr. McCandless.
                         
          A short, bald man of 65, MR. MCCANDLESS speaks:
                         
           MR. MCCANDLESS
           Since Wednesday morning, my Ham
           radio's been a mess -- all sorts of
           frequencies I like to scan. Some
           kind of buzz modulation-- have you
           found that?
                         
          PUSH IN ON JACK, HEARING THIS --
                         
                          JACK
           Mr. McCandless, can I speak with
           you for a moment, privately?
                         
          The Mayor takes over as Jack has a SIDEBAR MEETING with Mr.
                         MCCANDLESS:
                         
           MR. MCCANDLESS JACK
          -- it was like having my -- that must be very annoying-
          radio hi-jacked-- - you don't know the
           frequencies off-hand, do you?
          -- sure I do: 13201 to 13710, (pulls out paper, pen)
                         15015 TO 15048--
           60.
                         
                         
          EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
                         
          Jack hurries from the town meeting to the station --
                         
                          WOMAN
           Jack, all the tools in the garage
           are gone.
                         
                          JACK
           Patty, get in touch with Vicky.
           David, have you seen Milner?
                         
                          DAVID
           No, sir, I haven't seen him.
                         
                          MAN
           There's a sink hole in my garage.
           It almost sank a foot.
                         
                          JACK
           Hey Tom. Tom, have you seen Milner?
                         
                          TOM
           Have you tried his office?
                         
                          JACK
           Check his office.
                         
                          MAN
           The powers been out for days
                         
          Jack continues, into:
                         
                         
          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
                         
          DOLLY FAST with an exasperated Jack as he WRITES, tailed by
          ASSISTANT DEPUTY ROSKO --
                         
                          JACK
           --Rosko, I need you to get every
           radio we have and you tune to these
           frequencies -- understand?
                         
                          ROSKO
           No. What?
                         
                          JACK
           Hey Danny, you have a radio scanner
           with a descrambler don't you?
                         
                          DANNY
           Voice inverter, yeah.
           61.
                         
                         
                          JACK
           Whatever, get it down and set it up
           for me.
                         
                          ROSKO
           What is this?
                         
                          JACK
           I think the Air Force is using
                          UNASSIGNED CHANNELS--
                         
          He heads for his office, seeing LOUIS, who is being escorted
          out by an Officer across the room.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Hey -- he was at my house yesterday
           morning, are you aware of that?
                         
                          OFFICER ROSKO
           (quiet to Jack)
           We brought him in about the car lot
           and other things -- he's clean.
                         
                          LOUIS
           I'd appreciate it if you would
           inform your son that my house if
           off-limits. And so it my daughter.
                         
          Louis heads out -- HOLD ON JACK AS he turns, ENTERS HIS
          OFFICE, and as that door opens, we CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. JOE'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          The door opens of his messy, motherless room. Joe and Alice
          enter. He could not be more self-conscious. He moves stacks
          of comic, tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed -- pair of
          underwear and socks. He closes the closet and hangs a bath
          towel on his desk chair. She looks around sa she enters. The
          light dim, intimate.
                         
                          JOE
           Oh gawd, I didn't clean up.
                         
          Joe quickly moves a pile of papers and books from the desk to
          the floor; NOTEBOOKS AND SCHOOL WORK spill out and we get a
          GLIMPSE of some "B-MINUSES" and other "C-PLUSES" in RED.
                         
          Joe, embarrassed, hides them, then moves to his MODELS:
                         
                          ALICE
           -- you made all these?
           62.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           Yeah, that's the Hunchback of Notre
           Dame. I watched that one on TV.
                          HERE---
                         
          Alice sits on the bed. Joe takes the FIVE-CAR TRAIN MODEL.
          She moves close:
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           This is the train they wanna
           destroy.
                         
          Alice hold it. Joe watches her. She really looks at it.
                         
                          ALICE
           ... it looks real.
           (beat, studies)
           It looks so old...
                         
                          JOE
           That's dry brush technique.
           (off her look)
           After you've painted the base
           color, you take something like...
           (grabs up Testors bottle)
           Euro Gray.
                         
          Her face is so close to his. Her hair touches his ear.
                         
                          ALICE
           Euro Gray...
                         
                          JOE
           There are so many different grays,
           it's crazy. And you pour a little
           onto like a paper plate. Then you
           take a dry brush and you just dip
           it in, then you brush on the paper,
           so the paint's barely on the brush.
           Then you make small brush strokes
           on the model. Little ones, like
           where the wear and tear would be.
           Around the wheels. Or where the
           doors would slide. Then you do it
           again, like with Camouflage Gray--
           or here, I used Insignia Red to
           make it look like there was another
           coat of paint on there before. Like
           they painted over it, but you could
           see it scratched off.
                         
          Lost in thought, he looks at her. Suddenly self-conscious.
           63.
                         
                         
                          ALICE
           What was that necklace?
           (off his awkward stare)
           The one you were holding at the
           train crash. Was it your mom's?
                         
          It takes him a beat. Finally:
                         
                          JOE
           My dad gave it to her the day I was
           born. She wears it all the time.
           Used to.
                          (BEAT)
           It was bad, how she-- died and
           stuff, but they got the necklace
           back. So.
                         
          Their tension INTERRUPTED BY an out of breath Charles:
                         
                          CHARLES
           Guys, what the hell?! No one knew
           where you were.
                         
                          JOE
           We're sitting right here.
                         
                          CHARLES
           You gotta be the soldier.
                         
                          JOE
           I thought you were calling Evan.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Evan blew us off, he's a pussy.
                          (TO ALICE)
           Excuse me.
                         
                          ALICE
           It's okay.
                         
                          CHARLES
           You gotta do it. You're the only
           one.

                          JACK
           The hell do you mean you "found my
           dog in Brookville?" That's a
                          DIFFERENT COUNTY--

                          OFFICER TALLY
           Lucy-- that's where she is. We've
           gotten nearly thirty calls from
           people who have found local dogs.
           Thing is, the calls coming in
           aren't local.
                         
          Tally puts a MAP on his desk -- 28 DOTS in a CIRCLE, anywhere
          from a 20 to 150 MILE RADIUS, WITH LILLIAN AT THE CENTER.
                         
           OFFICER TALLY (CONT'D)
           It's like they all just... ran
           away, every direction...
                         
          Jack is stunned.

          Officer Rosko at his desk, with a YOUNG WOMAN, a HAM RADIO at
          his desk beside a REEL-TO-REEL TAPE DECK. He takes notes:
                         
                          YOUNG WOMAN
           It's not her. She never's
           disappeared before.
                         
                          OFFICER ROSKO
           Alright. Now what does she look
           like?
                         
                          YOUNG WOMAN
           She's got dark hair, it was in
           rollers. Do you know what rollers
           are?
                         
                          OFFICER ROSKO
           Yes, I know what rollers are.
                         
                          YOUNG WOMAN
           She went to her car--
                         
          Suddenly a GARBLED ELECTRONIC SOUND from the HAM RADIO. Rosko
          quickly hits RECORD on the reel-to-reel --
                         
                          OFFICER ROSKO
                          EXCUSE ME--

          close to the tape recorder, turns on recorder.

          dressed as an Airman, performing with Martin, dressed as the
          detective.
                         
          Military trucks surround the house. Hathaway is with a

           Suicide? Who was it?
                         
                          OFFICER JOE
           A former Air Force officer. He
           called me last night, said he had a
           secret that he couldn't keep any
           longer.
                         
          Officer Joe hands Hathaway a FILE. Hathaway looks at it.
           66.
                         
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           What's this?
                         
                          OFFICER JOE
           He worked at Romero Chemical. He
           found out some things the company's
           been doing. After what you told me
           at the bar, I thought you should
           know.
                         
          Cary behind the camera, Charles beside him:
                         
                          CARY
                          (QUIETLY)
           Are we gonna get in trouble here--?
                         
                          CHARLES
                          (WHISPER-YELL)
           Shhhh! Production value! It's for
           the movie!
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           This proves it. They knew, the
           company knew. Thank you so much for
           the information.
                         
                          OFFICER JOE
           We just made the discovery
           ourselves. You understand this is
           top secret.
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           Of course.
                         
                          OFFICER JOE
           I would never have given you this
           information if you and I hadn't
           served together in Vietnam.
                         
          As it continues, we see Alice behind the camera, watching
          Joe, smiling. But then she sees something that disturbs her:
          Jack's CRUISER pulls up.
                         
                         
          INT. WOODWARD'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          A dozen OFFICERS go through HUNDREDS OF CARDBOARD BOXES of
          documents. Books and personal belongings are put into boxes,
          taken from the house. Overmyer enters, crosses to Nelec, who
          reviews a folder.
                         
                          OVERMYER
           Nothing so far--
           67.
                         
                         
                          NELEC
           How much more is there?
                         
                          OVERMYER
           Sixty boxes in the basement, maybe
           more.
                         
                          NELEC
           What, more tax returns?
                         
                          OVERMYER
           It's here somewhere. If we can't
           find it, Woodward'll tell us where
           it is.
                         
          But Nelec has seen something outside: THE KIDS.
                         
                          NELEC
           ... the hell's that?
                         
                          OVERMYER
           ... looks like kids making a
           movie...
                         
          Behind them, a WINDOW, showing the street, where Jack insists
          Joe get into the car. Nelec looks out -- sees Jack take Joe
          by the arm, grab the tripod and head to his squad car.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOORWARD'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          As Jack gets out, he sees the kids and isn't happy. He moves
          toward Joe and his friends:
                         
                          CHARLES
           Joe.
                          (TO JACK)
           Hey, Mr. Lamb!
                         
          Joe spins around as Jack arrives, grabs his camera from
          Charles and saying firmly, to Joe:
                         
                          JACK
           Get in the car.
                         
          Joe is stunned -- instantly humiliated in front of Alice --
          he's taken back to the squad car --
                         
                          CHARLES
           Uh-- Mr. Lamb? That's your camera,
           but technically, that's my film--
           68.
                         
                         
          Jack OPENS the car's back door -- Joe gets in -- Jack SLAMS
          it shut, then throws the camera and tripod into the passenger
          seat and SLAMS that door, heading to the house, leaving Joe
          in the back. Nelec heads outside -- Jack moves to him:
                         
                          NELEC
           I would like to help you out
           deputy. I really would. But we
           operate on a need to know basis.
                         
                          JACK
           Why are your trucks sweeping the
           town?
                         
                          NELEC
           We'll be out of your way shortly.
                         
                          JACK
           Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind me
           contacting DC. Talk to some friends
           about "Walking Distance."
                         
          This lands on Nelec.
                         
                          JACK (CONT'D)
           All right. We'll do it that way.
                         
          Jack heads off.
                         
                          NELEC
           Deputy.
                          (JACK TURNS)
           Let's talk. Just not here.
                         
          Jack stops, turns to uncomfortable Nelec.
                         
                         
          INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY
                         
          Joe, his breathing heavying, sits in the car, heart pounding,
          watching his father move over to talk to Nelec, close again.
          Then he looks over at his friends -- Charles giving him a
          "WHAT THE FUCK?!" Look. Alice watches him sympathetically.
          She mouths to him a guilty, "...is it me...?" And Joe shakes
          his head: "No." But we -- and she -- know better.
                         
                         
          EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The squad car pulls up. Jack gets out, Joe follows -- THE
          CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THAT WE ARE:
           69.
                         
                         
          INT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Door opens. Jack enters, then lets Joe pass him. Joe closes
          the door hard and says, angrily, but restrained:
                         
                          JACK
           This is new. All this. For the both
           of us. Dealing with-- all this,
           just us. So I'm going to make this
           as clear and simple as I can:
           You're not friends with Alice
           Dainard. When I say no, I don't
           mean maybe. I don't mean yes. I
           mean no. I've known Louis Dainard
           for alotta years-- he's been
           nothing but trouble. Your mother
           used to say he's not a bad guy, he
           just needs a chance, he's just sad -
           - well I tried to be good to him,
           but I can't. Not anymore. I will
           not allow him or his daughter in
           this house. I will not allow you
           spending time with her, doing
           projects or whatever it is that
           you're doing. THAT'S IT. I hope
           we're clear.
                         
          Jack turns to leave -- but Joe, enraged, says:
                         
                          JOE
           We're not clear.
                         
          Jack stops -- stunned -- Joe's heart pounds --
                         
                          JACK
           What'd you say?
                         
                          JOE
           We're not clear. You and I aren't
           clear about anything. We couldn't
           be less clear.
                         
                          JACK
           Joseph Francis Lamb--
                         
                          JOE
                          (ERUPTING)
           Just `cause mom died doesn't mean
           you know anything about me!!! You
           don't. You don't know about Alice
           either -- she's kind!
           70.
                         
                         
                          JACK
           I'm not having this discussion with
           you--!
                         
                          JOE
           She's NICE to me!
                         
                          JACK
           I don't care what she is! Her
           father is a selfish, irresponsible
           son-of-a-bitch!
                         
          Jack moves CLOSE to Joe -- intimidating -- Joe steps back --
          Jack is fucking intense:
                         
                          JACK (CONT'D)
           You listen to me, I've got twelve
           thousand people in this town that
           are scared out of their minds--
           they've got one person they can
           rely on -- it used to be someone
           else, but now it's just me.
                         
          Jack suddenly stops himself, realizing what he's saying. And
          to whom he's saying it. But somehow, in this moment, he can't
          be a better father than law officer. Not yet. More upset at
          himself than Joe, he heads out.
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN STREET - DUSK
                         
          Joe rides UP A HILL -- BOOM UP -- REVEAL THE TOWN CEMETERY.
                         
                         
          EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
                         
          Joe sits, his back against his mother's grave. Holds her OPEN
          LOCKET, staring at it. He's just come here for comfort. But
          then -- a SOUND -- and Joe turns. Deep and low, in the
          distance. Joe is motionless. HEARS IT AGAIN. He stands, pulls
          out his flashlight -- aims the beam down ROWS OF GRAVES,
          toward the big CARETAKER'S SHED in the distance. Another
          INTENSE, LOW SOUND -- then a high pitch HIT, like METAL ON
          WOOD and Joe backs up, nervous. Another odd sound -- then
          ANOTHER -- which TRANSITIONS US TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. MUNICIPAL AIRPORT ENTRANCE - NIGHT
                         
          Jack's squad car arrives at the abandoned airfield.
           71.
                         
                         
          EXT. MUNICIPAL AIRPORT BUILDING - NIGHT
                         
          Jack's car pulls up. He gets out of the car. Suddenly the
          three large MILITARY TRUCKS' HEADLIGHTS COME ON -- all aimed
          at Jack -- he is blinded -- tries to see --
                         
                          JACK
           Hello--?
                         
          And now BODIES are seen of SOLDIERS, holding and aiming
          WEAPONS. Then, a VOICE over a TRUCK PA:
                         
           VOICE (V.O.)
           Drop your weapons. Put your hands
           on the car.
                         
                          JACK
           --I'm here to see Colonel Nelec. He
           told me to meet him here.
                         
           VOICE (V.O.)
           You're under military arrest. Drop
           your weapons.
                         
                          JACK
           WHERE'S NELEC?
                         
                         
          INT. MILITARY MEDICAL ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          TIGHT ON NELEC. Past an IV and medical machinery. He's
          looking at someone we don't yet see. In the background,
          Overmyer stands, watching. Nelec is quiet, simple:
                         
                          NELEC
           I don't want any more trouble. Do
           you?
                         
          Now we see who he's talking to. IT'S DR. WOODWARD. Battered
          and scraped, he lies in a medical bed, afraid, but defiant.
                         
                          NELEC (CONT'D)
           We've been going through your
           belongings, looking for evidence.
           Of what you knew, how you knew
           it... and who else might know.
                          (BEAT)
           I remember you. In the lab. And I
           recall we didn't see eye to eye,
           but that's no excuse for doing what
           you did here.
           72.
                         
                         
          Dr. Woodward swallows. Feels that his time on Earth is coming
          to an end no matter what he does here. By the door, Overmyer
          is quietly putting on his BLACK GLOVES.
                         
                          NELEC (CONT'D)
           So in the spirit of moving forward
           and avoiding more trouble, tell us
           where you put your research. I know
           you had someone document the crash
           that night. Tell me who that was
           and I'll help you, I swear to God.
           On my mother's life -- if you help
           us now, we will take care of you.
                         
           DR. WOODWARD
           I've seen what happens, Mr. Nelec,
           when you take care of people.
                         
                          NELEC
           --I'm going to bait him. I'm going
           to catch him.
                         
           DR. WOODWARD
           He's in me, you know. As I am in
           him. So when you see him next, as
           I'm sure you will... I'll be
           watching you, too.
                         
          Nelec offers a vague, searching smile. But Woodward will not -
          - not ever -- relent. So. Nelec moves to the door, he remains
          FACING CAMERA, his back to Woodward, as Overmyer moves to the
          bed. PUSH IN ON NELEC'S FACE, UNDERSTANDING HIS TRUE NATURE
          AS WE CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Joe sleeps, power still out. Then, a KNOCK. He wakes up.
          Another KNOCK. His window. He moves to it. Opens it. It's
          Alice. Joe is half asleep, but also stunned. Very quietly:
                         
                          ALIE
           -- are you-- were you sleeping?
                         
                          JOE
           Before, earlier, b-- no, you okay?
                         
                          ALICE
           Yeah.
                         
                          JOE
                          (BEAT)
           Oh, you wanna come in?
           73.
                         
                         
          And Alice climbs in. Joe sits on the floor. Alice does too.
          It's odd and silent for a moment.
                         
                          ALICE
           Power's still out.
                         
                          JOE
           Room's still messy.
                         
                          ALICE
           I was in bed, couldn't sleep.
                          (BEAT)
           Thinking. I wanted to tell you
           something, before tomorrow -- Don't
           let Charles blow up your train.
                         
          Joe stares, amazed at her.
                         
                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           I don't think it's right, do you? I
           know he's your friend, but he's so
                          BOSSY--
                         
                          JOE
           He can be sorta li-- I've known him
           since Kindergarten, though--
                         
                          ALICE
           He shouldn't always get what he
           wants. I mean, who always gets what
           they want? -- I know I don't know
           you at all. Even though... it sort
           of feels like I do.
                          (BEAT)
           Do you not... feel like that?
                         
                          JOE
           -- no, I totally do, I'm just...
           sort of in shock at this whole
                          CONVERSATION--
                         
          And the POWER RETURNS -- Joe's CLOCK LIGHT goes on behind him
          -- but more chilling, the PROJECTOR comes back on; the SILENT
          HOME MOVIE OF HIS MOTHER PLAYS. Joe crawls to the projector
          to stop it -- but:
                         
                          ALICE
           -- no, keep it-- please --
                         
          Alice moves closer to the screen. Joe sits behind her. She
          watches the film. Can't take her eyes away.
                         
                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           ... is that her?
           74.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           ... yeah...
                         
          And as Alice watches, we GENTLY PUSH IN... as tears start to
          fill her eyes. Behind her, at a near WHISPER:
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           ... it's so weird watching her like
           this, like she's still here...
           (beat, lost in it)
           ... she used to look at me, this
           way... like really look. And I
           just... knew I was there. That I
           existed.
                         
          A tear drops down Alice's face, though Joe can't see that.
          Finally, quietly:
                         
                          ALICE
           He drank that morning. My dad.
                          (BEAT)
           He missed his shift.
           (beat, hard)
           Your mom took it for him. The day
           of the accident.
                         
          Watching his mother, Joe is quietly stunned. Finally, eyes
          wet, Alice turns to Joe.
                         
                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           ... I know he wishes it was him.
           Instead of her.
                          (HARD BEAT)
           ... and sometimes I wish it was,
           too.
                         
          Joe just stares at her... heartsick and speechless. Finally:
                         
                          JOE
           Don't say that.
                          (BEAT)
           He's your dad.
                         
          Just then, the SUPER 8 movie ENDS: the film FLIPFLIPFLIPS.
          Joe turns off the projector -- but a SOUND REMAINS. A sort of
          SHUDDER-HUM. Joe unplugs the projector, but the sound
          remains. Then they look: THE SHUDDERING IS COMING FROM THE
          CUBE HE TOOK FROM THE CRASH SITE, sitting on his desk.
                         
          Joe and Alice move to it. He turns on his desk lamp. The cube
          VIBRATES, almost imperceptibly.
                         
                          ALICE JOE
          -- has this--? -- no.
           75.
                         
                         
          Joe opens a drawer, grabs a paintbrush -- he touches the cube
          -- the thing SHUDDERS ON ITS OWN.
                         
          They are amazed. They get LOW -- eyes at desk level -- the
          SHUDDERING INCREASES IN PITCH AND VOLUME -- he reaches out to
          touch it with his finger, but suddenly the cube BULLETS AWAY -
          - ACROSS THE ROOM -- AND BLASTS THROUGH THE WALL, LEAVING A
          FIVE-INCH HOLE IN THE WALL! She screams -- they both fall to
          the floor, STUNNED -- PUSH IN ON Joe, his heart pounding. He
          moves to the wall -- looks through the hole: in the distance,
          trees and the TOWN WATER TOWER.
                         
                         
          INT. ALICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Alice enters the dark house quietly. She steps carefully
          toward her room, when --
                         
           LOUIS (O.S.)
           Morning.
                         
          His voice makes her JUMP. She turns: sitting in the dark, in
          an armchair, is her father. He's awake. And drunk.
                         
                          LOUIS (CONT'D)
           You wanna tell me where you were?
           Or you want me to tell you.
                         
          A tense beat, her mind races. Breathe, Alice, just breathe.
                         
                          LOUIS (CONT'D)
           Sit down.
                         
                          ALICE
           I should go to bed.
                         
                          LOUIS
           I wanna talk to you. I said sit
           down.
                         
                          ALICE
           I don't want to sit down.
                         
                          LOUIS
           Then go. Be just like your mother
           and leave.
                         
          This kills her -- but she does: she leaves the house.
                         
                          LOUIS (CONT'D)
           GO AHEAD, GO!
           76.
                         
                         
          EXT. ALICE'S HOUSE - PRE-DAWN
                         
          Alice, crying, gets on her bike and rides off -- a DISTANT
          FIERY GLOW past the factory and over the hills. The front
          door opens -- Louis comes out and yells, miserable:
                         
                          LOUIS
           ALICE!!! WAIT!!!
                         
          But she's far gone -- Louis' mind races -- he runs to his
          BUICK -- starts it up -- PULLS OUT FAST and goes after her --
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN
                         
          Alice PEDALS HARD, she wants to escape everywhere. No cars on
          the street, no people. A block behind her, SCREECH: a CAR
          turns onto the road. Her father's car -- she makes a turn --
                         
                         
          INT. BUICK - PRE-DAWN
                         
          We're with Louis as he drive -- clearly drunk --
                         
                         
          EXT. SHARP TURN ROAD - PRE-DAWN
                         
          Alice makes a daring stop -- turns back up the hill, pedals
          hard, crying and hyperventilating --
                         
                          LOUIS
           ALICE!!! I'M SORRY!!!
                         
          Louis sees her, tries to stop, but can't -- and his car SLAMS
          INTO A PARKED CAR IN A VIOLENT, SUDDEN STOP!
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN
                         
          Alice GASPS -- stops pedaling -- looks back at her father's
          car, wide-eyed and terrified -- should she go back?!
                         
                         
          INT. BUICK - PRE-DAWN
                         
          Louis is bleeding. Badly hurt. He adjusts himself --
          painfully -- then looks into the CRACKED-GLASS REAR VIEW
          MIRROR -- AND HE SEES SOMETHING THAT MAKES HIS EYES GO WIDE.
           77.
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN
                         
          Alive is still looking back at the car -- SO SHE DOESN'T SEE
          THE SHAPE THAT IS COMING BEHIND HER -- and just as she
          decides: I'M NOT GOING BACK, she turns to begin riding on --
          BUT SEES SOMETHING AND SCREAMS --
                         
                         
          INT. BUICK - PRE-DAWN
                         
          THROUGH THE MOSAIC OF THE SHATTERED REAR VIEW MIRROR, WE SEE
          THE CREATURE GRAB ALICE -- HER SCREAMS BECOME HER FATHER'S:
                         
                          LOUIS
           -- ALICE, NO!!!!! NO!!!!!!!
                         
          Louis tries to get out of the car -- but it's painful -- and
          his door is JAMMED SHUT -- he goes for the passenger door --
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN
                         
          -- when Louis finally gets out -- he runs from his car --
          stumbling drunk and bleeding -- SCREAMING, SHREDDING HIS
          VOCAL CHORDS --
                         
                          LOUIS
           ALICE!!!
                         
          But all that's there is her bike -- and before he can even
          get that far, Louis FALLS HARD onto the pavement, crying, a
          drunken, horrified, shocked, battered MESS. In a WIDE SHOT,
          LOUIS is in the middle of the street, Alice's fallen bike on
          the sidewalk.
                         
                         
          EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
                         
          In the great distance, the WATER TOWER. We BOOM DOWN in a
          MASSIVE WIDE SHOT of a field at night. Then a LONG LENS SHOT
          of SIX SOLDIERS standing in the field. But ONE stands out
          front, wearing a FLAME THROWER. And suddenly the quiet is
          broken by the ROAR OF FLAME. A WIDE, WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT as
          the flames ARC in the tall, dry grass. Over the radio:
                         
                          VOICE
           Firelight is 0500 hours. Operation
           Walking Distance is in effect. T-

           Evacuation is T-minus four hours.
           78.
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - EARLY MORNING
                         
          The distant factory, the even more distant mountains, and an
          ominous PLUME OF SMOKE -- a far-off SIREN is HEARD. Then:
                         
           JOE (V.O.)
           Why are you not reacting?
                         
                         
          INT. OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI - MORNING
                         
          Joe stands at the counter with Charles, who is in a bad mood.
                         
                          JOE
                          (EMPHATIC WHISPER)
           That thing went through my wall.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I told you not to pick it up in the
           first place.
                         
                          JOE
           What are you so angry about? That
           I'm not going to let you blow up my
           train?
                         
                          CHARLES
           That's part of it! Juts a part!
                         
          Donny's returned with a DEVELOPED FILM ENVELOPE. A red "RUSH"
          stamp on it. He gives Charles his change:
                         
                          DONNY
           Tall your sister Donny from Olsen's
           broke up with Karen, that shit
           ended a week ago.
                         
          Charles heads off -- Joe follows.
                         
                         
          EXT. OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI - DAY
                         
          As Charles rides off with the film, Joe follows -- and we
          BOOM UP along the WATER TOWER as they go --
                         
                          JOE
           What's your problem?
                         
                          CHARLES
           My whole movie's a disaster `cause
           of you!
                         
                          JOE
           I know, my dad's being a turkey.
           79.
                         
                         
                          CHARLES
           Whatever.
                         
                          JOE
           We're still gonna finish your
           movie!
                         
                          CHARLES
           It's not about the movie.
                         
                          JOE
           What are you talking about? Of
           course it is.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Just forget it.
                         
                          JOE
           Why?
                         
                          CHARLES
           There's nothing wrong--
                         
          As we CONTINUE BOOMING UP, we arrive at the top of the WATER
          TOWER, where THE CUBE HAS AFFIXED ITSELF TO THE SIDE --
          unseen from the street. In the distance, THE THREATENING FIRE
          SMOKE LOOMS --
                         
                         
          EXT. CHARLES' HOUSE - DAY
                         
          As Joe and Charles ride their bikes up to his house:
                         
                          JOE
           I'll get the camera back, I know
           where my dad put it -- We can still
           make the festival.
                         
                          CHARLES
           It's not about the movie.
                         
                          JOE
           Then what is it about?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Jesus, you don't even get it do
           you? It's obvious.
                         
                          JOE
           What's obvious?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Gawd, you're a dumb ass.
           80.
                         
                         
          Frustrated beyond belief, Charles goes inside. Joe follows.
                         
                         
          INT. CHARLES' ROOM - DAY
                         
          Charles threads the film into the projector.
                         
                          CHARLES
           That night of the crash, you
           started getting all weird.
                         
                          JOE
           -- what?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Like Mr. Attitude all of a sudden.
                         
                          JOE
           Your movie was over! That's what
           you said! You were upset. I gave
           you a camera! I helped you!
                         
                          CHARLES
           Don't pretend like you did it for
           me! You didn't do it for me and you
           know it!
                         
                          JOE
           What's your problem?
                         
          Charles ROLLS THE FILM, DIMS THE LIGHTS --
                         
                          CHARLES
           It was never about me! It was
           always about Alice!
                         
          And suddenly on the poster board pinned to the closet, there
          she is: ALICE, from the night of the train crash. The scene
          plays as they filmed it:
                         
           MRS. HATHAWAY
           John. I don't like it. This case.
           These murders.
                         
                          DETECTIVE HATHAWAY
           What am I supposed to do, go to
           Michigan with you?
                         
          THE FILMED SCENE CONTINUES as Joe and Charles argue:
                         
                          JOE
           Well, you're the one who wanted the
           wife in the movie!
           81.
                         
                         
                          CHARLES
           Not so you could fall in love with
           her!
                         
          Joe's mind spins -- how does he respond to this?!
                         
                          JOE
           What do you even care what I think
           about Alice?!
                         
                          CHARLES
           Because I like her! That's why!
           That's why I asked her in the first
           place! So I could get to know her,
           not YOU!
                         
                          JOE
           -- wait, you like Alice Dainard?
                         
                          CHARLES
           You're such an idiot.
                         
                          JOE
           (from Charles' movie)
           Guys, look out!
                         
          They watch for a moment as the TRAIN CRASH HAPPENS -- but
          it's SO SUDDEN, SO FAST, the camera picks up almost nothing.
          Within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the
          SETTLING DEBRIS. Charles moves forward, so the film is now
          partially BEING PROJECTED ON HIM.
                         
                          CHARLES
           SHIT! Look at all that smoke! We
           can't use any of this. And you
           won't even let me blow up your
           train. Everything's bogus.
                         
                          JOE
           We can make another train and blow
           that one up.
                         
          Joe moves forward. Part of the film PROJECTED ON HIM, too.
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           I do like her. Sorry about that.
                         
                          CJAR
           Shut up. It's okay.
                          (BEAT)
           That's not even what bothers me.
           (beat, finally, sad)
           It's that she likes you too. That
           really bothers me. I dunno...
           82.
                         
                         
          But Joe has seen something -- on the screen -- SOTTO:
                         
                          JOE
           ... Charles...
                         
                          CHARLES
           I know it's stupid. What would she
           ever like me? I haven't leaned out
           yet, which the doctor says is gonna
                          HAP--
                         
          But Joe has slapped Charles' arm, his eyes locked to the
          screen -- Charles looks too -- AND NOW WE SEE IT: through the
          BROKEN CAMERA LENS -- SOMETHING MOVES -- SOMETHING BIG --
          FROM THE TRAIN CAR, THROUGH THE WRECKAGE -- what the hell is
          it? TOO DAMN BIG -- MOSTLY OUT OF FRAME, ITS SHAPE AND FLESH
          TOO BIZARRE -- we only see the LEGS as it clears frame --
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           -- Joe, what the hell--?!
                         
          PUSH IN ON THEIR FACES AS THEY SEE THE ALIEN THEY'VE CAPTURED
          ON FILM -- then from outside: AN AIR RAID SIREN RAMPS,
          WHINING THROUGH THE TOWN. The boys look at each other --
          afraid. QUICK CLOSE-UPS as they REWIND THE FILM AND RIP IT
          OUT AND TAKE THE CANNISTER:
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
                         
          WIDE SHOT of the neighborhood -- in the distance: MILITARY
          TRUCKS, JEEPS AND BUSES drive. NEIGHBORS coming from their
          homes in the MID-GROUND: confusion and talk, more VEHICLES.
          Finally, as we BOOM DOWN, RACK TO JOE AND CHARLES, trying to
          make sense of this -- Joe calls to a passing adult, MR.
                         HARKIN:
                         
                          JOE
           Mr. Harkin. What's going on?
                         
           MR. HARKIN
           Evacuation! The fire!
                         
          Mr. Harkin POINTS -- Joe turns to look -- we PAN: THE DISTANT
          SMOKE, BIG AND LOOMING.
                         
          VARIOUS SHOTS of MILITARY busses STOPPING -- SOLDIERS
          ORDERING AND ASSISTING PEOPLE ONTO VEHICLES -- carrying all
          the belongings they can. Others quickly LOAD UP CARS,
          strapping belongings to the roof. Over all this:
           83.

          Other people in a panic, running to find others who are lost.
          A LITTLE GIRL CRIES amid the madness.

          Joe and Charles get on, frightened and uncomfortable. They
          sit. Outside: the madness of the evac -- they scan the crowd.
                         
                          JOE CHARLES
          You see your family anywhere? -- no, you see your dad?

          EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - DAY
                         
          The evacuation BUSES drive through Main Street -- passing
          soldiers who are MOVING IN THE RED CARGO TRUCKS that we may
          recognize from the train crash site: THE CONTENTS FROM THE
          TRAIN ARE BEING MOVED INTO THE CENTER OF TOWN.

          The buses drive past the guard gate into the base -- into the
          huge HANGAR that we were in earlier. Those who drove
          themselves PARK THEIR CARS -- and are ushered to the hangar.
          DONNY steps out of his 1972 PONTIAC CATALINA, carrying a
          duffel. RACK FOCUS to see we're IN THE BUS with Joe, who has
          seen Donny -- and they drive INSIDE THE HANGAR --
                         
                         
          INT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - DAY
                         
          ARMED Air Force and National Guard SOLDIERS direct MASSES OF
          PEOPLE, carrying luggage and belongings. Move with Joe and
          Charles, who scan for familiar faces -- suddenly Charles'
          MOTHER IS THERE -- embraces Charles:
           84.
                         
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           Charles, Charles -- sweetheart, are
           you okay? I went back to the house
           and you were gone.
                         
                          CHARLES
           They made us get on the bus.
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           Hi, Joe.
                         
                          JOE
           Hi.
                          (TO CHARLES)
           I'm gonna find my dad.
                         
                          CHARLES
           You gonna tell him about that
           thing?
                         
                          JOE
           Yeah.
                         
                          CHARLES' MOTHER
           Come back if you can't find him.
                         
          He heads off. ORDERS are being BARKED -- RESIDENTS can be
          heard, complaining and arguing. Walkie SQUAWKS and PA
          ANNOUNCEMENTS as SOLDIERS check their wrist bands. Joe passes
          an ARGUING MAN and SOLDIER:
                         
           ARGUING MAN ARGUING SOLDIER
          -- I need to go back to my -- sir, the town is sealed
          house, I left some medication off -- no one is allowed back
          that my wife needs-- -- you can talk to the nurses
          -- no, we can't get it here -- the town must stay
          anywhere else, I need to go empty until we've been given
          back-- the all-clear--
                         
          BOOM UP TO REVEAL the EVAC CENTER. A THOUSAND PEOPLE so far.

          LOUIS lies in a cot in the TRIAGE UNIT, fifty beds
          transferred from the hospital. Louis stares off, head
          bandaged, eyes open, MUTTERING TO HIMSELF, like a man as
          tired, hung over, injured and in shock as he is.
                         
          Find Joe, who is looking everywhere for his dad -- he finally
          sees Louis and hurries to him.
           85.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           Mr. Dainard, it's Joe Lamb. I know
           you don't like me sir, and I'm
           sorry about that-- but I'm looking
           for my dad--
                         
          And Louis GRABS HIS SHIRT and pulls him close. In a voice
          desperate and heartsick, he says:
                         
                          LOUIS
           It took her.
                         
                          JOE
           (long beat, sotto)
           ... what?
                         
                          LOUIS
           It took her. I saw it. It was...
           something... so... big, like
           nothing -- it was-- and no one...
           no one believes me...
                          (CRYING)
           ... no one believes me-- they just
           keep giving me pills. It took
           her... Joe, it took Alice... no one
           believes me.
                         
          Joe's mind is on fire as he absorbs this -- HE WHISPERS:
                         
                          JOE
           ... I believe you.
                         
          And Louis looks at him with hope --
                         
           JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           It took Alice.
                         
          CUT TO JOE WITH HIS FRIENDS, assembled around a set of cots.

                          JOE (CONT'D)

                          PRESTON
           Wait a minute -- first of all, I
           want to live. Okay?

          Jen suddenly closes her magazine, stares at him suspiciously.

          the tarmac are a few MILITARY VEHICLES, a handful of airmen.

          fucking scared; at least he's holding a rifle. He peels
          around a corner -- through a window, the tarmac: GUARDS,
          VEHICLES. Jack's eyes shift -- he spots an AIRCRAFT FUEL

                          JOE
           Yes. Thank you very much. Do you
           have a tire iron?

          A SHOT of the boys CLIMBING A FENCE.
                         
          They move fast across the alley, to a TRAILER locked with A
          PADLOCK -- the DUNGEON.

          Joe tries PRYING the locks off with the tire iron -- it
          doesn't budge.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Joe, let me try -- let me try.
                         
          Joe hands the tire iron to Charles -- he tries -- nothing.
                         
          As Martin grabs the tire iron:
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           Joe, this is impossible, man.
                         
          Martin breaks off the LATCH -- BAM!

           --I loosened it for you.
                         
          Now we CUT TO DARKNESS -- we're INSIDE THE DUNGEON as it
          opens -- the boys look DIRECTLY AT US -- their faces say it
          all: THE MOTHER LODE.

           desperate to reconstitute his ship
           since it crashed here in `58, but
           instead of giving him the help he
           needs, we've held him as a
           prisoner. He's been restrained and
           experimented upon -- Through pain
           and lack of compassion, we have
           taught him to hate us all. We've

          Woodward offers what looks like RAW MEAT to the motionless,
          sitting CREATURE. All the boys watch quietly -- then,

           DR. WOODWARD (V.O.)
           I told them I knew these things
           because he made contact with me.
           That he makes a psychic connection
           by touch. The moment we made
           contact, I understood him and he,
           me. What I know is that if we don't
           change this and start helping him,

           97.
                         
                         
          PAN as Nelec moves back -- we PUSH IN on OVERMYER, who sits
          near the front, putting on his DARK GLOVES. Nelec sits, which
          takes us to a shot towards the back of the bus -- another
          Airman, HERNANDEZ, 40, sits too. PUSH PAST THEM toward our
          four BOYS, sitting cuffed and seat-belted behind the dirty,
          wired SAFETY GLASS, all looking toward us, terrified.
                         
                          CHARLES
           ... what... what's gonna happen?
                         
                          CARY
           I think we're gonna die.
                         
                          MARTIN
           No. They'd never do that.
                         
                          JOE
           -- guys-- I forced you to come with
           me... I'm... I'm so sorry.
           (looks to Charles)
           I'm so sorry...
                         
                          CARY
           I think they're gonna kill us.
                         
                          CHARLES
                          (UNCONVINCING)
           Joe. They're not gonna kill us. You
           know why?
                         
          Joe is suddenly hopeful:
                         
                          JOE
           ... why--?
                         
          But just as he's spoken, a SHAPE FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND HIM
          SLAMS HARD INTO THE BUS, SPIDER-WEBBING THE BULLETPROOF
          GLASS! The ENTIRE BUS IS ROCKED, Charles SCREAMS, hurt --
                         
          At the front of the bus, NELEC FALLS -- HITS A BENCH, THEN
          CRASHES INTO THE SIDE WINDOW --
                         
                         
          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
                         
          The bus was hit SO HARD it rides for a moment ONLY ON ITS
          RIGHT TIRES --
                         
                         
          INT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT
                         
          The MILITARY DRIVER struggles with the wheel --
           98.
                         
                         
                          DRIVER
           -- HOLD ON. HOLD ON--!!!
                         
                          CHARLES
           Was that the thing from the train?!
                         
                         
          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
                         
          The bus SLAMS BACK onto the road, LOUD -- A TIRE BLOWS! We
          MOVE AROUND THE BUS -- JUST MISSING SEEING THE CREATURE --
                         
                         
          INT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT
                         
          The kids panic as the HOBBLED BUS STILL DRIVES --
                         
                          CHARLES
           Was that it?! Oh my God!!!
                         
                          MARTIN
           I can't see anything -- do you see
           anything?
                         
                          JIE
           -- not yet --!
                         
                          DRIVER
           -- Sir, I gotta pull over!
                         
                         
          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
                         
          HIGH OVERHEAD: the bus comes to a sudden SCREECHING stop.
                         
                         
          INT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT
                         
          Charles looks forward --
                         
                          CHARLES
           Oh my God, guys --
                         
          Joe turns to see NELEC LOADING A RIFLE, straining to see out
          a driver's side window. Mayhem:
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           What's that gun --?
                         
          Cary, behind him, actually answers him:
           99.
                         
                         
                          CARY CHARLES
          Sako Bolt Action, 30-06
          (pronounced: thirty-aut-six) -- okay okay okay, I get it --
          Leathwood Art Scope--
                         
          Hernandez makes a radio call, Overmyer straining to see out
          the windows as Nelec locks and loads the unique ammo and
          moves to a driver's side window, tries to see --
                         
                          HERNANDEZ OVERMYER
          -- repeat, contact with
          precious cargo, thirty clicks -- sir, I do not have visual -
          from center of town, - Driver, can you see
          currently headed for Base anything?
                         FORTRESS --
                         
                          HERNANDEZ DRIVER
          -- send support immediately! No sir, nothing!
                         
          Despite his handcuffs, Charles desperately tries to unlatch
          his seatbelt with his shaking hands -- Cary sees this:
                         
                          CARY
           Charles, what are you doing?
                         
                          CHARLES
           I don't feel good about this --
                         
          PUSH IN on Cary, to CLOSEUP, looking PAST CAMERA, TERRIFIED --
                         
                          CARY
           -- oh God -- guys --
                         
          THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM THE DARK
          LIKE A GHOST THROUGH BLACK VELVET -- HIT BY THE HEADLIGHTS,
          IT ROARS AT SUCH A PITCH AND VOLUME THAT THE WINDSHIELD
          SPIDERS! It's out of the light and gone again -- PUSH IN ON
          NELEC -- newly terrified, he hands his TRACKING RIFLE to
                         OVERMYER:
                         
                          NELEC
           Here. Tag it.
                         
          Overmyer is stunned for a moment, but hides it well:
                         
                          OVERMYER
           Yessir.
                         
                          NELEC
           Open the door.
                         
          Reluctant as hell, for a tense beat, the Driver pulls the
          controls: the door HISSES LOUDLY as it opens.
           100.
                         
                         
          In the back, the boys are all frozen for a moment, watching.
                         
          Overmyer moves for the door. Five feet away from the door, he
          stops, turns back to Nelec:
                         
                          OVERMYER
           Is there anywhere in particul--
                         
          KKKKRRRRRASSHHH!!!! THE THING REACHES IN -- SHATTERS THE DOOR
          -- the Driver SCREAMS -- the thing GRABS OVERMYER, who DROPS
          THE RIFLE -- IT FIRES -- the projectile HITS THE SAFETY GLASS
          IN FRONT OF THE BOYS AS OVERMYER, GRABBED, BLOOD IN HIS
          MOUTH, TRIES TO HOLD ONTO THE SEATS, REACHING FOR NELEC, WHO
          DOES NOTHING -- OVERMYER IS VIOLENTLY YANKED OUT OF THE BUS --
          Joe IN SHOCK -- Behind him, Martin VOMITS.
                         
                          NELEC
           GET US OUT OF HERE, NOW! NOW!!!
                          (TO HERNANDEZ)
           What kind of firepower do we have?
                         
          CHARLES SCRAMBLES to unlatch his seatbelt --
                         
                          JOE
           Charles! Maybe you should wait!
                         
                          CHARLES
           FOR WHAT?! ANOTHER MONSTER?!?!
                         
          BAAAM!!! The bus is SLAMMED SO HARD --
                         
                         
          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
                         
          The BUS IS PUSHED TWENTY FEET FROM SOMETHING ON THE OTHER
          SIDE -- THEN IT TIPS OVER AND CRASHES TO THE GROUND:
                         
                         
          INT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT
                         
          Windows SHATTER -- Charles and Cary -- seatbelts removed --
          LAND ON JOE AND MARTIN! The THREE SOLDIERS hit the window-
          floor painfully -- Hernandez so hard he's INSTANTLY
          UNCONSCIOUS! THE BUS IS NOW MOTIONLESS ON ITS SIDE, OPEN DOOR
          UP. Nelec rises. Scared, but pissed.
                         
          The REAR WHEELS of the bus SCREAM in rotation -- we
          COUNTERMOVE with the creature as it COMES AROUND the other
          side, CLIMBS onto the exposed side -- METAL AND WINDOW
                         CRUNCHES --
                         
          The boys gather their wits -- LIGHTS FLASHING HAUNTINGLY --
           101.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           -- you guys okay?!
                         
                          CHARLES
           -- I wanna go home so bad --
                         
          Joe moves to the locked bulletproof glass door -- tries the
          handle -- but it's never gonna open.
                         
          On the OTHER side of the glass, Nelec rights himself,
          momentarily disoriented -- breathing heavily, he moves away
          from the bus door to the locked glass separating him from the
          kids; he tries the handle, but it won't open for him either.
                         
          And there is Joe and Nelec, face-to-face -- Joe seeing the
          fear in Nelec's eyes -- his understanding that this is his
          fate. Somehow Nelec takes this moment to look into Joe's face
          -- to silently -- in a look -- repent. Instantly, Joe knows
          he's about to watch this man's life end.
                         
          SMASH! Nelec turns -- the creature is BUSTING the bus door --
          SMASHING AT IT -- to make it BIGGER. So it can get inside.
          The Driver's LEG IS CAUGHT -- he's trying to get out, but
          cannot -- is PANICKING -- as SSSSTAB!!! The creature KILLS
          HIM INSTANTLY and SMASH as again it tries to WIDEN the door.
          Nelec WINCES -- the only conscious man on this side of the
          glass; the boys COWER on their side, with each monstrous hit,
          all their eyes on Nelec -- except Joe, who only wants to get
          to Alice. He sees the SHATTERED BULLETPROOF WINDOW -- above
          them, on what has become the "roof" of the bus.
                         
                          JOE
           Up there, there's broken glass --
                         
                          MARTIN
           -- here, use me, I'm strong!
                         
                          JOE
           Lemme get on your shoulders!
                         
                          CHARLES
           I'm strong!
                         
          The boys struggle to get Joe onto Martin's shoulders as, on
          the other side of the glass, Nelec scrambles for Hernandez's
          fallen SEMI-AUTO RIFLE. He grabs it and scampers back to the
          glass as SMASH!!! Pieces of metal and glass BURST like ice
          chips as the creature violently WIDENS the bus door opening--
                         
          On Charles' shoulders, Joe can reach the shattered-but-thick
          window -- which he must HIT -- BREAK OPEN to get out --
          essentially exactly what the creature is doing, in reverse.
                         
          Using both fists, Joe POUNDS the window. No give.
           102.
                         
                         
                          MARTIN CARY
          Harder! Come on, you PUSSY!!!
                         
          With all his might, Joe hits the window again -- the
          SLIGHTEST sound of glass adjusting -- meanwhile, SLAM!!! The
          creature BUSTING the bus door -- PRYING it wider like a
          sardine can -- NELEC SITS AGAINST THE GLASS AND OPENS FIRE,
          FUTILELY, ON THE CREATURE. He makes a CALL on his walkie:
                         
                          NELEC
           This is Nelec -- use the big guns.
           Whatever happens to me, you take it
           down, you kill him --
                         
          -- and he drops the walkie and FIRES AGAIN -- the LOUD
          GUNFIRE BARELY AUDIBLE behind the glass with the boys as Joe
          hits the glass again -- BAM -- a CRINKLING of glass --
                         
                          CHARLES
           You can do it!
                         
          Joe hits again -- so does the creature -- as Nelec RUNS OUT
          OF AMMO. That was never really hope anyway. Joe hits again
          and CRASH! The window SHATTERS! Glass chunks RAIN DOWN on the
          boys -- all covering their face -- Cary seeing the CREATURE
          STARTING TO ENTER THE BUS --
                         
                          CARY
           Go! Joe, move!!!
                         
          With all the boys helping, Joe pulls himself up -- outside
          the bus, Joe peeks out -- the fucking creature -- its back to
          Joe -- just fifteen feet away, focused on the door -- and Joe
          strains to climb out here, onto the top-side of the bus.
                         
          And as the boys climb out, the creature climbs in -- first
          Joe, then Charles (AD LIB DIALOGUE WITH CARY AND MARTIN: "You
          gotta lose some weight --" "I know!!!"), Then Cary, and
          Martin last -- they all jump down to the dirt -- they hear
          SCREAMS and turn back for a moment --
                         
          Inside the bus, Nelec watches as the creature ENTERS THE
          TIGHT-FITTING BUS, SMASHING BENCHES, MAKING ITS WAY
          TERRIFYINGLY DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD HIM. And as the creature
          descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge --
          Nelec says, eerily quietly, terrified:
                         
                          NELEC
           -- it was my turn once... to find
           you. Now... it's your t--
           103.
                         
                         
          Before he can finish, the creature fucking ATTACKS -- and it
          would be horrible and brutal, if the BLOOD DIDN'T SPRAY UPON
          THE BULLETPROOF GLASS -- WHICH OUR CAMERA IS SAFELY BEHIND --
          OBSCURING THE NIGHTMARISH VIEW.
                         
          In the field, a distance away, the boys watch the bus SHUDDER
          and SHAKE. Then... silence. They see the creature burst out
          of the bus -- then RUN OFF -- fast and stealthy, away from
          them in the overgrown grass, like a native hunter. Which, of
          course, is partly what it is. They're sort of stunned.
                         
                          CHARLES

          INT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - NIGHT
                         
          Louis stares off, lost. Two AIR FORCE SOLDIERS arrive:
                         
                          SOLDIER
           You need to come with us, we have
           some questions for you --
                         
                          LOUIS
           -- what, is she... Is she dead--?
                         
                          SOLDIER TWO
           Just come with us.
                         
          Standing is hard for heartsick Louis, his legs so hurt --
          suddenly JACK IS THERE, acting the role of Air Force:
                         
                          JACK
           Hey fellas, I've got orders from
           Colonel Nelec to personally
           transport this man to base.
                         
                          SOLDIER
           He's all yours, Staff Sergeant.
                         
          As the two Soldiers head off, Jack wraps Louis' arm over his
          shoulders, heads off in the other direction, as Louis looks
          him over, confused:
                         
                          LOUIS
           Where're we going--?
                         
                          JACK
           -- to find our kids.
                         
          On LOUIS' FACE -- a surprised glimmer of HOPE --
           104.
                         
                         
          EXT. TRANSPORT BUS - NIGHT
                         
          Moments later, TIGHT on a POCKET -- Joe pulls out his
          MOTHER'S NECKLACE. WIDEN to see that he's taken the necklace
          from Overmyer's dead body. Cary holds up his backpack.

          They turn: a car comes, fast -- PUSH IN ON JOE who studies
          the oncoming car, as behind him:
                         
                          MARTIN
           They're coming, man! I think we

           No--!!! No, look!
                         
          The car ARRIVES: It's DONNY. He gets out of his car, wild-
          and red-eyed, incredibly happy to see them:
                         
                          DONNY
           Ho ho!!! You dorks are alive! I
           didn't know...!

           You want me to drive?
                         
          Donny looks at Joe, like it hurts to think.

          SUDDENLY, BOOM!!! A DEAFENING, CONCUSSIVE GUNBLAST! They're
          LIT UP by what they see ahead: in the oncoming cross-street,
          TANKS -- TWO OF THEM -- AND A ROCKET-LAUNCHING VEHICLE FIRE
          AGAIN AND AGAIN AT SOMETHING WE CAN'T YET SEE! The boys COVER
          THEIR EARS -- Donny awakens, but only for a moment --
                         
                          CHARLES
           TURN THE CAR AROUND!
                         
          Joe quickly turns left into a driveway -- but we PUSH IN
          TIGHT ON HIM -- from the direction they just came are MORE
          TANKS AND MILITARY VEHICLES -- Joe's eyes go wide -- they're
          stuck. GUNFIRE CONTINUES!

           Drugs are so bad!
                         
          Joe and the boys get out of the car fast and RUN across the
          street, zig-zagging between the enormous MILITARY VEHICLES --
           106.

           Sir, the weapons are misfiring!

          Soldier hurries off.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT
                         
          Joe in the lead - they turn and look back -- a massive shot
          of the neighborhood under fire -- houses getting BLOWN TO
          SHIT in collateral damage.
                         
          An EXPLOSION HITS TOO CLOSE -- the boys SCREAM as they run
          BETWEEN HOUSES -- and WE TRACK WITH THEM -- four boys racing
          through a neighborhood under siege -- power GOES OUT -- and
          some explosions are much closer than others -- another BIG
          HIT and they go to a back door of a house -- and go inside --
                         
                         
          INT. NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          -- they run in for cover -- they're silhouetted in this dark
          space by the EXPLOSION LIGHT emanating from the windows.
          They're all out of breath in a strange KITCHEN --
                         
                          CARY
           You guys see those explosions? They

           Kathy? Oh, Kathy's cool.
                         
          Another CRAZY LOUD AND BRIGHT EXPLOSION -- the light fixtures
          sway. Charles grabs a coke on the counter.
                         
           MARTIN (CONT'D) CHARLES
          Charles-- that's not yours-- -- what?! I'm thirsty and I'm
           in a war zone!
                         
          Another fucking LOUD BLAST -- sound of GLASS BREAKING -- and
          the creature ROARING --
           107.
                         
                         
          And there it is, in silhouette, moving past the bay window --
          Joe realizes: where the creature is, so are the blasts:
                         
                          JOE
           Come on, guys, let's go. Come on!

           To the cemetery--
                         
          But as they get to the living room a HUGE EXPLOSION BLOWS OUT
          A WALL! They all go down -- but Martin is in agony all of a
          sudden -- his leg RIPPED by concrete. If there's good news
          here, the creature has left this area -- the explosions
          getting further away. But there's blood and Martin is in real
          pain.
                         
                          MARTIN

          Charles wants the tie around the curtains, still hanging on
          the wall that now has a HOLE in it; MILITARY VEHICLES can be
          seen driving past outside. Joe hands Charles the thick fabric
          tie -- which Charles fashion into a tourniquet, wraps it
          around Martin's leg, tight --
                         
                          JOE

                          JOE
           We need to get inside.
                         
                          CARY
           For what? What's in these windows?
                         
                          JOE
           Cary, help me.
                         
                          CARY
           It's dirt. Why is there dirt in
           these windows?
                         
                          JOE
           Help me, on three.
                         
                          JOE/CARY
           One, two, three.... One, two,
           three.... One, two threee.
                         
          The two begin KICKING the door together -- on three -- one --
          two -- CRASH! Again and again, until finally the door KICKS
          OPEN -- and they almost FALL INSIDE -- and thank goodness
          they didn't -- because -- and now we're looking STRAIGHT DOWN
          FROM INSIDE THE SHED -- the entire floor of the shed has been
          DUG OUT -- DROPPING FORTY FEET STRAIGHT DOWN, dirt PILED,
          caked along the sides of the structure. The boys catch their
          breath.
                         
                          CARY
           Whoa. This is scary.
                         
                          JOE
           You got any sparklers in there?
                         
                          CARY
           Are you kidding me?
                         
          Cary opens his backpack, whips out a Fourth of July SPARKLER.
          LIGHTS it with a lighter and DROPS IT IN. The thing falls far
          enough to tell them it's too far to jump.
           110.
                         
                         
          But burning on the dirt floor of the nearly-dug hole, it
          lights up a TUNNEL at the bottom.
                         
                          JOE
           -- Alice is down there.
                         
                         
          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
                         
          A JEEP roars past.
                         
                         
          INT. JEEP - NIGHT
                         
          Jack drives fast. Louis sits beside him. It's awkward. But
          not angry. Finally, vulnerable, scared and sad:
                         
                          LOUIS
           I came to your house that day. To
           tell you that I never meant to hurt
           anyone. Swear to God.
           (beat, respectful tears)
           I'm sorry, Jack. About what
           happened to your wife.
                         
          Jack looks at him for a moment, then back to the road. A
          beat. Finally:
                         
                          JACK
           ... It was an accident. It was an
           accident.
                         
          Jack glances at him. A small nod of forgiveness and
          gratitude. Louis wants to cry again, but just accepts it.
                         
                         
          INT. SHED - NIGHT
                         
          Joe begins CLIMBING DOWN the ROPE.
                         
                         
          INT. CEMETERY SHED HOLE - NIGHT
                         
          Joe lands on the bottom. Dark as hell -- looks up -- at Cary
          climbing down into the hole -- the barn roof looming above
          him. Now Cry lands too. There are THREE POSSIBLE WAYS TO GO.
          Joe's mind races about which way to go.
                         
                          CARY
           Joe, I don't understand--
                         
          We HEAR a DISTANT RUMBLING -- like something far off, but
          MECHANICAL. Then:
           111.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           Shhh. This way.
                         
          They begin their walk into the dirt tunnel, a TALL OVAL
          TUNNEL, TWENTY FEET TALL --
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #1 (W/FURNIURE) - NIGHT
                         
          We're SO FAR AWAY, that the screen is mostly black, with a
          small speck of SPARKLY LIGHT.
                         
          They come to an area LITTERED WITH THE STUFF OF A LIVING
          ROOM. They look up: ANOTHER HOLE LEADING DOWN, DUG STRAIGHT
          THROUGH A HOUSE. They continue, coming to an INTERSECTION --
          where a NEW TUNNEL branches off.
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
                         
          There's DIM LIGHT from up ahead, where the tunnel BENDS. The
          RUMBLING/MECHANICAL SOUND LOUDER now. Joe and Cary slowly
          move forward -- seeing something off-camera that scares and
          amazes them all at once.
                         
          IT'S A HUNDRED-FOOT DIAMETER, FORTY-FOOT TALL UNDERGROUND
          SPACE, FILLED WITH A MECHANICAL MARVEL -- A MASSIVE, BIZARRE
          CONTRAPTION COMBINING THOUSANDS OF MECHANICAL PIECES, FROM
          THE MISSING MICROWAVES, CAR ENGINES, ANTENNAS, AND COUNTLESS
          OTHER DEVICES -- WIRES AND CABLES HANG AND CONNECT
          EVERYWHERE, ALL LEADING TO THE DIRT CEILING, HEADING UP, TO
          SOMEWHERE ABOVE GROUND. THE THICK-WITH-FUMES SPACE CHUGS AND
          HUMS WITH A SLOWLY INCREASING PITCH, AS IT IT'S WARMING UP,
          GETTING READY TO FINALLY, ACTUALLY WORK.
                         
          They cross to the other side. Cary bumps into a HANGING
          SHERIFF PRUITT. Cary is about to scream, but Joe puts a hand
          on his mouth and leads him away from Pruitt.
                         
                          CARY
           It's Sheriff Pruitt.
                         
                          JOE
           I know. Cary look.
                         
          Makeshift HANGING BULBS provide some light; a number of other
          TUNNELS are visible from here, too. Joe and Cary look at the
          space in disbelief.
                         
                          CARY
           What is this?
                         
                          JOE
           We're under the water tower.
           112.
                         
                         
          Then Joe sees something that makes him grab at Cary's shirt.
          Cary looks: THROUGH THE MASS OF METAL AND MACHINERY AND
          DANGLING CABLES, AT THE OTHER END OF THIS UNDERGROUND
          EXPERIMENT, IS THE CREATURE. HUNCHED OVER. BACK TO THE BOYS.
          AND IT'S SAVAGELY EATING SOMETHING. IT MOVES A BIT: WE SEE
          IT'S A HUMAN LEG. Joe and Cary would SCREAM if they didn't
          need to stay quiet. In a panicked WHISPER:
                         
                          CARY
           It's eating a person.
                         
          Joe moves away from Cary to get a better view of the other
          side of the machinery -- and there he sees, in an INSET
          section of the rock-wall, THREE HUMAN BODIES, HANGING
          LIFELESS FROM THEIR FEET, WRAPPED IN SOME KIND OF THIN
          SHELLAC. TIGHT ON JOE as he sees, among them, ALICE. His
          heart POUNDS, his resolve quadruples. Cary sees her too --
                         
                          JOE
           She's here. We're going to use your
           firecrackers.
                         
                          CARY
           I don't think it's going to hurt
           it, Joe.
                         
                          JOE
           There are other tunnels.
                         
                          CARY
           So?
                         
                          JOE
           I need you to make noise. Lots of
           it, right here, in two minutes.
           Make it loud and make it last--
           gimme some sparklers.
                         
                          CARY
           (goes through his bag)
           -- why-- what are you gonna do--?
                         
                          JOE
           (takes SPARKLERS and a
           LIGHTER from Cary)
           Make sure you're gone by the time
           it blows: you can't be here, you
           gotta run.
                         
                          CARY
           Where are you going?
           113.
                         
                         
          But Joe's already gone. Stay with Cary, who opens his
          backpack, starts pulling out his amazing array of EXPLOSIVES,
          glancing up to make sure he's out of the creature's view --
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #3 - NIGHT
                         
          MOVE FAST with Joe as he races, a LIT SPARKLER giving him his
          light -- the MECHANICAL RUMBLING all but gone now. Joe runs,
          looking for another way into the creature's massive space --
          he finally finds another INTERSECTION -- he turns into it --
          he disappears down the tunnel --
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
                         
          Cary's made a long, insane pile of FIRECRACKERS -- he uses an
          OPEN M-80 and begins laying a SQUIGGLY, LONG LINE OF GUN
          POWDER back, away from the firecrackers -- away from the
          entrance to the creature's CONTRAPTION space.
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT
                         
          Joe races down the dirt tunnel, the SOUND OF THE MECHANICAL
          RUMBLING -- and its INCREASING PITCH -- getting LOUDER. The
          SPARKLER DIES as LIGHT BEGINS TO REVEAL JOE, who slows --
          peers around the dirt tunnel bend -- he is now on the OTHER
          SIDE of the space. He sees the creature -- then looks across
          to the lifeless body of Alice. His heart sinks.
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
                         
          Cary's done laying out the charges -- he pulls out his
          lighter -- FFFT! FFFT! The damn thing won't light --
                         
                          CARY
           -- come on-- damnit!
                         
          FFT! FFT! No go -- he keeps trying.
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT
                         
          Joe watches as the creature FINISHES WITH ITS MEAL AND HEADS
          FOR THE OTHER HANGING BODIES -- PUSH IN ON JOE, DESPERATE --
                         
                          JOE
           -- Cary, come on, come on--
           114.
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
                         
          Cary frantically trying the lighter -- FFT! FFT! FFT!
                         
                          CARY
           -- damnit!!!
                         
          He looks up -- watches the creature GRAB AND PULL ALICE'S
          LIFELESS BODY DOWN FROM HER HANGING POSITION -- it moves with
          her to where he was eating the teacher -- Cary SHAKES THE
          LIGHTER, STARTING TO CRY AND HE FLICKS IT AND FFFFFTH!!! IT
          LIGHTS! HE TOUCHES IT ON THE GUN POWDER AND RUNS OFF --
                         
                         
          INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT
                         
          The creature PULLS AWAY the fibrous covering over Alice --
          its TENTACLES SLITHER OUT.
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT
                         
          Watching this is horror, Joe's about to run in just as
          BABABABABABABABAM!!! The creature JERKS UP from its almost-
          meal of Alice, looks toward the EXPLOSIVE SOUNDS, then LEAVES
          HER, quickly moving for the tunnel --
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT
                         
          The creature arrives in the SMOKE-FILLED TUNNEL, as the
          FIREWORKS FILL the tunnel with BRIGHT, MULTI-COLORED LIGHTS --
                         
                         
          INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT
                         
          Joe SPRINTS in, gets to Alice -- lightly slaps her face --
                         
                          JOE
           -- Alice, please -- please --
           (nothing -- SLAP)
           Alice, wake up!
                         
          Nothing -- so he fucking SLAPS HER FACE HARD and she suddenly
          INHALES SHARPLY, he eyes WIDE, terrified --
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           Alice! You're alive! Can you hear
           me? Are you okay?!
                         
          She's CATCHING HER BREATH, nodding, looking at him, amazed --
           115.
                         
                         
                          ALICE
           What is this? What are you doing
           here?!
                         
                          JOE
           I'm just-- doing the best I can to
           save you.
                         
          She GRABS HIM AND HUGS HIM TIGHT, teary and grateful --
          during which -- quietly:
                         
                          ALICE
           How did you know?
                         
                          JOE
           Your dad. He told me. He was
           worried. And flipping out.
                         
                          ALICE
           Really?
                         
                          JOE
           -- we need to move--
                         
          But she breaks out of the hug and grabs his shirt, intense:
                         
           TINA (O.S.)
           Excuse me?
                         
          TINA, a 24-year-old , disoriented woman with curlers in her
          hair, wakes up.
                         
                          TINA (CONT'D)
           Where are we?
                         
                         
          INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT
                         
          Joe and Alice have helped down one FAMILIAR FACE: SHERIFF
          PRUITT. They're out of breath, but their survival instinct
          has kicked in:
                         
                          TINA
           I left my bag in my car. Then I
           went to my car to get my bag--
                         
                          ALICE
           It's been experimented on for
           years. It's terrified and exhausted
           and hungry, it just wants to go
           home. When it touched me, I knew --
           116.
                         
                         
                          JOE
           Alice, help me get the sheriff
           down.
                         
                          TIME CUT:
                         
                          SHERIFF PRUITT
           Follow me. I can get us out of
           here.
                         
                          JOE
           Sheriff, we came that way.
                         
                          SHERIFF PRUITT
           Don't argue with me.
                         
                          TINA
           Come on, kids, let's go with the
           sheriff.
                         
          Joe and Alice follow. They run into a tunnel. We PUSH IN ON
          THE MECHANICAL DEVICE -- the PITCH INCREASING MORE NOW -- AS
          IF IT'S ABOUT TO "FUNCTION" -- The creature returns and sees
          that the humans are gone. He takes off.
                         
                         
          INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT
                         
          Sparkler lighting the way, we're with Joe and Alice -- Pruitt
          and Tina behind them:
                         
                          JOE
           Sheriff, I really think we're going
           the wrong way.
                         
                          PRUITT
           We'll talk about it when we get up
           top.
                         
          They continue following Pruitt.
                         
           CARY (O.S.)
           Joe!
                         
                          JOE
           I told you to get out!
                         
                          CARY
           I thought this was the way out. I
           tried! Hey, Alice, welcome back--
                         
                          PRUITT
           Kids, come on, we gotta go.
           117.
                         
                         
          BUT HE'S LOOKING BACK AND HIS SPARKLER ILLUMINATES THE
          CREATURE THAT IS RIGHT UP AHEAD AND TINA SCREAMS -- THEY ALL
          DO AS PRUITT TURNS AND IS TAKEN, LIFTED HIGH, KILLED IN THE
          DARK AS THEY ALL TURN AND RUN -- PRUITT'S HORRIBLE SCREAMS
          terrifying as the foursome sprint in the opposite direction!
          After RUNNING HARD for a beat:
                         
          They haul ass, but after a long moment TINA IS GRABBED AWAY
          INTO THE DARKNESS!!! HER SCREAMS CONTINUE behind them --
                         
          They run and run and run, but then BOOM: they hit a DEAD END.
          A DIRT WALL. No more tunnels. No options. Out of breath, they
          turn -- but dare not go back toward the horrifying blackness.
          The only SOUND the sparkler, their erratic breathing and the
          DISTANT INCREASING PITCH OF THE CREATURE'S MECHANICAL DEVICE.
                         
          THE CREATURE IS THERE -- FORTY FEET FROM THEM, --
          APPROACHING! ALICE SCREAMS -- SHE AND CARY MORE BACK AGAINST
          THE WALL -- AND THE CREATURE MOVES FOR THEM, BUT JOE YELLS AS
          THE THING PASSES THE FIREWORKS:
                         
                          JOE
           GO! YOU DON'T WANNA BE HERE, GO!
                         
                          CARY
           Joe, what are you doing?
                         
          IT KEEPS COMING -- PAST THE FIREWORKS, AMAZINGLY BACKLIT AS
          IT LUMBERS TOWARD JOE, DESPERATELY TRYING TO STAND GROUND:
                         
                          JOE
           WE UNDERSTAND! WE KNOW HOW HARD
           IT'S BEEN! BUT NOT EVERYONE IS
           HORRIBLE!
                         
                          CARY
           Joe, shut up, it's gonna kill you!
                         
                          JOE
           YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY NOW!
                         
          AND IT GRABS JOE AND LIFTS HIM -- Alice and Cary SCREAM AS
          JOE IS BEING SQUEEZED -- HE LOOKS INTO THE GLOSSY BLACK EYES
          OF THIS BEAST, WHICH COULD KILL HIM AT ANY TIME -- but in
          this moment of fear comes something else. Simple truth -- he
          WHISPERS, SHAKILY:
                         
                          JOE (CONT'D)
           -- I know bad things happen-- bad
           things happen, but you can still
           live. You can still live, you can
           still live, you're gonna be okay--
           118.
                         
                         
          JUST AS WE THINK THE CREATURE'S GONNA KILL HIM: A DISTANT
          MECHANICAL TONE -- THE CREATURE TURNS, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT
          SOUND -- THEN TO JOE AGAIN. IT CONSIDERS HIM. ITS EYES'
          COVERING PEELS AWAY -- REVEALING HUGE, WET, VULNERABLE EYES.
          AND THE THING LOOKS AT HIM. REALLY LOOKS AT HIM. In a way, as
          you imagine his mother once had. And Joe feels this too. AND
          AFTER A LONG, SCARY BEAT, THE CREATURE SETS HIM DOWN. Joe
          backs up as the creature TURNS FAST AND SPEEDS AWAY. JOE IS
          STUNNED. SHOCKED RELIEF. ALICE AND CARY, TOO --
                         
                          CARY
           Okay, wait a minute, WHAT?!
                         
          Then, over the HIGH-PITCHED MECHANICAL SOUND comes RUMBLINGS -
          - like THUNDER from above -- and the three LOOK UP --
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - NIGHT
                         
          The kids round a corner -- ON MAIN STREET, COUNTLESS METALLIC
          OBJECTS -- ANYTHING METAL AND LOOSE -- has been INVISIBLY
          DRAGGED -- FLOATING -- toward the WATER TOWER -- at different
          speeds and with different personalities, metal objects BULLET
          TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER AND STICK THERE.
                         
          Suddenly, THE DINER WINDOW SHATTERS as a STOVE RIPS THROUGH
          IT -- we PAN WITH IT as it TUMBLES TOWARD AND UP THE WATER
          TOWER! HUNDREDS OF OBJECTS move past them -- from bicycles to
          silverware and sinks! DISHWASHERS AND TVS SMASH THROUGH THE
          TOWN'S APPLIANCE STORE WINDOW -- A TV FLOATS, UNPLUGGED, PAST
          THE KIDS -- AND IT IS ON -- AND SHOWS AN EPISODE FROM THE
          TWILIGHT ZONE -- all things eventually SLAMMING into the
          WATER TOWER, the objects BEGINNING TO CRUSH TOGETHER, FORMING
          ONE DENSE METALLIC MASS!
                         
          BAM! BAMBAM! Sounds like GUN BLASTS -- the KIDS TURN: behind
          them are the RED CARGO CONTAINERS -- ONE BY ONE those cubes
          BURST THROUGH THE CONTAINERS: BAM! BAMBAMBAM! BAMBAM! And
          they SLAM INTO THE WATER TOWER -- AND THEY BEGIN TO FORM AN
          ODD, HUGE CRESCENT SHAPE ABOVE THE TOWER! Alice is cry-
          laughing at seeing it work --
                         
                          CARY
           -- what's he doing...?
                         
                          JOE
           ... he's making a model.
                         
          AGAIN and AGAIN, pieces FLY OVERHEAD, beginning to FORM WHAT
          IS CLEARLY AN ALIEN CRAFT -- LIGHTS BEGINNING TO ILLUMINATE
          FROM INSIDE as it continues -- ONE OF THE SPOTLIGHTS
          ILLUMINATING A JEEP THAT HAS JUST ARRIVED: JACK GETS OUT. HE
          SEES JOE. JOE IS SURPRISED TO SEE HIM -- ALICE CONCERNED.
           119.
                         
                         
          BUT THEN THE KIDS ARE BOTH INCREDULOUS TO SEE JACK HELP LOUIS
          OUT OF THE JEEP -- THE TWO MEN MOVE THROUGH THE DEBRIS IN THE
          STREETS, STUNNED AT THE ACTIVITY SURROUNDING THEM, BUT
          FOCUSED ON THEIR CHILDREN; A TUMBLING TYPEWRITER ALMOST TAKES
          OUT JACK, BUT HE AVOIDS IT AS IT SHOOTS UP TO THE WATER
          TOWER.
                         
          JACK GETS TO HIS SON -- HOLDS HIS SHOULDERS -- LOOKS DEEPLY
          INTO HIS EYES, TOUCHES HIS FACE AND EMBRACES HIM --
                         
                          JACK
           -- I got you. I got you.
                         
          LOUIS, CRYING, DESPERATELY SORRY -- AND SHE SEES THIS IN HIS
          SAD, WOUNDED FACE -- SHE HOLDS OUT A HAND -- HE TAKES IT AND
          PULLS HER INTO AN EMBRACE, HUGGING HIS DAUGHTER DESPERATELY.
                         
          BEHIND THEM, THE SHIP CONTINUES TO TAKE SHAPE, ALMOST FULLY-
          FORMED -- but here, as he is being hugged by his father, Joe
          LOOKS DOWN: SOMETHING IN HIS POCKET Is MOVING -- he considers
          it, confused for a moment -- but he reaches in and pulls it
          out. HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE -- and he holds the chain, but the
          LOCKET PULLS TOWARD THE WATER TOWER -- wanting to go.
                         
          Joe knows what this means. He looks up at his father, who
          also understand. AND THIS IS WHEN WE GO INTO SLOW MOTION --
          FROM HERE UNTIL THE END. After a long beat, Joe HOLDS THE
          NECKLACE UP, toward the tower -- the thing PULLING... TEARS
          in Joe's eyes as he looks up at it -- not wanting to let go,
          but knowing he must. Jack, heartsick, watches his son, on the
          verge of letting go. Alice watches Joe, on the verge of tears
          -- except Joe just can't bring himself to do it, not now, not
          ever. But then something happens.
                         
          Pulled by the invisible force, THE LOCKET POPS OPEN. And we
          see what's inside. A PHOTOGRAPH of Joe's MOTHER. A young
          woman, HOLDING HER ONE SMALL BABY. And Joe looks at his
          mother -- and in this moment, she at him and Jack's eyes
          suddenly WELL WITH TEARS -- Alice, too, tears streaming down
          her face and finally Jack reaches out -- and puts his hand on
          his son's shoulder -- which was all Joe needed, really.
                         
          And finally... after all... JOE LETS GO. OUR SCORE SOARS AS,
          IN SLOW MOTION, the necklace SHOOTS ACROSS THE MAIN STREET UP
          TO THE WATER TOWER!
                         
          AND WHEN IT HITS, THE ENTIRE TOWER IMPLODES FROM PRESSURE --
          A FIREWORKS-LIKE EXPLOSION OF WATER BURSTS AND SHOWERS THE
          STREET AS THE MAJESTIC SHIP COMPLETES ITS FORMATION -- and
          that's when Joe sees the CREATURE, LEAVING -- CLIMBING UP THE
          WATER TOWER AND ENTERS HIS SHIP -- AND IT BEGINS TO LIFT. AS
          IT TAKES OFF, THE WEIGHT OF THE TOWER IS TOO MUCH: IT
          COLLAPSES INTO MAIN STREET.
           120.
                         
                         
          THE SHIP RISES SLOWLY INTO THE SKY -- ITS PURE WHITE
          SPOTLIGHTS FINALLY SCANNING THE GROUND BENEATH IT -- LILLIAN,
          OHIO -- EARTH -- A PLANET IT IS FINALLY LEAVING --
                         
                         
          INT./EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          And we PUSH IN on Charles and Marin, who watch, amazed, as
          the distant light RISES INTO THE SKY --
                         
                         
          EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
                         
          And we PUSH IN as DONNY SLEEPS, the REFLECTION OF THE RISING
          SHIP seen in his windshield --
                         
                         
          EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - NIGHT
                         
          Joe and Alice, Jack, Louis and Cary watch, amazed, as the
          ship disappears into the night sky, we are TIGHT ON JOE'S
          HAND, as it takes ALICE'S.
                         
          And looking skyward, Joe smiles.
                         
          As our SCORE SWELLS, we finally...
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.
                         
                         
                          THE END

     1958

     PROLOGUE:  INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. EVENING.

     Fade up on Ripley, as in the final scene of the film,
     sitting, desolate in a ship's cabin. The camera rotates
     around his face, which begins in light and ends in darkness.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               If I could just go back.  If I could rub
               everything out.  Starting with myself.
               Starting with borrowing a jacket.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST TERRACE. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley is at the piano, accompanying FRAN, a young soprano.
     CREDITS begin.

                         FRAN (SINGS)
               Ah, such fleeting paradise
               such innocent delight
               to love,
               be loved,
               a lullabye,
               then silence.

     The song finishes.  Applause.  They're the entertainment at a
     cocktail party to celebrate a silver wedding anniversary.
     Some partygoers congratulate Fran on her performance. A
     distinguished looking man, pushing his wife in a wheelchair,
     approaches Ripley, offers his hand.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
               Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (pointing at Ripley's borrowed
                    jacket)
               I see you were at Princeton.
               Then you'll most likely know our son,
               Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               We couldn't help noticing your jacket.

               Yes.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Class of '56?

                         RIPLEY
                   (hesitating)
               How is Dickie?

     INT. ELEVATOR OPENING OUT INTO LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.

     Fran, Ripley, Mr and Mrs Greenleaf and others emerge from an
     elevator. Emily talks to Fran, Herbert to Ripley.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
                   (to Fran)
               I hope you'll come and see us...

                         FRAN
               That's very kind.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Both of you...

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Of course, Dickie's idea of music is
               Jazz. He has a saxophone.  To my ear Jazz
               is just noise, just an insolent noise.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley shakes hands with Herbert Greenleaf as he gets into
     his Rolls Royce. They are making an appointment. Ripley
     crosses the street to Fran, pecks her cheek. She hands him
     his share of their fee.

                         RIPLEY
               Gotta run. I'm so late.
                   (he hands Fran's boyfriend the
                    jacket he's been wearing)
               Thanks for the jacket.

                         BOYFRIEND
               Sure.  Thanks for filling in for me.

     From Greenleaf's point of view he sees a couple embracing.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Darling couple, aren't they?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Yes.  An exceptional young man.

     From another vantage point Ripley hurries on as Fran gets
     into her boyfriend's car. A piano quartet starts up.

     EXT. THEATER. EVENING.

     Ripley runs past the droves of arriving concert-goers and
     heads for the theater. Music continues.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM, THEATER. NIGHT.

     The interval: A thick mass of men in tuxedoes grooming
     themselves at the basins. Ripley turns on faucets, offers
     towels, brushes off dandruff. Men talk over, round, and
     through him.  Put coins in a bowl.

     INT. A BOX AT THE THEATER. NIGHT

     The concert continues. Ripley peers through the curtain at
     the performances.  A haughty woman in the box turns round and
     he closes the curtain.

     INT. BACKSTAGE. 1:30 A.M.

     An empty auditorium. Ripley plays Bach in the blue
     ghostlight.  A caretaker emerges from his rounds, flips on
     the house lights.  Ripley jerks up from his playing, waves
     apologetically.

                         RIPLEY
               Sorry, sorry.  I know.  Sorry.

     EXT. GREENLEAF SHIPYARDS, BROOKLYN. DAY.

     Greenleaf and Ripley walk through one of the drydocks.  A
     huge void in the shape of a boat, swarming with workers
     preparing the shell of a new liner.  If Central Park is where
     the money is spent, this is clearly where it's made.  And a
     lot of it. Workers nod deferentially to the man with his name
     over the buildings behind them.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Mongibello. Tiny place. South of Naples.
               Marge, his uh, the young lade is
               supposedly writing some kind of book. God
               knows what he does. By all accounts they
               spend the whole time on the beach. Or his
               sailboat. That's my son's talent,
               spending his allowance.

     Ripley, in his green corduroy jacket the very model of a
     sober young man, listens attentively.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF (cont'd)
               Could you ever conceive of going to
               Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?
                   (Ripley looks doubtful)
               I'd pay you.  I'd pay you 1000 dollars.

                         RIPLEY
               I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir,
               but...

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Good. Now you can go for a reason.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK. DAY.

     A vinyl RECORD revolves in close up.  An exuberant and
     mysterious VOICE is scat singing. Wild. Then the sound slides
     into a raucous big band jazz number:  Dizzy Gillespie's The
     Champ. A HAND ejects the record. When the camera finds the
     man's face it is BLINDFOLDED. He's hot. He's wearing an
     undershirt. He's trying to identify the recording.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               I don't know. Count Basie?  Duke
               Ellington. I don't know. Count Basie.

     The man pulls of the blindfold, examines the record cover of
     the disc he's been trying to learn, needs to put on glasses
     to do so, is irritated by his mistake. He ejects the record.

     A pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered
     table which includes classical sheet music and a paper
     keyboard. One hand idly mimes at the keys.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Another song for Ripley to identify is on the gramophone.
     Chet Baker's My Funny Valentine.  Signs everywhere of
     packing. A suitcase. Books about Italy.  Ripley paces in this
     BASEMENT room, which is bathroom, kitchen, living room and
     bedroom all in one.  Tiny, tidy, squalid and sad. The windows
     give onto bars and a wall.

                         RIPLEY
               Don't even know if this is a man or a
               woman.

     There's a violent row going on in the room above his head. He
     flinches.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley, shining his shoes, packing almost done, is testing
     himself on another piece of music. Free jazz saxophone:
     Charlie Parker's Koko.  He listens hard, recognizes the
     track.

                         RIPLEY
               That's Charlie Parker. Bird.

     He skips over to the gramophone, checks the record. He's
     right, he smiles.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley studies an old photograph of Dickie Greenleaf in a
     Princeton Yearbook. He shoves the book in a bag, picks up
     his suitcase and takes a last look around the dingy apartment
     before closing the door behind him.

     EXT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley hauls his luggage up the stairs and into the sunlight.
     He is met at the top of the stairs by Mr Greenleaf's
     chauffeur.

                         CHAUFFEUR
               Here.  I'll take that.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

                         CARETAKER
                   (nodding towards the apartment)
               That thousand bucks should come in handy.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, sir.

                         CHAUFFEUR
                   (interupts Ripley, who is
                    about to open the car door)
               I'll get that.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

                         CHAUFFEUR
                   (as he holds open the door for
                    Ripley)
               Sir.
                   (Ripley laughs excitedly)
               You're gonna have a great trip.  Mr
               Greenleaf is personal friends with the
               Cunard people.

     INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S CAR. DAY.

     Ripley luxuriates in the back of the Greenleaf limousine. He
     opens up an envelope he's carrying with Greenleaf stationery.
     Inside a First Class Cunard Ticket, some traveler's checks
     and dollars.

                         CHAUFFEUR
               I can tell you.  The Greenleaf name opens
               a lot of doors.

     EXT. QUEEN MARY, MANHATTAN SKYLINE. DAY.

     The liner leaves New York en route to Italy.  END CREDITS.

     INT. NAPLES HARBOR, CUSTOMS & IMMIGRATION HALL. DAY.

     ITALY. Brilliant sunshine. The Queen Mary has just docked.
     Passengers can be seen disembarking through the huge windows.
     Coming from the First Class gangways they are greeted,
     escorted, fussed over into the hall.  Their bags have been
     unloaded ahead of them, and are now being sorted in the hall
     under the initials of their owners.  STANDS WITH THE LETTERS
     OF THE ALPHABET CHALKED ON THEM are dotted about, and trunks
     and suitcases of all shapes and sizes form small hills around
     them. Ripley enters and an Italian Porter approaches, wants
     his name.  Ripley. Ripley. Ripley! he repeats in the hubbub
     and joins the crowd around the letter R.  A striking young
     woman (MEREDITH) is nearby. She notices him.

     Ripley proceeds to the Customs area, where he's held in a
     line as a large suitcase is opened and searched. Meredith
     catches up with him. Her luggage a mountain next to his.

                         MEREDITH
               What's your secret?

                         RIPLEY
               Excuse me?

                         MEREDITH
               No, it's just - you are American, aren't
               you? - no, I just, I have so much
               luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined.
               It's humiliating.

     Ripley shrugs.  Now they're opening a second case of the
     passenger ahead.  Hard not to converse.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith
               Randall.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.

                         MEREDITH
               Hello.

     They are passed through immigration, head down the long
     stairs towards the street.  Meredith catches up with Ripley.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?

                         RIPLEY
                   (thinking quickly)
               Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.

                         MEREDITH
               So now, did they put your suitcase in the
               wrong pile? It's just - upstairs -
               weren't you under the R stand? I thought
               I saw you there.

                         RIPLEY
               My father wants me in New York. He builds
               boats. I'd rather sail them.  I travel
               under my mother's name.

                         MEREDITH
               Which is?

                         RIPLEY
               Emily.
                   (Meredith's bewildered)
               Just kidding.

                         MEREDITH
               The funny thing is, I'm not Randall
               either. I'm Logue.

                         RIPLEY
                   (nods, recognizing the name)
               As in the...?

                         MEREDITH
               As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug
               off the dress. I travel under my mother's
               name, too.

                         RIPLEY
               Randall.

                         MEREDITH
               Right.

     They've arrived at a crossroads on the stairs - graphic signs
     explain the choices: one way for Buses, Taxis and exits - the
     other for Trains: ROMA, VENEZIA, MILANO.  They're going in
     different directions.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
                   (offering her hand)
               So - partners in disguise.
                   (looks at the signs)
               Bye.

     EXT. COASTAL ROAD FROM NAPLES. LATE AFTERNOON.

     A BUS rolls around a coastal road cut into the side of a
     cliff, mountain above, blue sea below.

     INT. BUS. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley sits surrounded by teeming life. The bus slows at a
     new town. People get off.

     INT/EXTERIOR. BUS ARRIVES MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.

     Later, the day ending. Ripley looks out as they continue on
     their journey. Arriving at a small fishing port they wind
     down through a square, passing the local church.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. LATE DAY.

     And then the bus is in the heart of a wharf. On one side
     there's evidence of the fisherman's life, nets, old men
     working. Opposite there's a tiny cafe spilling out onto the
     street, young guys hang out, play table football, lounge on
     their Vespas. The Driver chants -

                         DRIVER
               MONGIBELLO!

     Ripley gets out, lugging his cases, as the bus continues on
     its way. He looks around him. He feels completely foreign.

     EXT. MIRAMARE HOTEL/BOAT AT SEA. MORNING.

     A SAILBOAT has slid into his view, now drops anchor, drops
     the sail.  A couple dive off and swim towards shore.

     ALL OF THIS IS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RIPLEY, who's
     watching the events through binoculars from his tiny balcony
     in the Miramare Hotel. An Italian Vocabulary Book is perched
     on his knees and, during this, he continues his study,
     mouthing the Italian words.

                         RIPLEY
                   (looking at a long, lean girl
                    about to dive)
               La fidanzata a una faccia.  The fiancÈe
               has a face.  La fidanzata e Marge.

     Her partner, DICKIE GREENLEAF, dives too. They're brown,
     beautiful, perfect. Ripley notices the name of the boat:
     "BIRD".

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Questo e la mia faccia.....

     The golden couple emerge from the sea. Dickie shakes off the
     water, grins.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               This is my face.

     He double-checks himself with the vocabulary book.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Questa...e la mia faccia. Questa e la
               faccia di Dickie.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley emerges from one of the beach cabins, and stands on
     the edge of the sand on a wooden walkway. He's wearing A TINY
     LIME-GREEN BATHING SUIT. He loathes beaches. A couple of boys
     turn laconically and watch him.

     Ripley puts on his shoes and scurries to the sea. He feels
     ridiculous, his skin alabaster against the brown bodies.
     Finally, the shame is too great and he pulls off his shoes
     and dashes to the water, where he luxuriates in the coolness
     of it before wading out of the sea, and walking straight up
     to Dickie.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie Greenleaf?

     Dickie squints at Ripley, who holds his shoes, lamely.

                         DICKIE
               Who's this?

                         RIPLEY
               It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at
               Princeton together.

                         DICKIE
               Okay.
                   (he sits up)
               And did we know each other?

                         RIPLEY
               Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must
               have known me.

                         DICKIE
                   (to Marge)
               Princeton is like a fog, America's like a
               fog.
                   (to Ripley)
               This is Marge Sherwood. Tom - sorry, what
               was it?

                         RIPLEY
               Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.

                         MARGE
               How do you do.

                         DICKIE
               What are you doing in Mongi?

                         RIPLEY
               Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.

                         DICKIE
                   (finds this idea absurd)
               Passing through! You're so white. Did you
               ever see a guy so white, Marge?  Gray,
               actually.

                         RIPLEY
               It's just an undercoat.
                   (Marge laughs)

                         DICKIE
               Say again?

                         RIPLEY
               You know, a primer.

                         DICKIE
               That's funny.

     He shares some intimacy with Marge, makes her laugh.  Ripley
     stands as they wrestle around him. Marge looks up.

                         MARGE
               You should come and have lunch with us,
               before you go - Dickie?

                         DICKIE
               Sure.  Any time.

                         MARGE
               And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in
               danger of turning a little pink.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks. Well, a coincidence.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. EARLY MORNING.

     ANOTHER DAY.  Church Bells ringing. Dickie, dressed in
     shorts, comes bumping up the cobbled path towards the square
     on his MOTORSCOOTER. He stops by a steep flight of steps.
     RIPLEY, a book in hand, unseen, walking up a hill, catches
     all this and, intrigued, watches as a young Italian beauty,
     SILVANA, has a spikey, flirtatious exchange with Dickie, then
     climbs on the scooter, behind him.

                         DICKIE
               I've been looking for you everywhere.

                         SILVANA
               Ah, today you're looking for me.  And
               where have you been the rest of the week?
               Pig.  With your American girl?  I hate
               you, you know?

                         DICKIE
               What?

                         SILVANA
               I hate you.

     And RIPLEY watches them as they rattle down the hill towards
     the sea.

     EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.

     Dickie appears in Marge's garden, the sea behind his head.
     Marge is sitting at her outside table surrounded by some of
     the remnants of lunch.  Dickie's sheepish, showered, late.

                         DICKIE
               Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late,
               I'm a swine.

                         MARGE
               Did you forget where I live? It's four
               o'clock.

                         DICKIE
               I just woke up.  I'm sorry.

                         MARGE
               You just woke up!

                         DICKIE
               Fausto and I - we took the boat out, we
               were fishing, and then it was dawn and
               we'd caught absolutely nothing.

                         MARGE
               Well, we ate everything without you.

                         DICKIE
               We?

                         MARGE
               Yes, Tom Ripley's here.

     As Ripley appears with the tray to collect more dishes.

                         DICKIE
               Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We
               thought you'd disappeared. We were going
               to send out a search party.

                         RIPLEY
               No, still here.

                         MARGE
               Tom was telling me about his trip over.
               Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.

                         DICKIE
               Is that good?

                         MARGE
               Shut up!

     Marge flicks him with a napkin. They start to wrestle,
     excluding Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm intruding.

                         DICKIE
               Can you mix a martini?

                         RIPLEY
                   (hesitant)
               Sure.

                         MARGE
                   (going inside)
               I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.

                         DICKIE
               Everybody should have one talent.
                   (to Ripley)
               What's yours?

                         RIPLEY
                   (without a beat)
               Forging signatures. Telling lies.
               Impersonating practically anybody.

                         DICKIE
                   (enjoying this banter)
               That's three. Nobody should have more
               than one talent. Okay, do an impression.

                         RIPLEY
               Now?  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Talent -
                   (his voice ages, his face
                    changes)
               The only talent my son has is for cashing
               his allowance.

                         DICKIE
                   (absolutely thrown)
               What? What's this?

                         RIPLEY
               I like to sail, believe me, I love to
               sail! Instead I make boats and other
               people sail them.

                         DICKIE
                   (incredibly impressed)
               Stop! It's too much!  You're making all
               the hairs on my neck stand up!

                         RIPLEY
                   (relishing it)
               Jazz, let's face it, it's just an
               insolent noise.

                         DICKIE
               I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the
               old bastard is here right now!  That's
               brilliant!  How do you know him?

                         RIPLEY
               I met him in New York.

                         DICKIE
               Marge! You've got to hear this!

                         MARGE
                   (returning with the drinks)
               What?  What?

                         DICKIE
               Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf
               1st.

                         RIPLEY
               Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a
               fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.

                         MARGE
               What's going on?

                         DICKIE
               Uncanny!

                         MARGE
               I don't get it.

                         RIPLEY
               Could you ever conceive of going there,
               Tom, and bringing him back?

                         DICKIE
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and
               persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you
               $1000.

     INT/EXT. MONGIBELLO CHURCH AND SQUARE. DUSK.

     A christening is over and now the whole village is pouring
     out of Church for the Passeggiata in Sunday best. Girls arm
     in arm parade. Boys arm in arm evaluate. New babies are
     compared and fussed over. Old people smoke, talk, shrug.
     Dickie is walking with Ripley, seething about his father's
     scheming.

                         DICKIE
               I'm never going back. To actually hire
               somebody to come all the way here to drag
               me back home - got to be insane, hasn't
               he?

     SILVANA comes out of church arm in arm with a man, her
     fiancee, as part of a foursome which includes Dickie's pal
     FAUSTO. Silvana's eyes flick towards Dickie, otherwise
     there's no acknowledgement as they all greet each other.
     Dickie introduces Tom, then they move on.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               I'm never going back!

                         RIPLEY
               No, I think your mother, her illness -

                         DICKIE
               It's got nothing to do with my mother!
               She's had leukemia for - ! This is what
               makes me boil about him! HE wants me
               back! - it's got nothing to do with my
               mother.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling
               you what I -

                         DICKIE
                   (interrupting)
               Go back!  Go back to New York or call him
               if you can find a telephone that works,
               and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me
               back to him or his shipyard.

     EXT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, MONGIBELLO. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley appears, with his meagre luggage at Dickie's front
     door. He's carrying his tote bag under his arm, the bottom of
     which seems to be unstitched and held together only by his
     fingers. Marge is on the terrace, she looks down to see Tom
     talking with Dickie.

                         MARGE
               Hi Tom.

                         DICKIE
                   (looks up)
               Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.

                         MARGE
               I'll come down.

                         DICKIE
                   (to Ripley)
               Did you speak to my father?

                         RIPLEY
               You were right about the telephones.
               There are no lines, there's some problem.

                         MARGE
                   (coming out of the front door)
               Hello Tom. You're off? What are your
               plans?

                         RIPLEY
               Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.

     He goes to shake her hand and as he releases the tote bag the
     seam splits and records spill to the ground, scattering. He
     bends down, starts gathering them up. Marge helps.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Oh, damn, sorry, this bag's -

     Dickie's delighted when he sees the Jazz titles.

                         DICKIE
               You like jazz!

                         RIPLEY
                   (gathering up the records)
               I love jazz.

                         DICKIE
                   (holding up a Chet Baker)
               This is the best. Marge says she likes
               jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is
               jazz.

                         MARGE
               I never said that!

                         RIPLEY
               Bird. That's jazz.

                         DICKIE
               Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat -

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. What's the name of your
               sailboat?

                         DICKIE
               Bird!

                         MARGE
               Which is ridiculous. Boats are female,
               everyone knows you can't call a boat
               after a man.

                         RIPLEY
               He's not a man, he's a god.

                         DICKIE
                   (excited)
               Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a
               club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.

                         MARGE
               It's vile.

                         DICKIE
               Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't
               have to come.
                   (to Ripley)
               It's great.  You're going to love it.

     INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.

     A cavern blue with smoke. A surprisingly good QUINTET blast
     out their version of MOANIN'. Dickie and Ripley arrive and
     make their way to a table where Fausto is sitting with
     friends. It's too noisy for conversation, but Dickie shouts
     introductions and they shake Ripley's hand.  Dickie is
     instantly absorbed in the music, Ripley absorbed in Dickie.
     An attractive Italian Girl, DAHLIA, comes over, kisses
     Dickie, pulls off his hat, puts it on, there's no room for
     her to sit, so she sits on Dickie's lap, smoking his
     cigarette.  Dickie raises his eyebrow at Tom, but it's
     clearly no hardship. Then the band strikes up the intro to Tu
     vuo' fa' L'Americano - a hit which reflects the current craze
     for all things American - and Fausto pulls a protesting Dickie
     up onto the stage.

                         FAUSTO
                   (improvising in Italian)
               Ladies and Gentlemen. Dickie Greenleaf,
               all the way from America... etc.

     Fausto starts to sing. Dickie joins in the chorus. Everybody
     claps. Dickie talks off-mic to Fausto.

                         FAUSTO (cont'd)
               And a big round of applause for a new
               friend from New York - Tom Ripley!

     Ripley's mortified, but Dickie jumps off the stage and pulls
     him up.  The song continues and now, at the chorus, it's
     Dickie and Ripley who have to sing. Ripley, of course, can
     sing well, if not confident in this arena. Soon the audience
     is clapping, standing on tables, dancing, Dahlia prominent.

                         DICKIE (O/S)
                   (reading)
               I have bumped into an old friend from
               Princeton - a fellow named Tom Ripley.
               He says he's going to haunt me until I
               agree to come back to New York with
               him...

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NOON.

     Dickie, in his new dressing gown, is sitting at the table,
     typing. Ripley's head emerges from behind the couch on which
     he has been enjoying a blissful sleep.

                         DICKIE
                   (grins)
               Good afternoon!

                         RIPLEY
               What time is it?
                   (puts on his glasses and checks
                    his watch)
               Oh God!  Do you always type your letters?
                   (points at the letter)
               That should be two Ts.

                         DICKIE
               I can't write and I can't spell.  That's
               the privilege of a first-class education.
               You're upstairs at the back. I think
               Ermelinda made the bed up.

                         RIPLEY
               This is so good of you.

                         DICKIE
               Don't say it again. Now you're a Double
               Agent and we're going to string my Dad
               alone, I was thinking we might buy a
               little car with the expense money he's
               sending you. What do you think, Marge...a
               little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?

     Marge has appeared, carrying Camparis.

                         MARGE
               Dickie, you can't even drive a car!  No,
               what we need urgently is an icebox. What
               do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll
               be your friend for life.

                         RIPLEY
               I absolutely agree with Marge.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS. DAY.

     Ripley locates his room, puts down his luggage in what is a
     comfortable and simple room, then heads back downstairs only
     to be tempted by the open door of Dickie's bedroom.

     INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. DAY.

     Ripley explores the casual elegance of Dickie's bedroom - the
     Louis Vuitton chest, the closet's open door spilling out
     shirts, ties. On the dressing table there are toiletries,
     cufflinks scattered, a silk tie.  Ripley picks up the tie and
     walks towards the open window below which is a terrace where
     lunch is being laid. Marge and Dickie are chatting. Shreds of
     conversation float up to Ripley.

                         DICKIE
               It'll just be for a little while.  He can
               be... he makes me laugh.

                         MARGE
               Okay, darling.

                         DICKIE
               You'd say if you mind?

                         MARGE
               No, I like him.

                         DICKIE
               Marge, you like everybody.

                         MARGE
               I don't like you.

                         DICKIE
               Then I'll go to your place and you can
               move in with Tom.

     Above them, Ripley repeats these phrases, carefully, testing
     the cadences, No, I like him. Marge, you like everybody,
     until he's as accurate as a taperecorder.

     EXT. TERRACE OF DICKIE'S HOUSE. DAY.

     Ermelinda is clearing away lunch. Ripley is changed and
     sitting at the table with Marge while Dickie works on the
     coffee. Ripley watches him, studying everything: the way he
     uses the expresso machine, the way he wears no socks, his
     pants, his rings.

                         DICKIE
               Now you know why Miss Sherwood always
               shows up for breakfast.  It's not love
               it's the coffee machine.

                         MARGE
               It's the one task Dickie can do on his
               own - make coffee.

                         DICKIE
               Shut up.

                         MARGE
               Oh darling - is that for me?

                         DICKIE
               No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.

                         RIPLEY
                   (as Dickie hands him his cup)
               That ring's so great. The green one.

                         MARGE
                   (delighted)
               Tom, I love you!
                   (to Dickie)
               See!
                   (to Ripley)
               I bought it for him, for his birthday.

                         RIPLEY
               It's superb.

                         DICKIE
               I had to promise, capital P, never to
               take it off - otherwise I'd give it to
               you.

                         MARGE
                   (flicking a crumb at him)
               Bastard!
                   (to Ripley)
               Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in
               Naples.  I bargained for about two weeks.

                         DICKIE
               I hope it wasn't cheap.

                         MARGE
               Oh, it was.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Marge)
               I have to find a birthday present for
               Frances. Perhaps you can help me?

                         MARGE
               Frances?

                         RIPLEY
               My fiancÈe.

                         DICKIE
               You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?

                         RIPLEY
               Your parents met her.

                         DICKIE
               Oh God - I can just imagine - if only
               Dickie would settle down... doesn't every
               parent deserve a grandchild?  Never! I
               swear on your ring, Marge.  I am never
               going back.

     EXT. BIRD SAILBOAT. DAY.

     The Bird is sailing off the coast of Mongibello. There's a
     manoeuvre going on with the sail.  Captain Dickie supervises
     his crew of Marge and a painfully awkward anxious-to-please
     Ripley.  Dickie goes over to help him.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?

                         DICKIE
               You're doing great. We'll make a sailor
               of you yet. You're doing really well.

                         MARGE
               Dubious but special honor, Tom - crewing
               Dickie's boat.  Alright, bar's open.

                         DICKIE
               Yes please!

     She heads for the cabin. Dickie settles down beside Ripley.

                         RIPLEY
               Could we sail to Venice?

                         DICKIE
               Sure.  I love Venice.

                         RIPLEY
               I have to go to Venice.

                         DICKIE
               See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or
               is it Rome? You do something and die,
               don't you?  Okay, Venice is on the list.

                         RIPLEY
               And Rome.

                         DICKIE
               Do you ski?
                   (Ripley frowns)
               Don't tell me - you're a lost cause!
               That's the next thing to deal with. We're
               planning to go to Cortina at Christmas.
               Excellent skiing. Excellent.
                   (as Marge reappears)
               Marge - Ripley can't ski.  We'll have to
               teach him that, too. Have you ever known
               such low class?

                         MARGE
               Poor Tom. Good thing we're not getting
               married. We might have to invite him on
               our honeymoon.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.

     Marge and Ripley are on a shopping expedition. They walk down
     the hill towards the grocery shop, next to the bar in the
     little square. Ripley has asked Marge how she and Dickie met.

                         MARGE
               Oh I hated New York - that Park Avenue
               crowd - so I fled to Paris to work on my
               book, and I was always going to this cafe
               with Jean-Jacques, and Dickie used to
               play his saxophone outside and I would
               see him and he would see me, and he would
               play My Funny Valentine. It was only
               later that I realised he only knows about
               six songs.

     They've arrived at the Grocery Store. Alessandra, the woman
     who owns the store greets them.  Silvana, who's her daughter,
     is also there, and less comfortable. She waits for Marge's
     order.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
                   (to Silvana, in Italian)
               Buono Sera, Silvana. Por favore: arance e
               pane, e del prosciutto.

                         SILVANA
               E fichi?  Come sempre?

                         MARGE
               Si.  Come sempre.  Grazie.

     Silvana goes inside for the meat and bread. Marge frowns.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
                   (back to Ripley)
               Anyway, then one day, we go in, I see
               Dickie, he starts playing My Funny
               Valentine, and then all of a sudden he
               just walks into the cafe, right in front
               of Jean-Jacques, and grabs me! Now I had
               never spoken to him in my life - he said
               I'm going to Italy, tomorrow, and I want
               you to come with me. So I did.

     At the edge of the square there's A BOCCE AREA, where men
     throw metal balls along a track, aiming to get closest to a
     small cue. Dickie is there, playing intensely with Fausto and
     two other guys, one of whom we've seen before with Silvana.
     Ripley and Marge loop back towards home, taking in the Bocce
     en route. Dickie waves. They wave back. Marge calls to him.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom
               and I are running off together.

                         DICKIE
               Okay.

     EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. EARLY EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley are leaving.  They're fooling around.
     Dickie jumps on Ripley's shoulders. Marge watches from the
     top of the garden.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO SQUARE. EARLY EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley, still horsing about, pass Silvana's
     grocery store.  Dickie dismounts, goes over to Silvana, who's
     tense, a little troubled. They huddle, Ripley isolated.

                         SILVANA
               Did you get my message?  I want to talk
               to you.

                         DICKIE
               I want to talk to you too...Smile for me.

     And Dickie's already gone, back to Ripley feinting to box him
     then dancing, satyr-like, down the hill.

     EXT. COASTAL ROAD TO NAPLES. EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley on the Vespa. There's a steep incline where
     the road winds down towards Naples and, as the Vespa gains
     speed, Ripley is happy to cling to Dickie.

                         DICKIE
               You're breaking my ribs!

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               You're breaking my ribs!

     INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.

     Ripley's really singing, carrying the burden of My Funny
     Valentine in a flawless imitation of Chet Baker. Dickie is
     playing some sax. After a verse, there's spontaneous
     applause. Dickie, impressed beams at Ripley.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.

     A NEW ICEBOX, incongruous in pride of place in the living
     room, casts its glow on a delighted Dickie as he pulls out a
     couple of beers, handing one to Ripley who is paging through
     his copy of the Collected Works of Shakespeare.

                         DICKIE
               I could fuck this icebox I love it so
               much.
                   (considering Ripley)
               What were you actually doing in New York?

                         RIPLEY
               I played piano in a few places.

                         DICKIE
               That's one job, you told me a lot of
               jobs.

                         RIPLEY
               A few places - that's a few jobs. Anyway,
               I don't want to think about New York.

                         DICKIE
               The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I
               spend hours speculating.
                   (drinking)
               Cold beer. Thank you Dad.

                         RIPLEY
               Copy out from here...

     He hands the book to Dickie, pointing out the lines.

                         DICKIE
                   (staring to write on the back
                    of a postcard)
               I love the fact you brought Shakespeare
               with you and no clothes.  Ermelinda says
               you wash the same shirt out every night.
               Is that true?

                         RIPLEY
               No! I've got more than one shirt!

                         DICKIE
               She can do that stuff for you. Anyway,
               just wear some of my things, wear
               anything you want, most of it's ancient.
                   (he's finished writing)

                         RIPLEY
               Now your signature.
                   (watching him write)
               Not "Dickie". Your signature.

     Dickie writes his signature at the bottom of the postcard.
     Ripley studies the writing, takes off his glasses to clean
     them. Dickie looks at him.

                         DICKIE
               Without the glasses you're not even ugly.
                   (takes them, tries them on)
               I don't need them because I never read.
               How do I look.

                         RIPLEY
               Like Clark Kent.
                   (takes them back, puts them on
                    beaming at Dickie)
               Now Superman.

     Dickie cuffs him.  Ripley looks down at the postcard.

                         DICKIE
               I know. I write like a child.

                         RIPLEY
               Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T,
               do you see? - fine, vulnerable - that's
               pain, that's secret pain.

                         DICKIE
               It must be a deep secret, cause I don't
               know about it.

                         RIPLEY
               Your handwriting - nothing more naked.
               See - nothing's quite touching the line -
               that's vanity.

                         DICKIE
                   (flattered)
               Well we certainly know that's true.

     INT. DICKIE'S BATHROOM. NIGHT.

     Dickie's in the bath. Ripley, dressed, sits on the stool next
     to the bath. They're in the middle of playing chess, the
     board propped on the bath tray. Ripley puts his hand in the
     water, checking the temperature. He turns on the faucet for a
     burst of hot. Ripley is absurdly happy. He pours some wine.

                         DICKIE
               Do you have any brothers?

                         RIPLEY
               No, no brothers, no sisters.

                         DICKIE
               me neither. Nor does Marge. All only
               children - what does that mean?

     He looks at Ripley who looks at him, a little too long.

                         RIPLEY
               Means we never shared a bath.
               I'm cold. Can I get in?

                         DICKIE
               No!

                         RIPLEY
               I didn't mean with you in it.

                         DICKIE
                   (standing)
               Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune
               anyway.

     He gets out, walks past Ripley, who doesn't turn around. But
     Dickie's reflected in the mirror. Ripley looks, then Dickie
     turns, holds his look momentarily before flicking him with
     his towel.

     INT/EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, NAPLES. DAY.

     An OFFICIAL is studying Dickie's passport photograph. It's
     not a recent picture. The official looks suspicious. Dickie
     is used to it.

                         DICKIE
               It is me. It's an old picture.
                   (sighs at Ripley)
               Every time - 'is it you?  Doesn't look
               like you'.

     He's signing for his allowance. He has a smart document case
     with his initials prominently embossed.  Ripley watches him
     sign and collect a large wad of notes.

                         CLERK
               Letters - Greenleaf, and for Ripley.

     Ripley collects and studies his mail. As they walk outside he
     holds up one letter to Dickie.

                         RIPLEY
               Fran.
                   (anticipating her letter)
               I miss you, where are you coming home?
               Stop telling me what a great time you're
               having, how you love Dickie... and Marge
               and...
                   (the next letter)
               And this one, I think, is your dad...

     INT. TRAIN TO ROME. DAY.

     Ripley sits reading the LETTER from Herbert Greenleaf.  He
     frowns, stops reading, looks out of the window.

                         DICKIE
               What does he say?

                         RIPLEY
               He's getting impatient. He wants me to
               reassure him you'll be home by
               Thanksgiving.

                         DICKIE
               You've got to get a new jacket. Really.
               You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm
               sick of seeing you in them.

                         RIPLEY
               I can't. I can't keep spending your
               father's money.

                         DICKIE
               I love how responsible you are. My Dad
               should make you Chief Accountant or
               something.  Let me buy you a jacket.
               There's a great place when we get to
               Rome, Batistoni.

     Ripley loves this idea and mouths the word, "Batistoni".

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Andiamo a Roma.  We're taking Tom to
               Roma!

     EXT. ARCARI'S CAFE, PIAZZA NAVONA, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley and Dickie sit outside at a Cafe in the Piazza Navona.
     Very smart, very sophisticated, very young crowd.  There are
     already several empty coffee cups and a half empty bottle of
     Frascati.  Ripley has his guide book out and is incredibly
     impatient. Dickie, meanwhile, has stretched out for the
     duration.

                         RIPLEY
               Where do we find a carozza for the Forum,
               or can we hire any of them - ?

                         DICKIE
               Relax.

                         RIPLEY
               It's just there's so much to do in a
               single day.

                         DICKIE
               Relax. The most important question is
               where to eat. I hope Freddie made a
               reservation.

                         RIPLEY
               Freddie?

                         DICKIE
               Freddie Miles.  You know - he's
               organizing the Cortina skiing trip.

     Ripley hates the idea of having this special day invaded. A
     horn makes him look up as FREDDIE MILES illegally parks his
     open top sports car opposite the cafe, sees Dickie and
     bustles over.  He's a heavy-set American with a reddish
     crewcut. Ripley finds him disgusting to look at. Dickie is
     delighted.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Frederico!

                         FREDDIE
               Ciao bello.
                   (noticing a beautiful woman in
                    an open-topped car)
               Don't you want to fuck every woman you
               see.  Just once.

     They kiss cheeks, continental-style.

                         DICKIE
               This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.

                         FREDDIE
                   (mugging)
               Hey, if I'm late, think what her
               husband's saying!

     He fills Dickie's glass with wine and drinks it standing up.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               So let's go. I got us a table outside at
               Fabrizio's.

     And Dickie's up, leaving Ripley to pick up all the tiny
     checks to work out the bill and pay it.

                         DICKIE
               I'll tell you - I am so cabin-crazy with
               Mongi.

     Freddie and Dickie link arms Italian-style and cross the
     street to Freddie's car.

                         FREDDIE
               I know.  I was there.
                   (looks back to see Ripley
                    struggling to settle the
                    check)
               Tommy!  It's S.R.O.  Two seater.
               Standing Room Only.  Chop, chop, Tommy!

     Ripley, abandoned, goes over. There's no room in the car. He
     has to crouch in the rear.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               You're going to have to sit between us.
               But don't put your shoes on the seat,
               know what I mean, put them one on top of
               the other.  Okay?

     INT. A JAZZ RECORD STORE. LATE AFTERNOON.

     This record store is hidden away down a cobbled alley, and
     stuffed with the trendiest Romans, all of whom rifle the
     stacks under a fog of cigarette smoke.  There are two
     LISTENING BOOTHS, one of which has Freddie and Dickie crammed
     into it, sharing a set of headphones.  Ripley stands outside
     the booth, holding both of their jackets like a manservant,
     while inside and behind the glass doors they chat animatedly.
     He looks longingly at the street, where the light is fading.
     Dickie catches his hangdog expression and pushes open the
     accordion doors.

                         DICKIE
               Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and
               meet some friends of Freddie's. The best
               thing is - if you want to be a tourist -
               grab a cab and we can meet up at the
               railway station.

                         RIPLEY
                   (absolutely crestfallen)
               What club?

                         DICKIE
               Freddie's arranged it with some of the
               skiing crowd. Come if you want but I
               thought you wanted to see the Forum...?

                         RIPLEY
               I did. And then maybe get the jacket and
               what have you...

                         FREDDIE
                   (from inside the booth)
               Dick - you've got to hear this!

                         DICKIE
                   (oblivious to Ripley's pain)
               Listen, just take one of mine when we get
               back. Don't worry about it.  I did the
               Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is
               enough in anyone's life.

     Ripley hands him the coats, turns away.

                         DICKIE
               Ciao.  Have fun.

     Ripley heads for the door, then comes back, raps on the
     booth.  Dickie pushes it open.

                         RIPLEY
               You said to make sure you didn't miss the
               train. It leaves at eight.

     EXT. THE CAPITOL. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley hikes up Michelangelo's Arcoeli Steps. Then he's
     looking down from the Campodoglio at the Forum below. Then
     he's walking by the oversized fragments of the Colossus. This
     is the real Ripley, the lover of beauty, inspired by art, by
     antiquity. He's awed. He's cold. He so much wishes he weren't
     alone.

     INT. ROME RAILWAY STATION. NIGHT.

     It's past eight, Ripley stands, one foot on the guard step of
     the Naples train, waiting forlornly for Dickie, then giving
     up as the train pulls away. He pulls the door to his
     compartment closed, and sits inside the train alone.

     INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

     There's music playing, Bing Crosby's "May I". Very loud.
     Ripley dances to the mirror, SPECTACLES ABANDONED and DRESSED
     AS DICKIE IN HIS TUXEDO, MINUS TROUSERS. He adjusts his hair,
     catches one of Dickie's expressions.  There are clothes
     abandoned everywhere.  He's been having a big dressing-up
     session. He sings along with Bing.

                         DICKIE (O/S)
               What are you doing?

     Ripley turns, horrified, to see Dickie standing in the
     doorway.  The music thumps away.

                         RIPLEY
               Oh - just amusing myself.  Sorry, Dickie.
                   (pause)
               I didn't think you were coming back.

     Dickie turns off the record player.

                         DICKIE
               I wish you'd get out of my clothes.

     Ripley starts undressing, his fingers clumsy with
     mortification and shock.  Dickie looks at his feet, shakes
     his head.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Shoes too?

                         RIPLEY
                   (lame, ashamed)
               You said I could pick out a jacket and I
               just... Sorry.

                         DICKIE
               Get undressed in your own room, would
               you?

                         RIPLEY
               I thought you'd missed the train.

                         DICKIE
               Freddie drove me back in his car.

                         RIPLEY
                   (horrified)
               Is Freddie here?

                         DICKIE
               He's downstairs.

                         RIPLEY
               I was just fooling around. Don't say
               anything. Sorry.

     Dickie lets him leave and then sits amongst the debris of the
     dressing-up session, not amused.

     EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. DAY.

     Ripley comes down, apprehensive, to find Marge and Dickie and
     Freddie having a jolly breakfast on the terrace. Dickie looks
     perfectly happy.

                         MARGE
               Hi, Tom.  Come join us.

                         FREDDIE
               I want this job of yours, Tommy. I was
               just saying - You live in Italy, sleep in
               Dickie's house, eat Dickie's food, wear
               his clothes, and his father picks up the
               tab. If you get bored, let me know, I'll
               do it!

     EXT. THE OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DAY.

     The boat is drifting.  Freddie and Dickie and Marge are
     swimming, then Marge climbs back onto the boat, where Ripley
     is sitting alone, reading.

                         MARGE
               You really should go in, it's marvellous.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm fine.

     She approaches him, conscious of his isolation. She's in a
     red bikini, and she towels herself dry as they speak.

                         MARGE
               Are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               Sure.

     They watch Dickie and Freddie fooling around in the water.

                         MARGE
               The thing with Dickie - it's like the sun
               shines on you and it's glorious, then he
               forgets you and it's very very cold.

                         RIPLEY
               So I'm learning.

                         MARGE
               He's not even aware of it. When you've
               got his attention you feel like you're
               the only person in the world. That's why
               everybody loves him. Other times...

     There's a yell from Dickie as Freddie wrestles with him.

                         DICKIE
                   (laughing and choking)
               He's drowning me!

                         MARGE
               It's always the same whenever someone new
               comes into his life - Freddie, Fausto,
               Peter Smith-Kingsley - he's wonderful -
               did you meet him, he's a musician? -
               ... and especially you, of course... and
               that's only the boys.

     They watch as Freddie pushes Dickie under the surface.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               Tell me, why is it when men play they
               always play at killing each other...?
               I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.

                         RIPLEY
               What about Cortina?

                         MARGE
               Didn't Dick say? - he talked to
               Freddie... apparently it's not going to
               work out -
                   (Ripley's devastated, Marge
                    notices, can't look at him)
               Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.

     EXT. OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DUSK.

     LATER and now the boat is sailing again. Ripley is sitting in
     his spot. Dickie and Freddie are at the tiller.

                         DICKIE
               Come on, Frederico, do you really have
               to go back?  At least stick around for
               the Festival of the Madonna.

                         FREDDIE
               I don't think so. Come back with me to
               Rome. There's this great new club.  Have
               some drinks, lotta ladies...

     Marge, still in her bikini, disappears into the cabin. Dickie
     makes a face at Freddie.

                         DICKIE
               Do you think you can steer this thing?

                         FREDDIE
               Sure.

                         DICKIE
               Just point her at Capri and avoid the
               rocks.

                         FREDDIE
               What are you doing?

                         DICKIE
               Marge-maintenance.

                         FREDDIE
               Aye, aye.

     Dickie heads towards the cabin. Freddie takes over the
     tiller. There's a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the
     water.

     From where Ripley sits he can see Capri in the distance, but
     he can also look down into the cabin, its porthole offering
     him a restricted view.  He looks down and there's a flash of
     flesh, then nothing.  Then as the boat swings with the waves,
     he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair, and then
     Marge's bare foot kicking out rhythmically, the red-painted
     toes straining.  Ripley's mesmerized, aroused, and absolutely
     betrayed.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               Tommy - How's the peeping? Come on Tommy,
               you were looking.  Tommy Tommy Tommy.

     Shamed, Ripley looks away. He stares at the water, parting
     before the boat, its turmoil reflecting his.

     EXT. DICKIE'S MOORING. DAY.

     The Bird returns to the mooring by Dickie's House.  Dickie as
     ever Captain of the Ship, clambering around, shouting
     instructions, with Ripley, Marge and Freddie as crew.  Ripley
     looks back at shore. Silvana stands watching, staring.
     Dickie notices her too.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO SLIPWAY. LATE DAY.

     A WOMAN'S HEAD suddenly breaks the surface of the water.

     It's a statue of the Virgin Mary, life size, adorned with
     flowers and a lace veil.  As she is revealed, wooden,
     staring, four men emerge, lifting the statue on a palette,
     wading towards the shore, the Madonna aloft on their
     shoulders.

     The whole town of Mongibello is in attendance for this Annual
     Festival of the Madonna del Mare, either standing in their
     fishing boats, or on shore and flanking the Parish Priest and
     altar boys and incense. RIPLEY, DICKIE and MARGE watch from
     Dickie's terrace. There are hymns and, as the statue is
     carried to the shore, the men's heads barely above the waves,
     the congregation applauds at the illusion that the Madonna is
     walking on water.

     Suddenly ANOTHER HEAD appears on the surface of the water,
     about fifty yards from the statue. There's a scream from
     among the crowd as someone notices the body. It's SILVANA.
     One of the MEN carrying the statue turns first towards the
     direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse.
     It's Silvana's fiancee, and in a second he has let go of the
     palette, CAUSING IT TO TOPPLE, and - in absolute grief -
     wades, swims, splashes towards the body.

     PANDEMONIUM in the crowd, which breaks up, with other people
     splashing, fully clothed, into the water. From the terrace,
     Ripley turns and looks at Dickie, catching his eye.

     EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. LATE DAY.

     Marge and Ripley and Dickie watch from the terrace as below
     them an AMBULANCE takes away the body. It seems as if the
     whole town looks on - fiancee, parents, brothers, sisters,
     police, priest, etc. As the corpse is loaded into the vehicle
     A BRIEF SCUFFLE occurs between Silvana's fiancee and her
     brother. They are pulled apart. Then the ambulance pulls
     away.

                         RIPLEY
               What's the fight about? That's her
               fiancÈ, isn't it?  Are they blaming him?

                         DICKIE
                   (sharp)
               I don't know! Why are you asking me?
                   (agitated)
               How can it take an hour to find an
               ambulance?

                         MARGE
                   (conciliatory)
               Well, she was already dead, darling,
               wasn't she, so I suppose -

                         DICKIE
               I don't know why people say this
               country's civilised. It isn't. It's
               fucking primitive.

     And with that HE KICKS OUT VIOLENTLY AT A CHAIR SUPPORTING
     THE RECORDPLAYER. Records, machine, chair go flying across
     the terrace. Dickie storms inside.

                         MARGE
               Dickie!

                         RIPLEY
               I'll go and see what's the matter.

                         MARGE
               I'll go.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Later, Dickie is slumped in an armchair at the open window
     overlooking the slipway. He's playing sax. A forlorn, keening
     phrase from YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS. Ripley appears,
     begins tidying the mess in the living room.  He picks up
     empty bottles, an abandoned bikini top.

                         RIPLEY
               I know why you're upset.
                   (Dickie continues playing)
               I know about Silvana, Dickie. About you
               and Silvana.

     Dickie stops playing.

                         DICKIE
               What about us?

     He now has an armful of dishes and glasses and bottles.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
                   (losing his temper)
               You don't have to clean up! Really!

     Ripley disappears into the kitchen.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
                   (as Ripley returns)
               She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do
               you know what that means in a place like
               this?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm prepared to take the blame.

                         DICKIE
               What are you talking about?

                         RIPLEY
               You've been so good to me. You're the
               brother I never had. I'm the brother you
               never had.

                         DICKIE
               She came to me for help, she needed
               money, and I didn't help her. I didn't
               help her. Now she's dead and it's my
               fault.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm not going to say anything - to Marge,
               or anybody, the police - It's a secret
               between us and I'll keep it.

     And he disappears again, leaving Dickie to resume the sax,
     somehow in thrall to Ripley.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               Dear Tom, I think the time has come to
               discontinue your expense checks...

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, NAPLES. DAY.

     Ripley and Dickie are walking out of the American Express
     Office, Dickie pushing the rest of his money into his case,
     Ripley - despondent - reading aloud extracts from a letter
     from Herbert Greenleaf -

                         RIPLEY
               ...The thousand dollars, of course, was
               only due in the event that you succeeded
               in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I
               hope the trip has afforded you some
               pleasure despite the failure of its main
               objective you need no longer consider
               yourself obligated to us in any way...

                         DICKIE
               You can't blame him.  You could hardly
               expect this to go on forever.

                         RIPLEY
               I thought you might write again. Now that
               we're brothers...

                         DICKIE
               I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've
               had a good run, haven't we?

                         RIPLEY
                   (increasingly miserable)
               What about Venice? Can we stick to that
               plan at least?

                         DICKIE
               I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on
               here without money.  It's time we all
               moved on.  Besides I'm sick of Mongi.
               Especially now with everything - I really
               want to move to the North. I need to
               check out San Remo next week, find
               somewhere new to keep the boat.
               But it would be great, though, if you
               came with me.  Our last trip before you
               leave. There's a jazz festival - we could
               say goodbye in style.  What do you think?
               A last trip?

     INT. TRAIN TO SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.

     Dickie and Ripley travel up to San Remo. They sit next to
     each other. Dickie's asleep. Ripley lays his head on Dickie's
     shoulder, but as he does that, the ticket inspector announces
     the San Remo stop, taps on the window and Dickie stirs. Then
     Ripley plays his familiar game of studying his face in the
     reflection of the train window, so that he can move his head
     and see his reflection, then back and see Dickie's.  Dickie
     suddenly catches him staring. Ripley looks away.

                         DICKIE
                   (terse)
               Why do you do that thing - with your
               neck? On trains you always do that thing,
               it's so spooky.

     EXT. HOTEL TERRACE RESTAURANT, SAN REMO. NIGHT.

     Dickie and Ripley walk through the terrace of an hotel which
     lips out towards the sea. There's a restaurant and palms and
     a JAZZ QUINTET playing, American. Very cool. They pass the
     band. Dickie's captivated as they head for their table. They
     pass some girls at a table. Dickie smiles greedily.

                         DICKIE
               This is more like it. Didn't I tell you
               San Remo was crazy!

     They're shown to a good table. Dickie watches the band while
     their glasses are filled with champagne. Ripley looks happy.
     He's got Dickie all to himself.

                         RIPLEY
               To Mongibello and the happiest days of my
               life.

                         DICKIE
               To Mongi.  You're cheerful tonight.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm suddenly quite happy to be going
               back.

                         DICKIE
               That's good.

                         RIPLEY
               I've got plans!

                         DICKIE
               Ripley's plans.

                         RIPLEY
               Esatto. I'm always planning.

                         DICKIE
               Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I
               didn't, did I?

                         RIPLEY
               Why are you asking all of a sudden?

                         DICKIE
               No reason. Because you're leaving, I
               guess. I don't think you were there, were
               you?

                         RIPLEY
               Why?

                         DICKIE
               I mean it as a compliment. You've got
               such great taste, I don't know. Most of
               the thugs at Princeton had tasted
               everything and had no taste. Used to say,
               the cream of America: rich and thick.
               Freddie's the perfect example.

                         RIPLEY
               Then I'll take it as a compliment.

                         DICKIE
               I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!

                         RIPLEY
                   (a beat)
               Ha.

                         DICKIE
               Do you even like jazz - or was that
               something for my benefit?

                         RIPLEY
                   (conceding, without guile)
               I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to
               like everything about the way you live.
               It's one big love affair. If you knew my
               life back home in New York...

     Dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert
     solo, doesn't hear the confession of love.

                         DICKIE
               I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what
               do you think about drums?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               So cool.

     He mimes a high-hat and snare. Ripley can't quite credit this
     - it's superficiality.

     EXT. MID OCEAN. DAY.

     The bay of San Remo. DICKIE and RIPLEY have hired a motor 
     boat.

                         DICKIE
               That's how I found my place in Mongi.
               Took a boat out round the bay.  The first
               place I liked, I got it.

     The motor boat is ploughing the waves. Dickie exhilarated by
     the speed.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie, slow down, come on!

     Ripley grips the oar, his knuckles white. Dickie cuts the
     motor, and the boat slows to a crawl, miles from the shore.

                         DICKIE
                   (ecstatic)
               I love it here! Gonna live here!

     Dickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of
     the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers,
     already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich.

                         RIPLEY
               I wanted to tell you my plan.

                         DICKIE
               So tell me.

                         RIPLEY
               I thought I might come back. In the New
               Year. Under my own steam.

                         DICKIE
                   (suddenly tight)
               Really?  To Italy?

                         RIPLEY
               Of course. Let's say, for argument's
               sake, you were here - perhaps we could
               split the rent on a house - I'll get a
               job - or, better still, I could get a
               place in Rome and when we're there we
               could be there and if we're here we could
               be here -

                         DICKIE
               Oh God, I don't think so.

                         RIPLEY
               - you see, particularly with the Marge
               problem, you can just blame me.

                         DICKIE
               Marge and I are getting married.

                         RIPLEY
                   (appalled)
               How?

                         DICKIE
               How?

                         RIPLEY
               Yesterday you're ogling girls on the
               terrace, today you're getting married.
               It's absurd.

                         DICKIE
               I love Marge.

                         RIPLEY
               You love me and you're not marrying me.

                         DICKIE
                   (cold)
               Tom, I don't love you.

                         RIPLEY
               No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained
               all of that.

                         DICKIE
               I'm actually a little relieved you're
               going, to be honest. I think we've seen
               enough of each other for a while.

     Ripley stares at him, his eyes suddenly reptilian.

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               You can be a leech - you know this - and
               it's boring. You can be quite boring.

                         RIPLEY
                   (volcanic)
               The funny thing - I'm not pretending to
               be somebody else and you are. I'm
               absolutely honest with you. I've told you
               my feelings. But you, first of all I know
               there's something - that evening when we
               played chess, for instance, it was
               obvious -

                         DICKIE
                   (incredulous)
               What evening?

                         RIPLEY
               Sure - I know, that's too dangerous for
               you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers,
               fine, then you do this sordid thing with
               Marge, fucking her on the boat while we
               all have to listen, which was
               excruciating, frankly, plus you follow
               your cock around like a - and now you're
               getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive
               me...you're lying to Marge then getting
               married to her, you're knocking up
               Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've
               got to play drums, which is it, Dickie,
               what do you really play?

     Dickie, furious, gets up, and lurches towards Ripley.

                         DICKIE
                   (attacking him, administering
                    tiny slaps as punctuation to
                    his tirade)
               Who are you - some imposter, some third
               class mooch - who are you to tell me
               anything? Actually, I really really
               really don't want to be on this boat with
               you, I can't move without you moving,
               which is exactly how it feels and it
               gives me the creeps.
                   (he goes to rev up the engine)
               I can't move without - "Dickie, Dickie,
               Dickie" - like a little girl.  You give
               me the -

     RIPLEY SMASHES HIM ACROSS THE HEAD WITH THE OAR. DICKIE SLIPS
     OFF THE WOODEN SEAT, HIS EYES ROLLING IN GROGGY SURPRISE.

                         RIPLEY
               Shut up! Just shut up! Just shut up!

     The boat slows as Dickie releases the tiller.  Dickie looks
     up at Ripley wearily and slides onto his back.

                         DICKIE
               For God's sake.

     Ripley, shocked at himself, goes to Dickie, rocking the boat,
     catches him up, then is horrified to see Dickie's face,
     apparently unmarked, SUDDENLY SPLIT OPEN, a line of blood and
     then a peeling like a fruit bursting. Ripley's appalled.  A
     terrible roar issues from Dickie as he launches himself at
     Ripley.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               I'll kill you!

     Ripley finds himself pushing him away, picking up the oar,
     kicking off Dickie's hand around his ankle. The boat is
     rocking and swerving crazily as Dickie falls against the
     tiller. Ripley almost loses his balance. His glasses come
     off. They struggle, locked together in a life or death
     wrestle to get control of the oar. Dickie's blinded by his
     own blood, loses his grip.

     Ripley, terrified, hits Dickie again and again, the oar like
     a carpet-beater banging down flat, blood on the blade, blood
     on Ripley, until he's on his knees, heaving for breath,
     letting his arm drop, then realizing, disgusted, that he's
     let it rest in a pool of blood. He starts to sob, sprawls
     there, sobbing, next to Dickie, horrified by what he's done.

     Nobody's in sight.  The boat rocks, gently, the sun sparkling
     indifferently on the waves.  Ripley lies by Dickie in the
     bottom of the boat, in the embrace he's always wanted.

     The pretty blue-and-white boat rocks peacefully.  The sea
     calms.

     EXT. A COVE NEAR SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.

     A deserted cove, several miles along the coast. Ripley
     clambers onto a rock over the shore.  He's watching the boat
     slowly sinking. Shuddering from the exertion, the cold, he
     finds Dickie's jacket, puts it on and watches as the boat
     disappears under the surface.

     EXT. SAN REMO. DUSK.

     Ripley walks back towards the hotel, still wearing Dickie's
     jacket, cold and wet, his bag over his shoulder.

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley approaches the front desk.  He's shivering.  He's not
     wearing his glasses.

                         RIPLEY
               Can I have my key, please?

                         RECEPTIONIST
                   (at the key rack)
               Of course - But you must be very cold?
               Signor Greenleaf?  Yes? -

                         RIPLEY
                   (mind racing)
               No, it's - I'm...

     EXT. ROAD BETWEEN NAPLES AND MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley sits on the bus as it rumbles towards Mongi.  He
     stares out of the window, full of what he's done. No idea
     what to do.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. DAY.

     The BUS comes into town. Ripley gets out, looks calm, very
     together.

     INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM, MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley walks into the living room, slowly approaches
     Dickie's saxophone which is on its stand on the table.  He
     can't get close to it, it evokes Dickie too much.

     INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. DAY.

     Ripley has Dickie's Hermes Baby typewriter on the desk and is
     busy writing letters. He has finished a letter to the
     Greenleafs, now he's at the end of one to Marge. We can read
     part of it - C/O American Express, Rome 9 November 1958. Dear
     Marge, this is a difficult letter for me to write... Ripley
     produces the Shakespeare and Signature page and COPIES
     DICKIE'S SIGNATURE at the end of the letter.

     EXT. MARGE'S GARDEN, MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley stands at the entrance to Marge's garden where she is
     working at her book on the outside table, surrounded by
     references and notes, held down by bricks. He looks at her
     until she looks at him. She's startled, gasps.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Marge.

                         MARGE
               Tom, you startled me!  You're back.

                         RIPLEY
               How are you? Sorry. Is your book going
               well?

                         MARGE
               Yes - I'm on a good streak, thanks.

                         RIPLEY
               I was just looking at you -
                   (looking at her tenderly)
               - so quiet.

                         MARGE
               Where's Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               I think he's planning on staying in Rome
               for a few days.

                         MARGE
                   (looks at him)
               Ha. Did he say why?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. I don't understand Dickie,
               Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.

                         MARGE
               What does that mean?

                         RIPLEY
               Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the
               next day I'm not, one day we're all one
               family, the next day he wants to be
               alone. You tell me.

                         MARGE
               Is that what he said - he wanted to be
               alone?

                         RIPLEY
               He was thinking of you, Marge - he asked
               me to deliver this.

     He hands her a package. She pulls at it, it's perfume.

                         MARGE
               Thanks. he knows I love this, although
               why it couldn't have waited...

                         RIPLEY
               Errand number one - deliver Marge's
               perfume. Errand number two, pack some
               clothes and his precious saxophone.

                         MARGE
                   (alarmed)
               How long's he staying for?

                         RIPLEY
               Search me. I guess we're abandoned.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, BEACH. EARLY MORNING.

     Marge is walking along the beach and out onto the jetty,
     forlorn, a bleached figure on this winter morning.

     INT. OFF FROM DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. MORNING.

     As Ripley walks down the stairs, Marge is at the icebox in
     the living room. She's fixing herself a drink, has the icebox
     open for ice. She's ashen, and might have been weeping, walks
     back into the kitchen area.

                         MARGE
               There was a letter from Dickie in with my
               perfume. You realize it's more than a few
               days? He's thinking of moving to Rome.

     She bangs out the ice onto the counter, cubes falling
     everywhere. Ripley drops to the floor and starts to clear
     them up.  She's got the letter, shows it to Ripley. He puts
     fresh ice into her glass.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               The thing is, the night before he left,
               we talked about moving, together, going
               North - and I suppose I put some pressure
               on him, about getting married, I just
               might have scared him off. There's a side
               to him, when our heads are on the pillow,
               I know no-one else sees it, which is
               really tender.
                   (unravelling)
               I think I should come with you to Rome
               and just confront him.

     Ripley lights a cigarette.  Marge loses confidence.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               He hates being confronted.

                         RIPLEY
               I think you're right.

     INT. ALBERGO GOLDONI, ROME. DAY.

     RIPLEY'S BATTERED CASES are carried into the tiny lobby of
     this small hotel. He exchanges his passport at the desk for
     his room key, then makes his way, carrying his own luggage to
     the metal cage elevator. THIS SCENE INTERCUTS WITH:

     INT. HOTEL GRAND. DAY.

     DICKIE'S ARRAY OF LEATHER LUGGAGE is pulled along on a 
     baggage trolley by a liveried PORTER.

     Dickie's passport slides across the marble desk. A key comes
     back, collected by a hand sporting Dickie's two distinctive
     rings.  As ALDO, the Front Desk Manager, inspects the
     passport, he looks at the owner.  Ripley wears a terrific
     suit, his hair parted in the Greenleaf style, no glasses. His
     voice, when he speaks, has the same, lazy, confident drawl.

                         ALDO
               Welcome back, Signor Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
                   (walking away)
               Thank you.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. DAY.

     The PORTER takes the cases and opens them as Ripley walks
     around the suite. It's large and splendid. Ripley breathes in
     its opulence.  He immediately picks up the telephone.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, I'd like you to telephone the Hotel
               Goldoni. Yes. I want to speak to Signor
               Thomas Ripley - No Ripley, R, yes.
               Grazie.

     He produces Dickie's pen and signs the blotter quickly - H R
     Greenleaf.  Then he pulls out a postcard from the writing
     case to reveal Dickie's Stars, hide your fires handwriting
     specimen. He compares the two signatures, is pleased.

     The telephone rings.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Pronto? Signor Ripley is not there? I'd
               like to leave a message. Yes. Please call
               Dickie - Dickie Greenleaf - at the Grand.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOTEL ROOM, GOLDONI. DAY.

     A tiny, cell of a room, single bed. Ripley on the phone.

                         RIPLEY
               He's not there?  Very well. I'll leave a
               message - Got your call. Dinner tonight
               sounds fine. Ripley.
                   (listens as it's read back)
               Dinner tonight, yes, is okay. Yes, thank
               you.

     INT. GUCCI STORE, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley has bought some more LEATHER GOODS - a briefcase and
     overnight bag. He is at the counter, signing checks.

                         RIPLEY
               I'd like these to have my initials -
               embossed, I don't know the word in
               Italian ...embossed?

                         GUCCI ASSISTANT
               Embossed, of course, Signor Greenleaf.

     There's an excited rap on the window and a shout of DICKIE!
     Shocked, Ripley looks over to find MEREDITH LOGUE outside,
     alone and delighted to see him.  He grins and mouths hello.

                         MEREDITH
                   (entering the shop)
               Dickie! Oh my God!  Ciao.

     EXT. ACROSS PIAZZA NAVONA TO ARCARI'S CAFE. DAY.

     Ripley and Meredith walk across the Piazza towards the cafe.

                         MEREDITH
               But you're going skiing with us Yankees,
               aren't you?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MEREDITH
               At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie
               Miles and -

                         RIPLEY
                   (interrupting, astonished)
               How did you know that?

                         MEREDITH
               Everybody knows Freddie Miles.

                         RIPLEY
                   (unsettled)
               Is Freddie in Rome?

                         MEREDITH
               Now? I don't think so. But I've met him,
               of course, and we've chatted and I know
               about you and Marge and Mongi and what an
               unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you
               were a rat and I thought to myself now I
               know why he travels under R.

                         RIPLEY
               I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So
               the rat's here now, in Rome.

                         MEREDITH
               Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if -

                         RIPLEY
               Don't be sorry. I've never been happier.
               I feel like I've been handed a new life.

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.

     Meredith and Ripley walk down the Spanish Steps and head
     inside the office.

                         MEREDITH
               The truth is if you've had money your
               entire life, even if you despise it,
               which we do - agreed? - you're only truly
               comfortable around other people who have
               it and despise it.

                         RIPLEY
               I know.

                         MEREDITH
               I've never admitted that to anyone.

     INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley's signing Dickie's allowance receipt. Meredith is with
     him, signing her own counterfoil. He is, of course, endorsed
     by her presence.  She goes to the window ahead of him.

     She takes her money, turns to him.

     He hands over his documents. The Clerk compares Ripley's
     signature with the one on the passport and then looks up at
     him. Ripley is cool as a cucumber.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't want too many large bills. Nobody
               will change them.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. ANOTHER DAY.

     Where A TAILOR is finishing the fitting of a cashmere jacket
     for Ripley. Bolts of cloth everywhere as Meredith adjudicates
     the possible materials, which the tailor holds up against
     Ripley.

                         MEREDITH
               Show me the other one again.
                   (the Tailor obliges)
               I like them both.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll take them both.

     Ripley goes inside the bedroom to change. While he's inside,
     Meredith shows the Tailor out.  As she returns she notices
     the open sax case, peers inside.

                         MEREDITH (O/S)
               I know you're a jazz fiend but do you
               absolutely hate the Opera?  I've been
               trying to give my tickets away, it's
               tomorrow, but if you were prepared to be
               dragged...

     She looks up to catch him bare-chested. She's intoxicated by
     him, the romance she feels to be in the air.

                         RIPLEY
                   (emerging)
               You could drag me.

     INT. THE OPERA HOUSE, ROME.

     On stage is Act Two of Eugene Onegin.  Lensky sings his aria
     before the duel with Onegin.

     Ripley's in a tuxedo, in a box which includes a glamorous
     Meredith and her AUNT AND UNCLE.  He knows what comes next.
     Lensky is shot by Onegin. Blood pours from his neck into the
     snow.  Onegin, horrified at the death of his friend, goes
     over, wraps Lensky in his cloak, the silk lining flashing,
     kneels holding him... Ripley can barely hide his emotion...
     Meredith watches her sensitive friend, entranced.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE BOXES, OPERA HOUSE, ROME.

     The Interval.  Ripley and Meredith exit their box with
     Meredith's Aunt and Uncle (who heads for the interval
     drinks).

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.

                         JOAN
               Can you bear it?  We hear you're a friend
               of Freddie's - he has I hate Opera
               tattooed on his chest.

                         RIPLEY
               There's room for a whole libretto on
               Freddie's chest.

                         JOAN
                   (laughs)
               I'm sure we've met.

     They reach the console where Uncle Ted has their drinks.

                         JOAN (cont'd)
               I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted?
               This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks, yes, I think we did.

                         JOAN
               One minute you people are children and
               the next you're getting tattooed.

     INT. OPERA HOUSE, FOYER. NIGHT.

     Ripley heads past the Beautiful People on his hunt for the
     Men's Room, and walks straight into a young and cultured
     Englishman.  They greet each other and suddenly MARGE is
     beside them.

                         MARGE
                   (as if she's seen a ghost)
               Oh my God. Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, how are you? What are you doing in
               Rome?

                         MARGE
               Is he here? Are you with Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               No.
                   (to Smith-Kingsley)
               Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.

                         PETER
               Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about
               you, of course - from Marge, and Dickie.

                         MARGE
                   (works out what's strange)
               No glasses.

     He fishes out the glasses.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Peter)
               Ditto.

                         PETER
               Where are you hiding him? He's
               impossible, isn't he?

                         MARGE
               Is he really not here?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera
               tattooed on his chest.

                         MARGE
               You were going to Venice.

                         PETER
               Yes, what happened? I heard you were
               desperate to come. I was looking forward
               to rowing you around.

                         RIPLEY
               I am.  I really am. And I've been
               travelling. I just can't seem to get that
               far north.

                         PETER
               Well hurry, before we sink.
                   (reaches into his jacket)
               Should I give you my telephone number in
               Venice?

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

     The INTERVAL BELL'S ringing. Peter hands over his card to
     Ripley, sees Meredith.

                         PETER
               Look there's Meredith thingy - who's
               that, Marge? - they're in textiles...
               Meredith -
                   (embarrassed at not
                    remembering)
               God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in
               her house...!

                         MARGE
               I don't know her.
                   (to Ripley)
               He hasn't called, he's hardly written,
               just these cryptic notes. You don't just
               dump people.

     The last INTERVAL BELL. There's a mini-stampede to return.

                         PETER
               Will we see you later?

                         RIPLEY
               I can't later.

                         PETER
               And tomorrow?

                         RIPLEY
               Tomorrow's possible. Do you know
               Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?

                         PETER
               I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?

                         RIPLEY
               Ten thirty?

                         PETER
               We'll be there.

                         RIPLEY
               Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.
                   (to Peter)
               It's really good to meet you.

     INT. BOX, OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT.

     Ripley goes straight to Meredith and grabs her.

                         RIPLEY
               Let's go.

                         MEREDITH
               I thought you were enjoying yourself?

                         RIPLEY
               Let's take a Carozza and look at the
               moon.

                         MEREDITH
               You're crazy! It's freezing out there.

     He's looking past her, where a mirror reflects Marge wading
     through the audience, Peter's elegant head getting
     dangerously near as they approach their seats.

                         RIPLEY
               C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the
               two of us.

                         MEREDITH
                   (quite taken)
               Okay then, you're crazy.

     EXT. CAROZZA, ROME. NIGHT.

     Meredith shivers in the raw night as they cross the Tiber.
     Ripley as Dickie is confessing his heart belongs to Marge.

                         MEREDITH
               Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.

                         RIPLEY
               You're such a pal to understand. It's as
               if Marge is here now - I look at you and
               I see her face - and I can't, whatever
               I'm feeling towards you - I just can't...

                         MEREDITH
               No, I absolutely understand. Of course.

                         RIPLEY
               Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.

                         MEREDITH
               Beating you away.

     EXT. MEREDITH'S APARTMENT, ROME.

     They arrive at the courtyard outside Meredith's Apartment
     Building. Ripley jumps down, collects her. She makes to go
     inside, then looks at him.

                         MEREDITH
               Will you meet me tomorrow?  Just to say
               goodbye in the daylight, properly? So
               it's not just this, it's too...you should
               always save pain for daylight...

                         RIPLEY
               Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll
               meet you. Let's have coffee in the
               morning at Dinelli's.

                         MEREDITH
                   (fluttering)
               I don't - is that by the Spanish Steps?

                         RIPLEY
               Exactly. 10.30 -
                   (instantly correcting himself)
               10.15.

     He gets back into the carozza. It moves off.

     EXT. DINELLI'S CAFE, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. MORNING.

     Meredith sits waiting in a cafe at the bottom of the Spanish
     Steps. Ripley, dressed as Ripley, is at the top of the steps,
     among early tourists, watching as she drinks her coffee at an
     outside table. Then Marge and Peter appear walking up the Via
     Condotti, head for another table, don't see Meredith.  She
     acknowledges Peter who hasn't noticed her.

                         MEREDITH
               Peter? Hello, it's Meredith Logue.

                         PETER
               Of course it is, Meredith, hello, I'm
               sorry, half-asleep, how are you? This is
               Marge Sherwood. Meredith Logue.

                         MARGE
               Hello.

     Hearing Marge's name Meredith reacts, freezes.

                         PETER
               Join us, won't you? We're just waiting
               for a friend. Do you know, I wonder did
               we see you at the Opera last night?

                         MEREDITH
               I won't actually, although I think this
               might - are you waiting for Dickie?

                         PETER
               Well no, as it happens, although...

                         MARGE
                   (stunned at the mention of his
                    name)
               Dickie? Do you know Dickie?

                         MEREDITH
               You were at the Opera? Well, that
               explains - yes I was there. I was there
               with Dickie.

                         MARGE
                   (to Peter)
               I told you! I knew it!

                         MEREDITH
                   (moving over to them)
               Marge, I don't know you, so I have no
               right, but Dickie loves you.  He's - I
               think you'll find he's coming home to
               you.

                         MARGE
                   (proprietorial)
               How would you know that?

                         MEREDITH
               He told me everything. I was supposed to
               meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I...I'm
               going to go now, I think. Unless he meant
               us to meet - which would be a little
               cruel, wouldn't it?

                         PETER
               No, we're meeting another friend. Tom
               Ripley.

                         MARGE
               Do you know Tom?

                         MEREDITH
               Ripley? No. I heard about him, of course,
               but no, I didn't meet him.

     The WAITER has arrived to take orders. Meredith indicates
     she's leaving.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               Not for me. No, grazie.

     Marge is on the edge. Peter lays a hand to comfort her.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               I hope I didn't complicate matters, but
               nothing, nothing untoward happened,
               nothing to prevent you from welcoming him
               back, from marrying him...Goodbye.
               Goodbye Peter, please don't get up.

     Peter gets up. Ripley, from his vantage point at the top of
     the steps, watches Meredith leave and walk off into the
     crowd. He begins the slow walk down towards the square. As he
     becomes visible to the cafe, he starts to hurry. He's
     apologising to Marge and Peter as they see him, in his
     element, lying and believing in his lie.

                         RIPLEY
               Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers.
               Italian bureaucracy - never one stamp
               when they can make you line up for three.
               Have you been waiting long?

                         PETER
               Not at all. Morning Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Hi.
                   (to Marge)
               Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've
               seen a ghost...

                         MARGE
               Dickie was at the Opera last night.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't
               drag Dickie to -

                         MARGE
               He was there with someone. So I suppose
               she must have dragged him - that's not
               fair.  I'm going back to Mongi. I think
               Dickie's coming home.
                   (to Peter)
               I'm going to go home.

                         RIPLEY
               Really? That's swell. No, I was just -
               you're way ahead of me! Great!

                         PETER
               We think he's had a change of heart.
                   (to Marge)
               So we should be celebrating.

                         MARGE
               I hope so.

                         PETER
                   (to Marge)
               That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith
               said -
                   (to Ripley)
               Meredith's the American girl I saw last
               night, I know her, at the Opera, she's
               been seeing something of Dickie -

                         RIPLEY
               My God.

                         PETER
               But the point is Dickie - well we know
               this - Dickie loves Marge and he misses
               her and apparently he's come to his
               senses...

                         RIPLEY
               It's fantastic.
                   (to Peter)
               I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand
               this, but anytime Dickie does something I
               feel guilty.

     INT. APARTMENT, PALAZZA GIOIA. DAY.

     Ripley is being shown an APARTMENT FOR RENT in the Palazzo
     Gioia by a dry-witted older woman, SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley
     explores, relishing the decor.

                         SIGNORA BUFFI
               Accendo il riscaldamento.
               (I'll turn the heating on.)

                         RIPLEY
                   (mimes playing sax)
               Mi piace suonare.
               (I like to play music.)

                         SIGNORA BUFFI
                   (shrugs)
               Io sono sorda. Quelli di sotto, una
               coppia, sono sordi. Allora, ti piace?
               (I'm deaf. The couple below are deaf. So,
               do you like it?)

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley is in the apartment, fire burning, wearing pyjamas.
     There's a small Christmas tree. He kneels on the floor with
     some festive, gift-wrapped packages. He opens a package. It's
     a marble head of Hadrian. A gasp from Ripley. He picks up a
     glass, pours himself a drink.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley plunges into Bach's Italian Concerto on his new and
     precious toy, a STEINWAY GRAND. His doorbell rings. He stops
     playing. He doesn't get visitors. He rises, a little nervous.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello?

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               Who is it?

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               It's Freddie. Let me in.

     RIPLEY ALMOST COLLAPSES. He's faint.

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Dickie, come on, it's me.

     Ripley can't think what to hide, where to hide. He opens the
     door.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.

                         FREDDIE
                   (confused, not pleasantly)
               Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at
               dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?

                         FREDDIE
               I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm.
               If you said he was still at lunch I'd
               believe you. Incredible. The guy has
               disappeared off the face of the earth.

                         RIPLEY
               I guess.

                         FREDDIE
               The landlady - as far as I could tell,
               the landlady said he was here right now.

                         RIPLEY
               He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I
               can't think why you would imagine Dickie
               would hide from you.

                         FREDDIE
               Because he's been hiding from me - what
               happened at Christmas?

                         RIPLEY
               What about Christmas?

                         FREDDIE
               He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't
               get a cable or a call or a note or,
               frankly, a fart.

     Ripley has his hands behind his back. HE'S TUGGING
     FRANTICALLY AT DICKIE'S RINGS. Ripley wanders into the
     kitchen, turns on the tap to sluice his fingers.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               Of course, he's been very involved in his
               music, hasn't he? I think his theory is,
               you know, you have to go into a cocoon
               before you can become a butterfly.

                         FREDDIE
               Which is horseshit.  Have you heard him
               play that thing?
                   (gesturing at the sax on its
                    stand)
               He can't.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
                   (casually)
               How did you find him? It's such an out of
               the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?

                         FREDDIE
               No thanks.
                   (explaining his detective work)
               Some kid at the American Express Office.
                   (he starts to explore)
               Are you living here?

     Now he starts to hammer a nasty boogie-woogie on the piano.

                         RIPLEY
                   (returning, flinching)
               No. No, I'm staying here for a few days,
               in Rome.  That's a new piano, so you prob -

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Did this place come furnished? It doesn't
               look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? - so
               bourgeois.

     Now he's poking at the Hadrian bust.

                         RIPLEY
               You should watch that!

                         FREDDIE
               In fact the only thing which looks like
               Dickie is you.

                         RIPLEY
               Hardly.

                         FREDDIE
               Have you done something to your hair?

     Ripley starts to smile, his eyes darting around the room.

                         RIPLEY
               Freddie, do you have something to say?

                         FREDDIE
               What? I think I'm saying it. Something's
               going on. He's either converted to
               Christianity - or to something else.

                         RIPLEY
               I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself.
               Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the
               Corso.

                         FREDDIE
               Is it on "delle Croce, just off the
               Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you?
               Last time you didn't know your ass from
               your elbow, now you're giving me
               directions. That's not fair, you probably
               do know your ass from your elbow. I'll
               see you.

     AND HE'S GONE. Ripley shuts the door, smooths the silk runner
     on the table where Freddie's hand had rucked it. He goes back
     to the door, opens it and looks over the rail.

     INT. LANDING AND STAIRS, RIPLEY'S BUILDING. LATE DAY.

     FREDDIE IS BACK IN CONVERSATION WITH SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley
     can't make out the text but there's some discussion about
     Signor Greenleaf and Signor Ripley. Ripley hurries inside as
     Freddie's heavy shoes start to clump up the stairs again.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. LATE DAY.

     Freddie knocks on the door which pushes open. As he marches
     in, he launches into his interrogation.

                         FREDDIE
               Ripley? There's someth -

     - AND WALKS STRAIGHT INTO THE HEAD OF HADRIAN WHICH RIPLEY
     SWINGS AT HIM, HOLDING ON AWKWARDLY WITH BOTH HANDS TO THE
     HEAVY MARBLE SCULPTURE.

     Freddie falls like an ox, first to his knees, groaning, then
     to the floor as Ripley brings the head down again, beating
     him downwards. As Freddie slumps away, Ripley loses his
     balance and the head sends Freddie a glancing blow before
     slipping from Ripley's grasp and smashing on to the floor.
     THE NOSE IS CHIPPED OFF.

     EXT. PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     It's deserted. Ripley hauls Freddie out of the shadows
     towards the car. A couple walk across the square. Ripley
     talks to Freddie, berating him for his drunken stupor. He
     pushes him over the door and into the passenger seat.

                         RIPLEY
                   (mimicking Freddie's voice)
               Hey, if I'm drunk, think what her
               husband's saying.

     EXT. VIA APPIA ANTICA. NIGHT.

     The Fiat noses along THE APPIAN WAY. Black fragments of tombs
     punctuate either side of the poorly lit road. Inside the car,
     Ripley looks to left and right for a place to dump the body.
     He slows near a clump of trees.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. EVENING.

     Someone is KNOCKING urgently at the door. Ripley opens it,
     finds himself face to face with Signora Buffi and TWO
     POLICEMEN. One of them offers his hand.

                         ROVERINI
               Dickie Greenleaf?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes?

                         ROVERINI
               Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. EVENING.

     Ripley sits with his head in his hands at the table. Roverini
     and his sergeant, BAGGIO, watch patiently.

                         ROVERINI
               It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did
               Signor Miles leave yesterday?

                         RIPLEY
               I can't be absolutely sure - 8? 9? We'd
               both taken on far too many drinks - but
               it was dark, it was certainly dark when I
               walked him down to his car.

                         ROVERINI
               So Signor Miles drove away and you did
               what?

                         RIPLEY
               I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but
               I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks.
               I've suffered all day. Who found him?

     Roverini has walked over to the bust of Hadrian.

                         ROVERINI
               Senta.  We have to ask you to stay in
               Rome.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.

                         ROVERINI
               So, the Doctor, he has to make the -
                   (looks at Baggio)
               - come se dice?

                         RIPLEY
               Postmortem?

                         ROVERINI
               Yes, exactly, but his first, his first
               conclusion was that Signor Miles was
               killed not later than seven o'clock
               yesterday evening.

                         RIPLEY
               Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he
               drove off in his car.

                         ROVERINI
               No.

     EXT. NARROW STREET, THE GHETTO, ROME. MORNING.

     Ripley comes through a dark tunnel in the Ghetto on his
     scooter. He drives past a furniture store, DRESSING TABLES
     AND MIRRORS spilling out onto the street. He glances
     sideways, sees his reflection fractured into several images
     and, for an instant, it seems AS IF DICKIE'S THERE
     WATCHING HIM. Ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the
     pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along
     the cobbled passage. The man he thought to be Dickie, an
     Italian, runs up concerned.

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. DAY.

     Ripley emerges from the American Express Office. Across the
     street at the cafe, as once before, sits Marge. Ripley slips
     Dickie's bag into his knapsack as he approaches his scooter.
     Marge spots him and strides across the piazza. She is in no
     mood for pleasantries.

                         MARGE
               Did he kill Freddie?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, when did you get here?

                         MARGE
               Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?

                         RIPLEY
               I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.

                         MARGE
               I tried again, waiting here, watching for
               him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look
               for Dickie I find you.

                   (focusing on Ripley's cuts and
                    bruises)
               What happened to your face?

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie did it.

                         MARGE
                   (suddenly tense)
               Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               My face! There was an argument. I said
               some things I shouldn't have.  About you.
               About the appalling way he's treating
               you, all of us.  And the next thing I
               know he's launched himself at me.
                   (he pulls the scooter off the
                    stand)
               Are you getting on?

                         MARGE
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               Get on. I'll take you to him.

     EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. DAY.

     Ripley and Marge come round the corner on the scooter. The
     entrance to the Palazzo is blocked by a couple of police cars.
     Inspector Roverini emerges from one of them. Ripley,
     startled, drives straight past the entrance.

     EXT. ROME STREET, BY THE RIVER. DAY.

     Ripley pulls up several hundred yards later, in a different
     piazza full of book stalls.  Marge is confused.

                         MARGE
               Where does Dickie live?

                         RIPLEY
               We passed it a few blocks back, where the
               police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They
               don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not
               going to incriminate Dickie -

                         MARGE
               Perhaps I shouldn't go either.

                         RIPLEY
                   (thinking hard, distracted)
               No, well go if you want to, but don't
               talk to the Police about my face - they
               find out he hit me - he's got a temper - he
               could've hit Freddie.
                   (sincerely)
               Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you
               later.

     And he drives off. At the first opportunity HE DOUBLES BACK
     and roars towards the Palazzo.

     EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley drives towards the entrance.  As Ripley gets off and
     pushes his scooter through the doorway SOME JOURNALISTS,
     LOITERING INSIDE A BARBER'S SHOP come running out and swarm
     around him with questions about Freddie. One of them gets off
     a photograph.  It's chaos, a Police Officer shouts him away
     as Ripley puts up a protective hand and runs inside.

     INT. ENTRANCE AND STAIRS, PALAZZO GIOIA. CONTINUOUS.

     As Ripley hurries inside he encounters officers conducting
     more thorough forensic investigations in the stairwell. On a
     landing is Roverini. Ripley hurries towards him.

                         RIPLEY
               Can we go up? Do you mind?

                         ROVERINI
               Of course. What happened to your face?

                         RIPLEY
               My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by
               photographers.

     He hurries up the stairs, Roverini in tow.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
                   (agitated)
               The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm
               feeling hounded - do you think you could
               not give out my address?

                         ROVERINI
               Never. We've had many requests and, of
               course, we say no - even to your fiancÈe.

                         RIPLEY
               I really don't want to see anybody.

                         ROVERINI
               Even your fiancÈe...?

                         RIPLEY
               Even her.

                         ROVERINI
               What about Thomas Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               What about Ripley?

     Ripley's way ahead and has reached the door of his apartment.
     He waits nervously for Roverini. He unlocks the door and can
     barely wait for Roverini to catch up.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.

     Roverini follows Ripley inside, Baggio hurries in behind him.

                         ROVERINI
               You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo,
               is that right?

     Ripley is appalled. He smiles.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That
               was months ago.

                         ROVERINI
               November, I thought.

                         RIPLEY
               Was it? Did you speak to Tom?

                         ROVERINI
               November 7th is my information.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't remember the exact date.

                         ROVERINI
               And when did you last see Signor Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               A few days ago.

                         ROVERINI
               Does he stay with you here?

                         RIPLEY
               No!

                         ROVERINI
               No.  Here is a pattern. Two days ago
               Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves your
               apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a
               little boat is found in San Remo full of
               rocks, and the owner tells the Police it
               was stolen on November 7th. We look at
               hotel records and we see oh! Dickie
               Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then
               our boatman remembers two Americans
               taking a boat.

                         RIPLEY
               It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence.
               There must be fifty hotels in San Remo,
               there must have been a hundred people
               renting a boat on that day.

                         ROVERINI
               31 people.

                         RIPLEY
               31 people.

     Baggio appears. Speaks to Roverini. Ripley is getting cranky.

                         ROVERINI
               That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge
               Sherwood.

                         RIPLEY
                   (appalled, defeated)
               Let her in, what's the difference?  Let
               her in.
                   (Baggio is on his way to the
                    door.)
               No, actually, no, I'd like it very much
               if you would ask her to come back later.

     Roverini nods, mutters to Baggio, who heads out.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Thank you.

                         ROVERINI
                   (watching him)
               May I ask...why would you speak to your
               friend and not your fiancÈe?

                         RIPLEY
               I think I just said. Ripley was handling
               some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley
               want to marry me.  Nor did he ask me
               every day if I would marry him. And when.

                         ROVERINI
               Do you have a photograph of Signor
               Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm not in the habit of carrying around
               photographs of my male friends.

                         ROVERINI
               Now I think I have upset you. My English
               perhaps is coarse.

                         RIPLEY
               It is a little coarse, yes.

                         ROVERINI
               Sorry.  No-one has seen Signor Ripley
               since San -

                         RIPLEY
               I have!

                         ROVERINI
               You have, yes.

                         RIPLEY
               No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask
               her! and if I could remember which hotel
               he was staying at - the Goldoni! - Tom
               was staying at the Goldoni.

                         ROVERINI
               Good. The Goldoni. Yes - you're right. A
               coincidence.
                   (he gets up to leave)
               I look forward to our next meeting when I
               will be more careful with my English and
               persuade you to play me your saxophone.
               Alto.

                         RIPLEY
               Absolutely.

                         ROVERINI
                   (suddenly turning)
               I have a witness who thinks they saw two
               men getting into Mr Miles' car. She
               wants to identify you in a - confronto -
               line-up.
                   (ominously)
               Tomorrow then?

                         RIPLEY
                   (thrown, scrabbling)
               Tomorrow.

     Ripley lets them out, heaves a heavy sigh, then peeps through
     the door, looks down to see Roverini speaking to Marge on the
     stairs.

                         ROVERINI (O/S)
               Buongiorno, Miss Sherwood.  He's in but I
               really don't think he wants to see
               anyone.

     Ripley leans against the door, the noose tightening, then
     suddenly a voice shocks him upright.

                         MARGE
               Dick? Dickie? I know you can hear me.
               What am I doing, chasing you around...?
               I was going to say I would count to three
               and if you didn't open the door, but I
               won't count any more. On you. I won't
               count on you any more. Whatever it is,
               whatever you've done or haven't done,
               you've broken my heart. That's one thing
               I know you're guilty of, and I don't know
               why, I don't know why, I just don't know
               why...

     Ripley listens, there's a silence, then Marge's footsteps as
     they ring out on the stone stairs. The tapping sound resolves
     into the tap-tap of a manual typewriter.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley's at the typewriter, he begins to type.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               My dear Tom, I'm getting out of this.
               Freddie's death, Silvana. I've thought
               about going to the police, but I can't do
               it, I can't face it.  I can't face
               anything anymore...

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     CHAOS.  Ripley is working quickly, selecting clothes,
     dividing them into TWO PILES - one for Dickie's trunk, one
     for his own battered suitcase. He puts the license plates
     from Freddie's car in Dickie's luggage. He has placed one
     shirt on the Ripley pile then checks again, and - on seeing
     Dickie's initials, places it with the bigger pile, then picks
     it up again and holds it briefly against his cheek.

     He takes Dickie's rings, opens up a LITTLE BOX of buttons and
     needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in. Dickie's
     leather writing case goes on the big pile, too, as do cuff
     links, ties, the Mont Blanc, Dickie's passport, which he
     opens to scratch at the photograph, obliterating the face.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               ...I wish I could give you the life I
               took for granted. You've always
               understood what's at the heart of me,
               Tom. Marge never could. I suppose that's
               why I'm writing this to you, the brother
               I never had. The only true friend I ever
               had. In all kinds of ways you're much
               more like the son my father always
               wanted. I realise you can change the
               people, change the scenery, but you can't
               change your own rotten self. Now I can't
               think what to do, or where to go. I'm
               haunted by everything I've done, and
               can't undo. I'm sorry, I can't go on.
               I've made a mess of being Dickie
               Greenleaf haven't I?

     He's finished the letter, signs it, puts it in an envelope
     marked Tom Ripley and places the letter on top of the piano
     next to Dickie's passport. His head is reflected in the
     distorting curve of the lid. As he puts on his glasses
     there's a moment when there are two heads slowly separating,
     as Ripley leaves behind his brief life as Dickie Greenleaf.

     INT. BASEMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley carries Dickie's luggage down into THE COMMUNAL
     BASEMENT of the Gioia, a wretched place full of shadows and
     gloom and the overflow from thirty apartments. A red plush
     couch sits on top of a mound of furniture.  He finds some
     dustsheets and shoves the cases under them. Then Dickie's
     saxophone.

     Outside the small window, Ripley sees uniformed feet and the
     revolving blue light of a Police Car. He shrinks back, turns
     off the light and disappears into the dark, illuminated
     fitfully by the strobe of cold blue.

     EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA, ROME. NIGHT.

     Ripley, familiar battered luggage in tow, appears at the
     entrance of the building next to his own, glances at the
     police car parked opposite the big doors, then hurries off
     into the darkness.

     EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley's briefly silhouetted as he scuttles down an alley,
     hurrying towards a gate, and disappears behind it.

     EXT. PIAZZALE ROMA, VENICE. DAWN.

     Ripley sits next to his battered luggage at the prow of a
     MOTOR TAXI as it surges towards Venice at dawn. Peter Smith-
     Kingsley waits on the quay. Ripley waves. Peter waves back.

                         PETER
                   (indicating the taxi stop)
               I'll see you over there!

     EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. EARLY MORNING.

     Ripley and Peter walk through the square, the pigeons
     scattering. Ripley breathes in the atmosphere, the beautiful
     grey.

                         RIPLEY
               Peter, I'm really sorry to put you
               through this. I just couldn't face going
               to the police by myself when my Italian's
               so rotten.

                         PETER
               Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted
               you finally made it to Venice. I'm
               delighted, contrary to rumour, you're
               still in one piece?

                         RIPLEY
               What rumour?

                         PETER
               That Dickie murdered you and is
               travelling under your passport. I know,
               ridiculous.

     INT. POLICE STATION, VENICE. LATE DAY.

     Later.  Ripley sits in the middle of a bustling Police Station,
     where thefts, tourists, thieves and complaints are being
     processed.  The Station is in an old brewery or armory. It's a
     horrible, monochrome, oppressive place. Peter is in
     conversation at a desk, turns and walks over to where Ripley
     waits.

                         PETER
               Welcome to Venice.  This place reeks,
               doesn't it? Can you smell it?  Ugh.
               Sorry. Not the best way to spend your
               first day.

                         RIPLEY
               It's okay.

                         PETER
               Anyway I've got to the bottom of the
               delay. Finally.  We're waiting for
               someone from Rome.

                         RIPLEY
                   (completely thrown)
               What do you mean?  They're sending
               someone from Rome?

                         PETER
               That's good, isn't it?

                         RIPLEY
                   (as if suffocating)
               No, but I thought that didn't happen in
               Italy, that each region was completely
               separate! I was sure that was the -

                         PETER
               You've seen the papers, you know what a
               big deal it's been here. American tourist
               murdered -

                         RIPLEY
               It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned
               the stench I can hardly breathe.

     A door opens. COLONEL VERRECCHIA, fresh from Rome, and a
     sullen wedge of a man, comes in, scowling at the couple.
     Ripley dare not look up in case it's Roverini.  A POLICEMAN
     introduces him.

                         POLICEMAN
               Colonelo Verrecchia della Polizia di
               Roma.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (to Peter, in Italian)
               Qui e Ripley?  Who is Ripley?

                         PETER
                   (in Italian)
               Lui. Him.

     Verrecchia strides past them and into a smaller, interview
     room at the back of the station.  His manner is ominous.

     INT. POLICE STATION, INTERVIEW ROOM, VENICE. LATE DAY.

     This room is not at all friendly. There is evidence of a
     locked area for cells at one wall.  A small, sour window
     gives onto a canal.  The main station is glimpsed through
     some internal windows. Peter and Ripley come through.

     Verrecchia sits down.  Verrecchia talks in staccato Italian,
     during which Peter translates.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in
               seguito alla negativa valutazione delle
               disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con
               il mio predecessore Roverini che come e
               noto non e riuscito a impedire il
               verificarsi della scomparsa del signor
               Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona
               al momento passibile di incriminazione
               del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               He's taken over the case because...
               they're annoyed the previous chap let
               Dickie...disappear when he was the only,
               he was the only suspect in Freddie's
               murder.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il
               signor Ripley ha visto il signor
               Greenleaf?
               (When was the last time Ripley saw
               Greenleaf?)

     Ripley forgets he's not supposed to have much Italian and
     answers.

                         RIPLEY
               In Rome, about three weeks ago.
                   (shrugs)
               I knew that one.

                         PETER
                   (giving Ripley a look)
               A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               Where have you been since then?

                         RIPLEY
               I've been backpacking.

                         PETER
               I don't know how to translate that.
                   (he tries)
               E difficile....il signor Ripley
               ....dormiva all'aperto, con un...

                         VERRECCHIA
               All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?

                         PETER
               He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping
               outside.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze
               omosessuali?

                         PETER
               Are you a homosexual?
                   (then as himself)
               Interesting non-sequitur.

                         RIPLEY
               No.

                         PETER
                   (translates for him)
               No.
                   (as Peter, drily)
               By the way, officially there are no
               Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo,
               Michelangelo very inconvenient.

                         RIPLEY
               Tell him I have a fiancÈe, Dickie has a
               fiancÈe and Freddie Miles probably had a
               string of them.

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il
               signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e
               probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha
               molte fidanzate.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (laughs)
               Mamma mia, quante fidanzate!

     They all laugh.

                         RIPLEY
               What did he say?

                         PETER
               He says so many fiancÈes.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (suddenly very tough)
               Lei ha ucciso prima Freddie Miles e dopo
               Dickie Greenleaf! Vero?

     As Peter translates Verrecchia watches intently.

                         PETER
               He wants to know if you killed Freddie
               Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?

                         RIPLEY
                   (outraged)
               No I did not. I did not kill Freddie
               Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf.  Is
               he accusing me?
                   (Peter clearly doesn't ask)
               Ask him if he's accusing me!

                         PETER
               He's already angry, I don't think -

                         RIPLEY
                   (interrupting, heated)
               Just because he doesn't like Americans!

                         VERRECCHIA
               Non e questo il luogo per le vostre
               conversazioni private!  (This is not the
               place for your private conversations)

                         PETER
                   (appeasing him)
               A ragione.  A ragione.  (You're right.
               You're right.)

                         VERRECCHIA
               Hmm. C'e questa...  (There's this...)

     Verrecchia hands over a letter. It's opened. Ripley's name on
     the outside. Ripley stares at it.

                         VERRECCHIA
                         (cont'd)
               Questa lettera e stata trovata
               nell'abitazione del signor Richard
               Greenleaf a Roma.

                         PETER
               They found this in Dickie's place in
               Rome.

                         RIPLEY
               You opened this?

                         VERRECCHIA
               Of course!

     He stands and takes the letter out.  Begins to read. He has
     the look of a man whose privacy has been violated.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Peter)
               It's a suicide note.
                   (to Verrecchia)
               You ask me all these questions and you've
               already read this suicide note?

     INT. PETER SMITH-KINGSLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     There's music everywhere - and stands - and posters of
     performances and PHOTOGRAPHS OF PETER CONDUCTING. Peter is an
     opera repetiteur. Ripley is sitting at Peter's piano, playing
     from the score of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater. Peter's made supper.
     He's setting the table.

                         PETER
               Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill
               Freddie, what must that be like? To wake
               up every morning, how can you? Just wake
               up and be a person, drink a coffee...?

                         RIPLEY
               Whatever you do, however terrible,
               however hurtful - it all makes sense,
               doesn't it? inside your head. You never
               meet anybody who thinks they're a bad
               person or that they're cruel.

                         PETER
               But you're still tormented, you must be,
               you've killed somebody...

                         RIPLEY
               Don't you put the past in a room, in the
               cellar, and lock the door and just never
               go in there? Because that's what I do.

                         PETER
               Probably. In my case it's probably a
               whole building.

                         RIPLEY
               Then you meet someone special and all you
               want to do is toss them the key, say open
               up, step inside, but you can't because
               it's dark and there are demons and if
               anybody saw how ugly it was...

     Peter's come over, stands behind him over the piano.

                         PETER
               That's the music talking. Harder to be
               bleak if you're playing Knees up Mother
               Brown.

     He vamps this vaudeville song over Ripley's shoulder.

                         RIPLEY
               I keep wanting to do that - fling open
               the door - let the light in, clean
               everything out. If I could get a huge
               eraser and rub everything out...starting
               with myself...the thing is, Peter, if...

                         PETER
                   (as Ripley falls silent)
               No key, huh?

     INT. SANTA MARIA DELLA PIETA, BRIDGE OF SIGHS. DAY.

     A YOUNG BOY SINGS the soprano part of Vivaldi's STABAT MATER.
     A piercingly pure sound in Vivaldi's own church.  The
     orchestra - rehearsing - is conducted by Peter from the
     organ.

     Ripley slips in at the back of the church. He stands and
     listens. Peter sees him, smiles.  Ripley smiles back.

     EXT. VENICE, S.LUCIA RAILWAY STATION. DAY.

     MARGE appears on the steps, carrying an overnight bag. Ripley
     and Peter have come to meet her.

                         MARGE
                   (kissing him warmly)
               Hello Peter, so good to see you.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Marge!

                         MARGE
                   (coolly)
               Tom.

     They walk towards the Vaporetto.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               So you found Peter...

                         PETER
               I think we sort of found each other.

     Marge smiles enigmatically. Ripley registers.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               Where's Dickie's father?

                         MARGE
               He's not coming till the morning.
               Evidently his stomach - I don't think the
               food here is agreeing with him.

                         RIPLEY
               I was looking forward to seeing him.

                         MARGE
               Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of
               that. There's a private detective on the
               case now - a Mr MacCarron - Dickie's
               father's employing him.

                         RIPLEY
               That's a terrific idea.

                         MARGE
               He's American. He's already discovered
               Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day
               before he disappeared.

     They step onto the Vaporetto.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               Is that what you do before you jump in
               the Tiber?  I don't think so.

     EXT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY.

     The boat arrives at the entrance to the house. Peter opens
     the door as Ripley collects Marge's bags.

                         MARGE
                   (to Peter)
               Is this you?

                         PETER
               No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?

                         MARGE
               Golly. Who's paying for this?

                         RIPLEY
               Peter found it for me. I can afford it
               because it's damp and, and falling down.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY.

     Marge, entering the living room, is astonished at its
     grandeur. She walks around as Ripley heads for the bar.

                         MARGE
               This is spectacular.

                         PETER
               That's why Tom wanted you to stay.  It's
               better than squeezing into my room, and I
               know how you hate hotels.

                         MARGE
               A hotel would've been fine.
                   (to Ripley)
               We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far
               his dollar has stretched.

     Ripley is shaking a martini. Marge laughs, helpless, somehow
     raging. Peter turns

                         PETER
               What's funny?

                         MARGE
               No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when
               Tom arrived in Mongi.
                   (to Ripley)
               And now look at you.

                         RIPLEY
               Look at me what?

                         MARGE
               To the manner born.

     EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. DAY.

     St Mark's Square is buzzing with life - tourists, balloon
     sellers - a man playing saxophone. HERBERT GREENLEAF sits out
     in the colonade on one of the many tables at Florian's Cafe,
     cradling a glass of hot water. He gets up as Marge and Ripley
     arrive.

                         RIPLEY
               Mr Greenleaf.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Tom. How are you?  You look well.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm well, thank you.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Far cry from New York.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes it is.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Marge, good morning.  Unusual weather.

                         MARGE
               Very.

                         RIPLEY
               And you, sir?  Any better?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Pretty good.  Sticking with hot water.

                         MARGE
               Where's Mr MacCarron?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well,
               my boy, it's come to a pretty pass,
               hasn't it?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes.  What's the detective hoping to
               find in San Remo?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               He's being thorough, that's all. I'm
               learning about my son, Tom, now he's
               missing. I'm learning a great deal about
               him. I hope you can fill in some more
               blanks for me. Marge has been good enough
               to do that, about Mongibello.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do
               anything to help Dickie.

     Marge looks at him in contempt.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               This theory, the letter he left for you,
               the Police think that's a clear
               indication he was planning on doing
               something...to himself.

                         MARGE
               I just don't believe that!

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk
               to Tom alone - perhaps this afternoon?
               Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say
               to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to
               another fellow -

                         MARGE
               Such as?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               What a waste of lives and opportunities
               and -

     A saxophonist is blaring away in the piazza. Greenleaf
     suddenly explodes.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (cont'd)
               - I'd pay that fellow a hundred dollars
               right now to shut up!

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.

     Herbert Greenleaf sits on a chair, Ripley pours him some tea.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (reading, plunging into gloom)
               No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.

                         RIPLEY
               I think it might hurt her to know.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               And his passport photo? Did you hear? To
               scratch out your own face like that - can
               you imagine - the frame of mind you'd
               have to be in?
                   (reading)
               I've thought about going to the police
               but I can't face it. I can't face
               anything anymore.

                         RIPLEY
               I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him
               away. I spoke and he heard you.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (such a disappointed father)
               Well, if we all pushed him away what
               about him pushing us away? You've been a
               great friend to my son. Everything is
               someone else's fault. We all want to sow
               wild oars. Somebody's got to - what's the
               word?
                   (Ripley shakes his head)
               The moment someone confronts him he
               lashes out.  He lashes out. You know,
               people always say you can't choose your
               parents, but you can't choose your
               children.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DUSK.

     Ripley wakes up from an awful, chilling nightmare, his head
     full of ghosts. He's cramped up in an armchair, his arms in
     sine foetal protection. HIS DOOR KNOCKER IS BEING REPEATEDLY
     SHAKEN. He surfaces thickly, stumbles to the door. It's Peter
     and Marge.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have
               fallen asleep.

                         PETER
               You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?

                         MARGE
               Did Dickie's Dad go?

                         RIPLEY
               He's having an early night.

                         MARGE
               Poor man.
                   (she heads to her room)
               We were knocking on that door for ever.
                   (she fiddles inside the sleeve
                    of her dress)
               I think I've broken my strap.

                         PETER
               Not guilty.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll fix some drinks.

                         MARGE
               You walk in Venice!

     She takes off her shoe, examining her feet for wear and tear,
     then disappears into the bedroom. Peter walks over to Ripley,
     a little concerned.

                         PETER
               Are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm fine.

                         PETER
                   (a hand on his shoulder)
               Do you want me to stick around?

                         RIPLEY
               It's okay.

                         PETER
               Or I could come back.

     Ripley looks at him. That's never happened. He digs in his
     pocket, finds his key, gives it to Peter. Peter smiles.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               Your key.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BATHROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.

     Ripley's in the bath. Marge knocks on his door.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               Tom?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

     Ripley, irritated, opens the door, his towel wrapped around
     his waist. Marge is white. She's wearing a robe. She's
     slightly breathless.

                         MARGE
               I found Dickie's rings.

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MARGE
               You've got Dickie's rings.

                         RIPLEY
               I can explain.

     He can't. His eyes dart. Marge holds up the evidence.

                         MARGE
               Dickie promised me he would never take
               off this ring.

                         RIPLEY
               Let me put on some clothes and then we
               can talk about this.

                         MARGE
               I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to
               tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr
               Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, calm down, you're being
               hysterical.

                         MARGE
               He promised me. I swear I'll never take
               off this ring until the day -

                         RIPLEY
               Shut up! Shut up!

     His towel slips off from his waist.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               I'm wet, Marge, I've lost my towel, I'd
               really like to put my clothes on. So go
               and pour us both a drink, will you?

     She goes off obediently, a zombie. He shuts the door.
     Immediately he starts looking for something, anything, to
     kill Marge with. He's got a shoe but it feels too light. He
     opens cabinets, drawers - nail scissors, nothing - then
     picks up his straight razor and considers it in the mirror.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SITTING ROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.

     Marge is leaving, coat on, as Ripley comes out of the
     bathroom.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge?  Where are you going?

                         MARGE
                   (like a creature caught in
                    headlights)
               I was looking for a needle and thread. I
               wasn't snooping. I was looking for a
               needle and thread to mend my bra.

                         RIPLEY
               The scent you're wearing. I bought it for
               you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie.
               So many things. The day he was late back
               from Rome - I tried to tell you this - he
               was with another girl. I'm not talking
               about Meredith, another girl we met in a
               bar. He couldn't be faithful for five
               minutes. So when he makes a promise it
               doesn't mean what it means when you make
               a promise. Or I do. He has so many
               realities, Dickie, and he believes them
               all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half
               the time he doesn't even realize.

     A SMALL RED STAIN is appearing on the pocket of his robe. As
     he speaks the stain spreads. He looks at it absently.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Today, for the first time, I've even
               wondered whether he might have killed
               Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody
               contradicted him - well, you know that.
               Marge. I loved you - you might as well
               know - I loved you, and because he knew I
               loved you, he let you think I loved him.
               Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't
               know, maybe it's grotesque to say this
               now, so just write it on a piece of paper
               or something, and keep it in your purse
               for a rainy day. Tom loves me.

                         MARGE
                   (as if she'd heard nothing)
               Why do you have Dickie's rings?

     His hand goes to his pocket. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT.

                         RIPLEY
               I told you. He gave them to me.

                         MARGE
               Why? When?

                         RIPLEY
               I feel as if you haven't heard anything
               I've been saying to you.

                         MARGE
               I don't believe you.

                         RIPLEY
               It's all true.

                         MARGE
               I don't believe a single word you've
               said.

     Marge is shivering. Ripley, ominous, advances, she retreats.

                         RIPLEY
               You're shivering, Marge. Can I hold you?
               Would you let me hold you?

     Marge panics, backed up against the door. She screams and
     turns straight into the arms of a startled PETER who's come
     back to visit Ripley, and is unlocking the door.

                         MARGE
                   (sobbing uncontrollably)
               Oh Peter! Get me out of here.

     Ripley storms off. His hand comes out of his pocket COVERED
     IN BLOOD from the razor. Peter notices, appalled.

                         PETER
               Tom, are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               You try. You try talking to her.

                         PETER
                   (calls after him)
               Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?

                         RIPLEY
                   (not turning around)
               I give up.

     INT. RIPLEY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

     Peter has just put a band-aid over Ripley's cut hand.

                         PETER
               You can't be angry with her.  She's upset
               and needs someone to blame. So she blames
               you.  I'll go home and talk to her.  As
               for you - either get a safety razor or
               grow a beard.

     INT. LOBBY, EUROPA REGINA HOTEL, VENICE. MORNING.

     Ripley hurries through the gleaming marble entrance.

     INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S SUITE, EUROPA REGINA. DAY.

     Ripley knocks on the door. It's opened by a face he doesn't
     recognize. A middle-aged heavy set man. It's MacCARRON, the
     private investigator.

                         RIPLEY
               Is Mr Greenleaf here?

                         MACCARRON
               Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               I don't know, I don't know, I just know
               it.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (O/S)
               Marge, there's female intuition, and
               then there are facts -

     Greenleaf sits with a scrubbed Marge, her hair pulled back,
     as if newly-widowed. THE RINGS SIT GLINTING ON THE COFFEE
     TABLE.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello, sir.
                   (smiles thinly at Marge)
               Marge, you should have waited, didn't
               Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you
               up?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Marge has been telling us about the
               rings.

                         RIPLEY
               You know I feel ridiculous I didn't
               mention them yesterday - I clean forgot -
               ridiculous.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Perhaps you didn't mention them because
               there's only one conclusion to be drawn.

     Ripley worries about what that conclusion is as Mr Greenleaf
     heads into his bedroom.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (cont'd)
               I'm going to take Marge for a little
               walk, Tom.  Mr MacCarron wants to talk
               with you.

                         RIPLEY
                   (feeling caged in)
               We could go down to the bar - no need for
               you to -

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               No, he should talk to you alone.

     He helps Marge to her feet and leads her out. RIPLEY IS
     PARALYSED. He waits for the door to shut. Aimlessly he walks
     out onto the terrace, with its staggering, beautiful and
     indifferent view.

     EXT. EUROPA REGINA, THE GREENLEAF TERRACE. DAY.

     Ripley stands, steels himself for MacCarron's charges.

                         RIPLEY
               I could probably see my bedroom from
               here. I can see my house. When you see
               where you live from a distance it's like
               a dream, isn't it?

                         MACCARRON
                   (coming out)
               I don't care for B.S. I don't care to
               hear it. I don't care to speak it.

                         RIPLEY
               Okay.

                         MACCARRON
               Why do you think Dickie's father sent him
               to Europe in the first place? Did you
               know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-
               killed a boy?

     Ripley turns, shocked.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               At a party. Over some girl. He kicked the
               kid several times in the head. Put him in
               the hospital. The boy had a wire fixed in
               his jaw. The Rome Police didn't think to
               ask Mr Greenleaf.

     MacCarron gets up.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Nor did they think to check whether a
               Thomas Ripley had ever been a student at
               Princeton University. I turned up a Tom
               Ripley who'd been a piano tuner in the
               music department.

     Ripley's head drops.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               See - in America we're taught to check a
               fact before it becomes a fact. We're
               taught to nose around when a girl drowns
               herself, find out if that girl was
               pregnant, find out if Dickie had an
               embarrassment there.

     Ripley doesn't know where this barrage is going.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty.
               He really does. Marge, she's got a
               hundred theories, but there are a few
               things she doesn't know. We hope she
               never knows.

                         RIPLEY
               I hope she never knows.

                         MACCARRON
               Three different people saw Dickie get
               into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't
               identify himself because he was jumping
               someone else's wife at the time saw
               Dickie removing license plates from a red
               sports car. The Police know about this
               man because he happens to be a Policeman.

     He walks out of the room, returns carrying THE LICENSE PLATES
     from Freddie's car.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               I found these in the basement of Dickie's
               apartment. They belonged to Freddie's
               car. Mr Greenleaf has asked me to lose
               them in the canal this evening.

     Ripley can't believe what he's hearing. It's like a dream.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Mr Greenleaf also feels there was a
               silent promise in Dickie's letter to you
               which he intends to honor. He intends to
               transfer a good part of Dickie's income
               from his trust into your name. He doesn't
               intend to give the Italian police any
               information about Dickie's past. He's
               rather hoping you'll feel the same.

     There is a silence in which this strange compact is agreed.

     EXT. EUROPA REGINA MOORING. DAY.

     Ripley stands with Marge, Mr Greenleaf and MacCarron at the
     water's edge - MOTOR LAUNCH growling. They shake hands, and
     then MacCarron and Mr Greenleaf get into the launch. Herbert
     Greenleaf carries the saxophone case.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Marge)
               I feel I never should have said those
               things to you the other evening. I was
               pretty flustered, the rings and - and you
               looked so, I don't know.

     Marge shakes her head to silence him.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               But I hope that note goes to New York in
               your purse, for a rainy day.

                         MARGE
               What are you going to do now, Tom?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. Peter has a concert in
               Athens next month - and he's asked if I
               want to go along, help out. He says
               goodbye by the way - he's in rehearsal,
               otherwise -

                         MARGE
               Why do I think there's never been a
               Ripley rainy day?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MARGE
                   (lunging at him)
               I know it was you - I know it was you,
               Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed
               Dickie. I know it was you.

                         RIPLEY
               Oh Marge.

     He puts his hand out to control her. She pushes it away.
     STARTS TO LASH OUT AT HIM, the frustration too much, so that
     Ripley has to cover his face. MacCarron comes off the boat to
     restrain her.  Ripley looks at him as if to say: what can you
     do, she's hysterical. MacCarron nods, pulls her on to the
     boat. Greenleaf catches Ripley's eye, guiltily. Turns away.
     They stand silhouetted as the launch revs up and surges off
     towards open waters, passing the little fleets of gondolas.

     EXT. FERRY FOR ATHENS, NAPLES. DAY.

     A week later and Peter and Ripley are on the deck of the
     ferry, the HELLENES, as it sails towards Greece.  They're
     laughing.

                         RIPLEY
               Ask me what I want to change about this
               moment.

                         PETER
               What do you want to change about this
               moment?

                         RIPLEY
               Nothing.

     INT. PETER'S CABIN. DUSK.

     Peter's in a bathrobe organising his currency, his
     traveller's cheques. Ripley knocks on the door, comes in.

                         PETER
               Hello.  What are you up to?

                         RIPLEY
               All kinds of things. Making plans.

                         PETER
               Plans - good, plans for tonight or plans
               for the future?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. Both. My plan right now is
               to go up on deck, look at the sunset.
               Come with me.

                         PETER
               You go. I don't want to get dressed yet.
               Come back though.  Come back.
                   (smiles at him)
               You know, you look so relaxed, like a
               completely different person.

                         RIPLEY
               Well, that's entirely your fault.  And,
               if I fall overboard, that'll be your
               fault too.

     EXT. DECK OF THE HELLENES. SUNSET.

     Ripley stands on deck, staring at the magnificent sunset.
     Then a voice shakes him from his reverie.

                         MEREDITH
               Dickie?  Dickie?

     He turns. He's caught. Suddenly he's Dickie.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               Dickie, my God!

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Meredith.

                         MEREDITH
               I was looking at you, your clothes, I
               wouldn't have known you...

                         RIPLEY
               Well, you've spotted me and so you get
               the reward.

                         MEREDITH
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               Just kidding. Are you alone?

                         MEREDITH
               Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.

     Meredith points to the UPPER DECK BALCONY where TWO OLDER
     COUPLES are walking around the deck.

                         RIPLEY
               Of course.  Aunt Joan.

                         MEREDITH
               And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've
               thought about you so much.

                         RIPLEY
               I've thought about you.

     And now he's thinking I can't kill them all...

                         MEREDITH
               When I thought about you I was mostly
               hating you. Where've you been hiding?

                         RIPLEY
               I haven't been hiding. I've been in
               Police custody. They've been trying to
               flush out Freddie's killer.

                         MEREDITH
               You're kidding.

                         RIPLEY
               They're letting me have this vacation.
               Which is why the get-up. Which is why you
               haven't heard from me.

                         MEREDITH
               You know, the whole world thinks you
               killed Freddie? It's terrible.

                         RIPLEY
               I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later.
               Later?

     He kisses her.  Full of future.

                         MEREDITH
               So - are you travelling under R?

                         RIPLEY
               You know what - I am.

                         MEREDITH
               Dickie, are you with Peter Smith-
               Kingsley?  I bet you are. My aunt thought
               she saw him.

                         RIPLEY
                   (horrified)
               Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him
               in months.  No, I'm alone.
                   (and he understands this is not
                    any kind of lie)

     INT. PETER'S CABIN. NIGHT.

     Peter's working on his score, lying on his front, apparently
     engrossed. Ripley knocks and enters. Looks long at Peter.

                         PETER
               How was it?

                         RIPLEY
               Good. But I think we should stay in here
               for the rest of the trip.

                         PETER
               Was that Meredith?

                         RIPLEY
                   (sighs)
               Was who Meredith?

                         PETER
               Meredith Logue. You were kissing
               somebody. Looked like Meredith.

                         RIPLEY
               Hardly kissing. Kissing off.

                         PETER
               Didn't look that way - you know - from a
               distance.

                         RIPLEY
               I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen
               you.

                         PETER
               Why lie?

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie and Peter, that's just too good
               gossip, isn't it?

                         PETER
               Or Tom and Peter even.

                         RIPLEY
               Well that would be even better gossip.

                         PETER
               Really, why?
                   (completely lost)
               Sorry, I'm completely lost.

                         RIPLEY
               I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be
               stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's
               my, that's my - terrible and alone and
               dark - and I've lied about who I am, and
               where I am, and so nobody can ever find
               me.

                         PETER
               What do you mean lied about who you are?

                         RIPLEY
               I suppose I always thought - better to be
               a fake somebody than a real nobody.

                         PETER
               What are you talking about - you're not a
               nobody! That's the last thing you are.

                         RIPLEY
               Peter, I... I...

                         PETER
                   (conciliatory)
               And don't forget. I have the key.

                         RIPLEY
               You have the key. Tell me some good
               things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up.
               Just tell me some nice things.

     He sits on the bed, leans against Peter. His eyes are
     brimming with tears.  He takes the cord from Peter's robe and
     begins twisting it in his hands.

                         PETER
               Good things about Tom Ripley?  Could take
               some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is
               tender... Tom is beautiful...

                         RIPLEY
                   (during this, and tender)
               You're such a liar...

                         PETER
               ...Tom is a mystery...

     Ripley is pressing against him, moving up his body, kisses
     his shoulder, the cord wrapped tight in his hands...

     INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. NIGHT.

     Ripley returns to his cabin. Sits on the bed, desolate.

                         PETER (O/S)
                   (cont'd)
               ...Tom is not a nobody. Tom has secrets
               he doesn't want to tell me, and I wish he
               would. Tom has nightmares. That's not a
               good thing. Tom has someone to love him.
               That is a good thing!
                   (feeling Ripley's weight on
                    him)
               Tom is crushing me. Tom is crushing me.
                   (suddenly alarmed)
               Tom, you're crushing me!

     The door of his closet flips open with the swell and he
     catches his reflection. It swings shut. Open then shut.
     Through the porthole the weather's changing as the light
     dies. There's a swell as the horizon rises and falls in the
     round glass. Ripley, alone, in a nightmare of his own making.

     THE END.






     Lullaby for Cain

     From the silence
     from the night
     comes a distant lullabye

     Cry, remembering that first cry
     Your brother standing by
     and loved
     both loved
     beloved sons of mine
     sing a lullabye
     mother is close by
     innocent eyes
     such innocent eyes

     Envy stole your brother's life
     came home murdered peace of mind
     left you nightmares on the pillow
     sleep now

     Soul, surrendering your soul
     the heart of you not whole
     for love
     but love
     what toll

     Cast into the dark
     branded with the mark
     of shame
     of Cain

     From the garden of God's light
     to a wilderness of light
     sleep now

     sleep now.

     1958

     PROLOGUE:  INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. EVENING.

     Fade up on Ripley, as in the final scene of the film,
     sitting, desolate in a ship's cabin. The camera rotates
     around his face, which begins in light and ends in darkness.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               If I could just go back.  If I could rub
               everything out.  Starting with myself.
               Starting with borrowing a jacket.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST TERRACE. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley is at the piano, accompanying FRAN, a young soprano.
     CREDITS begin.

                         FRAN (SINGS)
               Ah, such fleeting paradise
               such innocent delight
               to love,
               be loved,
               a lullabye,
               then silence.

     The song finishes.  Applause.  They're the entertainment at a
     cocktail party to celebrate a silver wedding anniversary.
     Some partygoers congratulate Fran on her performance. A
     distinguished looking man, pushing his wife in a wheelchair,
     approaches Ripley, offers his hand.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
               Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (pointing at Ripley's borrowed
                    jacket)
               I see you were at Princeton.
               Then you'll most likely know our son,
               Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               We couldn't help noticing your jacket.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Yes.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Class of '56?

                         RIPLEY
                   (hesitating)
               How is Dickie?

     INT. ELEVATOR OPENING OUT INTO LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.

     Fran, Ripley, Mr and Mrs Greenleaf and others emerge from an
     elevator. Emily talks to Fran, Herbert to Ripley.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
                   (to Fran)
               I hope you'll come and see us...

                         FRAN
               That's very kind.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Both of you...

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Of course, Dickie's idea of music is
               Jazz. He has a saxophone.  To my ear Jazz
               is just noise, just an insolent noise.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley shakes hands with Herbert Greenleaf as he gets into
     his Rolls Royce. They are making an appointment. Ripley
     crosses the street to Fran, pecks her cheek. She hands him
     his share of their fee.

                         RIPLEY
               Gotta run. I'm so late.
                   (he hands Fran's boyfriend the
                    jacket he's been wearing)
               Thanks for the jacket.

                         BOYFRIEND
               Sure.  Thanks for filling in for me.

     From Greenleaf's point of view he sees a couple embracing.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Darling couple, aren't they?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Yes.  An exceptional young man.

     From another vantage point Ripley hurries on as Fran gets
     into her boyfriend's car. A piano quartet starts up.

     EXT. THEATER. EVENING.

     Ripley runs past the droves of arriving concert-goers and
     heads for the theater. Music continues.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM, THEATER. NIGHT.

     The interval: A thick mass of men in tuxedoes grooming
     themselves at the basins. Ripley turns on faucets, offers
     towels, brushes off dandruff. Men talk over, round, and
     through him.  Put coins in a bowl.

     INT. A BOX AT THE THEATER. NIGHT

     The concert continues. Ripley peers through the curtain at
     the performances.  A haughty woman in the box turns round and
     he closes the curtain.

     INT. BACKSTAGE. 1:30 A.M.

     An empty auditorium. Ripley plays Bach in the blue
     ghostlight.  A caretaker emerges from his rounds, flips on
     the house lights.  Ripley jerks up from his playing, waves
     apologetically.

                         RIPLEY
               Sorry, sorry.  I know.  Sorry.

     EXT. GREENLEAF SHIPYARDS, BROOKLYN. DAY.

     Greenleaf and Ripley walk through one of the drydocks.  A
     huge void in the shape of a boat, swarming with workers
     preparing the shell of a new liner.  If Central Park is where
     the money is spent, this is clearly where it's made.  And a
     lot of it. Workers nod deferentially to the man with his name
     over the buildings behind them.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Mongibello. Tiny place. South of Naples.
               Marge, his uh, the young lade is
               supposedly writing some kind of book. God
               knows what he does. By all accounts they
               spend the whole time on the beach. Or his
               sailboat. That's my son's talent,
               spending his allowance.

     Ripley, in his green corduroy jacket the very model of a
     sober young man, listens attentively.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF (cont'd)
               Could you ever conceive of going to
               Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?
                   (Ripley looks doubtful)
               I'd pay you.  I'd pay you 1000 dollars.

                         RIPLEY
               I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir,
               but...

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Good. Now you can go for a reason.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK. DAY.

     A vinyl RECORD revolves in close up.  An exuberant and
     mysterious VOICE is scat singing. Wild. Then the sound slides
     into a raucous big band jazz number:  Dizzy Gillespie's The
     Champ. A HAND ejects the record. When the camera finds the
     man's face it is BLINDFOLDED. He's hot. He's wearing an
     undershirt. He's trying to identify the recording.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               I don't know. Count Basie?  Duke
               Ellington. I don't know. Count Basie.

     The man pulls of the blindfold, examines the record cover of
     the disc he's been trying to learn, needs to put on glasses
     to do so, is irritated by his mistake. He ejects the record.

     A pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered
     table which includes classical sheet music and a paper
     keyboard. One hand idly mimes at the keys.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Another song for Ripley to identify is on the gramophone.
     Chet Baker's My Funny Valentine.  Signs everywhere of
     packing. A suitcase. Books about Italy.  Ripley paces in this
     BASEMENT room, which is bathroom, kitchen, living room and
     bedroom all in one.  Tiny, tidy, squalid and sad. The windows
     give onto bars and a wall.

                         RIPLEY
               Don't even know if this is a man or a
               woman.

     There's a violent row going on in the room above his head. He
     flinches.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley, shining his shoes, packing almost done, is testing
     himself on another piece of music. Free jazz saxophone:
     Charlie Parker's Koko.  He listens hard, recognizes the
     track.

                         RIPLEY
               That's Charlie Parker. Bird.

     He skips over to the gramophone, checks the record. He's
     right, he smiles.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley studies an old photograph of Dickie Greenleaf in a
     Princeton Yearbook. He shoves the book in a bag, picks up
     his suitcase and takes a last look around the dingy apartment
     before closing the door behind him.

     EXT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley hauls his luggage up the stairs and into the sunlight.
     He is met at the top of the stairs by Mr Greenleaf's
     chauffeur.

                         CHAUFFEUR
               Here.  I'll take that.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

                         CARETAKER
                   (nodding towards the apartment)
               That thousand bucks should come in handy.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, sir.

                         CHAUFFEUR
                   (interupts Ripley, who is
                    about to open the car door)
               I'll get that.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

                         CHAUFFEUR
                   (as he holds open the door for
                    Ripley)
               Sir.
                   (Ripley laughs excitedly)
               You're gonna have a great trip.  Mr
               Greenleaf is personal friends with the
               Cunard people.

     INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S CAR. DAY.

     Ripley luxuriates in the back of the Greenleaf limousine. He
     opens up an envelope he's carrying with Greenleaf stationery.
     Inside a First Class Cunard Ticket, some traveler's checks
     and dollars.

                         CHAUFFEUR
               I can tell you.  The Greenleaf name opens
               a lot of doors.

     EXT. QUEEN MARY, MANHATTAN SKYLINE. DAY.

     The liner leaves New York en route to Italy.  END CREDITS.

     INT. NAPLES HARBOR, CUSTOMS & IMMIGRATION HALL. DAY.

     ITALY. Brilliant sunshine. The Queen Mary has just docked.
     Passengers can be seen disembarking through the huge windows.
     Coming from the First Class gangways they are greeted,
     escorted, fussed over into the hall.  Their bags have been
     unloaded ahead of them, and are now being sorted in the hall
     under the initials of their owners.  STANDS WITH THE LETTERS
     OF THE ALPHABET CHALKED ON THEM are dotted about, and trunks
     and suitcases of all shapes and sizes form small hills around
     them. Ripley enters and an Italian Porter approaches, wants
     his name.  Ripley. Ripley. Ripley! he repeats in the hubbub
     and joins the crowd around the letter R.  A striking young
     woman (MEREDITH) is nearby. She notices him.

     Ripley proceeds to the Customs area, where he's held in a
     line as a large suitcase is opened and searched. Meredith
     catches up with him. Her luggage a mountain next to his.

                         MEREDITH
               What's your secret?

                         RIPLEY
               Excuse me?

                         MEREDITH
               No, it's just - you are American, aren't
               you? - no, I just, I have so much
               luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined.
               It's humiliating.

     Ripley shrugs.  Now they're opening a second case of the
     passenger ahead.  Hard not to converse.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith
               Randall.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.

                         MEREDITH
               Hello.

     They are passed through immigration, head down the long
     stairs towards the street.  Meredith catches up with Ripley.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?

                         RIPLEY
                   (thinking quickly)
               Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.

                         MEREDITH
               So now, did they put your suitcase in the
               wrong pile? It's just - upstairs -
               weren't you under the R stand? I thought
               I saw you there.

                         RIPLEY
               My father wants me in New York. He builds
               boats. I'd rather sail them.  I travel
               under my mother's name.

                         MEREDITH
               Which is?

                         RIPLEY
               Emily.
                   (Meredith's bewildered)
               Just kidding.

                         MEREDITH
               The funny thing is, I'm not Randall
               either. I'm Logue.

                         RIPLEY
                   (nods, recognizing the name)
               As in the...?

                         MEREDITH
               As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug
               off the dress. I travel under my mother's
               name, too.

                         RIPLEY
               Randall.

                         MEREDITH
               Right.

     They've arrived at a crossroads on the stairs - graphic signs
     explain the choices: one way for Buses, Taxis and exits - the
     other for Trains: ROMA, VENEZIA, MILANO.  They're going in
     different directions.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
                   (offering her hand)
               So - partners in disguise.
                   (looks at the signs)
               Bye.

     EXT. COASTAL ROAD FROM NAPLES. LATE AFTERNOON.

     A BUS rolls around a coastal road cut into the side of a
     cliff, mountain above, blue sea below.

     INT. BUS. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley sits surrounded by teeming life. The bus slows at a
     new town. People get off.

     INT/EXTERIOR. BUS ARRIVES MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.

     Later, the day ending. Ripley looks out as they continue on
     their journey. Arriving at a small fishing port they wind
     down through a square, passing the local church.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. LATE DAY.

     And then the bus is in the heart of a wharf. On one side
     there's evidence of the fisherman's life, nets, old men
     working. Opposite there's a tiny cafe spilling out onto the
     street, young guys hang out, play table football, lounge on
     their Vespas. The Driver chants -

                         DRIVER
               MONGIBELLO!

     Ripley gets out, lugging his cases, as the bus continues on
     its way. He looks around him. He feels completely foreign.

     EXT. MIRAMARE HOTEL/BOAT AT SEA. MORNING.

     A SAILBOAT has slid into his view, now drops anchor, drops
     the sail.  A couple dive off and swim towards shore.

     ALL OF THIS IS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RIPLEY, who's
     watching the events through binoculars from his tiny balcony
     in the Miramare Hotel. An Italian Vocabulary Book is perched
     on his knees and, during this, he continues his study,
     mouthing the Italian words.

                         RIPLEY
                   (looking at a long, lean girl
                    about to dive)
               La fidanzata a una faccia.  The fiancÈe
               has a face.  La fidanzata e Marge.

     Her partner, DICKIE GREENLEAF, dives too. They're brown,
     beautiful, perfect. Ripley notices the name of the boat:
     "BIRD".

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Questo e la mia faccia.....

     The golden couple emerge from the sea. Dickie shakes off the
     water, grins.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               This is my face.

     He double-checks himself with the vocabulary book.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Questa...e la mia faccia. Questa e la
               faccia di Dickie.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley emerges from one of the beach cabins, and stands on
     the edge of the sand on a wooden walkway. He's wearing A TINY
     LIME-GREEN BATHING SUIT. He loathes beaches. A couple of boys
     turn laconically and watch him.

     Ripley puts on his shoes and scurries to the sea. He feels
     ridiculous, his skin alabaster against the brown bodies.
     Finally, the shame is too great and he pulls off his shoes
     and dashes to the water, where he luxuriates in the coolness
     of it before wading out of the sea, and walking straight up
     to Dickie.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie Greenleaf?

     Dickie squints at Ripley, who holds his shoes, lamely.

                         DICKIE
               Who's this?

                         RIPLEY
               It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at
               Princeton together.

                         DICKIE
               Okay.
                   (he sits up)
               And did we know each other?

                         RIPLEY
               Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must
               have known me.

                         DICKIE
                   (to Marge)
               Princeton is like a fog, America's like a
               fog.
                   (to Ripley)
               This is Marge Sherwood. Tom - sorry, what
               was it?

                         RIPLEY
               Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.

                         MARGE
               How do you do.

                         DICKIE
               What are you doing in Mongi?

                         RIPLEY
               Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.

                         DICKIE
                   (finds this idea absurd)
               Passing through! You're so white. Did you
               ever see a guy so white, Marge?  Gray,
               actually.

                         RIPLEY
               It's just an undercoat.
                   (Marge laughs)

                         DICKIE
               Say again?

                         RIPLEY
               You know, a primer.

                         DICKIE
               That's funny.

     He shares some intimacy with Marge, makes her laugh.  Ripley
     stands as they wrestle around him. Marge looks up.

                         MARGE
               You should come and have lunch with us,
               before you go - Dickie?

                         DICKIE
               Sure.  Any time.

                         MARGE
               And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in
               danger of turning a little pink.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks. Well, a coincidence.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. EARLY MORNING.

     ANOTHER DAY.  Church Bells ringing. Dickie, dressed in
     shorts, comes bumping up the cobbled path towards the square
     on his MOTORSCOOTER. He stops by a steep flight of steps.
     RIPLEY, a book in hand, unseen, walking up a hill, catches
     all this and, intrigued, watches as a young Italian beauty,
     SILVANA, has a spikey, flirtatious exchange with Dickie, then
     climbs on the scooter, behind him.

                         DICKIE
               I've been looking for you everywhere.

                         SILVANA
               Ah, today you're looking for me.  And
               where have you been the rest of the week?
               Pig.  With your American girl?  I hate
               you, you know?

                         DICKIE
               What?

                         SILVANA
               I hate you.

     And RIPLEY watches them as they rattle down the hill towards
     the sea.

     EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.

     Dickie appears in Marge's garden, the sea behind his head.
     Marge is sitting at her outside table surrounded by some of
     the remnants of lunch.  Dickie's sheepish, showered, late.

                         DICKIE
               Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late,
               I'm a swine.

                         MARGE
               Did you forget where I live? It's four
               o'clock.

                         DICKIE
               I just woke up.  I'm sorry.

                         MARGE
               You just woke up!

                         DICKIE
               Fausto and I - we took the boat out, we
               were fishing, and then it was dawn and
               we'd caught absolutely nothing.

                         MARGE
               Well, we ate everything without you.

                         DICKIE
               We?

                         MARGE
               Yes, Tom Ripley's here.

     As Ripley appears with the tray to collect more dishes.

                         DICKIE
               Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We
               thought you'd disappeared. We were going
               to send out a search party.

                         RIPLEY
               No, still here.

                         MARGE
               Tom was telling me about his trip over.
               Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.

                         DICKIE
               Is that good?

                         MARGE
               Shut up!

     Marge flicks him with a napkin. They start to wrestle,
     excluding Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm intruding.

                         DICKIE
               Can you mix a martini?

                         RIPLEY
                   (hesitant)
               Sure.

                         MARGE
                   (going inside)
               I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.

                         DICKIE
               Everybody should have one talent.
                   (to Ripley)
               What's yours?

                         RIPLEY
                   (without a beat)
               Forging signatures. Telling lies.
               Impersonating practically anybody.

                         DICKIE
                   (enjoying this banter)
               That's three. Nobody should have more
               than one talent. Okay, do an impression.

                         RIPLEY
               Now?  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Talent -
                   (his voice ages, his face
                    changes)
               The only talent my son has is for cashing
               his allowance.

                         DICKIE
                   (absolutely thrown)
               What? What's this?

                         RIPLEY
               I like to sail, believe me, I love to
               sail! Instead I make boats and other
               people sail them.

                         DICKIE
                   (incredibly impressed)
               Stop! It's too much!  You're making all
               the hairs on my neck stand up!

                         RIPLEY
                   (relishing it)
               Jazz, let's face it, it's just an
               insolent noise.

                         DICKIE
               I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the
               old bastard is here right now!  That's
               brilliant!  How do you know him?

                         RIPLEY
               I met him in New York.

                         DICKIE
               Marge! You've got to hear this!

                         MARGE
                   (returning with the drinks)
               What?  What?

                         DICKIE
               Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf
               1st.

                         RIPLEY
               Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a
               fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.

                         MARGE
               What's going on?

                         DICKIE
               Uncanny!

                         MARGE
               I don't get it.

                         RIPLEY
               Could you ever conceive of going there,
               Tom, and bringing him back?

                         DICKIE
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and
               persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you
               $1000.

     INT/EXT. MONGIBELLO CHURCH AND SQUARE. DUSK.

     A christening is over and now the whole village is pouring
     out of Church for the Passeggiata in Sunday best. Girls arm
     in arm parade. Boys arm in arm evaluate. New babies are
     compared and fussed over. Old people smoke, talk, shrug.
     Dickie is walking with Ripley, seething about his father's
     scheming.

                         DICKIE
               I'm never going back. To actually hire
               somebody to come all the way here to drag
               me back home - got to be insane, hasn't
               he?

     SILVANA comes out of church arm in arm with a man, her
     fiancee, as part of a foursome which includes Dickie's pal
     FAUSTO. Silvana's eyes flick towards Dickie, otherwise
     there's no acknowledgement as they all greet each other.
     Dickie introduces Tom, then they move on.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               I'm never going back!

                         RIPLEY
               No, I think your mother, her illness -

                         DICKIE
               It's got nothing to do with my mother!
               She's had leukemia for - ! This is what
               makes me boil about him! HE wants me
               back! - it's got nothing to do with my
               mother.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling
               you what I -

                         DICKIE
                   (interrupting)
               Go back!  Go back to New York or call him
               if you can find a telephone that works,
               and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me
               back to him or his shipyard.

     EXT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, MONGIBELLO. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley appears, with his meagre luggage at Dickie's front
     door. He's carrying his tote bag under his arm, the bottom of
     which seems to be unstitched and held together only by his
     fingers. Marge is on the terrace, she looks down to see Tom
     talking with Dickie.

                         MARGE
               Hi Tom.

                         DICKIE
                   (looks up)
               Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.

                         MARGE
               I'll come down.

                         DICKIE
                   (to Ripley)
               Did you speak to my father?

                         RIPLEY
               You were right about the telephones.
               There are no lines, there's some problem.

                         MARGE
                   (coming out of the front door)
               Hello Tom. You're off? What are your
               plans?

                         RIPLEY
               Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.

     He goes to shake her hand and as he releases the tote bag the
     seam splits and records spill to the ground, scattering. He
     bends down, starts gathering them up. Marge helps.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Oh, damn, sorry, this bag's -

     Dickie's delighted when he sees the Jazz titles.

                         DICKIE
               You like jazz!

                         RIPLEY
                   (gathering up the records)
               I love jazz.

                         DICKIE
                   (holding up a Chet Baker)
               This is the best. Marge says she likes
               jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is
               jazz.

                         MARGE
               I never said that!

                         RIPLEY
               Bird. That's jazz.

                         DICKIE
               Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat -

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. What's the name of your
               sailboat?

                         DICKIE
               Bird!

                         MARGE
               Which is ridiculous. Boats are female,
               everyone knows you can't call a boat
               after a man.

                         RIPLEY
               He's not a man, he's a god.

                         DICKIE
                   (excited)
               Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a
               club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.

                         MARGE
               It's vile.

                         DICKIE
               Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't
               have to come.
                   (to Ripley)
               It's great.  You're going to love it.

     INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.

     A cavern blue with smoke. A surprisingly good QUINTET blast
     out their version of MOANIN'. Dickie and Ripley arrive and
     make their way to a table where Fausto is sitting with
     friends. It's too noisy for conversation, but Dickie shouts
     introductions and they shake Ripley's hand.  Dickie is
     instantly absorbed in the music, Ripley absorbed in Dickie.
     An attractive Italian Girl, DAHLIA, comes over, kisses
     Dickie, pulls off his hat, puts it on, there's no room for
     her to sit, so she sits on Dickie's lap, smoking his
     cigarette.  Dickie raises his eyebrow at Tom, but it's
     clearly no hardship. Then the band strikes up the intro to Tu
     vuo' fa' L'Americano - a hit which reflects the current craze
     for all things American - and Fausto pulls a protesting Dickie
     up onto the stage.

                         FAUSTO
                   (improvising in Italian)
               Ladies and Gentlemen. Dickie Greenleaf,
               all the way from America... etc.

     Fausto starts to sing. Dickie joins in the chorus. Everybody
     claps. Dickie talks off-mic to Fausto.

                         FAUSTO (cont'd)
               And a big round of applause for a new
               friend from New York - Tom Ripley!

     Ripley's mortified, but Dickie jumps off the stage and pulls
     him up.  The song continues and now, at the chorus, it's
     Dickie and Ripley who have to sing. Ripley, of course, can
     sing well, if not confident in this arena. Soon the audience
     is clapping, standing on tables, dancing, Dahlia prominent.

                         DICKIE (O/S)
                   (reading)
               I have bumped into an old friend from
               Princeton - a fellow named Tom Ripley.
               He says he's going to haunt me until I
               agree to come back to New York with
               him...

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NOON.

     Dickie, in his new dressing gown, is sitting at the table,
     typing. Ripley's head emerges from behind the couch on which
     he has been enjoying a blissful sleep.

                         DICKIE
                   (grins)
               Good afternoon!

                         RIPLEY
               What time is it?
                   (puts on his glasses and checks
                    his watch)
               Oh God!  Do you always type your letters?
                   (points at the letter)
               That should be two Ts.

                         DICKIE
               I can't write and I can't spell.  That's
               the privilege of a first-class education.
               You're upstairs at the back. I think
               Ermelinda made the bed up.

                         RIPLEY
               This is so good of you.

                         DICKIE
               Don't say it again. Now you're a Double
               Agent and we're going to string my Dad
               alone, I was thinking we might buy a
               little car with the expense money he's
               sending you. What do you think, Marge...a
               little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?

     Marge has appeared, carrying Camparis.

                         MARGE
               Dickie, you can't even drive a car!  No,
               what we need urgently is an icebox. What
               do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll
               be your friend for life.

                         RIPLEY
               I absolutely agree with Marge.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS. DAY.

     Ripley locates his room, puts down his luggage in what is a
     comfortable and simple room, then heads back downstairs only
     to be tempted by the open door of Dickie's bedroom.

     INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. DAY.

     Ripley explores the casual elegance of Dickie's bedroom - the
     Louis Vuitton chest, the closet's open door spilling out
     shirts, ties. On the dressing table there are toiletries,
     cufflinks scattered, a silk tie.  Ripley picks up the tie and
     walks towards the open window below which is a terrace where
     lunch is being laid. Marge and Dickie are chatting. Shreds of
     conversation float up to Ripley.

                         DICKIE
               It'll just be for a little while.  He can
               be... he makes me laugh.

                         MARGE
               Okay, darling.

                         DICKIE
               You'd say if you mind?

                         MARGE
               No, I like him.

                         DICKIE
               Marge, you like everybody.

                         MARGE
               I don't like you.

                         DICKIE
               Then I'll go to your place and you can
               move in with Tom.

     Above them, Ripley repeats these phrases, carefully, testing
     the cadences, No, I like him. Marge, you like everybody,
     until he's as accurate as a taperecorder.

     EXT. TERRACE OF DICKIE'S HOUSE. DAY.

     Ermelinda is clearing away lunch. Ripley is changed and
     sitting at the table with Marge while Dickie works on the
     coffee. Ripley watches him, studying everything: the way he
     uses the expresso machine, the way he wears no socks, his
     pants, his rings.

                         DICKIE
               Now you know why Miss Sherwood always
               shows up for breakfast.  It's not love
               it's the coffee machine.

                         MARGE
               It's the one task Dickie can do on his
               own - make coffee.

                         DICKIE
               Shut up.

                         MARGE
               Oh darling - is that for me?

                         DICKIE
               No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.

                         RIPLEY
                   (as Dickie hands him his cup)
               That ring's so great. The green one.

                         MARGE
                   (delighted)
               Tom, I love you!
                   (to Dickie)
               See!
                   (to Ripley)
               I bought it for him, for his birthday.

                         RIPLEY
               It's superb.

                         DICKIE
               I had to promise, capital P, never to
               take it off - otherwise I'd give it to
               you.

                         MARGE
                   (flicking a crumb at him)
               Bastard!
                   (to Ripley)
               Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in
               Naples.  I bargained for about two weeks.

                         DICKIE
               I hope it wasn't cheap.

                         MARGE
               Oh, it was.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Marge)
               I have to find a birthday present for
               Frances. Perhaps you can help me?

                         MARGE
               Frances?

                         RIPLEY
               My fiancÈe.

                         DICKIE
               You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?

                         RIPLEY
               Your parents met her.

                         DICKIE
               Oh God - I can just imagine - if only
               Dickie would settle down... doesn't every
               parent deserve a grandchild?  Never! I
               swear on your ring, Marge.  I am never
               going back.

     EXT. BIRD SAILBOAT. DAY.

     The Bird is sailing off the coast of Mongibello. There's a
     manoeuvre going on with the sail.  Captain Dickie supervises
     his crew of Marge and a painfully awkward anxious-to-please
     Ripley.  Dickie goes over to help him.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?

                         DICKIE
               You're doing great. We'll make a sailor
               of you yet. You're doing really well.

                         MARGE
               Dubious but special honor, Tom - crewing
               Dickie's boat.  Alright, bar's open.

                         DICKIE
               Yes please!

     She heads for the cabin. Dickie settles down beside Ripley.

                         RIPLEY
               Could we sail to Venice?

                         DICKIE
               Sure.  I love Venice.

                         RIPLEY
               I have to go to Venice.

                         DICKIE
               See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or
               is it Rome? You do something and die,
               don't you?  Okay, Venice is on the list.

                         RIPLEY
               And Rome.

                         DICKIE
               Do you ski?
                   (Ripley frowns)
               Don't tell me - you're a lost cause!
               That's the next thing to deal with. We're
               planning to go to Cortina at Christmas.
               Excellent skiing. Excellent.
                   (as Marge reappears)
               Marge - Ripley can't ski.  We'll have to
               teach him that, too. Have you ever known
               such low class?

                         MARGE
               Poor Tom. Good thing we're not getting
               married. We might have to invite him on
               our honeymoon.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.

     Marge and Ripley are on a shopping expedition. They walk down
     the hill towards the grocery shop, next to the bar in the
     little square. Ripley has asked Marge how she and Dickie met.

                         MARGE
               Oh I hated New York - that Park Avenue
               crowd - so I fled to Paris to work on my
               book, and I was always going to this cafe
               with Jean-Jacques, and Dickie used to
               play his saxophone outside and I would
               see him and he would see me, and he would
               play My Funny Valentine. It was only
               later that I realised he only knows about
               six songs.

     They've arrived at the Grocery Store. Alessandra, the woman
     who owns the store greets them.  Silvana, who's her daughter,
     is also there, and less comfortable. She waits for Marge's
     order.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
                   (to Silvana, in Italian)
               Buono Sera, Silvana. Por favore: arance e
               pane, e del prosciutto.

                         SILVANA
               E fichi?  Come sempre?

                         MARGE
               Si.  Come sempre.  Grazie.

     Silvana goes inside for the meat and bread. Marge frowns.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
                   (back to Ripley)
               Anyway, then one day, we go in, I see
               Dickie, he starts playing My Funny
               Valentine, and then all of a sudden he
               just walks into the cafe, right in front
               of Jean-Jacques, and grabs me! Now I had
               never spoken to him in my life - he said
               I'm going to Italy, tomorrow, and I want
               you to come with me. So I did.

     At the edge of the square there's A BOCCE AREA, where men
     throw metal balls along a track, aiming to get closest to a
     small cue. Dickie is there, playing intensely with Fausto and
     two other guys, one of whom we've seen before with Silvana.
     Ripley and Marge loop back towards home, taking in the Bocce
     en route. Dickie waves. They wave back. Marge calls to him.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom
               and I are running off together.

                         DICKIE
               Okay.

     EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. EARLY EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley are leaving.  They're fooling around.
     Dickie jumps on Ripley's shoulders. Marge watches from the
     top of the garden.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO SQUARE. EARLY EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley, still horsing about, pass Silvana's
     grocery store.  Dickie dismounts, goes over to Silvana, who's
     tense, a little troubled. They huddle, Ripley isolated.

                         SILVANA
               Did you get my message?  I want to talk
               to you.

                         DICKIE
               I want to talk to you too...Smile for me.

     And Dickie's already gone, back to Ripley feinting to box him
     then dancing, satyr-like, down the hill.

     EXT. COASTAL ROAD TO NAPLES. EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley on the Vespa. There's a steep incline where
     the road winds down towards Naples and, as the Vespa gains
     speed, Ripley is happy to cling to Dickie.

                         DICKIE
               You're breaking my ribs!

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               You're breaking my ribs!

     INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.

     Ripley's really singing, carrying the burden of My Funny
     Valentine in a flawless imitation of Chet Baker. Dickie is
     playing some sax. After a verse, there's spontaneous
     applause. Dickie, impressed beams at Ripley.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.

     A NEW ICEBOX, incongruous in pride of place in the living
     room, casts its glow on a delighted Dickie as he pulls out a
     couple of beers, handing one to Ripley who is paging through
     his copy of the Collected Works of Shakespeare.

                         DICKIE
               I could fuck this icebox I love it so
               much.
                   (considering Ripley)
               What were you actually doing in New York?

                         RIPLEY
               I played piano in a few places.

                         DICKIE
               That's one job, you told me a lot of
               jobs.

                         RIPLEY
               A few places - that's a few jobs. Anyway,
               I don't want to think about New York.

                         DICKIE
               The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I
               spend hours speculating.
                   (drinking)
               Cold beer. Thank you Dad.

                         RIPLEY
               Copy out from here...

     He hands the book to Dickie, pointing out the lines.

                         DICKIE
                   (staring to write on the back
                    of a postcard)
               I love the fact you brought Shakespeare
               with you and no clothes.  Ermelinda says
               you wash the same shirt out every night.
               Is that true?

                         RIPLEY
               No! I've got more than one shirt!

                         DICKIE
               She can do that stuff for you. Anyway,
               just wear some of my things, wear
               anything you want, most of it's ancient.
                   (he's finished writing)

                         RIPLEY
               Now your signature.
                   (watching him write)
               Not "Dickie". Your signature.

     Dickie writes his signature at the bottom of the postcard.
     Ripley studies the writing, takes off his glasses to clean
     them. Dickie looks at him.

                         DICKIE
               Without the glasses you're not even ugly.
                   (takes them, tries them on)
               I don't need them because I never read.
               How do I look.

                         RIPLEY
               Like Clark Kent.
                   (takes them back, puts them on
                    beaming at Dickie)
               Now Superman.

     Dickie cuffs him.  Ripley looks down at the postcard.

                         DICKIE
               I know. I write like a child.

                         RIPLEY
               Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T,
               do you see? - fine, vulnerable - that's
               pain, that's secret pain.

                         DICKIE
               It must be a deep secret, cause I don't
               know about it.

                         RIPLEY
               Your handwriting - nothing more naked.
               See - nothing's quite touching the line -
               that's vanity.

                         DICKIE
                   (flattered)
               Well we certainly know that's true.

     INT. DICKIE'S BATHROOM. NIGHT.

     Dickie's in the bath. Ripley, dressed, sits on the stool next
     to the bath. They're in the middle of playing chess, the
     board propped on the bath tray. Ripley puts his hand in the
     water, checking the temperature. He turns on the faucet for a
     burst of hot. Ripley is absurdly happy. He pours some wine.

                         DICKIE
               Do you have any brothers?

                         RIPLEY
               No, no brothers, no sisters.

                         DICKIE
               me neither. Nor does Marge. All only
               children - what does that mean?

     He looks at Ripley who looks at him, a little too long.

                         RIPLEY
               Means we never shared a bath.
               I'm cold. Can I get in?

                         DICKIE
               No!

                         RIPLEY
               I didn't mean with you in it.

                         DICKIE
                   (standing)
               Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune
               anyway.

     He gets out, walks past Ripley, who doesn't turn around. But
     Dickie's reflected in the mirror. Ripley looks, then Dickie
     turns, holds his look momentarily before flicking him with
     his towel.

     INT/EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, NAPLES. DAY.

     An OFFICIAL is studying Dickie's passport photograph. It's
     not a recent picture. The official looks suspicious. Dickie
     is used to it.

                         DICKIE
               It is me. It's an old picture.
                   (sighs at Ripley)
               Every time - 'is it you?  Doesn't look
               like you'.

     He's signing for his allowance. He has a smart document case
     with his initials prominently embossed.  Ripley watches him
     sign and collect a large wad of notes.

                         CLERK
               Letters - Greenleaf, and for Ripley.

     Ripley collects and studies his mail. As they walk outside he
     holds up one letter to Dickie.

                         RIPLEY
               Fran.
                   (anticipating her letter)
               I miss you, where are you coming home?
               Stop telling me what a great time you're
               having, how you love Dickie... and Marge
               and...
                   (the next letter)
               And this one, I think, is your dad...

     INT. TRAIN TO ROME. DAY.

     Ripley sits reading the LETTER from Herbert Greenleaf.  He
     frowns, stops reading, looks out of the window.

                         DICKIE
               What does he say?

                         RIPLEY
               He's getting impatient. He wants me to
               reassure him you'll be home by
               Thanksgiving.

                         DICKIE
               You've got to get a new jacket. Really.
               You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm
               sick of seeing you in them.

                         RIPLEY
               I can't. I can't keep spending your
               father's money.

                         DICKIE
               I love how responsible you are. My Dad
               should make you Chief Accountant or
               something.  Let me buy you a jacket.
               There's a great place when we get to
               Rome, Batistoni.

     Ripley loves this idea and mouths the word, "Batistoni".

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Andiamo a Roma.  We're taking Tom to
               Roma!

     EXT. ARCARI'S CAFE, PIAZZA NAVONA, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley and Dickie sit outside at a Cafe in the Piazza Navona.
     Very smart, very sophisticated, very young crowd.  There are
     already several empty coffee cups and a half empty bottle of
     Frascati.  Ripley has his guide book out and is incredibly
     impatient. Dickie, meanwhile, has stretched out for the
     duration.

                         RIPLEY
               Where do we find a carozza for the Forum,
               or can we hire any of them - ?

                         DICKIE
               Relax.

                         RIPLEY
               It's just there's so much to do in a
               single day.

                         DICKIE
               Relax. The most important question is
               where to eat. I hope Freddie made a
               reservation.

                         RIPLEY
               Freddie?

                         DICKIE
               Freddie Miles.  You know - he's
               organizing the Cortina skiing trip.

     Ripley hates the idea of having this special day invaded. A
     horn makes him look up as FREDDIE MILES illegally parks his
     open top sports car opposite the cafe, sees Dickie and
     bustles over.  He's a heavy-set American with a reddish
     crewcut. Ripley finds him disgusting to look at. Dickie is
     delighted.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Frederico!

                         FREDDIE
               Ciao bello.
                   (noticing a beautiful woman in
                    an open-topped car)
               Don't you want to fuck every woman you
               see.  Just once.

     They kiss cheeks, continental-style.

                         DICKIE
               This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.

                         FREDDIE
                   (mugging)
               Hey, if I'm late, think what her
               husband's saying!

     He fills Dickie's glass with wine and drinks it standing up.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               So let's go. I got us a table outside at
               Fabrizio's.

     And Dickie's up, leaving Ripley to pick up all the tiny
     checks to work out the bill and pay it.

                         DICKIE
               I'll tell you - I am so cabin-crazy with
               Mongi.

     Freddie and Dickie link arms Italian-style and cross the
     street to Freddie's car.

                         FREDDIE
               I know.  I was there.
                   (looks back to see Ripley
                    struggling to settle the
                    check)
               Tommy!  It's S.R.O.  Two seater.
               Standing Room Only.  Chop, chop, Tommy!

     Ripley, abandoned, goes over. There's no room in the car. He
     has to crouch in the rear.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               You're going to have to sit between us.
               But don't put your shoes on the seat,
               know what I mean, put them one on top of
               the other.  Okay?

     INT. A JAZZ RECORD STORE. LATE AFTERNOON.

     This record store is hidden away down a cobbled alley, and
     stuffed with the trendiest Romans, all of whom rifle the
     stacks under a fog of cigarette smoke.  There are two
     LISTENING BOOTHS, one of which has Freddie and Dickie crammed
     into it, sharing a set of headphones.  Ripley stands outside
     the booth, holding both of their jackets like a manservant,
     while inside and behind the glass doors they chat animatedly.
     He looks longingly at the street, where the light is fading.
     Dickie catches his hangdog expression and pushes open the
     accordion doors.

                         DICKIE
               Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and
               meet some friends of Freddie's. The best
               thing is - if you want to be a tourist -
               grab a cab and we can meet up at the
               railway station.

                         RIPLEY
                   (absolutely crestfallen)
               What club?

                         DICKIE
               Freddie's arranged it with some of the
               skiing crowd. Come if you want but I
               thought you wanted to see the Forum...?

                         RIPLEY
               I did. And then maybe get the jacket and
               what have you...

                         FREDDIE
                   (from inside the booth)
               Dick - you've got to hear this!

                         DICKIE
                   (oblivious to Ripley's pain)
               Listen, just take one of mine when we get
               back. Don't worry about it.  I did the
               Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is
               enough in anyone's life.

     Ripley hands him the coats, turns away.

                         DICKIE
               Ciao.  Have fun.

     Ripley heads for the door, then comes back, raps on the
     booth.  Dickie pushes it open.

                         RIPLEY
               You said to make sure you didn't miss the
               train. It leaves at eight.

     EXT. THE CAPITOL. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley hikes up Michelangelo's Arcoeli Steps. Then he's
     looking down from the Campodoglio at the Forum below. Then
     he's walking by the oversized fragments of the Colossus. This
     is the real Ripley, the lover of beauty, inspired by art, by
     antiquity. He's awed. He's cold. He so much wishes he weren't
     alone.

     INT. ROME RAILWAY STATION. NIGHT.

     It's past eight, Ripley stands, one foot on the guard step of
     the Naples train, waiting forlornly for Dickie, then giving
     up as the train pulls away. He pulls the door to his
     compartment closed, and sits inside the train alone.

     INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

     There's music playing, Bing Crosby's "May I". Very loud.
     Ripley dances to the mirror, SPECTACLES ABANDONED and DRESSED
     AS DICKIE IN HIS TUXEDO, MINUS TROUSERS. He adjusts his hair,
     catches one of Dickie's expressions.  There are clothes
     abandoned everywhere.  He's been having a big dressing-up
     session. He sings along with Bing.

                         DICKIE (O/S)
               What are you doing?

     Ripley turns, horrified, to see Dickie standing in the
     doorway.  The music thumps away.

                         RIPLEY
               Oh - just amusing myself.  Sorry, Dickie.
                   (pause)
               I didn't think you were coming back.

     Dickie turns off the record player.

                         DICKIE
               I wish you'd get out of my clothes.

     Ripley starts undressing, his fingers clumsy with
     mortification and shock.  Dickie looks at his feet, shakes
     his head.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Shoes too?

                         RIPLEY
                   (lame, ashamed)
               You said I could pick out a jacket and I
               just... Sorry.

                         DICKIE
               Get undressed in your own room, would
               you?

                         RIPLEY
               I thought you'd missed the train.

                         DICKIE
               Freddie drove me back in his car.

                         RIPLEY
                   (horrified)
               Is Freddie here?

                         DICKIE
               He's downstairs.

                         RIPLEY
               I was just fooling around. Don't say
               anything. Sorry.

     Dickie lets him leave and then sits amongst the debris of the
     dressing-up session, not amused.

     EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. DAY.

     Ripley comes down, apprehensive, to find Marge and Dickie and
     Freddie having a jolly breakfast on the terrace. Dickie looks
     perfectly happy.

                         MARGE
               Hi, Tom.  Come join us.

                         FREDDIE
               I want this job of yours, Tommy. I was
               just saying - You live in Italy, sleep in
               Dickie's house, eat Dickie's food, wear
               his clothes, and his father picks up the
               tab. If you get bored, let me know, I'll
               do it!

     EXT. THE OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DAY.

     The boat is drifting.  Freddie and Dickie and Marge are
     swimming, then Marge climbs back onto the boat, where Ripley
     is sitting alone, reading.

                         MARGE
               You really should go in, it's marvellous.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm fine.

     She approaches him, conscious of his isolation. She's in a
     red bikini, and she towels herself dry as they speak.

                         MARGE
               Are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               Sure.

     They watch Dickie and Freddie fooling around in the water.

                         MARGE
               The thing with Dickie - it's like the sun
               shines on you and it's glorious, then he
               forgets you and it's very very cold.

                         RIPLEY
               So I'm learning.

                         MARGE
               He's not even aware of it. When you've
               got his attention you feel like you're
               the only person in the world. That's why
               everybody loves him. Other times...

     There's a yell from Dickie as Freddie wrestles with him.

                         DICKIE
                   (laughing and choking)
               He's drowning me!

                         MARGE
               It's always the same whenever someone new
               comes into his life - Freddie, Fausto,
               Peter Smith-Kingsley - he's wonderful -
               did you meet him, he's a musician? -
               ... and especially you, of course... and
               that's only the boys.

     They watch as Freddie pushes Dickie under the surface.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               Tell me, why is it when men play they
               always play at killing each other...?
               I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.

                         RIPLEY
               What about Cortina?

                         MARGE
               Didn't Dick say? - he talked to
               Freddie... apparently it's not going to
               work out -
                   (Ripley's devastated, Marge
                    notices, can't look at him)
               Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.

     EXT. OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DUSK.

     LATER and now the boat is sailing again. Ripley is sitting in
     his spot. Dickie and Freddie are at the tiller.

                         DICKIE
               Come on, Frederico, do you really have
               to go back?  At least stick around for
               the Festival of the Madonna.

                         FREDDIE
               I don't think so. Come back with me to
               Rome. There's this great new club.  Have
               some drinks, lotta ladies...

     Marge, still in her bikini, disappears into the cabin. Dickie
     makes a face at Freddie.

                         DICKIE
               Do you think you can steer this thing?

                         FREDDIE
               Sure.

                         DICKIE
               Just point her at Capri and avoid the
               rocks.

                         FREDDIE
               What are you doing?

                         DICKIE
               Marge-maintenance.

                         FREDDIE
               Aye, aye.

     Dickie heads towards the cabin. Freddie takes over the
     tiller. There's a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the
     water.

     From where Ripley sits he can see Capri in the distance, but
     he can also look down into the cabin, its porthole offering
     him a restricted view.  He looks down and there's a flash of
     flesh, then nothing.  Then as the boat swings with the waves,
     he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair, and then
     Marge's bare foot kicking out rhythmically, the red-painted
     toes straining.  Ripley's mesmerized, aroused, and absolutely
     betrayed.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               Tommy - How's the peeping? Come on Tommy,
               you were looking.  Tommy Tommy Tommy.

     Shamed, Ripley looks away. He stares at the water, parting
     before the boat, its turmoil reflecting his.

     EXT. DICKIE'S MOORING. DAY.

     The Bird returns to the mooring by Dickie's House.  Dickie as
     ever Captain of the Ship, clambering around, shouting
     instructions, with Ripley, Marge and Freddie as crew.  Ripley
     looks back at shore. Silvana stands watching, staring.
     Dickie notices her too.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO SLIPWAY. LATE DAY.

     A WOMAN'S HEAD suddenly breaks the surface of the water.

     It's a statue of the Virgin Mary, life size, adorned with
     flowers and a lace veil.  As she is revealed, wooden,
     staring, four men emerge, lifting the statue on a palette,
     wading towards the shore, the Madonna aloft on their
     shoulders.

     The whole town of Mongibello is in attendance for this Annual
     Festival of the Madonna del Mare, either standing in their
     fishing boats, or on shore and flanking the Parish Priest and
     altar boys and incense. RIPLEY, DICKIE and MARGE watch from
     Dickie's terrace. There are hymns and, as the statue is
     carried to the shore, the men's heads barely above the waves,
     the congregation applauds at the illusion that the Madonna is
     walking on water.

     Suddenly ANOTHER HEAD appears on the surface of the water,
     about fifty yards from the statue. There's a scream from
     among the crowd as someone notices the body. It's SILVANA.
     One of the MEN carrying the statue turns first towards the
     direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse.
     It's Silvana's fiancee, and in a second he has let go of the
     palette, CAUSING IT TO TOPPLE, and - in absolute grief -
     wades, swims, splashes towards the body.

     PANDEMONIUM in the crowd, which breaks up, with other people
     splashing, fully clothed, into the water. From the terrace,
     Ripley turns and looks at Dickie, catching his eye.

     EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. LATE DAY.

     Marge and Ripley and Dickie watch from the terrace as below
     them an AMBULANCE takes away the body. It seems as if the
     whole town looks on - fiancee, parents, brothers, sisters,
     police, priest, etc. As the corpse is loaded into the vehicle
     A BRIEF SCUFFLE occurs between Silvana's fiancee and her
     brother. They are pulled apart. Then the ambulance pulls
     away.

                         RIPLEY
               What's the fight about? That's her
               fiancÈ, isn't it?  Are they blaming him?

                         DICKIE
                   (sharp)
               I don't know! Why are you asking me?
                   (agitated)
               How can it take an hour to find an
               ambulance?

                         MARGE
                   (conciliatory)
               Well, she was already dead, darling,
               wasn't she, so I suppose -

                         DICKIE
               I don't know why people say this
               country's civilised. It isn't. It's
               fucking primitive.

     And with that HE KICKS OUT VIOLENTLY AT A CHAIR SUPPORTING
     THE RECORDPLAYER. Records, machine, chair go flying across
     the terrace. Dickie storms inside.

                         MARGE
               Dickie!

                         RIPLEY
               I'll go and see what's the matter.

                         MARGE
               I'll go.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Later, Dickie is slumped in an armchair at the open window
     overlooking the slipway. He's playing sax. A forlorn, keening
     phrase from YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS. Ripley appears,
     begins tidying the mess in the living room.  He picks up
     empty bottles, an abandoned bikini top.

                         RIPLEY
               I know why you're upset.
                   (Dickie continues playing)
               I know about Silvana, Dickie. About you
               and Silvana.

     Dickie stops playing.

                         DICKIE
               What about us?

     He now has an armful of dishes and glasses and bottles.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
                   (losing his temper)
               You don't have to clean up! Really!

     Ripley disappears into the kitchen.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
                   (as Ripley returns)
               She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do
               you know what that means in a place like
               this?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm prepared to take the blame.

                         DICKIE
               What are you talking about?

                         RIPLEY
               You've been so good to me. You're the
               brother I never had. I'm the brother you
               never had.

                         DICKIE
               She came to me for help, she needed
               money, and I didn't help her. I didn't
               help her. Now she's dead and it's my
               fault.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm not going to say anything - to Marge,
               or anybody, the police - It's a secret
               between us and I'll keep it.

     And he disappears again, leaving Dickie to resume the sax,
     somehow in thrall to Ripley.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               Dear Tom, I think the time has come to
               discontinue your expense checks...

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, NAPLES. DAY.

     Ripley and Dickie are walking out of the American Express
     Office, Dickie pushing the rest of his money into his case,
     Ripley - despondent - reading aloud extracts from a letter
     from Herbert Greenleaf -

                         RIPLEY
               ...The thousand dollars, of course, was
               only due in the event that you succeeded
               in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I
               hope the trip has afforded you some
               pleasure despite the failure of its main
               objective you need no longer consider
               yourself obligated to us in any way...

                         DICKIE
               You can't blame him.  You could hardly
               expect this to go on forever.

                         RIPLEY
               I thought you might write again. Now that
               we're brothers...

                         DICKIE
               I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've
               had a good run, haven't we?

                         RIPLEY
                   (increasingly miserable)
               What about Venice? Can we stick to that
               plan at least?

                         DICKIE
               I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on
               here without money.  It's time we all
               moved on.  Besides I'm sick of Mongi.
               Especially now with everything - I really
               want to move to the North. I need to
               check out San Remo next week, find
               somewhere new to keep the boat.
               But it would be great, though, if you
               came with me.  Our last trip before you
               leave. There's a jazz festival - we could
               say goodbye in style.  What do you think?
               A last trip?

     INT. TRAIN TO SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.

     Dickie and Ripley travel up to San Remo. They sit next to
     each other. Dickie's asleep. Ripley lays his head on Dickie's
     shoulder, but as he does that, the ticket inspector announces
     the San Remo stop, taps on the window and Dickie stirs. Then
     Ripley plays his familiar game of studying his face in the
     reflection of the train window, so that he can move his head
     and see his reflection, then back and see Dickie's.  Dickie
     suddenly catches him staring. Ripley looks away.

                         DICKIE
                   (terse)
               Why do you do that thing - with your
               neck? On trains you always do that thing,
               it's so spooky.

     EXT. HOTEL TERRACE RESTAURANT, SAN REMO. NIGHT.

     Dickie and Ripley walk through the terrace of an hotel which
     lips out towards the sea. There's a restaurant and palms and
     a JAZZ QUINTET playing, American. Very cool. They pass the
     band. Dickie's captivated as they head for their table. They
     pass some girls at a table. Dickie smiles greedily.

                         DICKIE
               This is more like it. Didn't I tell you
               San Remo was crazy!

     They're shown to a good table. Dickie watches the band while
     their glasses are filled with champagne. Ripley looks happy.
     He's got Dickie all to himself.

                         RIPLEY
               To Mongibello and the happiest days of my
               life.

                         DICKIE
               To Mongi.  You're cheerful tonight.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm suddenly quite happy to be going
               back.

                         DICKIE
               That's good.

                         RIPLEY
               I've got plans!

                         DICKIE
               Ripley's plans.

                         RIPLEY
               Esatto. I'm always planning.

                         DICKIE
               Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I
               didn't, did I?

                         RIPLEY
               Why are you asking all of a sudden?

                         DICKIE
               No reason. Because you're leaving, I
               guess. I don't think you were there, were
               you?

                         RIPLEY
               Why?

                         DICKIE
               I mean it as a compliment. You've got
               such great taste, I don't know. Most of
               the thugs at Princeton had tasted
               everything and had no taste. Used to say,
               the cream of America: rich and thick.
               Freddie's the perfect example.

                         RIPLEY
               Then I'll take it as a compliment.

                         DICKIE
               I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!

                         RIPLEY
                   (a beat)
               Ha.

                         DICKIE
               Do you even like jazz - or was that
               something for my benefit?

                         RIPLEY
                   (conceding, without guile)
               I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to
               like everything about the way you live.
               It's one big love affair. If you knew my
               life back home in New York...

     Dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert
     solo, doesn't hear the confession of love.

                         DICKIE
               I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what
               do you think about drums?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               So cool.

     He mimes a high-hat and snare. Ripley can't quite credit this
     - it's superficiality.

     EXT. MID OCEAN. DAY.

     The bay of San Remo. DICKIE and RIPLEY have hired a motor 
     boat.

                         DICKIE
               That's how I found my place in Mongi.
               Took a boat out round the bay.  The first
               place I liked, I got it.

     The motor boat is ploughing the waves. Dickie exhilarated by
     the speed.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie, slow down, come on!

     Ripley grips the oar, his knuckles white. Dickie cuts the
     motor, and the boat slows to a crawl, miles from the shore.

                         DICKIE
                   (ecstatic)
               I love it here! Gonna live here!

     Dickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of
     the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers,
     already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich.

                         RIPLEY
               I wanted to tell you my plan.

                         DICKIE
               So tell me.

                         RIPLEY
               I thought I might come back. In the New
               Year. Under my own steam.

                         DICKIE
                   (suddenly tight)
               Really?  To Italy?

                         RIPLEY
               Of course. Let's say, for argument's
               sake, you were here - perhaps we could
               split the rent on a house - I'll get a
               job - or, better still, I could get a
               place in Rome and when we're there we
               could be there and if we're here we could
               be here -

                         DICKIE
               Oh God, I don't think so.

                         RIPLEY
               - you see, particularly with the Marge
               problem, you can just blame me.

                         DICKIE
               Marge and I are getting married.

                         RIPLEY
                   (appalled)
               How?

                         DICKIE
               How?

                         RIPLEY
               Yesterday you're ogling girls on the
               terrace, today you're getting married.
               It's absurd.

                         DICKIE
               I love Marge.

                         RIPLEY
               You love me and you're not marrying me.

                         DICKIE
                   (cold)
               Tom, I don't love you.

                         RIPLEY
               No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained
               all of that.

                         DICKIE
               I'm actually a little relieved you're
               going, to be honest. I think we've seen
               enough of each other for a while.

     Ripley stares at him, his eyes suddenly reptilian.

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               You can be a leech - you know this - and
               it's boring. You can be quite boring.

                         RIPLEY
                   (volcanic)
               The funny thing - I'm not pretending to
               be somebody else and you are. I'm
               absolutely honest with you. I've told you
               my feelings. But you, first of all I know
               there's something - that evening when we
               played chess, for instance, it was
               obvious -

                         DICKIE
                   (incredulous)
               What evening?

                         RIPLEY
               Sure - I know, that's too dangerous for
               you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers,
               fine, then you do this sordid thing with
               Marge, fucking her on the boat while we
               all have to listen, which was
               excruciating, frankly, plus you follow
               your cock around like a - and now you're
               getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive
               me...you're lying to Marge then getting
               married to her, you're knocking up
               Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've
               got to play drums, which is it, Dickie,
               what do you really play?

     Dickie, furious, gets up, and lurches towards Ripley.

                         DICKIE
                   (attacking him, administering
                    tiny slaps as punctuation to
                    his tirade)
               Who are you - some imposter, some third
               class mooch - who are you to tell me
               anything? Actually, I really really
               really don't want to be on this boat with
               you, I can't move without you moving,
               which is exactly how it feels and it
               gives me the creeps.
                   (he goes to rev up the engine)
               I can't move without - "Dickie, Dickie,
               Dickie" - like a little girl.  You give
               me the -

     RIPLEY SMASHES HIM ACROSS THE HEAD WITH THE OAR. DICKIE SLIPS
     OFF THE WOODEN SEAT, HIS EYES ROLLING IN GROGGY SURPRISE.

                         RIPLEY
               Shut up! Just shut up! Just shut up!

     The boat slows as Dickie releases the tiller.  Dickie looks
     up at Ripley wearily and slides onto his back.

                         DICKIE
               For God's sake.

     Ripley, shocked at himself, goes to Dickie, rocking the boat,
     catches him up, then is horrified to see Dickie's face,
     apparently unmarked, SUDDENLY SPLIT OPEN, a line of blood and
     then a peeling like a fruit bursting. Ripley's appalled.  A
     terrible roar issues from Dickie as he launches himself at
     Ripley.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               I'll kill you!

     Ripley finds himself pushing him away, picking up the oar,
     kicking off Dickie's hand around his ankle. The boat is
     rocking and swerving crazily as Dickie falls against the
     tiller. Ripley almost loses his balance. His glasses come
     off. They struggle, locked together in a life or death
     wrestle to get control of the oar. Dickie's blinded by his
     own blood, loses his grip.

     Ripley, terrified, hits Dickie again and again, the oar like
     a carpet-beater banging down flat, blood on the blade, blood
     on Ripley, until he's on his knees, heaving for breath,
     letting his arm drop, then realizing, disgusted, that he's
     let it rest in a pool of blood. He starts to sob, sprawls
     there, sobbing, next to Dickie, horrified by what he's done.

     Nobody's in sight.  The boat rocks, gently, the sun sparkling
     indifferently on the waves.  Ripley lies by Dickie in the
     bottom of the boat, in the embrace he's always wanted.

     The pretty blue-and-white boat rocks peacefully.  The sea
     calms.

     EXT. A COVE NEAR SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.

     A deserted cove, several miles along the coast. Ripley
     clambers onto a rock over the shore.  He's watching the boat
     slowly sinking. Shuddering from the exertion, the cold, he
     finds Dickie's jacket, puts it on and watches as the boat
     disappears under the surface.

     EXT. SAN REMO. DUSK.

     Ripley walks back towards the hotel, still wearing Dickie's
     jacket, cold and wet, his bag over his shoulder.

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley approaches the front desk.  He's shivering.  He's not
     wearing his glasses.

                         RIPLEY
               Can I have my key, please?

                         RECEPTIONIST
                   (at the key rack)
               Of course - But you must be very cold?
               Signor Greenleaf?  Yes? -

                         RIPLEY
                   (mind racing)
               No, it's - I'm...

     EXT. ROAD BETWEEN NAPLES AND MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley sits on the bus as it rumbles towards Mongi.  He
     stares out of the window, full of what he's done. No idea
     what to do.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. DAY.

     The BUS comes into town. Ripley gets out, looks calm, very
     together.

     INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM, MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley walks into the living room, slowly approaches
     Dickie's saxophone which is on its stand on the table.  He
     can't get close to it, it evokes Dickie too much.

     INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. DAY.

     Ripley has Dickie's Hermes Baby typewriter on the desk and is
     busy writing letters. He has finished a letter to the
     Greenleafs, now he's at the end of one to Marge. We can read
     part of it - C/O American Express, Rome 9 November 1958. Dear
     Marge, this is a difficult letter for me to write... Ripley
     produces the Shakespeare and Signature page and COPIES
     DICKIE'S SIGNATURE at the end of the letter.

     EXT. MARGE'S GARDEN, MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley stands at the entrance to Marge's garden where she is
     working at her book on the outside table, surrounded by
     references and notes, held down by bricks. He looks at her
     until she looks at him. She's startled, gasps.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Marge.

                         MARGE
               Tom, you startled me!  You're back.

                         RIPLEY
               How are you? Sorry. Is your book going
               well?

                         MARGE
               Yes - I'm on a good streak, thanks.

                         RIPLEY
               I was just looking at you -
                   (looking at her tenderly)
               - so quiet.

                         MARGE
               Where's Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               I think he's planning on staying in Rome
               for a few days.

                         MARGE
                   (looks at him)
               Ha. Did he say why?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. I don't understand Dickie,
               Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.

                         MARGE
               What does that mean?

                         RIPLEY
               Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the
               next day I'm not, one day we're all one
               family, the next day he wants to be
               alone. You tell me.

                         MARGE
               Is that what he said - he wanted to be
               alone?

                         RIPLEY
               He was thinking of you, Marge - he asked
               me to deliver this.

     He hands her a package. She pulls at it, it's perfume.

                         MARGE
               Thanks. he knows I love this, although
               why it couldn't have waited...

                         RIPLEY
               Errand number one - deliver Marge's
               perfume. Errand number two, pack some
               clothes and his precious saxophone.

                         MARGE
                   (alarmed)
               How long's he staying for?

                         RIPLEY
               Search me. I guess we're abandoned.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, BEACH. EARLY MORNING.

     Marge is walking along the beach and out onto the jetty,
     forlorn, a bleached figure on this winter morning.

     INT. OFF FROM DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. MORNING.

     As Ripley walks down the stairs, Marge is at the icebox in
     the living room. She's fixing herself a drink, has the icebox
     open for ice. She's ashen, and might have been weeping, walks
     back into the kitchen area.

                         MARGE
               There was a letter from Dickie in with my
               perfume. You realize it's more than a few
               days? He's thinking of moving to Rome.

     She bangs out the ice onto the counter, cubes falling
     everywhere. Ripley drops to the floor and starts to clear
     them up.  She's got the letter, shows it to Ripley. He puts
     fresh ice into her glass.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               The thing is, the night before he left,
               we talked about moving, together, going
               North - and I suppose I put some pressure
               on him, about getting married, I just
               might have scared him off. There's a side
               to him, when our heads are on the pillow,
               I know no-one else sees it, which is
               really tender.
                   (unravelling)
               I think I should come with you to Rome
               and just confront him.

     Ripley lights a cigarette.  Marge loses confidence.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               He hates being confronted.

                         RIPLEY
               I think you're right.

     INT. ALBERGO GOLDONI, ROME. DAY.

     RIPLEY'S BATTERED CASES are carried into the tiny lobby of
     this small hotel. He exchanges his passport at the desk for
     his room key, then makes his way, carrying his own luggage to
     the metal cage elevator. THIS SCENE INTERCUTS WITH:

     INT. HOTEL GRAND. DAY.

     DICKIE'S ARRAY OF LEATHER LUGGAGE is pulled along on a 
     baggage trolley by a liveried PORTER.

     Dickie's passport slides across the marble desk. A key comes
     back, collected by a hand sporting Dickie's two distinctive
     rings.  As ALDO, the Front Desk Manager, inspects the
     passport, he looks at the owner.  Ripley wears a terrific
     suit, his hair parted in the Greenleaf style, no glasses. His
     voice, when he speaks, has the same, lazy, confident drawl.

                         ALDO
               Welcome back, Signor Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
                   (walking away)
               Thank you.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. DAY.

     The PORTER takes the cases and opens them as Ripley walks
     around the suite. It's large and splendid. Ripley breathes in
     its opulence.  He immediately picks up the telephone.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, I'd like you to telephone the Hotel
               Goldoni. Yes. I want to speak to Signor
               Thomas Ripley - No Ripley, R, yes.
               Grazie.

     He produces Dickie's pen and signs the blotter quickly - H R
     Greenleaf.  Then he pulls out a postcard from the writing
     case to reveal Dickie's Stars, hide your fires handwriting
     specimen. He compares the two signatures, is pleased.

     The telephone rings.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Pronto? Signor Ripley is not there? I'd
               like to leave a message. Yes. Please call
               Dickie - Dickie Greenleaf - at the Grand.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOTEL ROOM, GOLDONI. DAY.

     A tiny, cell of a room, single bed. Ripley on the phone.

                         RIPLEY
               He's not there?  Very well. I'll leave a
               message - Got your call. Dinner tonight
               sounds fine. Ripley.
                   (listens as it's read back)
               Dinner tonight, yes, is okay. Yes, thank
               you.

     INT. GUCCI STORE, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley has bought some more LEATHER GOODS - a briefcase and
     overnight bag. He is at the counter, signing checks.

                         RIPLEY
               I'd like these to have my initials -
               embossed, I don't know the word in
               Italian ...embossed?

                         GUCCI ASSISTANT
               Embossed, of course, Signor Greenleaf.

     There's an excited rap on the window and a shout of DICKIE!
     Shocked, Ripley looks over to find MEREDITH LOGUE outside,
     alone and delighted to see him.  He grins and mouths hello.

                         MEREDITH
                   (entering the shop)
               Dickie! Oh my God!  Ciao.

     EXT. ACROSS PIAZZA NAVONA TO ARCARI'S CAFE. DAY.

     Ripley and Meredith walk across the Piazza towards the cafe.

                         MEREDITH
               But you're going skiing with us Yankees,
               aren't you?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MEREDITH
               At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie
               Miles and -

                         RIPLEY
                   (interrupting, astonished)
               How did you know that?

                         MEREDITH
               Everybody knows Freddie Miles.

                         RIPLEY
                   (unsettled)
               Is Freddie in Rome?

                         MEREDITH
               Now? I don't think so. But I've met him,
               of course, and we've chatted and I know
               about you and Marge and Mongi and what an
               unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you
               were a rat and I thought to myself now I
               know why he travels under R.

                         RIPLEY
               I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So
               the rat's here now, in Rome.

                         MEREDITH
               Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if -

                         RIPLEY
               Don't be sorry. I've never been happier.
               I feel like I've been handed a new life.

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.

     Meredith and Ripley walk down the Spanish Steps and head
     inside the office.

                         MEREDITH
               The truth is if you've had money your
               entire life, even if you despise it,
               which we do - agreed? - you're only truly
               comfortable around other people who have
               it and despise it.

                         RIPLEY
               I know.

                         MEREDITH
               I've never admitted that to anyone.

     INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley's signing Dickie's allowance receipt. Meredith is with
     him, signing her own counterfoil. He is, of course, endorsed
     by her presence.  She goes to the window ahead of him.

     She takes her money, turns to him.

     He hands over his documents. The Clerk compares Ripley's
     signature with the one on the passport and then looks up at
     him. Ripley is cool as a cucumber.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't want too many large bills. Nobody
               will change them.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. ANOTHER DAY.

     Where A TAILOR is finishing the fitting of a cashmere jacket
     for Ripley. Bolts of cloth everywhere as Meredith adjudicates
     the possible materials, which the tailor holds up against
     Ripley.

                         MEREDITH
               Show me the other one again.
                   (the Tailor obliges)
               I like them both.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll take them both.

     Ripley goes inside the bedroom to change. While he's inside,
     Meredith shows the Tailor out.  As she returns she notices
     the open sax case, peers inside.

                         MEREDITH (O/S)
               I know you're a jazz fiend but do you
               absolutely hate the Opera?  I've been
               trying to give my tickets away, it's
               tomorrow, but if you were prepared to be
               dragged...

     She looks up to catch him bare-chested. She's intoxicated by
     him, the romance she feels to be in the air.

                         RIPLEY
                   (emerging)
               You could drag me.

     INT. THE OPERA HOUSE, ROME.

     On stage is Act Two of Eugene Onegin.  Lensky sings his aria
     before the duel with Onegin.

     Ripley's in a tuxedo, in a box which includes a glamorous
     Meredith and her AUNT AND UNCLE.  He knows what comes next.
     Lensky is shot by Onegin. Blood pours from his neck into the
     snow.  Onegin, horrified at the death of his friend, goes
     over, wraps Lensky in his cloak, the silk lining flashing,
     kneels holding him... Ripley can barely hide his emotion...
     Meredith watches her sensitive friend, entranced.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE BOXES, OPERA HOUSE, ROME.

     The Interval.  Ripley and Meredith exit their box with
     Meredith's Aunt and Uncle (who heads for the interval
     drinks).

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.

                         JOAN
               Can you bear it?  We hear you're a friend
               of Freddie's - he has I hate Opera
               tattooed on his chest.

                         RIPLEY
               There's room for a whole libretto on
               Freddie's chest.

                         JOAN
                   (laughs)
               I'm sure we've met.

     They reach the console where Uncle Ted has their drinks.

                         JOAN (cont'd)
               I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted?
               This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks, yes, I think we did.

                         JOAN
               One minute you people are children and
               the next you're getting tattooed.

     INT. OPERA HOUSE, FOYER. NIGHT.

     Ripley heads past the Beautiful People on his hunt for the
     Men's Room, and walks straight into a young and cultured
     Englishman.  They greet each other and suddenly MARGE is
     beside them.

                         MARGE
                   (as if she's seen a ghost)
               Oh my God. Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, how are you? What are you doing in
               Rome?

                         MARGE
               Is he here? Are you with Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               No.
                   (to Smith-Kingsley)
               Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.

                         PETER
               Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about
               you, of course - from Marge, and Dickie.

                         MARGE
                   (works out what's strange)
               No glasses.

     He fishes out the glasses.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Peter)
               Ditto.

                         PETER
               Where are you hiding him? He's
               impossible, isn't he?

                         MARGE
               Is he really not here?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera
               tattooed on his chest.

                         MARGE
               You were going to Venice.

                         PETER
               Yes, what happened? I heard you were
               desperate to come. I was looking forward
               to rowing you around.

                         RIPLEY
               I am.  I really am. And I've been
               travelling. I just can't seem to get that
               far north.

                         PETER
               Well hurry, before we sink.
                   (reaches into his jacket)
               Should I give you my telephone number in
               Venice?

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

     The INTERVAL BELL'S ringing. Peter hands over his card to
     Ripley, sees Meredith.

                         PETER
               Look there's Meredith thingy - who's
               that, Marge? - they're in textiles...
               Meredith -
                   (embarrassed at not
                    remembering)
               God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in
               her house...!

                         MARGE
               I don't know her.
                   (to Ripley)
               He hasn't called, he's hardly written,
               just these cryptic notes. You don't just
               dump people.

     The last INTERVAL BELL. There's a mini-stampede to return.

                         PETER
               Will we see you later?

                         RIPLEY
               I can't later.

                         PETER
               And tomorrow?

                         RIPLEY
               Tomorrow's possible. Do you know
               Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?

                         PETER
               I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?

                         RIPLEY
               Ten thirty?

                         PETER
               We'll be there.

                         RIPLEY
               Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.
                   (to Peter)
               It's really good to meet you.

     INT. BOX, OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT.

     Ripley goes straight to Meredith and grabs her.

                         RIPLEY
               Let's go.

                         MEREDITH
               I thought you were enjoying yourself?

                         RIPLEY
               Let's take a Carozza and look at the
               moon.

                         MEREDITH
               You're crazy! It's freezing out there.

     He's looking past her, where a mirror reflects Marge wading
     through the audience, Peter's elegant head getting
     dangerously near as they approach their seats.

                         RIPLEY
               C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the
               two of us.

                         MEREDITH
                   (quite taken)
               Okay then, you're crazy.

     EXT. CAROZZA, ROME. NIGHT.

     Meredith shivers in the raw night as they cross the Tiber.
     Ripley as Dickie is confessing his heart belongs to Marge.

                         MEREDITH
               Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.

                         RIPLEY
               You're such a pal to understand. It's as
               if Marge is here now - I look at you and
               I see her face - and I can't, whatever
               I'm feeling towards you - I just can't...

                         MEREDITH
               No, I absolutely understand. Of course.

                         RIPLEY
               Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.

                         MEREDITH
               Beating you away.

     EXT. MEREDITH'S APARTMENT, ROME.

     They arrive at the courtyard outside Meredith's Apartment
     Building. Ripley jumps down, collects her. She makes to go
     inside, then looks at him.

                         MEREDITH
               Will you meet me tomorrow?  Just to say
               goodbye in the daylight, properly? So
               it's not just this, it's too...you should
               always save pain for daylight...

                         RIPLEY
               Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll
               meet you. Let's have coffee in the
               morning at Dinelli's.

                         MEREDITH
                   (fluttering)
               I don't - is that by the Spanish Steps?

                         RIPLEY
               Exactly. 10.30 -
                   (instantly correcting himself)
               10.15.

     He gets back into the carozza. It moves off.

     EXT. DINELLI'S CAFE, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. MORNING.

     Meredith sits waiting in a cafe at the bottom of the Spanish
     Steps. Ripley, dressed as Ripley, is at the top of the steps,
     among early tourists, watching as she drinks her coffee at an
     outside table. Then Marge and Peter appear walking up the Via
     Condotti, head for another table, don't see Meredith.  She
     acknowledges Peter who hasn't noticed her.

                         MEREDITH
               Peter? Hello, it's Meredith Logue.

                         PETER
               Of course it is, Meredith, hello, I'm
               sorry, half-asleep, how are you? This is
               Marge Sherwood. Meredith Logue.

                         MARGE
               Hello.

     Hearing Marge's name Meredith reacts, freezes.

                         PETER
               Join us, won't you? We're just waiting
               for a friend. Do you know, I wonder did
               we see you at the Opera last night?

                         MEREDITH
               I won't actually, although I think this
               might - are you waiting for Dickie?

                         PETER
               Well no, as it happens, although...

                         MARGE
                   (stunned at the mention of his
                    name)
               Dickie? Do you know Dickie?

                         MEREDITH
               You were at the Opera? Well, that
               explains - yes I was there. I was there
               with Dickie.

                         MARGE
                   (to Peter)
               I told you! I knew it!

                         MEREDITH
                   (moving over to them)
               Marge, I don't know you, so I have no
               right, but Dickie loves you.  He's - I
               think you'll find he's coming home to
               you.

                         MARGE
                   (proprietorial)
               How would you know that?

                         MEREDITH
               He told me everything. I was supposed to
               meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I...I'm
               going to go now, I think. Unless he meant
               us to meet - which would be a little
               cruel, wouldn't it?

                         PETER
               No, we're meeting another friend. Tom
               Ripley.

                         MARGE
               Do you know Tom?

                         MEREDITH
               Ripley? No. I heard about him, of course,
               but no, I didn't meet him.

     The WAITER has arrived to take orders. Meredith indicates
     she's leaving.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               Not for me. No, grazie.

     Marge is on the edge. Peter lays a hand to comfort her.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               I hope I didn't complicate matters, but
               nothing, nothing untoward happened,
               nothing to prevent you from welcoming him
               back, from marrying him...Goodbye.
               Goodbye Peter, please don't get up.

     Peter gets up. Ripley, from his vantage point at the top of
     the steps, watches Meredith leave and walk off into the
     crowd. He begins the slow walk down towards the square. As he
     becomes visible to the cafe, he starts to hurry. He's
     apologising to Marge and Peter as they see him, in his
     element, lying and believing in his lie.

                         RIPLEY
               Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers.
               Italian bureaucracy - never one stamp
               when they can make you line up for three.
               Have you been waiting long?

                         PETER
               Not at all. Morning Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Hi.
                   (to Marge)
               Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've
               seen a ghost...

                         MARGE
               Dickie was at the Opera last night.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't
               drag Dickie to -

                         MARGE
               He was there with someone. So I suppose
               she must have dragged him - that's not
               fair.  I'm going back to Mongi. I think
               Dickie's coming home.
                   (to Peter)
               I'm going to go home.

                         RIPLEY
               Really? That's swell. No, I was just -
               you're way ahead of me! Great!

                         PETER
               We think he's had a change of heart.
                   (to Marge)
               So we should be celebrating.

                         MARGE
               I hope so.

                         PETER
                   (to Marge)
               That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith
               said -
                   (to Ripley)
               Meredith's the American girl I saw last
               night, I know her, at the Opera, she's
               been seeing something of Dickie -

                         RIPLEY
               My God.

                         PETER
               But the point is Dickie - well we know
               this - Dickie loves Marge and he misses
               her and apparently he's come to his
               senses...

                         RIPLEY
               It's fantastic.
                   (to Peter)
               I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand
               this, but anytime Dickie does something I
               feel guilty.

     INT. APARTMENT, PALAZZA GIOIA. DAY.

     Ripley is being shown an APARTMENT FOR RENT in the Palazzo
     Gioia by a dry-witted older woman, SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley
     explores, relishing the decor.

                         SIGNORA BUFFI
               Accendo il riscaldamento.
               (I'll turn the heating on.)

                         RIPLEY
                   (mimes playing sax)
               Mi piace suonare.
               (I like to play music.)

                         SIGNORA BUFFI
                   (shrugs)
               Io sono sorda. Quelli di sotto, una
               coppia, sono sordi. Allora, ti piace?
               (I'm deaf. The couple below are deaf. So,
               do you like it?)

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley is in the apartment, fire burning, wearing pyjamas.
     There's a small Christmas tree. He kneels on the floor with
     some festive, gift-wrapped packages. He opens a package. It's
     a marble head of Hadrian. A gasp from Ripley. He picks up a
     glass, pours himself a drink.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley plunges into Bach's Italian Concerto on his new and
     precious toy, a STEINWAY GRAND. His doorbell rings. He stops
     playing. He doesn't get visitors. He rises, a little nervous.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello?

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               Who is it?

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               It's Freddie. Let me in.

     RIPLEY ALMOST COLLAPSES. He's faint.

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Dickie, come on, it's me.

     Ripley can't think what to hide, where to hide. He opens the
     door.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.

                         FREDDIE
                   (confused, not pleasantly)
               Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at
               dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?

                         FREDDIE
               I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm.
               If you said he was still at lunch I'd
               believe you. Incredible. The guy has
               disappeared off the face of the earth.

                         RIPLEY
               I guess.

                         FREDDIE
               The landlady - as far as I could tell,
               the landlady said he was here right now.

                         RIPLEY
               He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I
               can't think why you would imagine Dickie
               would hide from you.

                         FREDDIE
               Because he's been hiding from me - what
               happened at Christmas?

                         RIPLEY
               What about Christmas?

                         FREDDIE
               He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't
               get a cable or a call or a note or,
               frankly, a fart.

     Ripley has his hands behind his back. HE'S TUGGING
     FRANTICALLY AT DICKIE'S RINGS. Ripley wanders into the
     kitchen, turns on the tap to sluice his fingers.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               Of course, he's been very involved in his
               music, hasn't he? I think his theory is,
               you know, you have to go into a cocoon
               before you can become a butterfly.

                         FREDDIE
               Which is horseshit.  Have you heard him
               play that thing?
                   (gesturing at the sax on its
                    stand)
               He can't.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
                   (casually)
               How did you find him? It's such an out of
               the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?

                         FREDDIE
               No thanks.
                   (explaining his detective work)
               Some kid at the American Express Office.
                   (he starts to explore)
               Are you living here?

     Now he starts to hammer a nasty boogie-woogie on the piano.

                         RIPLEY
                   (returning, flinching)
               No. No, I'm staying here for a few days,
               in Rome.  That's a new piano, so you prob -

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Did this place come furnished? It doesn't
               look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? - so
               bourgeois.

     Now he's poking at the Hadrian bust.

                         RIPLEY
               You should watch that!

                         FREDDIE
               In fact the only thing which looks like
               Dickie is you.

                         RIPLEY
               Hardly.

                         FREDDIE
               Have you done something to your hair?

     Ripley starts to smile, his eyes darting around the room.

                         RIPLEY
               Freddie, do you have something to say?

                         FREDDIE
               What? I think I'm saying it. Something's
               going on. He's either converted to
               Christianity - or to something else.

                         RIPLEY
               I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself.
               Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the
               Corso.

                         FREDDIE
               Is it on "delle Croce, just off the
               Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you?
               Last time you didn't know your ass from
               your elbow, now you're giving me
               directions. That's not fair, you probably
               do know your ass from your elbow. I'll
               see you.

     AND HE'S GONE. Ripley shuts the door, smooths the silk runner
     on the table where Freddie's hand had rucked it. He goes back
     to the door, opens it and looks over the rail.

     INT. LANDING AND STAIRS, RIPLEY'S BUILDING. LATE DAY.

     FREDDIE IS BACK IN CONVERSATION WITH SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley
     can't make out the text but there's some discussion about
     Signor Greenleaf and Signor Ripley. Ripley hurries inside as
     Freddie's heavy shoes start to clump up the stairs again.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. LATE DAY.

     Freddie knocks on the door which pushes open. As he marches
     in, he launches into his interrogation.

                         FREDDIE
               Ripley? There's someth -

     - AND WALKS STRAIGHT INTO THE HEAD OF HADRIAN WHICH RIPLEY
     SWINGS AT HIM, HOLDING ON AWKWARDLY WITH BOTH HANDS TO THE
     HEAVY MARBLE SCULPTURE.

     Freddie falls like an ox, first to his knees, groaning, then
     to the floor as Ripley brings the head down again, beating
     him downwards. As Freddie slumps away, Ripley loses his
     balance and the head sends Freddie a glancing blow before
     slipping from Ripley's grasp and smashing on to the floor.
     THE NOSE IS CHIPPED OFF.

     EXT. PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     It's deserted. Ripley hauls Freddie out of the shadows
     towards the car. A couple walk across the square. Ripley
     talks to Freddie, berating him for his drunken stupor. He
     pushes him over the door and into the passenger seat.

                         RIPLEY
                   (mimicking Freddie's voice)
               Hey, if I'm drunk, think what her
               husband's saying.

     EXT. VIA APPIA ANTICA. NIGHT.

     The Fiat noses along THE APPIAN WAY. Black fragments of tombs
     punctuate either side of the poorly lit road. Inside the car,
     Ripley looks to left and right for a place to dump the body.
     He slows near a clump of trees.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. EVENING.

     Someone is KNOCKING urgently at the door. Ripley opens it,
     finds himself face to face with Signora Buffi and TWO
     POLICEMEN. One of them offers his hand.

                         ROVERINI
               Dickie Greenleaf?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes?

                         ROVERINI
               Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. EVENING.

     Ripley sits with his head in his hands at the table. Roverini
     and his sergeant, BAGGIO, watch patiently.

                         ROVERINI
               It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did
               Signor Miles leave yesterday?

                         RIPLEY
               I can't be absolutely sure - 8? 9? We'd
               both taken on far too many drinks - but
               it was dark, it was certainly dark when I
               walked him down to his car.

                         ROVERINI
               So Signor Miles drove away and you did
               what?

                         RIPLEY
               I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but
               I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks.
               I've suffered all day. Who found him?

     Roverini has walked over to the bust of Hadrian.

                         ROVERINI
               Senta.  We have to ask you to stay in
               Rome.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.

                         ROVERINI
               So, the Doctor, he has to make the -
                   (looks at Baggio)
               - come se dice?

                         RIPLEY
               Postmortem?

                         ROVERINI
               Yes, exactly, but his first, his first
               conclusion was that Signor Miles was
               killed not later than seven o'clock
               yesterday evening.

                         RIPLEY
               Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he
               drove off in his car.

                         ROVERINI
               No.

     EXT. NARROW STREET, THE GHETTO, ROME. MORNING.

     Ripley comes through a dark tunnel in the Ghetto on his
     scooter. He drives past a furniture store, DRESSING TABLES
     AND MIRRORS spilling out onto the street. He glances
     sideways, sees his reflection fractured into several images
     and, for an instant, it seems AS IF DICKIE'S THERE
     WATCHING HIM. Ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the
     pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along
     the cobbled passage. The man he thought to be Dickie, an
     Italian, runs up concerned.

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. DAY.

     Ripley emerges from the American Express Office. Across the
     street at the cafe, as once before, sits Marge. Ripley slips
     Dickie's bag into his knapsack as he approaches his scooter.
     Marge spots him and strides across the piazza. She is in no
     mood for pleasantries.

                         MARGE
               Did he kill Freddie?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, when did you get here?

                         MARGE
               Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?

                         RIPLEY
               I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.

                         MARGE
               I tried again, waiting here, watching for
               him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look
               for Dickie I find you.

                   (focusing on Ripley's cuts and
                    bruises)
               What happened to your face?

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie did it.

                         MARGE
                   (suddenly tense)
               Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               My face! There was an argument. I said
               some things I shouldn't have.  About you.
               About the appalling way he's treating
               you, all of us.  And the next thing I
               know he's launched himself at me.
                   (he pulls the scooter off the
                    stand)
               Are you getting on?

                         MARGE
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               Get on. I'll take you to him.

     EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. DAY.

     Ripley and Marge come round the corner on the scooter. The
     entrance to the Palazzo is blocked by a couple of police cars.
     Inspector Roverini emerges from one of them. Ripley,
     startled, drives straight past the entrance.

     EXT. ROME STREET, BY THE RIVER. DAY.

     Ripley pulls up several hundred yards later, in a different
     piazza full of book stalls.  Marge is confused.

                         MARGE
               Where does Dickie live?

                         RIPLEY
               We passed it a few blocks back, where the
               police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They
               don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not
               going to incriminate Dickie -

                         MARGE
               Perhaps I shouldn't go either.

                         RIPLEY
                   (thinking hard, distracted)
               No, well go if you want to, but don't
               talk to the Police about my face - they
               find out he hit me - he's got a temper - he
               could've hit Freddie.
                   (sincerely)
               Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you
               later.

     And he drives off. At the first opportunity HE DOUBLES BACK
     and roars towards the Palazzo.

     EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley drives towards the entrance.  As Ripley gets off and
     pushes his scooter through the doorway SOME JOURNALISTS,
     LOITERING INSIDE A BARBER'S SHOP come running out and swarm
     around him with questions about Freddie. One of them gets off
     a photograph.  It's chaos, a Police Officer shouts him away
     as Ripley puts up a protective hand and runs inside.

     INT. ENTRANCE AND STAIRS, PALAZZO GIOIA. CONTINUOUS.

     As Ripley hurries inside he encounters officers conducting
     more thorough forensic investigations in the stairwell. On a
     landing is Roverini. Ripley hurries towards him.

                         RIPLEY
               Can we go up? Do you mind?

                         ROVERINI
               Of course. What happened to your face?

                         RIPLEY
               My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by
               photographers.

     He hurries up the stairs, Roverini in tow.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
                   (agitated)
               The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm
               feeling hounded - do you think you could
               not give out my address?

                         ROVERINI
               Never. We've had many requests and, of
               course, we say no - even to your fiancÈe.

                         RIPLEY
               I really don't want to see anybody.

                         ROVERINI
               Even your fiancÈe...?

                         RIPLEY
               Even her.

                         ROVERINI
               What about Thomas Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               What about Ripley?

     Ripley's way ahead and has reached the door of his apartment.
     He waits nervously for Roverini. He unlocks the door and can
     barely wait for Roverini to catch up.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.

     Roverini follows Ripley inside, Baggio hurries in behind him.

                         ROVERINI
               You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo,
               is that right?

     Ripley is appalled. He smiles.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That
               was months ago.

                         ROVERINI
               November, I thought.

                         RIPLEY
               Was it? Did you speak to Tom?

                         ROVERINI
               November 7th is my information.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't remember the exact date.

                         ROVERINI
               And when did you last see Signor Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               A few days ago.

                         ROVERINI
               Does he stay with you here?

                         RIPLEY
               No!

                         ROVERINI
               No.  Here is a pattern. Two days ago
               Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves your
               apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a
               little boat is found in San Remo full of
               rocks, and the owner tells the Police it
               was stolen on November 7th. We look at
               hotel records and we see oh! Dickie
               Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then
               our boatman remembers two Americans
               taking a boat.

                         RIPLEY
               It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence.
               There must be fifty hotels in San Remo,
               there must have been a hundred people
               renting a boat on that day.

                         ROVERINI
               31 people.

                         RIPLEY
               31 people.

     Baggio appears. Speaks to Roverini. Ripley is getting cranky.

                         ROVERINI
               That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge
               Sherwood.

                         RIPLEY
                   (appalled, defeated)
               Let her in, what's the difference?  Let
               her in.
                   (Baggio is on his way to the
                    door.)
               No, actually, no, I'd like it very much
               if you would ask her to come back later.

     Roverini nods, mutters to Baggio, who heads out.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Thank you.

                         ROVERINI
                   (watching him)
               May I ask...why would you speak to your
               friend and not your fiancÈe?

                         RIPLEY
               I think I just said. Ripley was handling
               some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley
               want to marry me.  Nor did he ask me
               every day if I would marry him. And when.

                         ROVERINI
               Do you have a photograph of Signor
               Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm not in the habit of carrying around
               photographs of my male friends.

                         ROVERINI
               Now I think I have upset you. My English
               perhaps is coarse.

                         RIPLEY
               It is a little coarse, yes.

                         ROVERINI
               Sorry.  No-one has seen Signor Ripley
               since San -

                         RIPLEY
               I have!

                         ROVERINI
               You have, yes.

                         RIPLEY
               No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask
               her! and if I could remember which hotel
               he was staying at - the Goldoni! - Tom
               was staying at the Goldoni.

                         ROVERINI
               Good. The Goldoni. Yes - you're right. A
               coincidence.
                   (he gets up to leave)
               I look forward to our next meeting when I
               will be more careful with my English and
               persuade you to play me your saxophone.
               Alto.

                         RIPLEY
               Absolutely.

                         ROVERINI
                   (suddenly turning)
               I have a witness who thinks they saw two
               men getting into Mr Miles' car. She
               wants to identify you in a - confronto -
               line-up.
                   (ominously)
               Tomorrow then?

                         RIPLEY
                   (thrown, scrabbling)
               Tomorrow.

     Ripley lets them out, heaves a heavy sigh, then peeps through
     the door, looks down to see Roverini speaking to Marge on the
     stairs.

                         ROVERINI (O/S)
               Buongiorno, Miss Sherwood.  He's in but I
               really don't think he wants to see
               anyone.

     Ripley leans against the door, the noose tightening, then
     suddenly a voice shocks him upright.

                         MARGE
               Dick? Dickie? I know you can hear me.
               What am I doing, chasing you around...?
               I was going to say I would count to three
               and if you didn't open the door, but I
               won't count any more. On you. I won't
               count on you any more. Whatever it is,
               whatever you've done or haven't done,
               you've broken my heart. That's one thing
               I know you're guilty of, and I don't know
               why, I don't know why, I just don't know
               why...

     Ripley listens, there's a silence, then Marge's footsteps as
     they ring out on the stone stairs. The tapping sound resolves
     into the tap-tap of a manual typewriter.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley's at the typewriter, he begins to type.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               My dear Tom, I'm getting out of this.
               Freddie's death, Silvana. I've thought
               about going to the police, but I can't do
               it, I can't face it.  I can't face
               anything anymore...

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     CHAOS.  Ripley is working quickly, selecting clothes,
     dividing them into TWO PILES - one for Dickie's trunk, one
     for his own battered suitcase. He puts the license plates
     from Freddie's car in Dickie's luggage. He has placed one
     shirt on the Ripley pile then checks again, and - on seeing
     Dickie's initials, places it with the bigger pile, then picks
     it up again and holds it briefly against his cheek.

     He takes Dickie's rings, opens up a LITTLE BOX of buttons and
     needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in. Dickie's
     leather writing case goes on the big pile, too, as do cuff
     links, ties, the Mont Blanc, Dickie's passport, which he
     opens to scratch at the photograph, obliterating the face.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               ...I wish I could give you the life I
               took for granted. You've always
               understood what's at the heart of me,
               Tom. Marge never could. I suppose that's
               why I'm writing this to you, the brother
               I never had. The only true friend I ever
               had. In all kinds of ways you're much
               more like the son my father always
               wanted. I realise you can change the
               people, change the scenery, but you can't
               change your own rotten self. Now I can't
               think what to do, or where to go. I'm
               haunted by everything I've done, and
               can't undo. I'm sorry, I can't go on.
               I've made a mess of being Dickie
               Greenleaf haven't I?

     He's finished the letter, signs it, puts it in an envelope
     marked Tom Ripley and places the letter on top of the piano
     next to Dickie's passport. His head is reflected in the
     distorting curve of the lid. As he puts on his glasses
     there's a moment when there are two heads slowly separating,
     as Ripley leaves behind his brief life as Dickie Greenleaf.

     INT. BASEMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley carries Dickie's luggage down into THE COMMUNAL
     BASEMENT of the Gioia, a wretched place full of shadows and
     gloom and the overflow from thirty apartments. A red plush
     couch sits on top of a mound of furniture.  He finds some
     dustsheets and shoves the cases under them. Then Dickie's
     saxophone.

     Outside the small window, Ripley sees uniformed feet and the
     revolving blue light of a Police Car. He shrinks back, turns
     off the light and disappears into the dark, illuminated
     fitfully by the strobe of cold blue.

     EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA, ROME. NIGHT.

     Ripley, familiar battered luggage in tow, appears at the
     entrance of the building next to his own, glances at the
     police car parked opposite the big doors, then hurries off
     into the darkness.

     EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley's briefly silhouetted as he scuttles down an alley,
     hurrying towards a gate, and disappears behind it.

     EXT. PIAZZALE ROMA, VENICE. DAWN.

     Ripley sits next to his battered luggage at the prow of a
     MOTOR TAXI as it surges towards Venice at dawn. Peter Smith-
     Kingsley waits on the quay. Ripley waves. Peter waves back.

                         PETER
                   (indicating the taxi stop)
               I'll see you over there!

     EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. EARLY MORNING.

     Ripley and Peter walk through the square, the pigeons
     scattering. Ripley breathes in the atmosphere, the beautiful
     grey.

                         RIPLEY
               Peter, I'm really sorry to put you
               through this. I just couldn't face going
               to the police by myself when my Italian's
               so rotten.

                         PETER
               Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted
               you finally made it to Venice. I'm
               delighted, contrary to rumour, you're
               still in one piece?

                         RIPLEY
               What rumour?

                         PETER
               That Dickie murdered you and is
               travelling under your passport. I know,
               ridiculous.

     INT. POLICE STATION, VENICE. LATE DAY.

     Later.  Ripley sits in the middle of a bustling Police Station,
     where thefts, tourists, thieves and complaints are being
     processed.  The Station is in an old brewery or armory. It's a
     horrible, monochrome, oppressive place. Peter is in
     conversation at a desk, turns and walks over to where Ripley
     waits.

                         PETER
               Welcome to Venice.  This place reeks,
               doesn't it? Can you smell it?  Ugh.
               Sorry. Not the best way to spend your
               first day.

                         RIPLEY
               It's okay.

                         PETER
               Anyway I've got to the bottom of the
               delay. Finally.  We're waiting for
               someone from Rome.

                         RIPLEY
                   (completely thrown)
               What do you mean?  They're sending
               someone from Rome?

                         PETER
               That's good, isn't it?

                         RIPLEY
                   (as if suffocating)
               No, but I thought that didn't happen in
               Italy, that each region was completely
               separate! I was sure that was the -

                         PETER
               You've seen the papers, you know what a
               big deal it's been here. American tourist
               murdered -

                         RIPLEY
               It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned
               the stench I can hardly breathe.

     A door opens. COLONEL VERRECCHIA, fresh from Rome, and a
     sullen wedge of a man, comes in, scowling at the couple.
     Ripley dare not look up in case it's Roverini.  A POLICEMAN
     introduces him.

                         POLICEMAN
               Colonelo Verrecchia della Polizia di
               Roma.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (to Peter, in Italian)
               Qui e Ripley?  Who is Ripley?

                         PETER
                   (in Italian)
               Lui. Him.

     Verrecchia strides past them and into a smaller, interview
     room at the back of the station.  His manner is ominous.

     INT. POLICE STATION, INTERVIEW ROOM, VENICE. LATE DAY.

     This room is not at all friendly. There is evidence of a
     locked area for cells at one wall.  A small, sour window
     gives onto a canal.  The main station is glimpsed through
     some internal windows. Peter and Ripley come through.

     Verrecchia sits down.  Verrecchia talks in staccato Italian,
     during which Peter translates.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in
               seguito alla negativa valutazione delle
               disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con
               il mio predecessore Roverini che come e
               noto non e riuscito a impedire il
               verificarsi della scomparsa del signor
               Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona
               al momento passibile di incriminazione
               del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               He's taken over the case because...
               they're annoyed the previous chap let
               Dickie...disappear when he was the only,
               he was the only suspect in Freddie's
               murder.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il
               signor Ripley ha visto il signor
               Greenleaf?
               (When was the last time Ripley saw
               Greenleaf?)

     Ripley forgets he's not supposed to have much Italian and
     answers.

                         RIPLEY
               In Rome, about three weeks ago.
                   (shrugs)
               I knew that one.

                         PETER
                   (giving Ripley a look)
               A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               Where have you been since then?

                         RIPLEY
               I've been backpacking.

                         PETER
               I don't know how to translate that.
                   (he tries)
               E difficile....il signor Ripley
               ....dormiva all'aperto, con un...

                         VERRECCHIA
               All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?

                         PETER
               He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping
               outside.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze
               omosessuali?

                         PETER
               Are you a homosexual?
                   (then as himself)
               Interesting non-sequitur.

                         RIPLEY
               No.

                         PETER
                   (translates for him)
               No.
                   (as Peter, drily)
               By the way, officially there are no
               Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo,
               Michelangelo very inconvenient.

                         RIPLEY
               Tell him I have a fiancÈe, Dickie has a
               fiancÈe and Freddie Miles probably had a
               string of them.

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il
               signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e
               probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha
               molte fidanzate.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (laughs)
               Mamma mia, quante fidanzate!

     They all laugh.

                         RIPLEY
               What did he say?

                         PETER
               He says so many fiancÈes.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (suddenly very tough)
               Lei ha ucciso prima Freddie Miles e dopo
               Dickie Greenleaf! Vero?

     As Peter translates Verrecchia watches intently.

                         PETER
               He wants to know if you killed Freddie
               Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?

                         RIPLEY
                   (outraged)
               No I did not. I did not kill Freddie
               Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf.  Is
               he accusing me?
                   (Peter clearly doesn't ask)
               Ask him if he's accusing me!

                         PETER
               He's already angry, I don't think -

                         RIPLEY
                   (interrupting, heated)
               Just because he doesn't like Americans!

                         VERRECCHIA
               Non e questo il luogo per le vostre
               conversazioni private!  (This is not the
               place for your private conversations)

                         PETER
                   (appeasing him)
               A ragione.  A ragione.  (You're right.
               You're right.)

                         VERRECCHIA
               Hmm. C'e questa...  (There's this...)

     Verrecchia hands over a letter. It's opened. Ripley's name on
     the outside. Ripley stares at it.

                         VERRECCHIA
                         (cont'd)
               Questa lettera e stata trovata
               nell'abitazione del signor Richard
               Greenleaf a Roma.

                         PETER
               They found this in Dickie's place in
               Rome.

                         RIPLEY
               You opened this?

                         VERRECCHIA
               Of course!

     He stands and takes the letter out.  Begins to read. He has
     the look of a man whose privacy has been violated.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Peter)
               It's a suicide note.
                   (to Verrecchia)
               You ask me all these questions and you've

     INT. PETER SMITH-KINGSLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     There's music everywhere - and stands - and posters of
     performances and PHOTOGRAPHS OF PETER CONDUCTING. Peter is an
     opera repetiteur. Ripley is sitting at Peter's piano, playing
     from the score of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater. Peter's made supper.
     He's setting the table.

                         PETER
               Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill
               Freddie, what must that be like? To wake
               up every morning, how can you? Just wake
               up and be a person, drink a coffee...?

                         RIPLEY
               Whatever you do, however terrible,
               however hurtful - it all makes sense,
               doesn't it? inside your head. You never
               meet anybody who thinks they're a bad
               person or that they're cruel.

                         PETER
               But you're still tormented, you must be,
               you've killed somebody...

                         RIPLEY
               Don't you put the past in a room, in the
               cellar, and lock the door and just never
               go in there? Because that's what I do.

                         PETER
               Probably. In my case it's probably a
               whole building.

                         RIPLEY
               Then you meet someone special and all you
               want to do is toss them the key, say open
               up, step inside, but you can't because
               it's dark and there are demons and if
               anybody saw how ugly it was...

     Peter's come over, stands behind him over the piano.

                         PETER
               That's the music talking. Harder to be
               bleak if you're playing Knees up Mother
               Brown.

     He vamps this vaudeville song over Ripley's shoulder.

                         RIPLEY
               I keep wanting to do that - fling open
               the door - let the light in, clean
               everything out. If I could get a huge
               eraser and rub everything out...starting
               with myself...the thing is, Peter, if...

                         PETER
                   (as Ripley falls silent)
               No key, huh?

     INT. SANTA MARIA DELLA PIETA, BRIDGE OF SIGHS. DAY.

     A YOUNG BOY SINGS the soprano part of Vivaldi's STABAT MATER.
     A piercingly pure sound in Vivaldi's own church.  The
     orchestra - rehearsing - is conducted by Peter from the
     organ.

     Ripley slips in at the back of the church. He stands and
     listens. Peter sees him, smiles.  Ripley smiles back.

     EXT. VENICE, S.LUCIA RAILWAY STATION. DAY.

     MARGE appears on the steps, carrying an overnight bag. Ripley
     and Peter have come to meet her.

                         MARGE
                   (kissing him warmly)
               Hello Peter, so good to see you.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Marge!

                         MARGE
                   (coolly)
               Tom.

     They walk towards the Vaporetto.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               So you found Peter...

                         PETER
               I think we sort of found each other.

     Marge smiles enigmatically. Ripley registers.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               Where's Dickie's father?

                         MARGE
               He's not coming till the morning.
               Evidently his stomach - I don't think the
               food here is agreeing with him.

                         RIPLEY
               I was looking forward to seeing him.

                         MARGE
               Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of
               that. There's a private detective on the
               case now - a Mr MacCarron - Dickie's
               father's employing him.

                         RIPLEY
               That's a terrific idea.

                         MARGE
               He's American. He's already discovered
               Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day
               before he disappeared.

     They step onto the Vaporetto.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               Is that what you do before you jump in
               the Tiber?  I don't think so.

     EXT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY.

     The boat arrives at the entrance to the house. Peter opens
     the door as Ripley collects Marge's bags.

                         MARGE
                   (to Peter)
               Is this you?

                         PETER
               No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?

                         MARGE
               Golly. Who's paying for this?

                         RIPLEY
               Peter found it for me. I can afford it
               because it's damp and, and falling down.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY.

     Marge, entering the living room, is astonished at its
     grandeur. She walks around as Ripley heads for the bar.

                         MARGE
               This is spectacular.

                         PETER
               That's why Tom wanted you to stay.  It's
               better than squeezing into my room, and I
               know how you hate hotels.

                         MARGE
               A hotel would've been fine.
                   (to Ripley)
               We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far
               his dollar has stretched.

     Ripley is shaking a martini. Marge laughs, helpless, somehow
     raging. Peter turns

                         PETER
               What's funny?

                         MARGE
               No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when
               Tom arrived in Mongi.
                   (to Ripley)
               And now look at you.

                         RIPLEY
               Look at me what?

                         MARGE
               To the manner born.

     EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. DAY.

     St Mark's Square is buzzing with life - tourists, balloon
     sellers - a man playing saxophone. HERBERT GREENLEAF sits out
     in the colonade on one of the many tables at Florian's Cafe,
     cradling a glass of hot water. He gets up as Marge and Ripley
     arrive.

                         RIPLEY
               Mr Greenleaf.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Tom. How are you?  You look well.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm well, thank you.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Far cry from New York.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes it is.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Marge, good morning.  Unusual weather.

                         MARGE
               Very.

                         RIPLEY
               And you, sir?  Any better?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Pretty good.  Sticking with hot water.

                         MARGE
               Where's Mr MacCarron?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well,
               my boy, it's come to a pretty pass,
               hasn't it?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes.  What's the detective hoping to
               find in San Remo?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               He's being thorough, that's all. I'm
               learning about my son, Tom, now he's
               missing. I'm learning a great deal about
               him. I hope you can fill in some more
               blanks for me. Marge has been good enough
               to do that, about Mongibello.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do
               anything to help Dickie.

     Marge looks at him in contempt.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               This theory, the letter he left for you,
               the Police think that's a clear
               indication he was planning on doing
               something...to himself.

                         MARGE
               I just don't believe that!

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk
               to Tom alone - perhaps this afternoon?
               Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say
               to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to
               another fellow -

                         MARGE
               Such as?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               What a waste of lives and opportunities
               and -

     A saxophonist is blaring away in the piazza. Greenleaf
     suddenly explodes.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (cont'd)
               - I'd pay that fellow a hundred dollars
               right now to shut up!

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.

     Herbert Greenleaf sits on a chair, Ripley pours him some tea.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (reading, plunging into gloom)
               No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.

                         RIPLEY
               I think it might hurt her to know.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               And his passport photo? Did you hear? To
               scratch out your own face like that - can
               you imagine - the frame of mind you'd
               have to be in?
                   (reading)
               I've thought about going to the police
               but I can't face it. I can't face
               anything anymore.

                         RIPLEY
               I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him
               away. I spoke and he heard you.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (such a disappointed father)
               Well, if we all pushed him away what
               about him pushing us away? You've been a
               great friend to my son. Everything is
               someone else's fault. We all want to sow
               wild oars. Somebody's got to - what's the
               word?
                   (Ripley shakes his head)
               The moment someone confronts him he
               lashes out.  He lashes out. You know,
               people always say you can't choose your
               parents, but you can't choose your
               children.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DUSK.

     Ripley wakes up from an awful, chilling nightmare, his head
     full of ghosts. He's cramped up in an armchair, his arms in
     sine foetal protection. HIS DOOR KNOCKER IS BEING REPEATEDLY
     SHAKEN. He surfaces thickly, stumbles to the door. It's Peter
     and Marge.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have
               fallen asleep.

                         PETER
               You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?

                         MARGE
               Did Dickie's Dad go?

                         RIPLEY
               He's having an early night.

                         MARGE
               Poor man.
                   (she heads to her room)
               We were knocking on that door for ever.
                   (she fiddles inside the sleeve
                    of her dress)
               I think I've broken my strap.

                         PETER
               Not guilty.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll fix some drinks.

                         MARGE
               You walk in Venice!

     She takes off her shoe, examining her feet for wear and tear,
     then disappears into the bedroom. Peter walks over to Ripley,
     a little concerned.

                         PETER
               Are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm fine.

                         PETER
                   (a hand on his shoulder)
               Do you want me to stick around?

                         RIPLEY
               It's okay.

                         PETER
               Or I could come back.

     Ripley looks at him. That's never happened. He digs in his
     pocket, finds his key, gives it to Peter. Peter smiles.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               Your key.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BATHROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.

     Ripley's in the bath. Marge knocks on his door.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               Tom?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

     Ripley, irritated, opens the door, his towel wrapped around
     his waist. Marge is white. She's wearing a robe. She's
     slightly breathless.

                         MARGE
               I found Dickie's rings.

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MARGE
               You've got Dickie's rings.

                         RIPLEY
               I can explain.

     He can't. His eyes dart. Marge holds up the evidence.

                         MARGE
               Dickie promised me he would never take
               off this ring.

                         RIPLEY
               Let me put on some clothes and then we
               can talk about this.

                         MARGE
               I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to
               tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr
               Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, calm down, you're being
               hysterical.

                         MARGE
               He promised me. I swear I'll never take
               off this ring until the day -

                         RIPLEY
               Shut up! Shut up!

     His towel slips off from his waist.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               I'm wet, Marge, I've lost my towel, I'd
               really like to put my clothes on. So go
               and pour us both a drink, will you?

     She goes off obediently, a zombie. He shuts the door.
     Immediately he starts looking for something, anything, to
     kill Marge with. He's got a shoe but it feels too light. He
     opens cabinets, drawers - nail scissors, nothing - then
     picks up his straight razor and considers it in the mirror.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SITTING ROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.

     Marge is leaving, coat on, as Ripley comes out of the
     bathroom.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge?  Where are you going?

                         MARGE
                   (like a creature caught in
                    headlights)
               I was looking for a needle and thread. I
               wasn't snooping. I was looking for a
               needle and thread to mend my bra.

                         RIPLEY
               The scent you're wearing. I bought it for
               you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie.
               So many things. The day he was late back
               from Rome - I tried to tell you this - he
               was with another girl. I'm not talking
               about Meredith, another girl we met in a
               bar. He couldn't be faithful for five
               minutes. So when he makes a promise it
               doesn't mean what it means when you make
               a promise. Or I do. He has so many
               realities, Dickie, and he believes them
               all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half
               the time he doesn't even realize.

     A SMALL RED STAIN is appearing on the pocket of his robe. As
     he speaks the stain spreads. He looks at it absently.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Today, for the first time, I've even
               wondered whether he might have killed
               Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody
               contradicted him - well, you know that.
               Marge. I loved you - you might as well
               know - I loved you, and because he knew I
               loved you, he let you think I loved him.
               Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't
               know, maybe it's grotesque to say this
               now, so just write it on a piece of paper
               or something, and keep it in your purse
               for a rainy day. Tom loves me.

                         MARGE
                   (as if she'd heard nothing)
               Why do you have Dickie's rings?

     His hand goes to his pocket. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT.

                         RIPLEY
               I told you. He gave them to me.

                         MARGE
               Why? When?

                         RIPLEY
               I feel as if you haven't heard anything
               I've been saying to you.

                         MARGE
               I don't believe you.

                         RIPLEY
               It's all true.

                         MARGE
               I don't believe a single word you've
               said.

     Marge is shivering. Ripley, ominous, advances, she retreats.

                         RIPLEY
               You're shivering, Marge. Can I hold you?
               Would you let me hold you?

     Marge panics, backed up against the door. She screams and
     turns straight into the arms of a startled PETER who's come
     back to visit Ripley, and is unlocking the door.

                         MARGE
                   (sobbing uncontrollably)
               Oh Peter! Get me out of here.

     Ripley storms off. His hand comes out of his pocket COVERED
     IN BLOOD from the razor. Peter notices, appalled.

                         PETER
               Tom, are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               You try. You try talking to her.

                         PETER
                   (calls after him)
               Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?

                         RIPLEY
                   (not turning around)
               I give up.

     INT. RIPLEY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

     Peter has just put a band-aid over Ripley's cut hand.

                         PETER
               You can't be angry with her.  She's upset
               and needs someone to blame. So she blames
               you.  I'll go home and talk to her.  As
               for you - either get a safety razor or
               grow a beard.

     INT. LOBBY, EUROPA REGINA HOTEL, VENICE. MORNING.

     Ripley hurries through the gleaming marble entrance.

     INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S SUITE, EUROPA REGINA. DAY.

     Ripley knocks on the door. It's opened by a face he doesn't
     recognize. A middle-aged heavy set man. It's MacCARRON, the
     private investigator.

                         RIPLEY
               Is Mr Greenleaf here?

                         MACCARRON
               Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               I don't know, I don't know, I just know
               it.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (O/S)
               Marge, there's female intuition, and
               then there are facts -

     Greenleaf sits with a scrubbed Marge, her hair pulled back,
     as if newly-widowed. THE RINGS SIT GLINTING ON THE COFFEE
     TABLE.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello, sir.
                   (smiles thinly at Marge)
               Marge, you should have waited, didn't
               Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you
               up?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Marge has been telling us about the
               rings.

                         RIPLEY
               You know I feel ridiculous I didn't
               mention them yesterday - I clean forgot -
               ridiculous.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Perhaps you didn't mention them because
               there's only one conclusion to be drawn.

     Ripley worries about what that conclusion is as Mr Greenleaf
     heads into his bedroom.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (cont'd)
               I'm going to take Marge for a little
               walk, Tom.  Mr MacCarron wants to talk
               with you.

                         RIPLEY
                   (feeling caged in)
               We could go down to the bar - no need for
               you to -

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               No, he should talk to you alone.

     He helps Marge to her feet and leads her out. RIPLEY IS
     PARALYSED. He waits for the door to shut. Aimlessly he walks
     out onto the terrace, with its staggering, beautiful and
     indifferent view.

     EXT. EUROPA REGINA, THE GREENLEAF TERRACE. DAY.

     Ripley stands, steels himself for MacCarron's charges.

                         RIPLEY
               I could probably see my bedroom from
               here. I can see my house. When you see
               where you live from a distance it's like
               a dream, isn't it?

                         MACCARRON
                   (coming out)
               I don't care for B.S. I don't care to
               hear it. I don't care to speak it.

                         RIPLEY
               Okay.

                         MACCARRON
               Why do you think Dickie's father sent him
               to Europe in the first place? Did you
               know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-
               killed a boy?

     Ripley turns, shocked.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               At a party. Over some girl. He kicked the
               kid several times in the head. Put him in
               the hospital. The boy had a wire fixed in
               his jaw. The Rome Police didn't think to
               ask Mr Greenleaf.

     MacCarron gets up.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Nor did they think to check whether a
               Thomas Ripley had ever been a student at
               Princeton University. I turned up a Tom
               Ripley who'd been a piano tuner in the
               music department.

     Ripley's head drops.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               See - in America we're taught to check a
               fact before it becomes a fact. We're
               taught to nose around when a girl drowns
               herself, find out if that girl was
               pregnant, find out if Dickie had an
               embarrassment there.

     Ripley doesn't know where this barrage is going.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty.
               He really does. Marge, she's got a
               hundred theories, but there are a few
               things she doesn't know. We hope she
               never knows.

                         RIPLEY
               I hope she never knows.

                         MACCARRON
               Three different people saw Dickie get
               into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't
               identify himself because he was jumping
               someone else's wife at the time saw
               Dickie removing license plates from a red
               sports car. The Police know about this
               man because he happens to be a Policeman.

     He walks out of the room, returns carrying THE LICENSE PLATES
     from Freddie's car.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               I found these in the basement of Dickie's
               apartment. They belonged to Freddie's
               car. Mr Greenleaf has asked me to lose
               them in the canal this evening.

     Ripley can't believe what he's hearing. It's like a dream.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Mr Greenleaf also feels there was a
               silent promise in Dickie's letter to you
               which he intends to honor. He intends to
               transfer a good part of Dickie's income
               from his trust into your name. He doesn't
               intend to give the Italian police any
               information about Dickie's past. He's
               rather hoping you'll feel the same.

     There is a silence in which this strange compact is agreed.

     EXT. EUROPA REGINA MOORING. DAY.

     Ripley stands with Marge, Mr Greenleaf and MacCarron at the
     water's edge - MOTOR LAUNCH growling. They shake hands, and
     then MacCarron and Mr Greenleaf get into the launch. Herbert
     Greenleaf carries the saxophone case.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Marge)
               I feel I never should have said those
               things to you the other evening. I was
               pretty flustered, the rings and - and you
               looked so, I don't know.

     Marge shakes her head to silence him.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               But I hope that note goes to New York in
               your purse, for a rainy day.

                         MARGE
               What are you going to do now, Tom?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. Peter has a concert in
               Athens next month - and he's asked if I
               want to go along, help out. He says
               goodbye by the way - he's in rehearsal,
               otherwise -

                         MARGE
               Why do I think there's never been a
               Ripley rainy day?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MARGE
                   (lunging at him)
               I know it was you - I know it was you,
               Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed
               Dickie. I know it was you.

                         RIPLEY
               Oh Marge.

     He puts his hand out to control her. She pushes it away.
     STARTS TO LASH OUT AT HIM, the frustration too much, so that
     Ripley has to cover his face. MacCarron comes off the boat to
     restrain her.  Ripley looks at him as if to say: what can you
     do, she's hysterical. MacCarron nods, pulls her on to the
     boat. Greenleaf catches Ripley's eye, guiltily. Turns away.
     They stand silhouetted as the launch revs up and surges off
     towards open waters, passing the little fleets of gondolas.

     EXT. FERRY FOR ATHENS, NAPLES. DAY.

     A week later and Peter and Ripley are on the deck of the
     ferry, the HELLENES, as it sails towards Greece.  They're
     laughing.

                         RIPLEY
               Ask me what I want to change about this
               moment.

                         PETER
               What do you want to change about this
               moment?

                         RIPLEY
               Nothing.

     INT. PETER'S CABIN. DUSK.

     Peter's in a bathrobe organising his currency, his
     traveller's cheques. Ripley knocks on the door, comes in.

                         PETER
               Hello.  What are you up to?

                         RIPLEY
               All kinds of things. Making plans.

                         PETER
               Plans - good, plans for tonight or plans
               for the future?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. Both. My plan right now is
               to go up on deck, look at the sunset.
               Come with me.

                         PETER
               You go. I don't want to get dressed yet.
               Come back though.  Come back.
                   (smiles at him)
               You know, you look so relaxed, like a
               completely different person.

                         RIPLEY
               Well, that's entirely your fault.  And,
               if I fall overboard, that'll be your
               fault too.

     EXT. DECK OF THE HELLENES. SUNSET.

     Ripley stands on deck, staring at the magnificent sunset.
     Then a voice shakes him from his reverie.

                         MEREDITH
               Dickie?  Dickie?

     He turns. He's caught. Suddenly he's Dickie.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               Dickie, my God!

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Meredith.

                         MEREDITH
               I was looking at you, your clothes, I
               wouldn't have known you...

                         RIPLEY
               Well, you've spotted me and so you get
               the reward.

                         MEREDITH
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               Just kidding. Are you alone?

                         MEREDITH
               Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.

     Meredith points to the UPPER DECK BALCONY where TWO OLDER
     COUPLES are walking around the deck.

                         RIPLEY
               Of course.  Aunt Joan.

                         MEREDITH
               And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've
               thought about you so much.

                         RIPLEY
               I've thought about you.

     And now he's thinking I can't kill them all...

                         MEREDITH
               When I thought about you I was mostly
               hating you. Where've you been hiding?

                         RIPLEY
               I haven't been hiding. I've been in
               Police custody. They've been trying to
               flush out Freddie's killer.

                         MEREDITH
               You're kidding.

                         RIPLEY
               They're letting me have this vacation.
               Which is why the get-up. Which is why you
               haven't heard from me.

                         MEREDITH
               You know, the whole world thinks you
               killed Freddie? It's terrible.

                         RIPLEY
               I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later.
               Later?

     He kisses her.  Full of future.

                         MEREDITH
               So - are you travelling under R?

                         RIPLEY
               You know what - I am.

                         MEREDITH
               Dickie, are you with Peter Smith-
               Kingsley?  I bet you are. My aunt thought
               she saw him.

                         RIPLEY
                   (horrified)
               Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him
               in months.  No, I'm alone.
                   (and he understands this is not
                    any kind of lie)

     INT. PETER'S CABIN. NIGHT.

     Peter's working on his score, lying on his front, apparently
     engrossed. Ripley knocks and enters. Looks long at Peter.

                         PETER
               How was it?

                         RIPLEY
               Good. But I think we should stay in here
               for the rest of the trip.

                         PETER
               Was that Meredith?

                         RIPLEY
                   (sighs)
               Was who Meredith?

                         PETER
               Meredith Logue. You were kissing
               somebody. Looked like Meredith.

                         RIPLEY
               Hardly kissing. Kissing off.

                         PETER
               Didn't look that way - you know - from a
               distance.

                         RIPLEY
               I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen
               you.

                         PETER
               Why lie?

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie and Peter, that's just too good
               gossip, isn't it?

                         PETER
               Or Tom and Peter even.

                         RIPLEY
               Well that would be even better gossip.

                         PETER
               Really, why?
                   (completely lost)
               Sorry, I'm completely lost.

                         RIPLEY
               I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be
               stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's
               my, that's my - terrible and alone and
               dark - and I've lied about who I am, and
               where I am, and so nobody can ever find
               me.

                         PETER
               What do you mean lied about who you are?

                         RIPLEY
               I suppose I always thought - better to be
               a fake somebody than a real nobody.

                         PETER
               What are you talking about - you're not a
               nobody! That's the last thing you are.

                         RIPLEY
               Peter, I... I...

                         PETER
                   (conciliatory)
               And don't forget. I have the key.

                         RIPLEY
               You have the key. Tell me some good
               things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up.
               Just tell me some nice things.

     He sits on the bed, leans against Peter. His eyes are
     brimming with tears.  He takes the cord from Peter's robe and
     begins twisting it in his hands.

                         PETER
               Good things about Tom Ripley?  Could take
               some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is
               tender... Tom is beautiful...

                         RIPLEY
                   (during this, and tender)
               You're such a liar...

                         PETER
               ...Tom is a mystery...

     Ripley is pressing against him, moving up his body, kisses
     his shoulder, the cord wrapped tight in his hands...

     INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. NIGHT.

     Ripley returns to his cabin. Sits on the bed, desolate.

                         PETER (O/S)
                   (cont'd)
               ...Tom is not a nobody. Tom has secrets
               he doesn't want to tell me, and I wish he
               would. Tom has nightmares. That's not a
               good thing. Tom has someone to love him.
               That is a good thing!
                   (feeling Ripley's weight on
                    him)
               Tom is crushing me. Tom is crushing me.
                   (suddenly alarmed)
               Tom, you're crushing me!

     The door of his closet flips open with the swell and he
     catches his reflection. It swings shut. Open then shut.
     Through the porthole the weather's changing as the light
     dies. There's a swell as the horizon rises and falls in the
     round glass. Ripley, alone, in a nightmare of his own making.

     THE END.






     Lullaby for Cain

     From the silence
     from the night
     comes a distant lullabye

     Cry, remembering that first cry
     Your brother standing by
     and loved
     both loved
     beloved sons of mine
     sing a lullabye
     mother is close by
     innocent eyes
     such innocent eyes

     Envy stole your brother's life
     came home murdered peace of mind
     left you nightmares on the pillow
     sleep now

     Soul, surrendering your soul
     the heart of you not whole
     for love
     but love
     what toll

     Cast into the dark
     branded with the mark
     of shame
     of Cain

     From the garden of God's light
     to a wilderness of light
     sleep now

     sleep now.

                                                        1944 SHOOTING DRAFT


                

               EXT. GARDEN CITY STATION - DAY

               CLOSE SHOT -- station signboard. It reads:

                                      "GARDEN CITY"

               CAMERA PANS to show the dusty platform of a typical small 
               Arizona town of the late nineties.

               CAMERA TRUCKS ALONG platform PAST a line of sleeping figures, 
               consisting of a couple of drunks, an Indian, two Mexicans 
               and a mongrel dog.

               CAMERA STOPS on the window of the ticket office. Inside the 
               office can be glimpsed the Station Agent dozing in a chair 
               with his feet up against the grill of the ticket window. The 
               clicking of the signal indicator is heard. The agent opens 
               his eyes, flips up the indicator and begins to get to his 
               feet sleepily.

               MED. SHOT

               line of sleeping figures, with dog in f.g. The sound of a 
               distant train whistle is heard o.s. The dog, which up to now 
               might have been dead, opens one eye and looks past camera.

               LONG SHOT

               railway track with the three-car train approaching.

               MED. SHOT

               line of sleeping figures. The dog jumps up barking furiously 
               and runs out of shot past camera. The sleeping figures come 
               to life and look toward camera. At the same time, the door 
               of the ticket office opens and the agent appears.

               FULL SHOT

               railway track. The train is now almost at the station.

               EXT. PLATFORM - DAY

               FULL SHOT -- with the line of men now standing on the edge 
               of the platform looking toward camera. Train steams slowly 
               in past camera, and stops, with a tall, wide-shouldered man 
               of about 28 (Rocklin), dressed in new store clothes, cowboots 
               and a broad-brimmed white hat, in f. g. standing on steps of 
               day coach with a small valise and saddle in his hands. Behind 
               Rocklin a conductor.

               MED. SHOT

               baggage car. The baggageman is standing at the open door of 
               the car with two sacks of mail. He drops them to the platform 
               and waves to the conductor o.s. and begins to close the doors 
               of the baggage car.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               on Station Agent and conductors. The latter signals the 
               engineer. The train whistle sounds again o.s. and the shadow 
               of the moving train begins to pass across the Station Agent's 
               face.

               TRUCKING SHOT

               As Rocklin comes along the platform carrying the valise in 
               one hand and balancing the saddle on his shoulder with the 
               other, a man behind him picks up the two mail sacks and exits 
               from scene. The station bums look at Rocklin curiously. His 
               expression giving no encouragement, they slink back out of 
               the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again. 
               At the ticket office, Rocklin pauses and looks around 
               uncertainly.

                                     STATION AGENT
                              (at office door)
                         Expectin' someone?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (after a second's 
                              pause)
                         I guess not. Where's the stagecoach 
                         office?

                                     STATION AGENT
                              (pointing)
                         Back of the depot.

               EXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY

               The stage is drawn up in front of the depot, over which is a 
               sign --

                                      RED ROCK STAGE

                                  J. Harolday Proprietor

               Rocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the 
               depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of Dave, 
               the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead 
               horses. He pauses close to one horse's head. Rocklin sees 
               Dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances 
               around, and raise it to drink. The bottle is almost to Dave's 
               lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. The bottle is 
               knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground. 
               Now Rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds 
               amusing despite its seriousness. Old Dave rants and snorts -- 
               beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and 
               exhibits his utter disgust generally.

                                     DAVE
                              (to horse)
                         Consarn you, Blossom -- lookit that -- 
                         jus' lookit what you done --
                              (some more pantomime)
                         I'm tellin' you, Blossom that --
                              (indicating broken 
                              bottle)
                         -- makes you the most aggravatin' 
                         female as ever I had a despise fer -- 
                         I've got a good notion to pizen you -- 
                         an' what's more --

               He stops talking abruptly because his hand has, quite by 
               chance, felt the spare bottle he carries, which he has 
               forgotten in his anger. A most satisfying smile lights his 
               bewhiskered face as he brings the bottle into view. He uncorks 
               it, and stepping a few paces from the horse, raises the 
               bottle.

                                     DAVE
                              (to Blossom)
                         Heh-heh -- fooled you, didn't I? --
                              (chuckles)
                         Fooled myself, too.

               ON ROCKLIN

               who has been watching Dave's performance. He smiles his 
               amusement and now proceeds toward the stage office.

               INT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY

               PAN SHOT. Rocklin enters and moves over to the counter, behind 
               which is the stage agent, a mild-looking man with pebble-
               lens glasses. During the scene, the character who picked up 
               the mail sacks from the platform, comes in, dumps the sacks 
               on the counter and leaves.

                                     STAGE AGENT
                              (to Rocklin)
                         Howdy.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (indicating stage)
                         That the stage for Santa Inez?

                                     STAGE AGENT
                              (nods)
                         Leaving any minute.

               Rocklin puts his saddle on the counter, and taking out a wad 
               of bills, drops them on the counter. The Stage Agent counts 
               out the fare.

                                     STAGE AGENT
                         Santa Inez -- seventeen-fifty --
                              (returning the balance)
                         Name?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Rocklin.

               The Stage Agent turns to make out the ticket. Rocklin takes 
               some tobacco and paper from his vest pocket as he glances 
               outside.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Mind if I ride alongside the driver?

                                     STAGE AGENT
                              (over his specs)
                         It's all right with me -- if it's 
                         all right with Dave -- He's mad -- 
                         His last trip -- Had a row with 
                         Harolday, the boss -- Old-timer, 
                         Dave -- an' a grumpy old cuss.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (soberly)
                         I like grumpy old cusses -- Hope to 
                         live long enough to be one.

                                     STAGE AGENT
                              (puzzled)
                         Yeah?

               He shakes his head and hands Rocklin the ticket, and moves 
               over to the door with one of the mail sacks in his hand.

               EXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY

               The Stage Agent, carrying a mail sack, and Rocklin come from 
               the stage depot and reach the stage as Dave is in the act of 
               climbing up to the driver's seat.

                                     STAGE AGENT
                         Here's your mail, Dave --

               Dave looks over his shoulder at the Agent and steps to the 
               ground, as Rocklin climbs up to the driver's seat.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (as he steps up to 
                              the seat)
                         -- and a passenger.

               Dave glares at Rocklin climbing up to the seat, and he is 
               about to order him down when Rocklin, now seated, looks down 
               at him and asks rather wistfully --

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Mind if I ride up here?

               Dave does mind, but his better judgment tells him to step 
               carefully in his attitude toward this stranger, who does 
               things first, then asks permission. His only answer to Rocklin 
               is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough. And 
               now Dave turns on the Agent, who becomes the target of his 
               pent-up wrath.

                                     DAVE
                         Where's them wimmen?

                                     STAGE AGENT
                         Up at the hotel.

                                     DAVE
                              (yanking mail sack 
                              from Agent)
                         Why ain't they here? -- This is the 
                         stage depot, ain't it -- ?
                              (heaves sack into 
                              boot)
                         Ain't it?

                                     STAGE AGENT
                         You can pick 'em up there -- it's 
                         only up the street --

                                     DAVE
                         On'y up the street -- an' they cain't 
                         walk it -- What's the matter -- don't 
                         Easterners have laigs like other 
                         folks?

               Dave stalks around the rear of the coach. The Agent meantime 
               stretches himself up toward Rocklin.

                                     STAGE AGENT
                              (so Dave won't hear)
                         Hold tight when you git in the 
                         mountains, mister -- When he gits 
                         riled you can hear the passengers 
                         prayin' for miles.

               Dave has climbed to his seat, and now the coach lurches away, 
               leaving the Agent shaking his head dubiously.

               EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY

               From the porch of the hotel. We see the stage approaching as 
               the hotel handyman brings a trunk and a couple of bags from 
               the hotel to the street. The coach pulls up and stops.

                                     DAVE
                              (to handyman)
                         Whar's them wimmen? -- They waitin' 
                         for you to carry 'em out?

               Before the handyman can answer, Dave's attention is taken by 
               someone calling his name from across the street. Meantime, 
               an Indian squaw wobbles from the hotel with bow and arrow, 
               etc. Rocklin buys bow and arrow.

                                     SADDLER
                              (as he comes to Dave)
                         Dave -- Dave -- tell Arly Harolday 
                         her saddle ain't ready yet, will ya?

                                     DAVE
                              (getting to the ground)
                         I ain't tellin' that crazy female 
                         nothin' -- Last time I seen her she 
                         threatened to rip the hide off'n me 
                         and bat me dizzy with it.

               Dave goes to the rear of the coach.

                                     SADDLER
                              (looks up to Rocklin)
                         Mister -- will you tell the Agent at 
                         Santa Inez to tell Miss Harolday her 
                         saddle ain't ready yet?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (nods)
                         I'll say that.

               PORCH OF HOTEL

               Miss Martin steps out onto the porch followed by Clara and a 
               gentleman, presumably the hotel manager or clerk. The women 
               are obviously Easterners and are attired in the good taste 
               of the period. Miss Martin is a domineering woman, approaching 
               middle age. Her niece, Clara, is a well-bred, attractive 
               girl of twenty-one and completely under the influence of the 
               older woman.

                                     CLERK
                              (as group comes through 
                              door)
                         By next year, madam, we expect to 
                         have a bathtub on each floor.

               Miss Martin stops short and looks o.s.

               ON DAVE AT REAR OF THE COUCH

               having a time lifting the trunk up into the boot. Miss Martin 
               and the others come into the scene.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Now don't drop it --

               Dave pauses to see who is talking.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         At your age you'd best not be lifting 
                         things so heavy.

                                     DAVE
                              (grimaces)
                         Mebbe you're young enough to hoist 
                         her up your own self.
                              (tries to lift trunk 
                              again)

               CLOSE SHOT

               on Clara. She is looking rather timidly up at Rocklin.

               CLOSE SHOT

               on Rocklin. He is grinning appreciatively at old Dave. Now 
               he notices Clara and regards her soberly a moment.

               FULL SHOT

               Dave has heaved the trunk in place and is securing it.

               Miss Martin, about to enter the coach, notices Clara staring 
               up at Rocklin.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Clara!

               Clara snaps her attention from Rocklin to her aunt. The Clerk 
               steps to the side of the coach and opens the door. He assists 
               Clara inside -- and now Miss Martin.

               INT. COACH - DAY

               Miss Martin and Clara. Miss Martin is just sitting. She looks 
               coldly at Clara.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (in low voice)
                         Staring as though you'd never seen a 
                         man before.

               EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY

               Dave, Rocklin and Clerk. Dave is at the moment climbing to 
               his seat on the other side of the coach. The Clerk swings 
               the door closed and looks up to Rocklin and speaks more or 
               less confidentially.

                                     CLERK
                         Try to hold him down or he'll scare 
                         the women to death.

               ON ROCKLIN

               He is looking down at the Clerk and answers quite casually, 
               but loud enough to be heard by the women.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I never feel sorry for anything that 
                         happens to a woman.

               INT. COACH - DAY

               THROUGH window of door -- Miss Martin and Clara. The women 
               have obviously overheard Rocklin's remark. Miss Martin smiles 
               vindictively at Clara, who flushes.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the Clerk, who moves to the 
               coach door.

                                     CLERK
                         Well, I hope you have a nice trip, 
                         ladies.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         I hope we get there -- wouldn't 
                         surprise me if we didn't.

               EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY

               On Dave and Rocklin.

                                     DAVE
                              (mutters)
                         Wait till I get you on the road, you 
                         old buzzard, you'll be surprised all 
                         right.

               He takes up the reins and shouts the team away.

                                                               DISSOLVE OUT

               DISSOLVE IN

               EXT. ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY

               EXTREME LONG SHOT -- with the stage hardly more than a black 
               dot below, its curl of rising dust in the midst of the whole 
               broad expanse. As the coach disappears from shot, the two 
               mounted men appear riding at an easy pace and continue in 
               the same direction as the coach.

               EXT. DRIVER'S SEAT OF COACH - DAY

               MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Dave and Rocklin, the latter staring 
               straight ahead. As they roll with the roll of the coach, 
               Dave steals a look at his companion.

                                     DAVE
                         I wonder why a young feller who don't 
                         have to wants to come into this God 
                         danged country?

               Rocklin ignores Dave's question and continues staring ahead. 
               Dave glances down toward the women.

                                     DAVE
                         Say -- did you mean what you said 
                         back there about wimmen?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (grimly)
                         Every word of it.

                                     DAVE
                              (chuckling)
                         Then you're smarter than most.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Maybe I seen more of 'em than most.

                                     DAVE
                              (looking at him 
                              admiringly)
                         Shouldn't be surprised. Shouldn't be 
                         a leetle bit surprised.
                              (reflectively)
                         All the same...

               He breaks off and chuckles again.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (unsmilingly)
                         All the same -- what?

               Dave doesn't reply, but lifting the pint of whiskey, jerks 
               out the cork with one movement of his thumbnail.

                                     DAVE
                              (offering bottle to 
                              Rocklin)
                         Take a slug.

               Rocklin drinks and gives the bottle back to Dave, who all 
               but empties it in one pull.

                                     DAVE
                              (holding up the bottle 
                              and squinting through 
                              it)
                         Whiskey and wimmen -- ever think how 
                         much alike they are? Both fool you, 
                         but you never figger out how to do 
                         without 'em.

               Rocklin makes no reply. Dave offers the bottle again.

                                     DAVE
                         Take another.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Not just yet.

                                     DAVE
                              (unoffended)
                         Well...
                              (putting the bottle 
                              to his lips)
                         Here's to her.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Who?

                                     DAVE
                         The next one that fools you.

               He empties the bottle and shies it away. At the same time, 
               the coach hits a particularly bad patch of road and there is 
               muffled exclamation from inside the coach. Dave leans over 
               and looks down o.s.

               INT. COACH - DAY

               MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Clara and Miss Martin. The former is 
               showing the effects of the rough ride, but the old lady is 
               hanging on grimly.

               EXT. DRIVER'S SEAT - DAY

               Dave straightens up, grinning.

                                     DAVE
                              (with relish)
                         Mighty rough stretch along here.

               He whips up the team, at the same time weaving a little 
               unsteadily in his seat.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Like me to speel you a while?

                                     DAVE
                         Nope. I've had a few snorts but that 
                         don't make no difference. Leas'ways, 
                         never has...
                              (after a second's 
                              pause)
                         Don't ever git wore out, and useless, 
                         like me.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Who're them as say you are?

                                     DAVE
                         Harolday, for one. Oh, I ain't belly-
                         aching. Reckon he's entitled to his 
                         opinion. But him and me never did 
                         see eye to eye.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         What's wrong?

                                     DAVE
                         It's constitootional, I reckon. Like 
                         that step-daughter of his is crazy -- 
                         he's too sane. Believes In law and 
                         order.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (grinning)
                         What's wrong with law and order?

                                     DAVE
                         Depends on who's a-dishin' it out. 
                         Never was good at takin' orders 
                         meself. As for the law -- well, you'll 
                         soon find out what that means 'round 
                         these parts.

               The coach hits a particularly bad bit of road and there is 
               an exclamation from inside. Dave grins and urges the team on 
               cheerfully.

                                                               DISSOLVE OUT

               DISSOLVE IN

               EXT. RIM - ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY

               FULL SHOT -- as Dave pulls up the stage at the top of a long 
               downgrade and looks out appreciatively at the view. From 
               this crest of the rim, a vast expanse of country is visible.

               CLOSE SHOT

               stage. Miss Martin thrusts her head out of the window.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Driver? Driver, what's the matter?

                                     DAVE
                         Nothin'. Restin' hosses. Git out and 
                         stretch yore laigs if you want.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Resting horses? What for? I can see 
                         with my own eyes it's downhill.

               Dave brightens visibly at this challenge.

                                     DAVE
                         You in such an all-fired hurry, lady?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Certainly, we are in a hurry.

                                     DAVE
                              (beaming)
                         Well -- we'll hurry some.

               His whip cracks like a rifle shot and the startled horses 
               literally jerk the heavy stage over the rim and down the 
               grade.

               LONG SHOT

               grade, with the stagecoach bounding and reeling down the 
               narrow road and around the sharp bends.

               CLOSE FULL SHOT

               Dave and Rocklin on stage as it thunders downhill. Dave is 
               leaning out and listening hopefully for the outcries from 
               within. None come. Rocklin is hanging on with both hands and 
               mildly amused.

               INT. STAGECOACH - DAY

               The two women are really being scrambled.

               EXT. STAGECOACH - ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- Dave and Rocklin. Rocklin is as calm as if 
               he were walking. Dave is more and more pleased with himself. 
               He again leans out to listen.

               LONG SHOT

               grade, with coach approaching in b.g. In f.g. the road narrows 
               and makes a sharp turn at the very edge of a precipice. There 
               is no possible way of getting the coach safely around this 
               turn except at a walk.

               LONG SHOT

               road, from point of view of driver's seat, establishing the 
               same menace ahead.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT

               Dave and Rocklin, as Rocklin glances out of the corner of 
               his eyes as if wondering whether or not Dave is too drunk to 
               perceive the disaster. He makes no move, however, to advise 
               or interfere.

               FULL SHOT

               road; at danger corner, as stage comes in. At the very last 
               second, Dave pulls in the horses and negotiates the turn in 
               safety.

               CLOSE SHOT

               stage. Dave grins at Rocklin, then listens for the outcry he 
               expects from the women within. The old lady's head bobs out 
               of the window.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (fiercely)
                         Now what's the matter. Why are we 
                         stopping again?

               Old Dave's mouth drops open, and as Rocklin begins to grin 
               at his discomfiture.

               DISSOLVE

               EXT. STAN'S PLACE - DAY

               FULL SHOT of lonely adobe which serves as a combination 
               roadhouse, stage station and bar. As the coach rolls into 
               f.g., a little Mexican boy (Pablo) runs out to change the 
               horses.

                                     PABLO
                              (as Rocklin swings 
                              down)
                         Buenas noches, senor.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Buenas noches, amigo.

                                     PABLO
                              (grinning at the 
                              friendly tone)
                         Ha llegado anticipademente, senor.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Tuvimos suerte en haber llegado.

               He glances pointedly at Dave who is climbing down unsteadily 
               and Pablo bursts out laughing.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               on door of coach. As Dave comes into shot, Miss Martin's 
               head pops out of the window.

                                     DAVE
                              (gruffly)
                         We stop here.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Why do we stop here?

                                     DAVE
                         If you wanta eat and stretch yore 
                         laigs.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Will you please stop referring to my 
                         legs!

                                     DAVE
                         You got some, ain't you?

               He turns and lurches toward the roadhouse.

               INT. STAN'S PLACE - DAY

               FULL SHOT from doorway. It is a large barn-like room on one 
               side of which is a bar. On the other side is a fireplace and 
               a partition behind which is a rough dining table and benches. 
               Standing at the bar drinking with his back to the door is a 
               wizened little man, dressed in an odd assortment of ragged 
               garments of unrecognizable origin. On the counter is a 
               travelling prospector's pack, to which is strapped an 
               assortment of prospector's equipment, including a pick and 
               shovel. As Dave enters, the man (Zeke) turns around and 
               reveals a face even hairier than Dave's.

                                     ZEKE
                              (holding out his arms)
                         Dave!

                                     DAVE
                              (letting out a yell 
                              and rushing to Zeke)
                         Why, Zeke, you two-legged old coot!

               CLOSE SHOT

               Zeke and Dave as they beat one another on the back.

                                     DAVE
                         Whar you been all these months?

                                     ZEKE
                         Up in the hills workin' my way down 
                         the biggest hole you ever seed.

                                     DAVE
                         Good -- What's at the bottom of it?

                                     ZEKE
                         Nothin'!

                                     DAVE
                              (roaring with laughter)
                         What, again!!

               MED. SHOT

               Rocklin has entered and moved to the fire. Miss Martin and 
               Clara enter and stand in the doorway watching the scene at 
               the bar. A pale-faced, dyspeptic-looking man of about 45 
               (Stan) comes from the kitchen and approaches them 
               ingratiatingly.

                                     STAN
                         Good evening, ladies. How about 
                         something to eat?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (with a dubious look 
                              toward the pair at 
                              the bar)
                         Well -- if it won't take too long.

                                     STAN
                              (leading the way toward 
                              the partition)
                         This way, ladies.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               bar. Dave has just fitted a cylindrical record of "She Was 
               Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage" to an old-type phonograph.

                                     DAVE
                         Yep -- this is my last trip.

                                     ZEKE
                         Why?

                                     DAVE
                         Old Harolday won't take back what he 
                         said.

                                     ZEKE
                         What'd he say?

                                     DAVE
                         "You're fired."

               They both yell with laughter and slap one another on the 
               back.

               MED. SHOT

               from fireplace. Rocklin is standing in f.g. looking down at 
               the fire and making the inevitable cigarette from his pocket 
               dip. Seated at the table are Clara and Miss Martin. From 
               o.s. comes the sound of Zeke and Dave singing to the 
               phonograph record. Miss Martin glares indignantly in the 
               direction of the bar, obviously about to make a protest. At 
               this moment Stan comes from the kitchen with a large dish in 
               his hand which he dumps on the table.

                                     STAN
                         There you are, folks. Dig in and 
                         help y'rselves.

               Miss Martin, sitting forward eagerly, suddenly sees the dish 
               of meat and freezes.

               CLOSE SHOT

               dish of meat. It is swimming in greasy brown gravy.

               MED. SHOT

               Miss Martin as she shudders dyspeptically and closes her 
               eyes.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               bar, as Stan comes from the table to Dave and Zeke.

                                     STAN
                         Supper, Dave?

                                     DAVE
                              (noisily)
                         I'm drinkin' mine. Set 'em up.

               MED. SHOT

               table. Clara has filled a plate with food, which she offers 
               to her aunt.

                                     CLARA
                         Auntie --

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         With my dyspepsia? Do you want to 
                         kill me?

               Clara hesitates for a second, then looks across to Rocklin.

                                     CLARA
                         Aren't you going to have any supper?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Reckon so.

               He comes to table and begins to help himself. There is a 
               loud burst of laughter from the bar.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Young man, that driver's had all the 
                         liquor he can take.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Has he?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         You know he has. You're not a complete 
                         fool, are you?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Frequently.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (to Clara, furiously)
                         The rudeness of people in these parts 
                         is appalling!

               Clara looks apologetically at Rocklin, then away again 
               nervously. Suddenly, she sees something o.s. and drops her 
               knife and fork with a little start.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               window. A thin, unpleasant-looking face is seen through the 
               glass. The windowpane is defective and so distorts the lower 
               part of the face into a hideous smile. It is the younger of 
               the two men who were watching the coach outside the hotel.

               PANNING SHOT

               on kitchen door as Stan comes through with a dish of potatoes. 
               A man's voice is heard o.s. and he pulls up abruptly.

                                     BOB CLEWS' VOICE
                         Well, well -- smells like a mighty 
                         nice bit of veal.

               CAMERA HAS PANNED TO include the side door next to the window 
               and almost opposite to the dining table. The owner of the 
               face at the window (Bob Clews) is now standing in the doorway. 
               Behind him is the man with the sheriff's badge on his dirty 
               vest (Jackson). As they come forward toward Stan, the latter 
               shows obvious signs of nervousness.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         Doin' yourself well these days, Stan.

                                     STAN
                         A friend of mine was by an' sold me 
                         a quarter of beef.

                                     JACKSON
                              (insinuatingly)
                         The same friend as sold you that 
                         hide Bob, here, found stashed in 
                         your barn yesterday?

                                     STAN
                         Hide -- What hide?

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         The one that might send you to the 
                         penitentiary.

                                     JACKSON
                              (smugly)
                         What did you do with it, Stan?

                                     STAN
                         I never had no hide stashed --

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (harshly)
                         I saw it yesterday under the hay.

                                     STAN
                         Then it must still be there.

                                     JACKSON
                         No it ain't -- we looked -- Where is 
                         it?

                                     STAN
                         I tell ya --

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (who has been an 
                              interested witness)
                         What is all this?

               Jackson, as though noticing the women for the first time, 
               raises his hat.

                                     JACKSON
                         Afternoon ma'am. Miz Caldwell ain't 
                         it?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         No -- Martin -- Miss Martin -- This 
                         is Miss Caldwell.

                                     JACKSON
                              (to Clara)
                         Glad to know you, miss -- Been 
                         expectin' you at Santa Inez. I'm 
                         Sheriff Jackson. Any relation of Red 
                         Caldwell's a friend of mine.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (that oily smile)
                         You're sure gonna brighten things up 
                         considerable around the K.C. Ranch.

               Miss Martin gives Clews an icy stare and snaps her eyes to 
               Jackson.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (indicating Stan)
                         What's going on with him?

                                     JACKSON
                         Just a little matter of the law.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (hastily)
                         Rustlin'.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Wrestling?

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         Rustlin' -- cattle stealin'.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Oh -- a thief --

                                     STAN
                              (visibly worried)
                         I tell ya I never --

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (quickly)
                         Save it --

                                     JACKSON
                              (to Miss Martin)
                         Matter of fact -- Bob, here, says 
                         that the hide he saw yesterday had 
                         the K.C. brand on it.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Oh -- hmmm -- well, what do you intend 
                         doing about it?

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (looking at Stan)
                         Law's pretty harsh 'round here on 
                         cattle thieves.

                                     JACKSON
                              (being the kind man)
                         Course, we don't want to make a 
                         mistake with an old-timer, but --

               Rocklin speaks from where he leans against the wall, casually 
               smoking.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         How about the owner of that beef -- 
                         mightn't he have somethin' to say 
                         about it?

               There's a pause in which all have turned their attention to 
               Rocklin.

                                     JACKSON
                         Meanin'?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Red Caldwell -- he's the owner of 
                         the K.C., ain't he?

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (after a short chuckle)
                         You're 'way behind the herd, mister -- 
                         Red Caldwell died three weeks ago.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (glaring at Clews)
                         Was murdered, you mean.

                                     JACKSON
                         That's right -- shot in the back -- 
                         not far from here.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (significantly to 
                              Stan)
                         Maybe he was gettin' on to things 
                         about the cattle that's been missin' 
                         from the K.C. lately.

                                     STAN
                         I tell ya I ain't never had any hide --

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (quickly)
                         Well, you got beef --

                                     STAN
                              (meekly defiant)
                         Yes -- an' I got a bill of sale fer 
                         it, too.

               Jackson and Clews exchange a quick glance.

                                     JACKSON
                         S'pose you let me see that bill of 
                         sale.

                                     STAN
                              (starts for kitchen)
                         It's right out here.

               Jackson follows, looking at the women.

                                     JACKSON
                         Like I said -- I wouldn't want to 
                         make a mistake with an ole-timer.

               Jackson follows Stan into the kitchen. Clews moves to the 
               fire and lunges there picking his teeth and eyeing Clara, 
               who stirs uneasily under the man's gaze.

               MED. SHOT

               as Rocklin comes out of the thoughtful mood in which he has 
               been plunged by the information about Red Caldwell and notes 
               the by-play between Clews and Clara. He frowns and makes a 
               movement as if about to rise. At the same time, Dave and 
               Zeke, whose voices have been heard throughout In the b.g., 
               stagger into the shot.

                                     DAVE
                              (chuckling and pointing 
                              to Miss Martin)
                         See that one?
                              (confidentially)
                         She ain't got no laigs.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Hold your tongue.
                              (to Zeke, who is gaping 
                              at her)
                         And you -- stop staring as if we 
                         were monsters.

               Zeke takes it and staggers into the b.g. near Bob Clews.

                                     DAVE
                              (to Rocklin)
                         Where's Stan? We got to have another 
                         drink.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         He's outside tryin' to explain away 
                         a hide.

                                     DAVE
                         Eh?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (indicating food)
                         Seems we're eatin' stolen beef.

                                     DAVE
                         Somebody's loco. Stan might have 
                         given house-room to bit o' dead beef, 
                         but he'd never be fool enough to 
                         leave the hide lyin' around.
                              (to Zeke)
                         How 'bout it, Zeke?

               Zeke opens his mouth to speak, and slowly folds up, sliding 
               down the wall to the floor.

               MED. SHOT

               as Clews comes from the fireplace and joins the group.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         That's the way it is, Dave.

               Dave has gone to Zeke's aid and now peers at Clews closely, 
               recognizing him for the first time.

                                     DAVE
                              (disgustedly)
                         Oh -- it's you.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         That's right -- your old pal Bob 
                         Clews.

                                     DAVE
                              (shoves Clews)
                         Git away from me -- you two-timin' 
                         horse thief.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (grinning)
                         Them's fightin' words, pardner.

               Stan and Jackson come from the kitchen. Dave is again picking 
               up Zeke, but seeing Stan, lets Zeke drop.

                                     DAVE
                              (moving to Stan)
                         Hey, Stan -- don't let 'em hang 
                         nothin' on you, you ain't done. 
                         They're just a couple of fourflushers -- 
                         the pair of 'em, everybody knows 
                         that.

               Jackson addresses everyone present with an indulgent Smile.

                                     JACKSON
                         Crazy drunk.

                                     DAVE
                              (wheels on Jackson)
                         Mebbe I am drunk -- mebbe that's why 
                         I'm tellin' the truth -- I'm drunk 
                         an' I'll say what I think -- I'll 
                         say what I know.

               Zeke, on the floor, takes up Dave's belligerent mood for a 
               flash.

                                     ZEKE
                         So will -- I --
                              (goes out again)

               Jackson goes to Dave.

                                     JACKSON
                         Don't act up this ways, Dave -- They's 
                         women watchin'.

               Clews moves in to Jackson and Dave, and now both men urge 
               Dave toward the door.

                                     DAVE
                              (attempting to throw 
                              them off)
                         Git your hands off me --

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (to company in general)
                         What he needs is a short lay-down.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (taking a step forward)
                         I'll lend a hand.

                                     JACKSON
                              (brushing past him)
                         Me an' Bob'll look after him. We're 
                         his friends -- come on, Bob.
                              (as they steer Dave 
                              through door)
                         Careful now -- don't hurt him.

               They exit. Rocklin stands frowning a second, then turns toward 
               the table where Stan is making a show of clearing dishes, 
               etc.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (quietly to Stan)
                         How are things standin' now between 
                         you an' the law?
                              (indicates direction 
                              Jackson went out)

                                     STAN
                              (not wanting to talk 
                              about it particularly)
                         All right, I reckon --
                              (looks at Rocklin; 
                              more confidently)
                         I guess this bill of sale --
                              (indicates it in Vest 
                              pocket)
                         -- kinda winded him.

               Rocklin's lips curl in a wise smile.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Good thing you saved it.

               Zeke is discovered on all fours crawling around on the floor 
               near the table where the women sit. He seems to be looking 
               for something.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (mystified)
                         What are you doing?

               Zeke turns his hairy face up toward Miss Martin.

                                     ZEKE
                         Musta been dreamin' -- Thought I was 
                         sittin' on a pot of gold.

                                     STAN
                              (wearily)
                         There ain't no gold here.

                                     ZEKE
                              (takes it)
                         There ain't even a pot.

               The door leading from the barn opens and Jackson enters 
               followed by Clews a few steps behind.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         How is he?

                                     JACKSON
                         Went to sleep soon's we laid him 
                         down.
                              (pulling off hat again)
                         Sorry to have a ruckus in front of 
                         you ladies. Dave's an ornery old 
                         cuss when he gets goin' -- No shape 
                         to drive on, I'm afraid.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (this is a fine kettle 
                              of fish)
                         Hmmm --

                                     JACKSON
                         Don't worry, ma'am. Bob, here, 'll 
                         take you on in -- knows every inch 
                         of the road -- Don't you?

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (grins)
                         You bet.

               Rocklin has been listening intently.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I'm drivin'.

               CLOSE SHOT

               of the group, with Clews looking significantly at Jackson, 
               who is obviously checkmated by Rocklin's remark.

                                     JACKSON
                              (finally speaks)
                         But if anything was to happen to the 
                         ladies, I'd feel -- to blame.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Don't.

               He turns abruptly and walks out the front door to the coach. 
               Jackson stares after him a moment, uncertain. Now he turns 
               to the women.

                                     JACKSON
                         You ladies want he should drive?

               Miss Martin hesitates.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         I'll be more'n glad to accommodate 
                         you --
                              (smiles at Clara)

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (resenting Clews' 
                              familiarity)
                         He's going with us anyway -- he may 
                         as well drive.

                                     JACKSON
                         Anything you say, ma'am.

               EXT. STAN'S PLACE - LATE AFTERNOON

               MED. SHOT -- coach as Rocklin moves toward it from the house. 
               A crudely made arrow shoots in and hits Rocklin lightly. A 
               warning hiss is heard o.s. and he turns quickly in the 
               direction of the sound.

               EXT. STABLE - STAN'S PLACE - LATE AFTERNOON

               MED. SHOT -- door of stable. The little Mexican who attended 
               the horses is peering out from the stable.

                                     MEXICAN
                              (in a whisper)
                         Venga con migo, senor.

               The kid disappears inside the stable. Rocklin comes into 
               shot from the direction of the coach and enters the stable.

               INT. STABLE - STAN'S PLACE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Rocklin comes through the door and moves toward the boy, who 
               is standing looking downward into some hay.

               CAMERA PANS DOWN to show Dave unconscious, with a nasty cut 
               in his scalp. Rocklin kneels into the shot. Over the scene 
               comes the sound of retreating hoofbeats.

               EXT. STAN'S PLACE - LATE AFTERNOON

               LONG SHOT -- from Rocklin's ANGLE in the stable, of Jackson 
               and Bob Clews riding away.

                              (to boy)
                         Did they do it?

                                     MEXICAN
                              (nods)
                         Si, senor. They hit him with a 
                         pistola.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (matters)
                         His friends, eh?

               He kneels again, picks Dave up, and prepares to carry him 
               out.

               PANNING SHOT -- with Miss Martin and Clara now seated next 
               to one another. Clara is half asleep with her head against 
               the side of the coach. Miss Martin is sitting bolt upright 
               but her eyes are closed and her head nods. CAMERA PANS to 
               include the other side of the coach where Dave is sprawled 
               in the seat, his head on a cushion, his mouth open, sound 
               asleep. Suddenly he snores violently, and Miss Martin wakes 
               with a start and glares at him angrily.

               CAMERA PANS to show the coach pulled up outside, with Rocklin 
               lifting his saddle from the top of the coach, whilst a

                         Where's the best chance of a cheap 
                         room?

               The two move out of shot across the road, followed by the

               (Ab Jenkins); a pleasant-faced storekeeper of about 50 (Pap 
               Fossler); and a little man with a weather-beaten face and 
               intensely blue eyes (Doc Riding). Watching the game are Sam 
               Haynes and Shorty Davis, the former a townsman and the latter 
               a cowboy. As they all look toward the door, Cap's voice 
               continues.

               Doc Riding looks quickly toward the door, taking in the 
               situation.

               Rocklin and Dave come to the bar. At the same time, Doc Riding 
               comes into shot from the poker table.

                         Bumped his head.

                              (examining the head)
                         Looks like he's going to need a couple 
                         or so stitches.
                              (to Cap)
                         Better get him upstairs.

               The bartender looks dubious.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (nodding)
                         Okay. You can book me a room, too.

               As Rocklin and Doc Riding begin to lead Dave toward the 
               Stairs.

               TRUCKING SHOT -- starting on big head of Dave, as he lies in 
               bed, with his eyes closed. His head is swathed in a clean 
               bandage. He stirs and gives a little chuckle.

                                     DAVE
                              (muttering)
                         No laigs.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Doc Riding at the bed and Rocklin 
               beyond, standing in the connecting doorway between two 
               bedrooms. The latter has a face towel in his hands and has 
               evidently been washing up. As Dave settles down comfortably 
               in the bed, Doc Riding closes his bag, nods to Rocklin and 
               moves toward the second bedroom.

               Rocklin closes door behind him.

                         Don't mind if I do.

               He moves across the room, followed by Rocklin, who throws 
               the towel down on the bed as he passes. For a second, he 
               hesitates as if about to pick up the gun-belt which is lying 
               on the bed. Then, deciding to leave it, he follows the doctor 
               through the door.

                         Besides, I on'y came in to oblige.

                         Come on, Doc. I still got to take 
                         something from you.

                              (shaking his head)

                         day ahead.

               Judge Garvey in foreground has been watching Rocklin, as if 
               trying to sum him up. He now leans forward with an 
               ingratiating smile.

                                     GARVEY
                         How about you, sir? Care to sit In? 
                         I'm warnin' you, though -- our young 
                         friend here has been holding 
                         phenomenal cards.

               Rocklin smiles and begins to shake his head.

                                     CLINT
                              (with a cocky grin)
                         Have a heart, Judge. This ain't no 
                         two-bit saddle-tramp's game. This is 
                         for real money.

               Rocklin turns very slowly and stares at Clint. The others 
               watch curiously. Without taking his eyes off Clint, he comes 
               forward slowly and stands looking down at him. Then, 
               unbuttoning the flap of his pocket, he takes out the wad of 
               bills and drops it on the table, at the same time sinking 
               into the chair vacated by Sammy. The tension amongst the 
               onlookers relaxes and Clint grins at Garvey and winks 
               significantly.

                                     GARVEY
                         Fine! Oh -- this is Pap Fossler; 
                         Shorty Davis; Ab Jenkins; Mr. 
                         Harolday, and my name's Garvey -- 
                         Judge Garvey. I didn't get your name.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I didn't give it.
                              (to Pap, who is holding 
                              the cards)
                         Deal.

               INT. SUN-UP BAR - NIGHT

               MED. SHOT -- poker table, including Cap, who is watching. 
               Pap Fossler is dealing. There is an atmosphere of tension 
               around the table, and it is obvious that Clint has been 
               losing. As he picks up his cards, he is unable to restrain a 
               smile of triumph. Rocklin makes a bet. Pap Fossler and the 
               man next to him fold immediately.

                                     CLINT
                         Raise you twenty.

               This is more than Rocklin has in front of him.

                                     PAP
                              (quietly)

                         Not if he wants to dig.

               He stares challengingly at Rocklin. Rocklin takes out a 
               wallet, from which he removes a bill and sees the raise.

                                     GARVEY
                              (folding)
                         No place for me.

                         One.

                                     CLINT
                              (eagerly)
                         One for me.

               He reaches for it almost before it is dealt and as a result 
               the card, a Queen, falls face up. Clint looks at it gleefully, 
               snatches it up and puts it in his hand. Rocklin watches him 
               impassively.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Don't you know that Queen is dead?

                                     CLINT
                         I can take it if I want it.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Sure -- if you want -- but you'll 
                         have to beat my hand with four cards.

                                     CLINT
                              (hotly)
                         I'm playing these, mister!

               Rocklin glances inquiringly at the other players. All are 
               dead-panned, unwilling to interfere. Rocklin looks toward 
               Cap, who stands near him.

                                     CAP
                              (shaking his head)
                         I'm not settin' in.

                                     GARVEY
                              (smoothly)
                         Why don't you split the pot?

                                     CLINT
                         I'm not splitting -- I'm betting!

               He shoves all the money in front of him into the pot.

                                     CLINT
                         Are you calling?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (calmly)
                         No.

               Clint excitedly starts to rake in the pot.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I'm raising.

               He shoves in the money in front of him, which is more than 
               Clint's and in addition takes from his wallet more bills.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Dig.

               Clint, very excited, empties his pockets, which is not enough.

                                     CLINT
                              (to other players)
                         Let me have some money

                                     PAP
                              (speaking for all)
                         You're in deep enough, Clint.

                                     CLINT
                              (disgusted, to Rocklin)
                         I've called for all I've got.
                              (spreads out his cards)
                         Full house.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         No good.
                              (spreads his hand)
                         Kings up. Your third queen is dead.

               Rocklin starts raking in the pot. Clint, almost hysterical, 
               jumps up, draws his gun and thrusts it almost into Rocklin's 
               face. The other players roll away from the line of fire.

                                     CLINT
                              (screaming)
                         You -- mister -- get away from that 
                         table. And get out of here. Maybe 
                         from now on you'll know a full house 
                         beats two pairs -- four-flusher!

               Rocklin, his hands outspread, slowly straightens up, rises 
               and backs away. At the foot of the stairs, he turns 
               deliberately and walks upstairs. When he disappears from 
               view --

               CLINT - WITH OTHERS AT THE POKER TABLE

               Clint breaks the tension, looking from one to the other.

                                     CLINT
                         No man can run a bluff on me.

               There is a cold silence.

                                     PAP
                              (finally)
                         He wasn't armed.

                                     CAP
                         I don't like to tell men how to play 
                         cards unless I'm settin' in -- but I 
                         mebbe ought to have spoken up.
                              (directly to Clint)
                         That Queen was dead, Clint -- and 
                         you know it.

                                     CLINT
                              (arrogantly)
                         When anybody plays poker with me, 
                         they play my game or not at all.

                                     CAP
                         You can't just go makin' your own 
                         rules, Clint --
                              (starts for the bar -- 
                              stops and turns)
                         -- an' if I was you I'd hightail 
                         outa here before he comes back.

                                     CLINT
                              (jolted)
                         Comes back?

                                     CAP
                              (wearily)
                         He's the kind.

               Cap turns and resumes his trek to the bar. Suddenly he stops 
               before reaching it and is looking up, o.s.

               THE TOP OF STAIRS FROM CAP'S ANGLE

               Rocklin is standing there grimly surveying the situation. As 
               he starts down the stairs...

               THE GROUP AROUND THE POKER TABLE

               They are staring o.s. Clint is very uneasy. And now Rocklin 
               moves slowly into the scene.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (with deadly calm)
                         I've come for my money.

                                     CLINT
                              (nervously pleasant)
                         It's all yours, mister -- Cap, there -- 
                         Cap is an old gambler -- he says you 
                         were right all the time.

               Clint again looks around for approval, but gets no response. 
               Rocklin comes slowly forward, picks up the money from the 
               table and turns back to the stairs. As he reaches the foot 
               of the stairs, he turns and looks straight at Garvey with a 
               peculiar expression.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         By the way, Judge -- the name is 
                         Rocklin.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               INT. ROCKLIN'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               TRUCKING SHOT -- on a small cracked mirror in which can be 
               seen the reflection of a man shaving. A voice is heard 
               singing, atrociously off key.

                                     SINGER'S VOICE
                         She was only a bird in a gilded 
                         cage...
                              (etc.)

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to show that the owner of tie voice is 
               Rocklin, who has almost finished shaving. As he scrapes his 
               chin and whistles, peering at himself in the little cracked 
               mirror, he hears the sound of the door opening and turns, 
               then ducks quickly as a boot flies past him, just missing 
               the mirror. There is the sound of the door slamming and 
               Rocklin grins. He picks up the boot and goes to the door 
               leading to Dave's room.

               INT. DAVE'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               As Rocklin enters, Dave is discovered almost dressed sitting 
               on the bed. Rocklin, glad to see him, smiles and tosses the 
               boot to him.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         How you feelin'?

                                     DAVE
                         After that singin'? -- Thirsty.
                              (pulls on his boot)

                                     ROCKLIN
                         How's your head?

                                     DAVE
                              (evidently not aware 
                              of what happened)
                         Oh -- a mite hungover -- but I'll 
                         feel better once I git downstairs.

               He hurries out the hall door. Rocklin, amused at the old 
               coot, starts back into his room.

               INT. ROCKLIN'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               Rocklin is just coming through the door and sees something 
               o.s., stops and freezes.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Bob Clews leaning against the 
               open ball door leading into Rocklin's room. He smiles as 
               Rocklin sees him.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         I knocked, but guess you didn't hear 
                         me.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (closing door to Dave's 
                              room)
                         What do you want?

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (grinning)
                         Looks like you stirred things up 
                         around here last night, stranger.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That all you came to say?

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         No. I got a message for you.
                              (getting no response)
                         From Old Man Harolday. Wants to see 
                         you out front.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         What about?

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         Maybe he wants to thank you for 
                         teaching that pup of his a lesson.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (after a second)
                         I'll be down.

               Clews hesitates for a second as if anxious to wake sure he 
               is coming, then, turning, he disappears into the hall. Rocklin 
               wipes the last of the lather off his chin, buckles on his 
               gun-belt and picking up his hat goes out, closing the door.

               INT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               MED. SHOT -- Dave, at the bar, grabbing a bottle, pours 
               himself a drink which he sinks in one draught. He shudders 
               and repeats the dose. During this, an excited murmur of voices 
               has been heard o.s. Dave turns and looks toward the far side 
               of the saloon and suddenly gapes.

               MED. SHOT - FROM THE BAR

               with Dave in f.g., and SHOOTING TOWARD the street. A group 
               of men, including Cap, the bartender, is gathered round the 
               window looking out into the street. Dave staggers across to 
               them and begins to push his way to the window.

               MED. SHOT

               group at window as Dave pushes them aside to get a view of 
               what is happening outside.

                                     DAVE
                         What's goin' on here?

                                     PAP FOSSLER
                         Arly Harolday's on the warpath.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY

               PANNING SHOT -- including Arly and Juan mounted in front of 
               the stagecoach office, which is situated diagonally across 
               the street from the Sun-Up.

               CAMERA HOLDS ON one group standing in front of Pap Fossler's 
               store, opposite the Sun-Up.

                                     AD LIBS
                         Here he comes. Watch the fun. This 
                         should be good. Etc.

               EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               ON the window. The men inside, including Dave and Cap, are 
               pressed against the glass.

               CAMERA MOVES BACK and PANS TO the alleyway at the side of 
               the saloon. Rocklin is coming toward the street.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Rocklin, as he comes out of the shadow of the alleyway and 
               stands blinking in the full sunlight. Sensing something 
               unusual, he looks quickly around.

               PANNING SHOT

               from Rocklin's ANGLE. CAMERA PANS OVER the groups in the 
               street, STOPPING ON one which includes Bob Clews. As Clews 
               sees Rocklin, he nudges a bystander and looks toward the 
               stagecoach office with a grin.

               CAMERA PANS to include Arly and Juan.

               TRUCKING SHOT ON

               Rocklin as he takes in the situation. With a grim look, he 
               begins to move along the sidewalk, CAMERA TRUCKING WITH him. 
               Suddenly, there is the clatter of a horse's hooves and Arly 
               gallops into shot, forcing the mare up onto the sidewalk and 
               barring Rocklin's progress.

                                     ARLY
                              (imperiously)
                         Is your name Rocklin?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (coldly)
                         Yes.

                                     ARLY
                              (contemptuously)
                         I want that money you took from my 
                         brother last night.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (quietly)
                         Are you crazy? Or just ignorant?

                                     ARLY
                              (flaming)
                         You took it at the point of a gun --
                              (suddenly whipping a 
                              revolver from her 
                              saddle holster)
                         -- and I'm taking it back the same 
                         way!

               FLASH SHOT

               of group including Bob Clews, as Clint Harolday rides in and 
               stares o.s.

               TRUCKING SHOT

               Rocklin, as he looks coldly from Arly to the run and back 
               again. Calmly taking the reins, he forces the mare's head up 
               and moves on. Furiously, Arly spurs the mare alongside, CAMERA 
               TRUCKING WITH them.

                                     ARLY
                              (furiously)
                         Stop! You! stop, or I'll kill you!

               CLOSE MOVING SHOT

               Arly and Rocklin. Rocklin continues along the sidewalk.

                                     ARLY
                              (pulls up her horse)
                         Turn around.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Arly. She raises her gun.

               ROCKLIN CONTINUES WALKING

               A shot comes from o.s. and strikes the building close to 
               him. He stiffens but keeps on walking. Another shot comes 
               even closer this time. He keeps walking.

               ON ARLY - SHE IS FURIOUS

               ROCKLIN HAS REACHED THE SWINGING DOORS OF THE SUN-UP

               As he puts out his hand to push open the door,

               CLOSE SHOT

               Rocklin's hand on the door as four shots in quick succession 
               spatter a line down the door close to his hand.

               INT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               TRUCKING SHOT -- Rocklin, as he continues his forward movement 
               through the swing-doors. CAMERA PULLS BACK in front of him 
               into the saloon until it reaches the bar. Cap moves from 
               window with crowd and goes behind bar.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Whiskey!

               EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               CLOSE SHOT -- Arley with the smoking gun still in her hand. 
               She stares wildly after Rocklin for a second, then wheels 
               her horse violently toward the group which includes Cling 
               Harolday and Bob Clews.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               group surrounding Clews and Clint Harolday. The clatter of 
               hoofs is heard and Arly gallops furiously into shot.

                                     CLINT
                         What happened?

                                     ARLY
                         You lied to me, didn't you?

                                     CLINT
                         I...

                                     ARLY
                         Don't think I'll forget this. Making 
                         a fool of me in front of the whole 
                         town.

               Before Clint can reply, she wheels the mare and gallops out 
               of shot.

               INT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               MED. SHOT -- as the customers, with Dave in f.g., mill around 
               Rocklin.

                                     DAVE
                         Boy, oh boy, was that a near thing! 
                         She'd just as soon have hit you as 
                         missed. You don't know how lucky you 
                         were, son.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Don't I?
                              (indicating whiskey 
                              with a sickly grin)
                         Why d'you think I need this?

               He sinks the whiskey and begins to pour himself another. At 
               the same time, the swing-doors open and Bob Clews comes 
               through. AS Rocklin raises the glass to his lips, Bob Clews 
               hits him on the back, causing him to spill the whisky.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         Funniest sight I ever seen.

               There is a moment's pause. Then with a slow, grim smile of 
               satisfaction, Rocklin turns and knocks Bob Clews off his 
               feet.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               with Bob Clews on the floor, tugging at his gun. As it comes 
               free of the holster, Rocklin brings his heel down on Clews' 
               wrist, grinding on it with his whole weights. Then, kicking 
               the gun out of reach, Rocklin steps back. Bob Clews sits up, 
               clutching his wrist and weaving back and forth.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (moaning)
                         You broke it! You broke it!

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Try another trick like that on me 
                         and it'll be worse.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         I never played you no trick. You 
                         broke my wrist.

               WIDER ANGLE

               to include the bystanders. They look at Bob Clews without 
               sympathy. He gets to his feet and stumbles back, collapsing 
               in a chair.

               CLOSE SHOT

               at bar, Dave has taken the bottle from Cap and is refilling 
               Rocklin's and his own glass ecstatically.

                                     DAVE
                              (gurgling with delight)
                         Oh boy -- has somebody come to town!

               He sinks both drinks quickly and is about to refill them 
               when Cap takes the bottle from him.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Cap)
                         Where'll I find Judge Garvey?

                                     CAP
                         He rooms behind his office down the 
                         street. Don't usually pull up the 
                         blinds till around noon, though.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (putting down money)
                         He will this morning.
                              (to Dave)
                         See you later, old-timer...

               As he moves toward the door.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Clint Harolday is seen at the window peering furtively toward 
               the Sun-Up Saloon. He suddenly notices something o.s. which 
               prompts him to say something which we of course cannot hear. 
               Now Garvey appears at the window.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY

               Rocklin, FROM Garvey's ANGLE as he leaves the Sun-Up and 
               starts toward the Judge's office.

               EXT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Garvey and Clint, at the window. From their expressions it 
               is apparent that anxious words are passing between them, and 
               now Clint suddenly drops from sight.

               ROCKLIN APPROACHES - LOOKS THE PLACE OVER - AND ENTERS

               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY

               ON Arly and Juan, mounted. They see Rocklin going into 
               Garvey's place.

               INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               MED. SHOT -- TOWARD door, with Garvey at desk in f.g. The 
               door opens and Rocklin enters.

                                     GARVEY
                              (effusively)
                         Oh, come in, Mr. Rocklin. Come right 
                         in.

               Rocklin looks him over for a second, then comes quietly to 
               the desk.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I understand you were Red Caldwell's 
                         lawyer?

                                     GARVEY
                              (immediately on guard)
                         I was.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Know anything about this?

               He takes out a letter and hands it to Garvey. The latter 
               takes it slowly, handling it as if it were dangerous. He 
               looks from the letter to Rocklin and back again. Then 
               reluctantly, he opens it and begins to read.

               LETTER -- It reads:

               Dear Mr. Rocklin:

               Glad you have made up your mind to take the job. Enclosed 
               find train fare and $150 advance on wages.

               Yours faithfully,

               J. Caldwell

               MED. SHOT

               Rocklin and Garvey. The latter looks up from the letter 
               completely bewildered.

                                     GARVEY
                         I don't understand. Job? What job?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Foreman.

                                     GARVEY
                              (gaping)
                         On the "K.C."?
                              (trying to take it in)
                         But -- but why should he want you?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Why not? Good foremen don't grow on 
                         bushes.

               There is a little pause, with Garvey still bewildered.

                                     GARVEY
                              (thinking hard)
                         Is that your only motive for coming 
                         here?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         What other motive could I have?

                                     GARVEY
                         I don't know -- It's just that Red 
                         Caldwell was a peculiar man -- had a 
                         funny way of doing things.

               He studies Rocklin a short moment, then sits back comfortably 
               and relieved.

                                     GARVEY
                         Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Rocklin, that 
                         you've been brought all this way on 
                         a fool's errand, but -- I'm afraid 
                         the deal's off.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Off?

                                     GARVEY
                         I don't want to be too hard on you, 
                         but as executor of the estate I have 
                         to consider the interests of the new 
                         owner. How about, say, a hundred in 
                         full settlement?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (thoughtfully)
                         Well --

               There is a knock on the door. Garvey rises and speaks on his 
               way to the door.

                                     GARVEY
                         That's my last word -- think it over.

               Garvey opens the door, and Miss Martin stalks in followed by 
               Clare.

                                     GARVEY
                              (graciously)
                         How do you do, ladies --

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (icily)
                         You are Judge Garvey, I presume.

                                     GARVEY
                              (nods)
                         Yes -- and you are --

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Miss Martin -- and my niece, Clara 
                         Caldwell.

                                     GARVEY
                              (reaching for a chair)
                         Of course -- of course --

               Miss Martin sits stiffly as she eyes Rocklin coldly.

                                     GARVEY
                         You came at a very opportune moment, 
                         madam. This gentleman claims to have 
                         some sort of a letter from the late 
                         Mr. Caldwell, engaging him as foreman 
                         of the "K.C."

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         What!

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Garvey)
                         What do you mean -- claims to have? -- 
                         You saw it, didn't you?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (before Garvey can 
                              answer)
                         You can't hold us to account for 
                         every promise made by that man. 
                         Everyone knows he wasn't responsible 
                         for his actions half the time. And 
                         if you think I'd have you as a foreman --

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (finds it hard to 
                              control himself)
                         Listen, lady -- I'd rather walk for 
                         somebody else, than ride for you.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (taken aback)
                         Well -- the impudence --

                                     ROCKLIN
                         All I come for this morning was to 
                         pay beck the hundred and fifty Red 
                         Caldwell sent in advance.

                                     CLARA
                         Oh, no

               They all turn and stare at her.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Don't interfere, Clara. Of course he 
                         must pay it back.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         The railway fare -- well, I reckon 
                         we can check that up against the 
                         time lost and call it quits.
                              (throws down a roll 
                              of bills in front of 
                              Garvey)

                                     CLARA
                              (summoning up her 
                              courage)
                         But, Mr. -- er -- I don't know your 
                         name...

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (raising his hat)
                         Rocklin, miss.

                                     CLARA
                         Mr. Rocklin, it isn't fair for you 
                         to pay anything back.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That's how I'd prefer it, If you 
                         don't mind, miss -- never did care 
                         fer owing favors to no one -- 
                         especially women.

                                     CLARA
                              (as if she had been 
                              struck)
                         Oh!

               The sound of rapid steps approaching from outside is heard 
               and they all look toward the door.

               MED. SHOT

               on door, as it opens to admit Arly. Ignoring everyone in the 
               room except Garvey, she comes abruptly to the desk, with the 
               riding quirt dangling from her wrist.

                                     ARLY
                         I've just heard they let George Clews 
                         out of penitentiary and that he's 
                         headed this way. You might tell him 
                         from me, if he sets foot on the Santee 
                         Ranch, I'll shoot him on sight.

                                     GARVEY
                         But really, Miss Arly, why should 
                         you deliver your message through me?

                                     ARLY
                         You have mutual friends.

                                     GARVEY
                         If you're referring to Sheriff 
                         Jackson...

                                     ARLY
                         I am.

                                     GARVEY
                         But that's absurd. The fact that he 
                         employs one of the Clews brothers 
                         doesn't make the other his friend.

                                     ARLY
                              (contemptuously)
                         Have it your own way; but it'd be 
                         fair to warn him, because I mean it.

               For the first time, she appears to be conscious of the 
               presence of the other women.

                                     GARVEY
                              (hastening to change 
                              the conversation)
                         Oh, Miss Caldwell, this is Miss 
                         Harolday -- Miss Martin, Miss 
                         Caldwell's aunt. You should know one 
                         another, seeing you'll be neighbors. 
                         Miss Harolday runs the Santee Ranch 
                         for her stepfather. She's a famous -- 
                         ah -- horsewoman in these parts.

                                     CLARA
                              (with ingenuous 
                              enthusiasm)
                         I know. I saw you ride into town 
                         this morning. You looked lovely. 
                         Just what I'd like to be.

               Arly stares at her unbelievingly for a second.

                                     ARLY
                              (slowly, a bit 
                              flustered)
                         Yes?

               She looks slowly from Clara to Rocklin, as if suspecting 
               collusion.

                                     CLARA
                              (completely innocent)
                         Oh, this is Mr. Rocklin. He drove us 
                         in from Garden City last night. He...

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (dead pan)
                         I already met Miss Harolday.

                                     CLARA
                         Oh.

                                     ARLY
                              (stonily, to Rocklin)
                         I've a message for you -- from 
                         Harolday.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (murmuring)
                         What, again?

                                     ARLY
                         He wants you to come down to the 
                         office.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         What for?

                                     ARLY
                         He's got a proposition to make -- 
                         about riding for him. Sixty a month.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Hmmm -- That's a foreman's wages.

                                     ARLY
                              (suddenly exploding)
                         I wouldn't offer you a red cent.
                              (controlling herself)
                         But it's his money.
                              (bitingly)
                         And the way things are shaping, maybe 
                         we could do with somebody as mean as 
                         you around the ranch.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (pushing her way 
                              forward)
                         I warn you, you're making a great 
                         mistake. This man is no good.

                                     CLARA
                         Auntie!

                                     ARLY
                              (to Rocklin ignoring 
                              Miss Martin)
                         Well? D'you want the job?

               CLOSE SHOT

               Rocklin, as he stares at Arly with an enigmatic expression. 
               Suddenly, he seems to make up his mind.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (indicating the door)
                         Lead the way.

               MED. SHOT

               as Arly turns abruptly on her heel and exits the way she 
               came. Rocklin makes a little gesture to the ladies with his 
               hat and follows. As he goes, Juan, who has been leaning 
               against the doorpost, follows, closing the door behind him.

                                     CLARA
                              (after they have gone)
                         Auntie, why did you have to say that? 
                         I simply don't understand you...

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (cutting in, grimly)
                         But I understand you.
                              (scathingly)
                         I'd be ashamed of myself. Throwing 
                         myself at a man like that.

                                     CLARA
                         I... I...
                              (suddenly bursting 
                              into tears)
                         Oh, you're horrid -- horrid. I wish 
                         I'd never come.

               She turns abruptly and drops onto the couch by the window. 

               CAMERA PANS TO HOLD A CLOSE TWO SHOT of Garvey and Miss 
               Martin.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         You must excuse her. She's young.

                                     GARVEY
                         And inexperienced.

               Garvey leans back in his chair and smiles.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (significantly)
                         And young people must be protected 
                         from themselves at times -- don't 
                         you agree?

               Miss Martin throws him a quick look, which he returns 
               steadily.

                                     GARVEY
                              (at last, with a grim 
                              echo of a smile)
                         Exactly.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY

               Arly and Rocklin walking along the street, not far from 
               Harolday's office. Rocklin glances back toward Julio, who is 
               following a few paces behind them. He rides his horse and is 
               leading Arly's.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Arly, indicating 
                              Julio)
                         Does he always follow you?

                                     ARLY
                              (defiantly)
                         He's not following me -- he's with 
                         me -- he's always with me.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (takes it mildly)
                         Oh -- just an old Indian friend.

                                     ARLY
                              (straight at him)
                         The best friend I've got.

               Rocklin nods, looks back again at Julio, then back to Arly 
               as they go out of shot.

               INT. SANTA INEZ STAGECOACH OFFICE - DAY

               PAINING SHOT -- as Arly comes to from the street, followed 
               by Julio and Rocklin.

                                     ARLY
                              (abruptly to Rocklin)
                         Wait here.

               CAMERA PANS her over to a door marked "PRIVATE," which she 
               opens without knocking.

               INT. HAROLDAY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY

               MED. SHOT as Arly comes through from the outer office toward 
               Harolday, who is seated at desk in f.g. At Arly's abrupt 
               entrance, he looks up, startled.

                                     ARLY
                         I've just hired a man named Rocklin 
                         and said you made me do it. Sixty 
                         dollars and he 'll earn it -- while 
                         he lasts.

               There is a little pause. Harolday's face is completely dead 
               pan. He looks out of the window for a second, then back at 
               Arly.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (quietly)
                         Why did you do it, Arly?

                                     ARLY
                         So I can fire him. I hate him. Clint 
                         and he quarrelled last night. Clint 
                         lied about it and I made a fool of 
                         myself.
                              (nodding toward the 
                              outer office)
                         He's outside now.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (with a little sigh)
                         All right. Send him in.

               Arly goes to the door and opens it.

                                     ARLY
                              (calling)
                         Come in.

               Rocklin comes in and Arly exits without a word, closing the 
               door behind her.

               REVERSE SHOT

               as Rocklin comes from the doorway into f.g. of shot, facing 
               Harolday, who is seated on the far side of the desk.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Mr. Rocklin, what happened between 
                         you and my son last night?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Poker.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Hmmm. About this suggestion of you 
                         working for me.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         It's your suggestion, not mine.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Ye-es. Sixty dollars is big money.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (turning to go)
                         If you've changed your mind...

                                     HAROLDAY
                         No, no.... Wait a minute. I take it 
                         you've had the experience.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Enough for Red Caldwell to hire me 
                         as foreman.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Oh -- had Caldwell hired you?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Yeah -- but I won't ride for the new 
                         owners -- so that leaves me open.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         I see -- Were you a friend of Red's?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         No -- I guess he just heard about 
                         me.

               A sudden clatter of feet is heard and all eyes turn toward 
               the door.

               MED. SHOT

               as Dave, followed by Arly and Juan, bursts in. His eyes go 
               around the room quickly until he finds Rocklin.

                                     DAVE
                              (as excited as a 
                              schoolboy)
                         George Clews is in town. He's seen 
                         what you done to Bob and he's a-
                         lookin' for you.

               They all look quickly toward the window.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

               LONG SHOT -- from stagecoach office window. The center of 
               the street is clear and men's heads are peering from doorways.

               INT. HAROLDAY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY

               MED. SHOT -- group at window, looking into street.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         The street is clear.

               Dave turns and looks curiously at Rocklin, who frowns 
               impatiently.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Dave irritably)
                         Tell him I'll be out in the street 
                         in front of the saloon.

                                     DAVE
                              (dashing out, radiant)
                         Uh-huh!

               INT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               The place is quite full and the atmosphere is one of 
               expectancy despite the outward casualness of the patrons. A 
               group lolls near the window, looking toward the stage office. 
               At the door a couple of customers peer out over the swinging 
               doors. The bar supports other customers engaged in various 
               private conversations but all are mindful of the presence of 
               George Clews who, with his brother, Bob, stands at the bar's 
               center, morosely toying with a glass of whisky in front of 
               him. He is quite conscious of the subtle glances of the 
               others, but regards them all with disdain. He downs his drink, 
               and speaks his thought to Bob.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                         I'm gonna get his ears.

               Suddenly Old Dave appears in a high state of excitement, and 
               halts with the swinging doors half open.

                                     DAVE
                              (loudly)
                         Hi you, George Clews --

               George Clews turns.

                                     DAVE
                         Rocklin says if you don't come out, 
                         he'll come in here after you, an' 
                         tear you apart.

               George Clews frowns. His eye catches sight of a king-size 
               glass of beer being slid across the bar to Shorty Davis, 
               standing alongside him. That quick, Clews beats Shorty to 
               the glass and hurls it at Dave, who ducks out. Cap, 
               anticipating trouble, brings a sawed-off shotgun up from 
               under the bar and now watches Clews and Shorty.

                                     SHORTY
                              (taps Clews)
                         That was my beer, you know.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (nastily)
                         If he comes in again -- I'll throw 
                         you.

               Before Shorty can reply, Clews yanks his hat down over the 
               little fellow's eyes, and gives him a backward shove that 
               sends him sprawling into a corner where we leave him 
               struggling to get his hat off. The crowd resents this, but 
               doesn't dare do anything, except Cap, who holds his shotgun 
               in sight.

                                     CAP
                              (to the Clews)
                         That does it, boys -- you know where 
                         the door is.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (to Bob)
                         Com-mon -- I'll get his ears.

                                     CAP
                         Not until I get my money --

               George and Bob Clews are now a few steps from the bar. They 
               have turned as Cap spoke and are looking at the shotgun.

                                     CAP
                         There's three drinks and a broken 
                         beer glass.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (to Bob, after a 
                              second's deliberation)
                         Pay 'im.

               George turns and starts for the doors as Bob comes back to 
               the bar to settle up.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                         I'll get his ears.

               ON PAP FOSSLER AND THE OTHERS AT WINDOW - AS GEORGE CLEWS 
               BURSTS OUT THROUGH THE DOORS

                                     PAP
                              (quietly)
                         That Rocklin'll kill him for sure.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Le's hope.

               EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               As George Clews steps outside, a mangy mongrel dog, basking 
               close by, evidently recognizes him and tails it away, leaving 
               George blinking at him.

               LONG SHOT

               Rocklin -- FROM George's ANGLE. He is walking slowly forward 
               down the middle of the street.

               MED. SHOT

               George, looking baffled by the steady approach.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (yelling)
                         I'm coming -- and you'd better run!

               He steps down from the sidewalk into the street and then 
               stands still again.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Rocklin -- CAMERA MOVING WITH him as he comes slowly and 
               steadily forward.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George. His hands are on his guns, but drunk or not, he has 
               too much sense to draw too soon.

               EXT. STAGECOACH OFFICE - DAY

               MED. SHOT -- Harolday watching from behind the window of his 
               office. Behind Harolday are Julio and Arly. The latter makes 
               a step as if about to move to the door, but Julio restrains 
               her.

               INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               MED. CLOSE SHOT -- as Garvey, Miss Martin and Clara watch 
               the scene below -- Garvey and Miss Martin excitedly and Clara 
               in great distress.

               EXT. HOTEL - DAY

               CLOSER SHOT -- men in hotel doorway, taut with excitement.

               FULL SHOT

               Rocklin -- SHOOTING PAST George, whose hands are on his gun 
               butts. Rocklin's thumbs are hooked in his belt as he continues 
               slowly forward, his eyes fixed on George's.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (quietly)
                         Draw a gun and I'll kill you.

               MED. SHOT

               George, as he stands bewildered and open- mouthed. Rocklin 
               enters scene, suddenly whips out his gun and brings it 
               crashing down alongside George's head. The barrel strikes 
               though the crown of his hat and he goes down like a pole-
               axed steer.

               INT. HAROLDAY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY

               MED. CLOSE SHOT -- group at window. Arly gives an involuntary 
               exclamation of pleasure, which she instantly checks, then 
               she moves abruptly out of shot, followed by Juan. Harolday 
               continues to stare frowningly out of the window.

               INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               MED. CLOSE SHOT -- group at window, with Garvey obviously 
               disapponted, Miss Martin bridling and Clara showing obvious 
               relief.

               EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               MED. SHOT -- Rocklin and crowd as they swirl around him 
               offering congratulations. Dave pushes his way through the 
               crowd and thumps Rocklin on the back in wild enthusiasm. At 
               the same time, the sound of a horse cantering is heard, and 
               Jackson comes into shot.

                                     JACKSON
                              (to Rocklin)
                         Hey, you! What's this you been up 
                         to?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I just laid a gun barrel over the 
                         head of a drunk friend of yours -- 
                         same as you did over Dave's here 
                         yesterday.

                                     DAVE
                              (surprised)
                         Eh?

                                     JACKSON
                              (blustering)
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (calmly)
                         You're a liar!

               He turns contemptuously and begins to move back towards the 
               stage office completely ignoring Jackson, who rides alongside 
               blusteringly.

                                     JACKSON
                         Now you lookee here, young feller. 
                         You go on talking that way and you'll 
                         find yourself in trouble.

               The crowd which has been following now begins to razz him 
               openly. He turns and glares, but without effect. He gives a 
               final shout to Rocklin.

                                     JACKSON
                         Don't say you ain't been warned.

               Pulling his horse around, he sets off in a lope up the street.

               MED. SHOT

               as Miss Martin comes along the street, determinedly, followed 
               by Clara, until she is face to face with Rocklin outside the 
               stage office where Arly and Juan are mounted ready to move 
               off.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (ignoring everyone 
                              but Rocklin)
                         I saw you. I saw you strike that 
                         poor man.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Yes, ma'am. As hard as I could.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         You ruffian, you!

               Clara pulls her sleeve imploringly.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Let me go!
                              (to Rocklin)
                         I knew the sort you were the moment 
                         I set eyes on you. You can't fool 
                         me! You're nothing but a common 
                         adventurer! Come, Clara!

               She takes Clara by the arm and sweeps past them towards the 
               hotel. Rocklin looks after them with a grim expression and 
               then up at Arly, who has been listening intently. She returns 
               his look steadily for a second. Then, with a mocking smile, 
               she wheels the mare and canters out of shot, followed by 
               Juan. He looks after her for a second; then with the same 
               grim look, enters Harolday's office.

               INT. HAROLDAY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Harolday is standing at the window, looking toward the door, 
               having seen Rocklin approaching. The door opens and Rocklin 
               enters and resumes his conversation as though it were hardly 
               interrupted.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         -- Now what was that you were sayin' 
                         about Caldwell?

                                     HAROLDAY
                         You being hired by Red Caldwell only 
                         confirms what I'd suspected -- he 
                         was getting ready to fight.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (trying to get 
                              information)
                         Fight? Who?

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Organized rustling. Well at least -- 
                         that's my belief. Red was no friend 
                         of mine. Too fond of taking the law 
                         into his own hands. But he had my 
                         sympathy. He'd been harder hit than 
                         any of us. And on top of it all, he 
                         lost his foreman.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You mean, he quit on him?

                                     HAROLDAY
                         He was shot -- in the back -- with a 
                         bullet from the same caliber rifle 
                         as got Red.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Got any ideas?

                                     HAROLDAY
                         No -- Except that the man you just 
                         pistol-whipped is in on it somewhere.
                              (bitterly)
                         Pity you didn't kill him when you 
                         had the chance.

               Rocklin realizes that maybe Harolday is trying to throw a 
               curve -- trying to get him to talk.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Say -- it don't sound as if it's 
                         goin' to be too easy for them wimmen 
                         at the K.C.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (watching him keenly)
                         Want to go back and work for them?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         No, sir. And I ain't jumping at this 
                         offer o' yours either because I don't 
                         hold with working for wimmen.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (quickly)
                         Oh, you mean my step-daughter. Well 
                         don't worry. She won't interfere 
                         with you...Rocklin -- I figure we've 
                         been losin' cattle over a place called 
                         Table Top -- it's the back way into 
                         the Topaz Ranch and the perfect route 
                         for rustlers -- I'm going to send 
                         you up to the line camp -- you don't 
                         mind working a lone hand -- do you?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (measuring)
                         -- I like workin' that way.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (rising and holding 
                              out a hand)
                         Good -- be ready to move out this 
                         afternoon.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY

               On Dave and Pap Fossler engaged in conversation in front of 
               Pap's store. In the b.g. -- across the street, we carry the 
               entrance to the Sun-Up Saloon.

                                     DAVE
                              (in his best sales 
                              talk)
                         -- now Pap -- I'm givin' you first 
                         call on me services. They's lots of 
                         other folks lookin' fer a good man, 
                         too -- you know. So if you want me, 
                         you better hurry and speak up because --

               During Dave's speech Rocklin has come from the Sun-up carrying 
               his valise. He pauses a moment, looking around. Dave sees 
               him.

                                     DAVE
                         'scuse me, Pap -- Be right back to 
                         find out when I start.

               He hurries across the street toward Rocklin.

               EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               On Rocklin just stepping off the curb. Dave comes in to him.

                                     DAVE
                         Whar you off to?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I'm riding for the Topaz Ranch.

               They start across the street, slowly toward the stage office.

                                     DAVE
                         What! -- Have you gone plumb loco?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Good money -- sixty a month

                                     DAVE
                         There ain't enough money in this 
                         town to make it worth your while to 
                         work for that gal.

               Rocklin gives Dave a quizzical look, which Dave mistakes for 
               weakening.

                                     DAVE
                         When she gits goin' she can be 
                         meaner'n a skillet full o' snakes. 
                         She ain't goin' to forget the way 
                         you made a fool of her today -- in 
                         front of the whole town.

                                     PAP FOSSLER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Hey, Dave.

                                     DAVE
                         Be right with you.
                              (to Rocklin)
                         It's pizen that's what it is -- jus' 
                         plain --- What you want to hang around 
                         this town for anyways? --

               Dave and Rocklin have reached middle of the street. Pap 
               Fossler's voice comes again from o.s.

                                     PAP FOSSLER'S VOICE
                         Hey, Dave.

               Dave reacts with a squint in Pap's direction. He runs out 
               toward Pap, but would rather stay with Rocklin. THE CAMERA 
               FOLLOWS Rocklin ACROSS the street To the stage office, where 
               see Arly and Tala sitting on their horses apparently waiting 
               for Rocklin. A third horse is standing by with Rocklin's 
               saddle on it.

               Rocklin, upon reaching the front of the stage office, pauses 
               a moment, to look over the horse carrying his saddle -- 
               glances up to Arly.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Be right with you.

               He goes into the stage of office, as we

                                                               DISSOLVE OUT

               DISSOLVE IN

               EXT. FORKED ROAD - DAY

               LONG SHOT -- as Rocklin, Arly and Juan canter along a dirt 
               road over open country with the mountain ranges in the 
               distance.

               CAMERA PANS to show a buggy on the road ahead, approaching a 
               wooded dell where the road divides.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               of the buggy, showing Miss Martin riding in front, beside 
               Shorty Davis, who is driving, and Clara with her back to the 
               driver, facing the oncoming trio. Miss Martin hears the sound 
               of the approaching horses, and looks over her shoulder.

               MED. SHOT

               Arly, Juan and Rocklin, with Miss Martin in F.g. The latter 
               scowls and looks quickly to her front as the riders draw 
               level with the buggy, Rocklin coining to the right, alongside 
               Clara.

                                     CLARA
                         Good afternoon, Mr. Rocklin.
                              (looking at the sky)
                         Lovely day, isn't it?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Reckon it is pretty nice. So you're 
                         moving in on the "K.C." eh?

                                     CLARA
                              (hesitating and 
                              throwing a look toward 
                              Miss Martin)
                         We-el, not exactly moving in. You 
                         see...

               MED. SHOT

               with Miss Martin in f.g. and SHOOTING OVER her shoulder to 
               include Clara and Rocklin.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (acidly, locking 
                              straight ahead)
                         Do you have to discuss our private 
                         affairs with every rag-tag-and-bobtail 
                         cow-person we meet, Clara?

                                     CLARA
                              (in a low voice)
                         Auntie!

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Sorry if I butted in, ma'am. Jest 
                         passing the time o'day.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         We can do very well without it -- 
                         thank you.
                              (with a look over her 
                              shoulder)
                         And you're keeping your lady friend 
                         waiting.

               Rocklin looks quickly in the same direction.

               MED. SHOT

               from Rocklin's ANGLE, with Arly and Juan at the fork in the 
               road. They are looking back towards the buggy which has taken 
               the lower road to the right of the copse.

               REVERSE SHOT

               with Arly and Juan in f.g. and the buggy in the distance. 
               Rocklin raises his hat to the women in the buggy and canters 
               back to Arly, who has been watching with a peculiar 
               expression.

                                     ARLY
                              (coldly)
                         I thought maybe you'd changed your 
                         mind again.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (cheerfully)
                         Nope.

               She looks at him angrily for a second as if about to say 
               something sarcastic. Then, repressing herself, she wheels 
               her horse and canters off along the side of the copse. Rocklin 
               throws an amused glance, at Juan, who has been watching with 
               an enigmatic expression. He returns Rocklin's look with a 
               stern, menacing frown. Then, with a gentle flick of the rein, 
               he urges his horse after Arly. Completely baffled, Rocklin 
               scratches his head for a second, then follows.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. RANCH HOUSE - SANTEE RANCH - LATE AFTERNOON

               MED. SHOT -- as the three canter up the driveway to a smart-
               looking ranch house. Arly dismounts and throws her reins to 
               Juan.

                                     ARLY
                              (over her shoulder to 
                              Rocklin)
                         Juan'll show you the bunkhouse. I'll 
                         talk to you about your duties in the 
                         morning.

               Before Rocklin can speak, she runs quickly up the steps of 
               the verandah and disappears into the house. Leading Arly's 
               Horse, Juan moves out of shot to the left of the ranch house 
               and Rocklin follows.

               EXT. CORRAL - SANTEE RANCH - LATE AFTERNOON

               MED. SHOT -- as Juan comes into shot leading the mare, 
               followed by Rocklin. They both dismount and begin to off-
               saddle.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         How far is the line-camp at Table-
                         Top?

                                     JUAN
                         Twenty-five -- thirty mile.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I'm moving out there first thing in 
                         the morning.
                              (as Juan turns and 
                              stares)
                         Boss' orders. Care to show me the 
                         way?

               There is a moment's pause. Then, what almost amounts to a 
               smile of relief, crosses Juan's face.

                                     JUAN
                         I will show you.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. SANTEE RANCH - DAY

               LONG SHOT -- as Rocklin and Juan ride out from the ranch 
               through the early morning mist and turn off in the direction 
               of the distant line of mountains.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO CANYON - DAY

               LONG SHOT -- as the two leave the open country and enter the 
               mouth of a steep and narrow gorge at the foot of the mountain 
               range.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Juan pulls up and dismounts, followed by Rocklin.

                                     JUAN
                              (pointing ahead)
                         The trail is straight ahead. You 
                         will find the cabin at the top.
                              (turning back to his 
                              horse)
                         Adios, Senor.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (challenging, but 
                              perfectly friendly)
                         Senor Romerez, it appears that you 
                         do not like me.

               For a second Juan does not reply. Then, as he speaks, he 
               takes a tobacco pouch from his pocket. Rocklin, his mind on 
               other things, does not take particular notice of the pouch, 
               but we cannot help notice the pouch ornament -- a steer's 
               head of hammered silver.

                                     JUAN
                              (during the above 
                              business)
                         Senor, that is true. I do not like 
                         you.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Why?

                                     JUAN
                              (extending the pouch)
                         Permit that I offer you a cigarette.

               Rocklin shakes his head. Juan, having spilled tobacco in a 
               paper, now puts away the pouch and rolls his own.

                                     JUAN
                         It is not your fault that your shadow 
                         is black. But you will only bring 
                         unhappiness to my senorita. I do not 
                         blame you, but I fear I must hate 
                         you.

               He turns abruptly and mounts the waiting horse; then looks 
               down from the saddle.

                                     JUAN
                         Adios, Senor.

               He rides quickly out of the shot.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. TABLE-TOP - DAY

               MED. SHOT -- as Rocklin forces his horse up the last few 
               feet of the steep trail at the top of the canyon, and pulls 
               up at the top of the rise with a look of amazement.

               FULL SHOT - FROM ROCKLIN'S ANGLE

               A rich meadow stretches ahead with a stream running through 
               it, and a cabin at the far end. Steep escarpments surround 
               the lush meadow land, making an idyllic scene. As Rocklin 
               comes slowly into shot with the same look of startled 
               appreciation on his face and begins to move toward the cabin,

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. APPROACH TO SANTEE RANCH - DAY

               LONG SHOT -- of Juan, as he canters across open country toward 
               the ranch.

               CAMERA PANS to include the road from Santa Inez along which 
               approaches a smallish freight wagon, pulled by two horses. 
               As the driver sees Juan and waves his whip, the Mexican 
               swerves from his course and canters toward the wagon.

               MED. SHOT

               wagon, which we now see is being driven by Dave. On the side 
               of the wagon is written: TRANSPORT & GENERAL FREIGHTAGE -- 
               Pap Fossler and Sons. Juan canters into shot and pulls up 
               alongside the wagon.

                                     DAVE
                         Hiya there.

                                     JUAN
                         Buenos dias, Senor Dave.
                              (looking at name on 
                              wagon)
                         You have found new employer, eh?

               DISSOLVE IN

               EXT. TOPAZ RANCH HOUSE - DAY

               Shelley, a Negro servant of the Harolday household, is 
               discovered sweeping the front porch. Behind him we see Clint 
               open the door -- peer furtively out -- then cross the porch 
               to its edge when he looks o.s. as though searching for 
               someone.

               Shelley, meantime, has noticed Clint, but goes right on with 
               his sweeping. His only reaction is a disparaging glance over 
               his shoulder.

                                     CLINT
                              (turning to Shelley)
                         Have you seen Arly?

                                     SHELLEY
                         No, suh, Ah didn't see Miss Arly 
                         today, but Ah seed her las' night, 
                         and she shore was mad.

               To emphasize his point, Shelley puckers his mouth in a 
               whistle.

                                     SHELLEY
                         Plenty mad!

               Clint's face tightens as he anticipates what is in store for 
               him. Over the scene comes the gradually increasing sound of 
               a feminine voice, gayly humming the notes of a popular tune 
               of the period. Clint's strained features relax in a can-that-
               be-Arly expression, while Shelley stops dead in the middle 
               of a sweep, and now both stare incredulously, o.s.

               ANGLE

               From their ANGLE we first see only the corner of the house, 
               while the owner of the voice approaches from the other side. 
               Now Arly comes into view, entirely oblivious of Clint and 
               Shelley watching her. She seems more attractive, in a feminine 
               way, this morning. It may be the skirt and blouse she is 
               wearing. Then again it may be the flower she is, even now, 
               adjusting in her hair. The presence of the two men suddenly 
               startles her. The song ends abruptly, while her hands fall 
               quickly away from the flower.

               ARLY

               As Arly moves toward the porch, Shelley snaps back to life 
               and resumes sweeping -- but furiously. Clint regards the 
               girl in the vague manner of the puzzled gent he is.

                                     CLINT
                              (not too definitely)
                         'Mornin', Arly --

               Arly is coming toward Clint.

                                     ARLY
                              (pleasantly)
                         'Mornin', Clint.

               She steps close to Clint, and he slowly backs up a step, for 
               he does not know she came up to him merely to pick up her 
               jacket lying on the ground near the step.

                                     CLINT
                              (as Arly leans down 
                              to pick up the jacket)
                         You must be feeling pretty good.

               Arly straightens up with the jacket in her hand, and the 
               corner of her mouth curls in a faint smile. She turns now 
               and starts along the walk, and takes only a few steps when 
               Clint comes to her side.

               ARLY AND CLINT WALKING

                                     CLINT
                              (as he joins Arly)
                         Say, Arly -- about that poker game, 
                         night before last, I ---

                                     ARLY
                              (tossing it off)
                         Forget it.

                                     CLINT
                              (did he hear correctly)
                         Forget it?

               Arly pays no attention to Clint. She is looking o.s. and 
               stops walking.

               EXT. GROUNDS NEAR TOPAZ RANCH HOUSE - DAY

               Tala, on his horse, as seen by Arly. Over the scene comes 
               Arly's voice calling from a distance.

                                     ARLY
                              (calling)
                         Tala.

               Tala reacts to the call by heading his horse at a slightly 
               different angle.

               ARLY AND CLINT

               Arly is looking o.s. toward Tala. Clint is now eyeing his 
               sister up and down quite openly. She turns her head now and 
               catches Clint looking her over.

                                     ARLY
                              (after a stilted pause)
                         Well --

                                     CLINT
                              (with a perplexed 
                              smile)
                         What is this? --

               A gesture of his hand indicates the way Arly has gotten 
               herself up. That quick, Arly's hand goes to the flower in 
               her hair. And, that quick, she guiltily withdraws it.

                                     ARLY
                              (bravely nonchalant)
                         What do you mean?

                                     CLINT
                         What do I mean? --

               Before he can explain, Tala pulls up in his horse and we 
               hear his voice over the scene.

                                     TALA'S VOICE
                         Good morning, Arliete.

               ARLY, TALA AND CLINT

               Tala sitting astride his horse smiles down at the girl.

                                     ARLY
                         Good morning, Tala.

                                     TALA
                         You have make yourself very pretty 
                         today.

               Arly is jolted by Tala's innocent remark, and she can't help 
               giving Clint a little side glance in the way of reaction. 
               Clint has not missed Tala's crack nor Arly's glance, and 
               when she gives it to him he says:

                                     CLINT
                              (pleasantly)
                         See what I mean?

               He tosses her an altogether knowing look now, and leaves, 
               going up the walk toward the house. Arly turns to Tala.

                                     ARLY
                         Have my horse saddled and sent around 
                         right away -- will you?
                              (then as a casual 
                              afterthought)
                         You can have that Rocklin bring it.

               She glances over her shoulder toward Clint going up the walk. 
               And then, looking back to Tala, finds he hasn't moved, but 
               remains smiling down at her.

                                     ARLY
                         What's the matter?

                                     TALA
                              (easily)
                         Rocklin is not here.

                                     ARLY
                              (breathlessly)
                         He quit?

                                     TALA
                         He has gone to the line camp at Table 
                         Top.

                                     ARLY
                         What?

                                     TALA
                         It was Mr. Harolday's orders.

               Arly looks away. Her eyes stare blankly into space as she 
               struggles with the mixed emotions of anger and disappointment. 
               Tala, aware of her plight, slowly dismounts and comes to the 
               girl's side.

                                     TALA
                              (in a fatherly manner)
                         Why do you make your heart heavy 
                         with thoughts of him, little one. -- 
                         He is not for you.

                                     ARLY
                              (bitterly)
                         Be quiet.

                                     TALA
                         He has made the choice, Arliete. 
                         With your own eyes you saw it 
                         yesterday.

                                     ARLY
                              (impatiently)
                         Oh --

                                     TALA
                         And she, too, has opened her heart 
                         to him -- Already she has summoned 
                         him to her.

                                     ARLY
                              (this turns her around)
                         What do you mean?

                                     TALA
                         Dave -- of the white beard -- carries 
                         a letter to Rocklin -- It is from 
                         her.

                                     ARLY
                         How do you know that?

                                     TALA
                         I have just now met Dave, and he 
                         tell me. -- So now he rides to Table 
                         Top.

               Arly is quiet a moment.

                                     TALA
                         Little one you --

                                     ARLY
                              (quickly, as she starts 
                              for the house)
                         Oh, leave me alone.

               LONG SHOT

               entrance to ranch. Entering the driveway from the direction 
               of Santa Inez, comes Harolday, still looking the distinguished 
               citizen.

               HAROLDAY RIDES UP TO THE PORCH - CLOSE TO ARLY AND JULIO

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Good morning, Julio -- morning Arly.
                              (to Julio as he 
                              dismounts)
                         Fetch my briefcase -- it's on my 
                         desk.

               Julio exits.

               HAROLDAY TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO ARLY WHO

               still smarting under the disappointment about Rocklin, seems 
               lost in thought. After regarding her a moment Harolday speaks.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Looks like we're going to get that 
                         land we've been wanting along the 
                         river bottom.

               Arly turns her eyes on Harolday, who continues.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         I didn't tell you -- but I bought 
                         the mortgage on the Hardman ranch, 
                         and it's due today -- On my way over 
                         there now.

               Arly's eyes burn as she tosses her head slightly.

                                     ARLY
                         Did you send that Rocklin to Table-
                         Top?

                                     HAROLDAY
                         I did.

                                     ARLY
                              (furiously)
                         Well, let's get things straight. 
                         This place was my mother's -- now 
                         it's mine and Clint's -- It's true 
                         you've been helping out -- but the 
                         way things are going we'll soon be 
                         able to pay you back every penny we 
                         owe. Meanwhile, I'm running this 
                         outfit and I expect to give the 
                         orders.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         You generally do.

                                     ARLY
                         Why did you send Rocklin up to Table-
                         Top?

                                     HAROLDAY
                         It seemed to me a good idea -- what 
                         with all this rustling going on --

                                     ARLY
                         Who'd ever try driving cattle over 
                         Table-Top? -- Unless they were crazy.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (coldly)
                         I don't agree with you. In any case -- 
                         if you must have it -- I'd no 
                         intention of engaging a man at 
                         foreman's wages just to gratify the 
                         whims of a jealous woman!

                                     ARLY
                              (dangerously)
                         You take care what you're saying.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (very controlled)
                         It's you should take care, my dear. 
                         I'm afraid there's one man you can't 
                         rawhide into jumping the way you 
                         want. You've made a fool of yourself 
                         over him once. Better watch out you 
                         don't do it again.

               He turns abruptly and walks off the verandah.

               MED. SHOT

               as Harolday comes from the verandah to his horse. Juan is 
               standing there with the briefcase which Harolday takes with 
               a yank, mounts his horse and rides out.

               The CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on Arly, who stands in furious 
               silence watching Harolday ride away.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN

               EXT. CANYON ROAD ON THE WAY TO TABLE-TOP - DUSK

               Old Dave is jogging along in his wagon. A rumble of thunder 
               echoes through the canyon. Dave reacts with a look toward 
               the sky.

               SHOT

               of storm clouds gathering.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD NEAR TABLE-TOP - DUSK

               A night shot of the mountain road near Table-Top. It is a 
               wooded section of the plateau, and occasional flashes of 
               lightning illuminate the big trees skirting the road. Dave, 
               in his wagon, looms out of the b.g., and as he nears the 
               camera we hear him urging the team through the downpour. As 
               he passes and continues hurriedly on his way, we

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN

               INT. CABIN - NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT on a soiled and wrinkled envelope lying on a table. 
               It is addressed to:

                               Mr. Rocklin c/o Santee Ranch

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK and Rocklin is revealed at the table, 
               looking down at the letter. His hat is tipped back on his 
               head, and his sleeves are rolled up. He is mixing dough in a 
               bowl sitting on the table near the letter, and his hands are 
               all gooey. Dave is discovered in front of the fireplace where 
               his outer shirt and socks are drying. It is dark outside, 
               but the storm has abated. Rocklin goes to a shelf near the 
               fireplace to get a pan.

                                     DAVE
                              (during the above)
                         Durn funny -- that storm quittin' 
                         just about the time I get here.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         No funnier than you sloggin' through 
                         it, just to deliver a letter from a 
                         woman.

                                     DAVE
                              (disgustedly)
                         Reckon I'm gettin' to be more of a 
                         fool the older I get.

               Dave watches Rocklin at the table shaping the dough for 
               biscuits and putting it in the pan.

                                     DAVE
                         When are we gonna get around to 
                         readin' it?

               Rocklin cannot help smiling a bit at the way Dave includes 
               himself in.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Thought I'd wait till mornin' -- 
                         might be bad news an' I wouldn't be 
                         able to sleep.

               Dave screws up his face in utter disgust and turns his 
               attention to his drying clothes.

               Rocklin, meanwhile, takes a flour sack from the table, wipes 
               the dough from his hands and picks up the letter. He goes 
               over to the fireplace, opening the letter the while, and 
               sits on the bench. Dave, seeing this, edges discreetly around 
               in back of Rocklin in order to see over his shoulder.

               The letter open, Rocklin takes out a roll of bills along 
               with the folded message. He lays the envelope on the bench.

                                     DAVE
                         Mmmm -- dineroo.

               Rocklin places the money in his shirt pocket for the moment, 
               and opens the folded message.

               LETTER. It begins with the usual Dear Mr. Rocklin.

               Rocklin's voice is heard over the insert as he reads from 
               here.

                                     ROCKLIN'S VOICE
                              (reading)
                         Forgive me if this letter is a trifle 
                         incoherent, but I am terribly worried 
                         and unhappy.

               BACK TO SCENE.

                                     DAVE
                         Who wouldn't be -- livin' with that 
                         ole screech owl.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (continues to read)
                         I am desperately in need of help and 
                         advice from someone whom I feel I 
                         can trust, and I am appealing to 
                         you, because I regard you in the 
                         same way my Uncle surely must have. 
                         I heartily dislike and distrust Judge 
                         Garvey --

                                     DAVE
                              (interrupting)
                         Huh -- Smart girl --

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (going on)
                         But my Aunt seems to have suddenly 
                         revised her opinion of him, and now 
                         wants me to place all my affairs in 
                         the Judge's hands and return east. 
                         Such is certainly not my wish.

                                     DAVE
                              (significantly)
                         Looks kinda like she's formed an 
                         attachment.

               Rocklin glares up to Dave.

                                     DAVE
                              (quickly)
                         For the locality, I mean.

                                     ROCKLIN

                         I wanted so much to give ranch life 
                         a trial, but fear circumstances are 
                         against me, especially in view of 
                         the recent Indian trouble --

                         Indian trouble --
                              (in normal tone)
                         Good Lord, they ain't been any Indian 
                         trouble around here in --

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (caustically)
                         You want to hear the rest of this?

                                     DAVE
                              (getting the inference)
                         Might's well -- come this far.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (reading)
                         I want to apologize for what took 
                         place this afternoon. And I am 
                         returning the 150, because I feel it 
                         is rightfully yours. You must take 
                         it. Faithfully yours, Clara Caldwell.

               The letter finished, Rocklin regards it a moment, then slowly 
               returns it to the envelope as he gazes thoughtfully into the 
               fire.

               Dave meantime straightens up -- scratches his shaggy top, 
               and turns his attention once more to his drying clothes.

                                     DAVE
                              (feeling his socks)
                         Well -- what do you make of it?

               Rocklin continues looking into the fire as he lays the letter 
               back on the bench and takes out tobacco to roll a cigarette.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Somebody's sure bustin' to get her 
                         out of there.

               Dave sits alongside Rocklin and begins putting on his socks.

                                     DAVE
                         Indian trouble --

                              (after a pause)
                         Wonder why the old lady's playin' 
                         along?

                                     DAVE

                         'em?
                              (pause)
                         Got to admit though, I feel a mite 
                         sorry for the young'un -- nice little 
                         tyke.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Too nice for this country.

                                     DAVE
                              (after a slight pause)
                         She's shore a pretty thing.

               Rocklin has been mulling things over.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Don't know how I could help her -- 
                         even if I wanted to -- I don't know 
                         any thing about this Garvey -- or 
                         Caldwell -- or --

                                     DAVE
                         Well, now -- I could mebbe help you 
                         out some, there -- Fact, I could 
                         tell you somethin' 'bout ole Red 
                         that might be interestin'.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You must have known him pretty well -- 
                         What kind of a man was he?

               Rocklin goes to the table and resumes molding biscuits.

               Dave has his boots on and is putting on his outer shirt.

                                     DAVE
                         Caldwell? -- The best -- cantankerous 
                         cuss -- but a real cowman, believe 
                         me -- He was a big feller, like 
                         yourself -- Fact, you coulda passed 
                         fer a blood relation, come to think 
                         of it.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (casually, as he busies 
                              himself with the 
                              biscuits)
                         Was the Judge and Red friends?

                                     DAVE
                              (anigmatically)
                         That's what you'd say. Garvey managed 
                         all Red's business. Besides which 
                         they was regular drinkin' pals -- 
                         played poker together most nights -- 
                         tho' they do say Red got the worst 
                         of it.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Red was a gambler, eh?

                                     DAVE
                         Oh, yeah -- reckon a pretty poor 
                         one, tho' -- still you'd say him and 
                         Garvey was friends.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (after a side glance 
                              to Dave)
                         Anything ever happen to make you 
                         think they weren't?

                                     DAVE
                              (moves close to Rocklin)
                         Rock -- I'm gonna tell you somethin' 
                         I ain't never told anybody.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (with a slight smile)
                         Think you can trust me?

               Dave grimaces his confidence.

                                     DAVE
                         The last time I seen Red was the day 
                         he died --

               In the pause Rocklin remains silent.

                                     DAVE
                         -- 'Twas in town -- he jus' come out 
                         of the stage office. Tried to book 
                         passage to Garden City but couldn't 
                         on account I had a full load. -- 
                         Well, sir, he took me aside and give 
                         me a printed sheet of paper and says, 
                         "Read it." I looked it over and fer 
                         as I could see it was a paper from 
                         one of them Chicago sportin' firms, 
                         tellin' how to manipulate trick 
                         playin' cards.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Marked cards.

                              (nods)
                         Reckon so. -- Seems Red found some 
                         cards and this paper in a coat one 
                         of his friends loaned him one night.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Whose was it?

                                     DAVE
                         Well, now that's just what I asked -- 
                         but all he said, was that it belonged 
                         to a good friend. Then he said he 
                         wasn't waitin' fer the next coach, 
                         but was ridin' over to see the 
                         district judge about it alone.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That's when they got him.

                                     DAVE
                         Yes, sir -- 'bout a mile or so from 
                         Stan's place. A bullet in the back 
                         an' his pockets empty.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         How come you never told this before?

                                     DAVE
                         Who was there to tell? -- Sheriff 
                         Jackson? -- Him an' Garvey's thick 
                         as thieves.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         How about what's his name -- Harolday? -- 
                         He's no friend of the Judge's, is 
                         he?

                                     DAVE
                         Hates his guts -- sure riles him to 
                         see young Clint hangin' onto the 
                         Judge's coattails. All the same, I 
                         jus' decided to keep my mouth shut 
                         and my eyes open.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (after a pause)
                         Even if it was Garvey Red was talkin' 
                         about -- it don't follow that he 
                         killed him.

                                     DAVE
                         No -- general opinion is that it was 
                         rustlers.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Why would rustlers take the evidence 
                         Caldwell had with him?

               Rocklin moves away to a large earthen jug holding water as 
               Dave talks.

                                     DAVE
                         Looks to me if you get the man who 
                         owned the marked cards, you get the 
                         killer.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (drinking)
                         Funny tho' -- first the K.C. foreman -- 
                         then Caldwell -- an' now these women.

                                     DAVE
                         Lordy -- you ain't thinkin' somebody 
                         might try bumpin' them?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (slowly, to himself)
                         I'm not so sure somebody hasn't tried 
                         already --
                              (to Dave)
                         Remember, when we stopped to change 
                         horses on the way Over from Garden 
                         City --

                                     DAVE
                         Shore -- you told me how Jackson and 
                         Clews tried to frame Stan.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (nods)
                         Yeah. Like they wanted to be sure 
                         he'd keep his mouth shut about 
                         something.

               Dave sits down on a box sitting against the wall, directly 
               under the large earthen jug of water.

                                     DAVE
                         And layin' that gun across my skull -- 
                         an' offerin' to drive the coach 
                         themselves.

               A SECTION OF THE CLEARING - MOONLIGHT

               A dark, mysterious figure on a horse raises his rifle --

               INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT

               SHOT.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (nods)
                         It was almost as if --

               A shot splinters the windowpane and shatters the earthen jug 
               on the shelf directly above Dave's head. The contents pour 
               down on Dave and he topples over. Rocklin meanwhile has wiped 
               the lantern off the table and ducked. They are both on the 
               floor in the faint glow coming from the fireplace.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (going to Dave)
                         You all right?

                                     DAVE
                              (blustering)
                         Will be if I ever get dry.

               Rocklin takes off his hat and puts his finger through two 
               holes drilled by the bullet.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Lookit that --

                                     DAVE
                         Good Lord --

               Rocklin puts the hat aside -- crawls over to his gun belt -- 
               straps it on.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Come on --

               He opens the door cautiously. Then sneaks out, followed by 
               Dave.

               EXT. OF CABIN - MOONLIGHT - AFTER THE STORM

               Rocklin and Dave stand close to the cabin, just clear of the 
               door, tensely scanning the surrounding darkness.

               Water can be heard dripping from the cabin roof, and an owl 
               hoots in a near-by tree.

               The sound of neighing horses comes from the direction of the 
               corral. Both men re-act.

                                     DAVE
                         My team.

               Almost immediately the neighing is repeated, but this time 
               from another direction entirely -- and from a distance.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That's not your team.

               He moves to the corner of the cabin, followed by Dave.

               HORSE IS STOMPING NERVOUSLY

               and now it starts away, galloping through the deep grass at 
               the edge of the clearing. Only the lower part of the animal 
               is seen, along with the legs of the rider.

               ROCKLIN AND DAVE HEAR THE SOUND OF RETREATING HOOF BEATS

               And they can barely make out their quarry riding hell-bent 
               toward the deep blackness of the trees.

               Rocklin fires and runs out into the moonlight in the clearing -- 
               Dave close behind.

               Rocklin halts -- fires again -- and again. Dave fires.

               The mysterious rider is now swallowed by the night.

               Dave starts after him again. Looking back, he sees Rocklin 
               has not moved.

                                     DAVE
                         Come on --

                                     ROCKLIN
                         No use -- he's gone.

                                     DAVE
                         Mebbe we winged him.

               He starts through the wet grass alone. Rocklin turns back 
               toward the cabin.

               DAVE - PLOUGHING THROUGH THE GRASS

               He has reached the edge of the clearing where a slight 
               embankment leads to the level of the trees. He is just 
               starting up to higher ground when his eyes catch something 
               on the embankment, shining in the moonlight. It proves to be 
               a tobacco pouch bearing a steer's head of hammered sliver. 
               It is dry, so has evidently just been dropped. Dave pockets 
               it, and proceeds warily along the mystery rider's trail.

               ROCLKLIN - WHO HAS JUST ABOUT REACHED THE CABIN

               He looks back in Dave's direction, and then looking toward 
               the cabin, suddenly stops and tenses.

               THE CABIN DOOR IS PARTLY OPEN

               and through it Rocklin can plainly see an indistinct form 
               moving in the faint glow of the dying fire.

               ROCKLIN DRAWS HIS GUN AND MOVES STEALTHILY TOWARDS THE CABIN 
               DOOR

               INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT

               Rocklin has reached the entrance unheard, and silently watches 
               the strange figure, its back to him, now headed for the 
               fireplace with his saddlebag, taken from the bunk. He sees 
               the intruder start emptying his saddlebag on the bench in 
               the light of the fire. He sees him suddenly stop and pick up 
               something hidden from his view.

               At that instant, Rocklin slams the door shut.

               The intruder whirls around.

               It is Arly -- tense -- and now defiant.

               The two regard each other like vicious animals in the same 
               cage. Arly's heart is pounding, but you would never know it.

               And now Rocklin, his gun away, starts closing in, slowly -- 
               but Arly holds her ground -- her eyes never leaving his.

               When Rocklin reaches Arly, he takes her one hand from behind 
               her back, and slowly forcing it up sees what is obviously 
               Clara's letter in her tightly clenched fist. He tries to 
               open her hand, and Arly, knowing she lacks the strength to 
               prevent it, suddenly whips out a knife with her free hand. 
               But that quick, Rocklin grabs the knife hand, and without 
               any apparent effort, wrenches it free of her grasp and tosses 
               it across the room, where it lands on the bunk. Arly relaxes 
               her grip on the letter meanwhile, and Rocklin gets it, and 
               tears it very deliberately, letting the pieces fall at her 
               feet.

               He turns his back on her now, going over to his hat on the 
               floor.

               Arly is furious in her helplessness and humiliation. And 
               Rocklin's smug manner isn't helping any. He picks up his hat 
               and, glancing at Arly, puts his finger once more through the 
               bullet holes.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (smiling wryly)
                         Not bad shootin'.

                                     ARLY
                              (right back at him)
                         You think I did that?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Sure -- to draw us away from here.
                              (looks at his hat)
                         You know, you cut it mighty close -- 
                         Good thing I ain't got brains enough 
                         to fill it.

               Rocklin puts his hat on. He sees Arly looking down at the 
               torn letter.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (suppressing smile)
                         Too bad you had to come 'way up here 
                         through that storm for nothin'.

                                     ARLY
                              (affectedly)
                         I haven't minded a bit --
                              (harshly)
                         -- because I came up to fire you.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Oh --
                              (nods)
                         I see.

               Rocklin goes toward the bunk with his saddlebag.

                                     ARLY
                         Get out of here -- get off the Santee 
                         and don't ever come back.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Mind if I wait for Dave? He ought to 
                         be along any minute -- Be funny if 
                         he winged that shadow of yours.

                                     ARLY
                         If you mean Juan -- you're loco. 
                         He's not even up here.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (mildly surprised)
                         You came up alone?

                                     ARLY
                         Yes.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (half believing her)
                         Then who was that we took out after?

                                     ARLY
                         The man who shot at you.

               Rocklin sits on the bunk and casually picks up Arly's knife.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Who was he?

                                     ARLY
                         I don't know.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You mean you won't tell.

                                     ARLY
                         I mean I don't know -- Why should I 
                         lie to you?

               That last from Arly brings a kind of smile to Rocklin's face -- 
               a smile that says in effect -- "Are you kidding?" He gets up 
               from the bunk to go to the door, and finding himself still 
               holding Arly's knife, throws it back to her in a seemingly 
               casual manner. It passes too close to Arly for comfort and, 
               Rocklin just opening the door, gets the knife right back -- 
               that close to his ear he feels the breeze. He looks at it, 
               quivering in the door. Then, moving to Arly in what could be 
               construed as a threatening manner, he takes her in his arms 
               and kisses her. Arly is caught completely unaware. Rocklin's 
               action disarms her. But it is, after all, what she really 
               wants, so before the kiss ends, Arly's arms slowly entwine 
               themselves around Rocklin's neck. In the middle of the kiss 
               Rocklin gently but forcefully takes her arms from around his 
               neck and puts her from him.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I guess you forgot -- you jes' fired 
                         me.

               He goes to the bunk -- picks up his saddlebag, coat, etc., 
               and starts for the door.

               Arly has been silently watching.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (turning near the 
                              open door)
                         So long.

               Dave's voice is heard just outside the cabin door.

                                     DAVE'S VOICE
                         Hey, Rock --

               Dave now rushes through the door, puffing and excited.

                                     DAVE
                         -- He got away -- but guess what, I --

               He sees Arly and pulls up abruptly.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (slowly to Dave)
                         You guess --

               Rocklin gives Arly a disparaging side glance and starts out.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Dave, who is trying 
                              to figure things out)
                         Come on.

               EXT. OF CABIN - NIGHT

               Rocklin is headed for the corral as Dave catches up to him.

                                     DAVE
                              (glancing back to the 
                              cabin)
                         Fer a man who's got a despise fer 
                         wimmin, you sure do get all snaggled 
                         up with 'em.

               INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT

               Arly, her back to us, is standing in the open doorway watching 
               the two headed for the corral.

               Her mood is evidenced by the manner in which she suddenly 
               slams shut the door. As she turns and leans against it, we 
               see tears in her eyes, and hear suppressed sobs. Her eyes 
               light on the bits of torn letter, and presently we see her 
               face set itself grimly, and now she walks toward the fireplace 
               and, passing the torn bite of paper, kicks at them viciously.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN

               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY

               LONG SHOT -- of Rocklin as he comes riding into town. As he 
               nears the corner where the stage and Harolday's office is 
               situated, the CAMERA MOVES IN, getting Rocklin and one of 
               the Harolday employees repairing the wooden sidewalk near 
               the hitching rail.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (as he dismounts)
                         You work for Harolday?

               The man nods.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Here's one of his horses -- I'll 
                         pick up my saddle later.

               He enters the building.

               INT. HAROLDAY'S OFFICE - DAY

               PANNING SHOT on Harolday as he sits at the desk working on a 
               ledger. The sound of a door opening is heard. Harolday looks 
               up casually as if expecting a customer, then suddenly gapes. 
               CAMERA PANS to include doorway in which stands Rocklin.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Howdy...

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (frowning)
                         I thought I sent you up to Table-
                         Top.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That's right.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (slowly)
                         What happened?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (taking off his hat)
                         Well, this, for one thing.

               He pokes a finger through the hole in the crown. Harolday's 
               eyes narrow.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (after a little pause)
                         I told you you'd regret letting that 
                         rat Clews off so easy.

               Rocklin looks at him with a queer expression without replying.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         What's the matter? Don't you think 
                         it was him, then?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (slowly)
                         I been figgerin'. Don't seem 
                         reasonable Clews was in condition to 
                         take that sort of chance alone... 
                         Besides -- how could he have known I 
                         was up there -- that soon. And -- 
                         George Clews ain't the only one I've 
                         run contrariwise to in this town. 
                         There's that Mexican, for instance.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Juan?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         He as good as told me yesterday that 
                         him and me was due for a run-in one 
                         of those days.
                              (suddenly nodding 
                              toward window)
                         And then there's him!

               Harolday looks sharply toward the window.

               MED. SHOT from office window. Clint is hurrying across from 
               the direction of the Sun-Up Saloon toward the office.

               INT. OUTER STAGECOACH OFFICE - DAY

               PANNING SHOT on Clint as he enters from street and crosses 
               to the door of Harolday's office.

               INT. HAROLDAY'S OFFICE - DAY

               MED. SHOT on door of inner office with Harolday at desk in 
               f.g. As the door opens it conceals Rocklin from Clint.

                                     CLINT
                              (excitedly)
                         I just heard that -- that Rocklin 
                         was --
                              (sees Rocklin)

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (slowly)
                         Was what?

                                     CLINT
                              (subdued)
                         Was shot at last night.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (very calm)
                         Mr. Rocklin was just telling me all 
                         about it.
                              (significantly)
                         Any idea who might have done it?

               Clint looks quickly at Harolday and back at Rocklin with 
               frightened eyes.

                                     CLINT
                         Not me.

               Rocklin makes no reply.

                                     CLINT
                         You ain't trying to pin it on me?
                              (his courage returning)
                         'Cause if you are, you're in for a 
                         big disappointment. I was over at 
                         the Sun-Up playing poker with the 
                         Judge and the rest of the boys till 
                         early morning. If you don't believe 
                         me, ask for yourself.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (after a pause)
                         All right. I believe you. But that 
                         don't mean you couldn't tell a thing 
                         or two as would help -- if you wanted.

                                     CLINT
                              (very nervous again)
                         What d'you mean?

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (sharply)
                         Yes. What sort of thing would Clint 
                         here know about, that would help 
                         identify the man who tried to kill 
                         you last night?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         This for one.

               He pulls out the tobacco pouch which Dave found at Table-
               Top.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Ever seen it before?

               CLOSE SHOT

               Clint as he stares wide-eyed at the pouch.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (harshly)
                         Well, go on -- speak up. Did you 
                         ever see it before?

                                     CLINT
                              (avoiding Harolday's 
                              eye)
                         No. Course I didn't
                              (suddenly raging at 
                              Rocklin)
                         Quit riding me! I don't know nothin' 
                         about it I tell you. Jest because I 
                         had a run-in with you over a game o' 
                         cards, that don't mean I'd sneak up 
                         on you in the dark and...

               Rocklin's disdainful smile takes the speech out of Clint, 
               who just sort of runs out of words. Rocklin hesitates for a 
               second then moves toward the door.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Harolday and Clint are at window looking past camera toward 
               the street. They see Rocklin carrying his saddle, walking 
               toward the Sun-Up. Shorty Davis hails Rocklin, says something 
               to him and points to the Sun-Up. Rocklin leaves, walking 
               faster.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (frowning deeply)
                         He means trouble.

               He turns from camera toward the desk.

                                     CLINT
                              (still at window)
                         Aw, what do I care.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (turning on him with 
                              cold fury)
                         Listen, I never did have much use 
                         for you. You're a poor specimen at 
                         the best; but as a would-be bad man 
                         you're nothing but a laughing stock. 
                         Why, the way you lied about that 
                         pouch just now wouldn't have deceived 
                         a six-year old.

                                     CLINT
                         I...

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (harshly)
                         All right, let it go at that. But I 
                         got myself to think of. It wouldn't 
                         suit me at all just now to have you 
                         shown up in public for what you are 
                         by that trouble-shootin' cowhand. My 
                         advice to you is to get out of the 
                         district and stay out.
                              (taking a key from 
                              his vest pocket)
                         You'll find some money in the safe 
                         at the ranch. Take what you need and 
                         put the key in the desk drawer. Now 
                         get.

               INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               Rocklin comes down the hall carrying his saddle and looking 
               at the room numbers. As he nears the f.g. he locates the 
               room he is looking for (it is a room facing toward the rear 
               of the Sun-Up). He knocks. Almost immediately the door opens 
               and Clara stands there -- flushed and embarrassed.

                                     CLARA
                         Oh, Mr. Rocklin --

               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               This is the room in which Clara has arranged to meet Rocklin, 
               who later takes it as his own.

               SHOT at door as Rocklin steps into the room.

                                     CLARA
                         I'm so glad I've found you -- I was 
                         on my way to the Santee and learned 
                         you were in town.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (putting his saddle, 
                              etc., aside)
                         Just got in.

                                     CLARA
                         I feel perfectly awful, running after 
                         you like this, but --

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You got trouble, eh?

                                     CLARA
                         My aunt found out I wrote you and 
                         made a terrible scene --

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You haven't signed everything over 
                         to that Garvey, have you?

                                     CLARA
                         No -- and because I refused, Auntie 
                         said she would sign an affidavit 
                         that I'm still underage, and then, 
                         as my guardian she can do what she 
                         likes.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Got anything to prove you're not 
                         underage?

                                     CLARA
                              (after a slight pause)
                         No -- but Mr. Garvey has a letter 
                         that would prove it. My aunt wrote 
                         it before we came out here.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         S'pose we could get it?

                                     CLARA
                         He'd never give it to me.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (starts for door)
                         Wait here.

                                     CLARA
                              (with a slight start 
                              toward Rocklin)
                         Oh, please -- you --
                              (she hesitates, not 
                              quite sure what to 
                              say)
                         You won't go getting yourself in 
                         trouble -- I -- I'd rather give up 
                         everything -- I mean --

               Rocklin notes her confusion. He regards her with a slight 
               sympathetic smile. Then opens the door and exits.

                                                               DISSOLVE OUT

               DISSOLVE IN

               INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               CLOSE SHOT -- a letter written in a bold feminine hand. It 
               reads:

               DEAR MR. GARVEY:

               In answer to your letter of the 25th, kindly be advised that 
               my niece, Clara Caldwell, became of age January 11th of this 
               year. And, although I am no longer her legal guardian, it 
               behooves me, as her nearest kin, to show continued interest 
               in her affairs --

               The CAMERA HOLDS LONG ENOUGH for the letter to be read. And 
               now the letter begins to be consumed in a flame as the CAMERA 
               PULLS BACK showing the burning letter in Judge Garvey's hand. 
               He is standing over the potbellied stove in his office, and 
               Miss Martin is close to him watching the letter burn. Garvey 
               finally lets it fall from his fingers onto the top of the 
               stove. He lifts the lid, lets the remains fall inside, and 
               smiles to Miss Martin.

                                     GARVEY
                         That takes care of that --
                              (crosses to his desk)
                         Now, I'll draw up an affidavit right 
                         away and everything will be taken 
                         care of as we want it.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (not too enthusiastic)
                         I certainly hope so -- it's not myself 
                         I'm concerned about --

                                     GARVEY
                              (getting out the papers)
                         -- Of course not.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         I can't say I'm very happy about 
                         doing this -- I only hope it works 
                         out for the best.

                                     GARVEY
                         It's the better choice of two evils -- 
                         now let's see --
                              (begins to write)
                         I, Elizabeth --
                              (looks at Miss Martin)
                         It is Elizabeth, isn't it?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Yes --

                                     GARVEY
                         -- Elizabeth Martin, of Danvers, 
                         Massachusetts, do hereby --

               The door opens and Rocklin enters. Miss Martin, who has been 
               pacing nervously, stops in her tracks. Garvey, taken 
               completely by surprise, feigns an affected casualness. Rocklin 
               eyes them both suspiciously as he slowly closes the door.

                                     GARVEY
                              (leaning back in his 
                              chair)
                         Well, Mr. Rocklin, this is indeed a 
                         surprise. Didn't expect to see you 
                         so soon. I understood you were riding 
                         for the Santee.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (coldly)
                         That's right.

               It is quite obvious to Garvey that Rocklin is here on 
               business. He turns to Miss Martin.

                                     GARVEY
                              (to Miss Martin)
                         Perhaps you'd better come back later --

               Miss Martin is in accord with that suggestion, and after 
               giving Rocklin the frigid eye, flounces out, slamming the 
               door.

               Garvey shakes his head, wipes his brow, and is returning to 
               his desk.

               INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               SHOT -- door to Garvey's office. Miss Martin has her ear 
               glued to the panels. Over scene comes Rocklin's voice.

                                     ROCKLIN'S VOICE
                         I came for that letter.

               Miss Martin reacts.

               INT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               SHOT -- Garvey and Rocklin.

                                     GARVEY
                              (calmly)
                         Did you say letter?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That's right -- the one Miss 
                         Caldwell's aunt wrote from out east 
                         sayin' she was of age. Remember?

                                     GARVEY
                         No -- I'm afraid I don't.

               INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               SHOT -- door. Miss Martin reacts with nod of satisfaction 
               and leaves.

               INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Rocklin goes to the filing cabinet where he opens the drawer 
               marked "C." As he fingers through the papers, Garvey sits 
               back in his chair, watching.

                                     GARVEY
                         What is your interest in this letter?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         My only interest is getting' it.

                                     GARVEY
                         You realize what this is, don't you? -- 
                         Robbing -- armed robbery at that.

               Rocklin pulls open the "M" drawer.

                                     GARVEY
                         I warn you, you're in for a 
                         disappointment.

               Not finding the letter in the "M" drawer, Rocklin goes to 
               the desk and pulls the handle of one of the drawers. It is 
               locked.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Open up.

                                     GARVEY
                              (has had about enough)
                         Listens, you --
                              (suddenly controls 
                              himself)
                         There's nothing in there that'd 
                         interest you.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (grimly)
                         I'd like to make up my own mind about 
                         that.

                                     GARVEY
                              (forces a chuckle)
                         All right -- I'll open it -- just to 
                         convince you I'm not hiding any 
                         letter.

               Garvey unlocks the drawer and opens it. It is found to contain 
               nothing but two brand new decks of playing cards.

               The UNOPENED DECKS OF CARDS.

               BACK TO SCENE. Garvey seems a little too anxious to close 
               the drawer, and before he can do so, Rocklin has one hand 
               inside. Garvey, checked for a second, looks up at Rocklin.

                                     GARVEY
                         What's the idea?

               Rocklin slowly withdraws his hand, holding one of the decks.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         These cards --

                                     GARVEY
                              (attempting to bluff 
                              it out)
                         Anything wrong in a man having cards 
                         in his possession?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Depends on what kind they are -- 
                         'specially when they're under lock 
                         and key.

               The two regard each other silently a moment. Now Rocklin 
               casually slips the deck he holds into his pocket.

                                     GARVEY
                              (too politely)
                         You're taking those, I presume.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That's right.

               He takes a step away. Garvey turns him by touching his arm.

                                     GARVEY
                              (has had almost enough)
                         Now, you look here --

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (soberly)
                         You're the one who better start 
                         lookin' -- lookin' for a way out for 
                         killin' Red Caldwell.

                                     GARVEY
                              (blanches)
                         Caldwell --

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (takes up one of the 
                              decks of cards)
                         He found out about these -- and you 
                         went and killed him.

                                     GARVEY
                              (with an affected 
                              smile and unnatural 
                              calmness)
                         And you believe a story like that?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I will until I hear a better one.
                              (puts deck he holds, 
                              in his pocket)
                         I'll just take this along -- the 
                         district judge at Garden City should 
                         be mighty interested.

               He starts around the desk toward the door. From the corner 
               of his eye he catches Garvey reaching for a gun in the middle 
               drawer. Before he can raise it, Rocklin is on him with a 
               blow that sends Garvey reeling back toward the stove.

               Rocklin starts for the door again, and just misses being 
               struck by a chair which Garvey hurls with vicious fury. The 
               chair crashes against a window.

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               The sound of breaking glass attracts the attention of passers-
               by, as well as Miss Martin seated in her surrey with Sammy, 
               the K.C. China-boy.

               INT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               The two are now fighting in earnest.

               VARIOUS FLASHES

               of the fight, intercut with townspeople gathering outside.

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Dave pulls up in his wagon.

               INT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               It is pretty well wrecked. Rocklin has Garvey just about 
               done in. He gives him one final Sunday punch and Garvey goes 
               down and stays down. At that moment, Dave and Pap Fossler 
               enter followed by other curious natives.

                                     DAVE
                         Say -- looks like you two been 
                         disagreein' 'bout somethin' --
                              (to Fossler, who has 
                              gone over to Garvey)
                         He ain't daid, is he?

                                     PAP FOSSLER
                         Not permanently, I don't reckon. -- 
                         What happened, anyways?

                                     DAVE
                              (to Rocklin)
                         You musta found out somethin'.

                                     PAP FOSSLER
                              (with a wink to Dave)
                         I reckon the Judge did, too.

               They exit, and almost immediately Miss Martin enters, and 
               after gaping in horror at the appearance of the place, sees 
               the Judge, who, having regained consciousness, bestirs himself 
               on the floor.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Oh, dear -- dear -- are you hurt?

                                     GARVEY
                              (getting up painfully)
                         Get out of my way --

               Garvey, on his feet now, makes for the door leading to his 
               living quarters at the back of the office. Miss Martin follows 
               him.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (haughtily)
                         Now don't you use that tone of voice 
                         to me --
                              (going through doorway)
                         I'll have you understand I --

               She sees the bed and shrieks upon realizing where she is, 
               and backs out quickly, almost catching the door which Garvey 
               slams in her face.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY

               Rocklin and Dave as they walk from Garvey's office. Dave has 
               a time hopping along against Rocklin's strides.

                                     DAVE
                         -- Find out who owns that tobaccy 
                         pouch yet?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (staring straight 
                              ahead)
                         No -- but get hold of Clint Harolday.

                                     DAVE
                         Clint -- Is he in on it?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Can't say for sure -- Bring him to 
                         the Sun-Up, and don't take no for an 
                         answer.

               Dave leaves and exits from shot in the direction of the stage 
               office. Rocklin goes off toward the Sun-Up.

               EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               PANNING SHOT. Juan is lounging against the corner of the 
               building, soberly watching Rocklin's approach. As Rocklin 
               comes into the scene he spots Juan, and stops a moment as 
               though deciding whether or not to question him. During this, 
               Juan casually takes his ornamental tobacco pouch from his 
               pocket and begins to roll a cigarette.

               The CAMERA PANS Rocklin to the side of the building and up 
               the outer stairs.

               INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               Rocklin comes through the door and down the hall. He reaches 
               his room, and is about to open the door when he hears a 
               familiar voice inside. He listens.

                                     ARLY'S VOICE
                         -- So now you know the truth. And if 
                         you think you can steal him away 
                         from me, you're welcome to try it.

               Rocklin frowns and enters.

               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               Rocklin steps into the room, holding the door partly open as 
               he focuses his attention on Arly. Clara, who has been sitting 
               in the rocker near the window, gets up and is the first to 
               speak.

                                     CLARA
                              (anxiously)
                         Did you get it?

               Rocklin closes the door.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         No -- but I don't think it's gonna 
                         matter much -- you go on back to the 
                         K.C. and I'll be out in the mornin' 
                         and take you with me to Garden City 
                         to see the district judge.

                                     CLARA
                         But I hate putting you to that 
                         trouble.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         No trouble at all -- I'm going anyway.

                                     ARLY
                              (casually)
                         You look like you've been fighting.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (soberly)
                         What are you doin' here?

                                     ARLY
                         I was just telling Miss Caldwell 
                         about -- well -- you and me.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (his eyes narrowing)
                         What about, you an' me?

                                     CLARA
                              (sensing the static 
                              in the atmosphere)
                         I think I'd better be going...

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (turning quickly from 
                              Arly)
                         Just a minute --
                              (glances at Arly)
                         What all has she been tellin' you?

                                     CLARA
                              (embarrassed)
                         Oh -- oh, really I'd rather not --

                                     ARLY
                              (interrupting)
                         Go ahead, tell him --
                              (looks at Rocklin and 
                              goes on defiantly)
                         -- and I dare him to deny it.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Deny what?

                                     CLARA
                         That she was with you last night at 
                         the cabin in the mountains.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Well -- why should I deny it?...

                                     ARLY
                              (quickly)
                         And didn't you make love to me?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (this is getting a 
                              bit thick for him)
                         Make love to you --

                                     ARLY
                              (forcing her point)
                         You didn't kiss me -- I suppose?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Did you expect me to deny that, too?

                                     ARLY
                              (smiles at Clara)
                         You see?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Clara)
                         Now, maybe you ought to hear what 
                         I've got to say --

               Clara is terribly hurt, but struggles to be grown-up about 
               it.

                                     CLARA
                         Please -- you needn't explain. After 
                         all, it really isn't any of my 
                         business, is it?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (in the pause he looks 
                              at Arly)
                         You little --

                                     ARLY
                              (quickly)
                         That's it -- start swearin'--
                              (to Clara)
                         Just like a man.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         If there wasn't a lady here, I'd do 
                         more to you than swear.

                                     CLARA
                         I don't know how I can ever thank 
                         you for trying to help me. I do 
                         appreciate it ever so much --
                              (to Arly)
                         Don't think too harshly of me, will 
                         you -- I --

               Clara can say no more without breaking. So she turns away 
               quickly and hurries out the door. Rocklin does a slow burn 
               as he glares at Arly.

                                     ARLY
                              (sincerely -- after a 
                              pause)
                         She's lovely, isn't she? -- So sweet -- 
                         honest, and helpless.

               Rocklin makes no reply.

                                     ARLY
                         Pity you didn't fall in love with 
                         her, instead of me.

               Arly is being ridiculous now. He ignores her remarks and 
               concentrates his attention on one of his hands -- he may 
               have sprained it slightly in the fight.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You might's well know right now that 
                         you or no woman is ever goin' to get 
                         me.

                                     ARLY
                         Don't be so sure -- I don't think 
                         I'm doin' so badly.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Don't you?

                                     ARLY
                         Don't you know?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I know there ain't a dirty trick you 
                         wouldn't play to get what you want.

                                     ARLY
                              (smiling)
                         I always get what I want.

               She takes a folded piece of paper out of her pocket and drops 
               it on the dresser as Rocklin watches her.

                                     ARLY
                         -- See?
                              (opens the door)
                         -- 'Bye now --

               The door closes. Rocklin stands a moment. Now curiosity brings 
               him to the dresser where he takes up the paper and unfolds 
               it.

               CLARA'S LETTER. The torn pieces have all been sorted and 
               pasted together on a sheet of paper

               BACK TO SCENE. Rocklin holds the letter. He is mad. He shakes 
               his head -- What a gal --- Now he is almost smiling -- almost. 
               He folds the letter -- puts it in his pocket. Takes off his 
               gun-belt and hangs it over the rocker near the window, and 
               stretches out on the bed, as we

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN

               EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

               ON Clara hurrying toward the front door in a suppressed state 
               of excitement. She has presumably just arrived at the ranch 
               in advance of Miss Martin. She enters the house after a glance 
               toward the gate.

               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Clara enters hastily and beats a path to the door of her 
               room.

               INT. CLARA'S ROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

               The door flies open. Clara bursts in, closing the door in 
               the same movement. Her eyes swing to someone o.s. and she 
               freezes to the spot.

               ON

               Miss Martin, standing by the window, cold and threatening. 
               She has not taken the time to remove her hat. After a moment's 
               pause, she moves slowly toward Clara.

               The CAMERA PANS WITH her into a TWO SHOT. Clara, her back 
               pressing harder and harder against the door, becomes more 
               terrified at the other's approach. Miss Martin appraises the 
               girl a short moment and now suddenly slaps her hard across 
               the face. Clara opens her mouth, about to scream, but even 
               stifles this impulse under the cold stare of her aunt.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (quietly but viciously)
                         Whatever is to become of you?

               Clara can only stare as one under an hypnotic spell.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Have you no sense of pride, or 
                         decency? Throwing yourself at that -- 
                         that wretch, like any shameless hussy.

               Clara hasn't moved.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         I thought we'd done with him -- but 
                         no -- you have to run to him and 
                         tell him all our business --

               Clara merely gasps for a breath of air, but Miss Martin, 
               thinking her about to speak, goes on, more forcefully now.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Don't you dare deny it -- you know 
                         very well you told him about that 
                         letter I wrote Mr. Garvey.

               Clara remains silent.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Didn't you? --

               Clara, now utterly broken, moves away. Miss Martin, her eyes 
               still rivited on the girl, follows.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Didn't you?

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

               The office has been more or less cleaned up since the fight. 
               Garvey is discovered near the window. He has cleaned himself 
               up but bears some evidence of the fight. He is reading a 
               letter as Sammy, the K.C. China-boy, stands waiting near the 
               door.

               LETTER. The message is written in the same bold hand of Miss 
               Martin already seen in the previous letter:

               Mr. Garvey,

               I have just learned that despicable Rocklin person intends 
               to take Clara to Garden City in the morning -- evidently to 
               have you investigated. I thought you had better know about 
               it.

               E.M.

               BACK TO SCENE. Garvey puts the message in his pocket as he 
               addresses Sammy.

                                     GARVEY
                         Tell Miss Martin that I'll take care 
                         of everything.

                                     SAMMY
                         -- You take clare of evelything.

                                                               DISSOLVE OUT

               DISSOLVE IN

               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               On Rocklin, stretched across the bed, examining the cards in 
               the light of a lamp.

               EXT. REAR OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               Garvey comes from around the building's corner and peers 
               furtively through the darkness toward the lighted windows of 
               Rocklin's room.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - NIGHT

               The area in front of the Sun-Up. Dave's wagon pulls up to 
               the hitching rail in front of the saloon. Clint, stripped of 
               his gun, is driving with Dave, alertly watching him. They 
               get down from the wagon and Dave prods Clint toward the corner 
               of the building.

               EXT. SIDE OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               Garvey has left the spot where we saw him look up to Rocklin's 
               window. We now see him as he rounds a rear corner of the 
               building and goes toward the outer stairs leading to the Sun-
               Up's second floor. He starts up the steps and stops almost 
               immediately and stares o.s.

               ANGEL

               From Garvey's ANGLE as he sees Dave bringing Clint from around 
               in front of the building toward the stairway.

               CAMERA HOLDS

               Garvey steps quickly to the ground and takes up a position 
               around the roar corner. He watches the two men approach the 
               stairway and go up. He moves out of the shot now, going toward 
               the street. The CAMERA HOLDS on the corner, and we see Tala 
               come into view, as though from nowhere, and take the exact 
               position at the building's corner vacated by Garvey only a 
               moment before. It is apparent that he is watching Garvey, 
               and after a momentary pause he too moves stealthily out of 
               the scene.

               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               PANNING SHOT on Rocklin asleep. He is fully dressed, as we 
               last saw him, with the exception of his boots. He is stretched 
               full length on top of the covers. His gun-belt still hangs 
               over the rocker, close to the open window. A knock on the 
               door brings him to a sitting position.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Come in --

               CAMERA PANS TO door as Clint enters reluctantly, followed by 
               the triumphant Dave.

                                     DAVE
                         Here he is, Rock. Caught him jist in 
                         time near the Santee. Headed fer 
                         out, I'd say.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Sit down, Clint.
                              (to Dave, as he reaches 
                              into his pocket)
                         How about goin' down below an' havin' 
                         one on me?

               He tosses Dave a coin, who catches it. Then Rocklin puts on 
               his boots.

                                     DAVE
                              (delighted)
                         Well, now -- that's right thoughtful -- 
                         Holler if you need me.

               Dave exits.

                                     CLINT
                              (belligerently, as he 
                              stands near the window)
                         What's this all about?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (calmly, as he stands 
                              up)
                         It ain't gonna do you any good to 
                         get all het up and tough, kid --

               Rocklin begins rolling a cigarette as he moves toward Clint.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I just want to ask you a few questions -- 
                         that's all.

               EXT. SIDE OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               An unidentifiable form is seen moving through the darkness 
               toward the outer stairway. As it nears the stairway, the 
               CAMERA MOVES IN so that as the mysterious figure begins 
               stealthily up the stairs, we see only the feet through the 
               rungs.

               The CAMERA THEN PANS QUICKLY AND ZOOMS INTO A CLOSE SHOT of 
               Juan, across the alley. And now through Juan's eyes we watch 
               the ascent of the mysterious intruder: The Mexican's line of 
               vision gradually raises, then the eyes slowly move across 
               the camera as the dark figure proceeds along to the rear 
               portion of the verandah.

               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               Rocklin finishes rolling his cigarette and lights it.

                                     CLINT
                         I told you once, I don't know who 
                         owns that pouch-- and I don't know 
                         who shot you.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (calmly)
                         Forget it -- that's not what I want 
                         to talk to you about, anyway.

                                     CLINT
                              (harshly)
                         Well, what do you want to talk about? 
                         Come on, get it over with.

               EXT. VERANDAH - REAR OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               The mysterious form has moved past the darkened windows along 
               the verandah and is nearing Rocklin's lighted room -- stops 
               close to the open window.

               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               SHOT -- Rocklin and Clint.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Clint -- I want you to tell me why 
                         Garvey murdered Red Caldwell --

               Clint tenses -- stares -- finds breathing difficult.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You know -- don't you?

                                     CLINT
                              (shaking)
                         Me? No!

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Oh yes you do.
                              (advancing on him)
                         And you're going to tell me all about 
                         it.

                                     CLINT
                         I don't know nothing, I tell you -- 
                         I --

               Rocklin slaps Clint's face open-handed, throwing him off 
               balance, then grabs him by the shirt front.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Talk!

                                     CLINT
                         I tell ya, I...

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (hitting him again)
                         Talk!

               Completely terrified, Clint opens his mouth as if about to 
               speak. Suddenly he sees something out of the shot over 
               Rocklin's shoulder and his expression changes. Rocklin looks 
               quickly in the same direction.

               MED. SHOT

               window. A gloved hand has come out of the dark and is reaching 
               through the window for Rocklin's gun in the belt which is 
               hanging over the chair.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Clint and Rocklin. The latter is still looking toward the 
               window. With a swift movement Clint picks up the water jug 
               from the washstand and brings it down on Rocklin's head. As 
               Rocklin falls out of shot, Clint turns to the window with a 
               triumphant smile. Suddenly his expression changes.

                                     CLINT
                              (in a hoarse scream)
                         No! No, don't!

               There is a shot from o.s. and Clint's hands go to his stomach. 
               With a gasp of pain he doubles up and collapses on the floor.

               SHOT

               window. The hand of the killer pitches the gun toward Rocklin 
               and disappears.

               INT. BAR - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               Lined up at the bar are Dave, Pap Fossler, Shorty Davis and 
               a few others. Cap is in his usual place. At the poker table 
               are Doc Riding, Sam Haynes, Ab Jenkins and one or two others.

               The shot has evidently been heard, for everything seems to 
               have stopped, and Dave and Pap Fussier are looking up toward 
               the ceiling, as are others. Now Dave snaps back to life -- 
               gulps down his drink, and hurries toward the stairs. As he 
               starts up, the others move slowly in the same direction.

               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               Rocklin is on the floor, groggy. He shakes his head, and as 
               his senses return, he picks up the gun and just gets to his 
               feet as Dave rushes in.

               Dave sees Clint's body on the floor -- notices the gun in 
               Rocklin's hand. He opens his mouth to speak but nothing comes 
               out. All he can do is stare and grimace. The sound of hurrying 
               feet comes from the hall, and presently the mob closes in, 
               crowding the room and the hall.

               Pap Fossler, who has been one of the first to enter, kneels 
               over Clint.

               During this, there are general ad libs from the crowd.

                                     AD LIBS
                         What happened? Who is it? Clint 
                         Harolday -- Etc.

                                     PAP FOSSLER
                         Where's Doc Riding?

                                     AD LIBS
                         Get the Doc. Hey, Doc -- He was down 
                         below. Here he is.

               Doc's voice is heard from the hall as he makes his way through 
               the jam.

                                     DOC RIDING'S VOICE
                         Here I am --

                                     AD LIBS
                         Look out, men -- Let the Doc through. 
                         Etc.

               Doc riding comes through the crowd, kneels beside Pap Fossler. 
               He needs only a glance to know he can be of no use.

                                     DOC RIDING
                              (breaking the silence)
                         Somebody better fetch Harolday.

                                     CAP
                         Shorty's already gone for him.

                                     PAP FOSSLER
                              (getting up)
                         Better get Arly, too.

               A voice is heard from the hall.

                                     VOICE
                         She was at the hotel a while ago.

                                     PAP FOSSLER
                              (looking down at Clint 
                              and shaking his head)
                         He was only a kid.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Rocklin, still holding his gun as he stares down at Clint's 
               body o.s. Now he studies the faces of the mob.

               PANNING SHOT

               of the crowd. There is nothing but a sea of hostile faces.

                                     JACKSON'S VOICE
                         What's goin' on here -- gang way --

               The crowd parts to admit Jackson, who comes stalking in 
               followed by Judge Garvey.

                                     JACKSON
                         What's the trouble here --

               He stops abruptly as he sees Clint's body. Now he levels his 
               eyes on Rocklin.

                                     JACKSON
                              (with a bitter smile)
                         I warned you, didn't I? -- Well, I 
                         guess this is the last trouble you'll 
                         ever make in this town.
                              (extending his hand)
                         Hand over that gun.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Just a minute, now --

               He steps back so no one is behind him. And there is something 
               about his manner and tone that urges Jackson to use 
               discretion.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to the crowd, 
                              generally)
                         I know it looks bad -- but I didn't 
                         kill the kid.

               The crowd stares in skeptical silence. Even Dave thinks 
               Rocklin is lying, and now does his best to protect his friend.

                                     DAVE
                         I believe you.
                              (to the others)
                         His gun was layin' over there on the 
                         floor when I come in and --

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (cutting in)
                         No it wasn't -- It was right in my 
                         hand -- like it is now.

               Dave winces.

                                     JACKSON
                         If you didn't know him -- then who 
                         did?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I don't know --
                              (looks at garvey)
                         But I'm going to find out.

               INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               Harolday, followed by Shorty Davis, is making his way down 
               the hall from the inner stair landing. As he nears the crowd 
               gathered at Rocklin's door, Juan comes into view down the 
               hall, having just entered through the door leading out onto 
               the verandah.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (as he nears Rocklin's 
                              door)
                         Where is he? -- Where's my boy?

               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               Harolday enters, over the ad libs of the mob, followed by 
               Shorty Davis. During the following action, Juan enters and 
               stands near the door, silently taking in everything.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Harolday, as he sees Clint's body and stops dead in horror. 
               He turns to Rocklin.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (with cold violence)
                         You murderer.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I didn't do it, Mr. Harolday.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (quickly)
                         Then who did?

                                     VOICE
                              (from crowd)
                         He had a gun in his hand when we 
                         come in.

                                     GARVEY
                              (smoothly)
                         And I'll bet it's the same one the 
                         bullet that killed Clint came out 
                         of.

               Rocklin gives Garvey a hard, slow look.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Well, what do you say to that?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         He's right.

                                     GARVEY
                         You admit it.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Yeah -- but that still don't say I 
                         killed him.

                         Aw, take him away -- Liar -- Lock 
                         him up, Sheriff -- The yellow-bellied -- 
                         Etc.

               ON ARLY AS SHE PUSHES HER WAY THROUGH THE CROWD

               She stares down at Clint. An expression of pity comes over 
               her. Now she looks coldly at Rocklin.

                                     ARLY
                              (softly)
                         Why did you do it?

               MED. SHOT

               with Rocklin in f.g.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I didn't.

                                     GARVEY
                         He admits it was his gun that shot 
                         him.

                                     ARLY
                              (whose eyes haven't 
                              left Rocklin's)
                         But you didn't fire it.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That's right.

                                     ARLY
                         What happened?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (slowly)
                         Clint and me was having a bit of an 
                         argument.

                                     ARLY
                              (quickly)
                         What about?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (searching for words)
                         About whether he was going to help 
                         clear up a few things that's been 
                         bothering me and some others 'round 
                         these parts.
                              (looking at Garvey)
                         For instance -- who it was shot Red 
                         Caldwell.

                                     JACKSON
                         Caldwell!

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (still at Garvey)
                         And the K.C. foreman. And who took 
                         that shot at me up at Table-Top last 
                         night. And why certain people are so 
                         anxious to get rid of the Caldwell 
                         girl.

                                     PAP FOSSLER
                         How would Clint know about all that?

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (harshly)
                         He's lying. He's trying to cover up 
                         for killing my boy.

                                     JACKSON
                              (encouraged by the 
                              support)
                         Quit stalling, Rocklin.

               He makes a tentative movement toward Rocklin but Arly 
               intervenes.

                                     ARLY
                         Wait a minute -- he's get a right to 
                         be heard.
                              (to Rocklin)
                         Well, we're listenin'.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Well -- Clint was getting' all set 
                         to talk, when -- somebody snuck up 
                         along the verandah there and pulled 
                         the gun out o' my belt...
                              (indicating the belt 
                              on chair)
                         ... and let him have it.

               There is a moment's amazed silence. Then the crowd breaks 
               into derisive comment.

                                     AD LIBS
                         What a story! What an alibi! String 
                         him up, the heel! Etc.

                                     JACKSON
                              (grinning)
                         You'll have to think up something 
                         better than that Rocklin.

               MED. SHOT

               with Garvey in f.g.

                                     GARVEY
                              (smoothly)
                         Don't be a fool, Rocklin. You know 
                         you can't get away with a yarn like 
                         that. Why don't you save yourself 
                         and everyone else a lot of trouble 
                         by surrendering to the Sheriff? After 
                         all, it isn't such a crime in these 
                         parts to kill a man in self-defense.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Self-defense?

                                     GARVEY
                         Everyone knows what Clint was like. 
                         He probably lost his head and pulled 
                         a gun on you, like he did at the Sun-
                         Up that night. Wasn't that it?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (grimly; after a little 
                              pause)
                         No, that wasn't it. And till I do 
                         what I got to do, I ain't surrenderin' 
                         to anybody -- least of all to your 
                         pal here.
                              (indicates sheriff)
                         If I got to be shot for knowing too 
                         much, it ain't going to be in the 
                         back, in a framed-up jail-break.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Arly, who has been staring at Rocklin in frowning 
               bewilderment.

                                     ARLY
                         But if someone's trying to kill you, 
                         why didn't they do it just now? Why 
                         did they have to kill Clint?

               CLOSE SHOT

               Rocklin.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Guess they wanted to get Clint, too. 
                         Doin' it this way they get us both. 
                         Clint first -- an' me afterwards -- 
                         like I jus' said.

               MED. SHOT

               with Garvey in f.g. Close beside him are Pap and Dave, who 
               watches Garvey closely.

                                     PAP FOSSLER
                         Quit fancy talk. Who's "they?"

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I might be able to tell you that 
                         later.

                                     JACKSON
                              (quickly)
                         No you won't -- because you're comin' 
                         with me.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (raises his gun)
                         Am I?

               The crowd tenses. Rocklin eyes them grimly.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         The first one that moves -- gets it.

               He moves over to the open window, and with his gun leveled 
               on the mob, steps out onto the verandah. Once outside, he 
               suddenly lets the window fall and disappears. A shot from 
               Jackson's gun shatters a pane, during which time there has 
               been a rush to the window. It is Arly and Dave who reach it 
               first, and feigning an attempt to raise the window, they 
               momentarily delay pursuit.

               AT THE DOOR LEADING FROM THE ROOM

               There is the inevitable jam as the pushing, yelling crowd 
               all try to exit at once.

               EXT. REAR OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               Rocklin, as he picks himself off the ground, having dropped 
               from the verandah. He starts quickly away.

               EXT. WINDOW OF ROCKLIN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               SHOOTING INTO the room, we see Arly and Dave shoved to one 
               side by Jackson and Garvey. The window goes up and Jackson 
               steps out, followed by Garvey, Harolday, Arly, Dave, and 
               others.

               INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               The human jam has been broken, and now the mob dashes wildly 
               toward the stairway, and verandah exit in the b.g.

               EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               The hitching rail in front of the Sun-Up. There are a dozen 
               or so horses tied up to it and close to it is Dave's team 
               and wagon. Rocklin comes from around the corner of the 
               building and races to the hitching rail.

               TOP OF OUTSIDE STAIRS

               Jackson and Garvey come from around the corner of the porch 
               followed by Harolday, Arly, Dave, and others. At the stairs 
               they collide with some of the men who have raced down the 
               hall, only to reach the stairway at the same moment. There 
               is another jam on the landing as the mob all try to get down 
               at once.

               ROCKLIN AT THE HITCHING RAIL

               He has cut the lines of the horses tied to the rail. We see 
               him cutting the last line and fire into the air. The horses 
               rare and stampede.

               THE MOB - WITH JACKSON AND GARVEY LEADING - COME FROM AROUND 
               THE BUILDING

               And now there is a state of utter confusion as the mob and 
               horses rush in all directions as the men try to retrieve 
               their mounts. Rocklin is no where in evidence.

               GARVEY AND JACKSON - AS HAROLDAY JOINS THEM NEAR DAVE'S WAGON

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (sarcastically)
                         Well, Sheriff -- you certainly are 
                         to be congratulated.

                                     JACKSON
                              (harassed)
                         Look, Mr. Harolday -- you saw what 
                         happened --

                                     GARVEY
                              (deeply concerned)
                         Never mind that -- Let's get going 
                         for Garden City -- that's where he's 
                         headed for.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         You sure?

                                     GARVEY
                         I'm positive.

               Dave climbs into his wagon behind the group as Jackson exits 
               quickly.

               EXT. STAGE OFFICE - SANTA INEZ - NIGHT

               At hitching rail. There are four or five horses tied up here. 
               Arly and Juan enter and mount their horses, and almost 
               immediately Garvey and Harolday come hurrying into the scene 
               after two of the other horses.

                                     ARLY
                              (shouts from her horse)
                         Where do you think he's gone?

               Before either of the two men can answer, Jackson's voice is 
               heard shouting o.s.

                                     JACKSON'S VOICE
                         All right, men -- follow me --

               The CAMERA PANS AROUND, getting Jackson, now mounted, as 
               others come riding in. He rares his horse around and starts 
               away followed by the mob, including our principals. They do 
               not get very far when Dave's wagon comes into the shot, going 
               hell-bent in pursuit.

               EXT. ROAD NEAR EDGE OF SANTA INEZ - NIGHT

               The posse riding hard, with Dave's wagon following.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Dave, half standing as he urges his team on. Behind him are 
               the closed flaps of the wagon top.

               WIDER ANGLE

               as a hand reaches out from between the flaps and grasps the 
               reins. Dave takes it, and looks wildly around -- falls back 
               on the seat.

               ON ROCKLIN - AS HIS HEAD COMES FROM BETWEEN THE FLAPS

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Dave, smiling broadly. Rocklin 
               is pulling hard on the reins.

                                     DAVE
                         I mighta knowed you'd do somethin' 
                         like this.
                              (as Rocklin slows the 
                              team)
                         What are we doin'?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Headin' for the K.C.

               With that Rocklin starts swinging the team around.

               ON THE WAGON AS IT SWINGS AROUND AND BECOMES LOST IN THE 
               DISTANT NIGHT

                                                                       WIPE

               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - NIGHT

               Sammy, the China-boy, is nervously knocking on Miss Martin's 
               door. It opens and Miss Martin is seen slipping a robe over 
               her long Mother Hubbard nightgown, with cap to match.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (impatiently)
                         Now -- what is it?

               Sammy points o.s. -- Miss Martin looks and freezes.

               As she moves down the hall, the CAMERA PANS WITH her until 
               it gets two men standing near the entrance door.

               Now the CAMERA MOVES IN TO A THREE SHOT and we recognize 
               George Clews and his brother, Bob. Bob, his wrist bandaged, 
               takes off his hat at Miss Martin's approach, and George 
               noticing, does likewise.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                         The name's Clews, ma'am -- Mr. Garvey 
                         sent us out --

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (eagerly)
                         Said you were expectin' trouble with 
                         that Rocklin.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         I am.
                              (acidly to George)
                         -- But I'm wondering if you're up to 
                         it. I noticed you didn't fare so 
                         well with him yesterday.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         He was drunk --

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (quickly)
                         Yeah -- But I'm sober now.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Well, see that you stay that way.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                         Don't worry, ma'am -- I've jus' bin 
                         waitin' to get even with that saddle-
                         bum.

               He opens the door.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (with that oily smile)
                         We'll be close-by.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (confidently)
                         You bet.

               They start out.

               INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - NIGHT

               Clara is seen in her nightgown, listening at the door to her 
               room. The sound of the outer door closing comes over the 
               scene and she hurries to her bed and feigns sleep, and just 
               in time, for the door opens and Miss Martin sticks her head 
               in, and satisfied that Clara is sleeping, exits.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. HIGHWAY - ROAD TO GARDEN CITY - NIGHT

               A raspy voice is heard coming out of the darkness singing a 
               ribald song of the periods. And now Old Zeke, riding his 
               burro, comes into view. As he passes close to the camera, we 
               PAN and get the posse coming out of the darkness in the 
               opposite direction Zeke is travelling.

               As the posse pulls up to Zeke, the CAMERA MOVES IN on a group 
               including Zeke, Jackson, Garvey, Harolday.

                                     JACKSON
                         Seen anybody ridin' hard for Garden 
                         City.

                                     ZEKE
                         Bin on the road since sundown -- 
                         ain't seen a livin' soul -- be he 
                         man or beast.

                                     JACKSON
                         He mighta taken the cutoff through 
                         Jaw Bone Canyon.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         After that storm? -- He'd never make 
                         it.

                                     GARVEY
                         There's only one other place he might 
                         have gone -- the K.C.

                                     JACKSON
                         You think so?

                                     GARVEY
                              (very definitely)
                         I'm positive.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         That's what you said before.

                                     JACKSON
                              (shouting to the posse 
                              milling around)
                         To the K.C., men.

               The posse swings around and starts back toward Santa Inez.

               ARLY AND JUAN

               Arly watches the posse, then turns to Juan.

                                     ARLY
                              (excitedly)
                         Take me through the canyon.

                                     JUAN
                         It is dangerous, senorita.

                                     ARLY
                         But if we get through we'll beat 
                         them to the K.C.

                                     JUAN
                         You would risk your life for Senor 
                         Rocklin?

               Arly does not answer in words. But Juan sees the answer in 
               her eyes. Now she tosses her head defiantly and swings her 
               horse off the road in the direction of the canyon. Juan 
               watches a moment, then spurs his mount after her, as we

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               On Clara, tossing fitfully in her bed. Suddenly she sits up 
               as an idea begins to take form in her mind. Now she hurries 
               out of bed, moves stealthily to the door and goes out, leaving 
               her door open.

               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               ON door to Miss Martin's room. Clara comes down the hall to 
               the door. She puts her ear close and listens. Now she opens 
               it cautiously and peers inside. The door to her room is 
               slammed o.s. by a sporadic draft. It startles the girl and 
               she quickly closes Miss Martin's door and hurries away.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN

               ON the posse, riding hell-bent.

               EXT. JAW BONE CANYON - DAWN

               Arly and Julio, as they slowly pick their way along the 
               difficult trail, skirting a roaring torrent. Julio is leading 
               and close behind him Arly is having a time negotiating the 
               unsteady ground of a landslide.

               ARLY AND JULIO AS THEY STAND CLOSE TO A DANGEROUSLY FORBIDDING 
               PORTION OF JAW BONE CANYON

               She notices Julio staring o.s. and slowly shaking his head.

                                     ARLY
                         Afraid?

               Julio nods his head slowly, deliberately.

                                     JULIO
                         Only for you -- you must not do this -- 
                         I will go through from here alone.

               A faint smile of admiration brushes Arly's face.

                                     ARLY
                         No, -- we're going through together.

               Arly lashes her horse away. Julio realizes the futileness of 
               further pleading and now moves his horse out after Arly.

               EXT. ROAD NEAR KC RANCH - DAWN

               The wagon with Dave and Rocklin coming out of the night.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Dave is driving the team for all it is worth. Rocklin is 
               looking back. He turns to Dave.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You can ease up now.

                                     DAVE
                         We're just about there.

                                                                   WIPE OUT

               WIPE IN

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO KC RANCH - DAWN

               A wooden gate is swung closed across the roadway. On the 
               gate is a crudely printed weather-beaten sign: K.C. RANCH. 
               Over the scene comes the SOUND of the wagon approaching.

               THE WAGON PULLS UP TO THE GATE

               Rocklin hops out, opens the gate. Dave drives the wagon 
               through. As Rocklin lets go the gate, it swings closed of 
               its own accord.

               EXT. SHED - KC RANCH - DAWN

               The shed is a short distance from the Caldwell house. Bob 
               Clews is standing at a corner of the shed looking o.s. Over 
               the scene comes the SOUND of the wagon.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (peering into shed)
                         Hey, George -- George, get up.

               EXT. KC RANCH - DAWN

               The wagon moving slowly through the cottonwoods, along the 
               drive not far from the house. It stops now, and the CAMERA 
               MOVES CLOSER to get Dave and Rocklin as they leave the team 
               and start stealthily toward the house seen in the moonlight 
               in the b.g.

               INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               We pick up Clara in the act of nervously pinning on her hat 
               in the dim light of a small lamp. She is fully dressed, and 
               once the hat is on, she looks around anxiously for her top 
               coat which she finds in the closet. She takes the coat and 
               starts hurriedly toward the lamp, sitting on a small taboret 
               near the door. As she bends over to blow it out, her eyes 
               raise and she freezes.

               MISS MARTIN HAS JUST OPENED THE DOOR AND STANDS THERE STARING 
               ICILY FOR A LONG MOMENT

               Now she snaps the door closed without removing her eyes from 
               Clara, and starts forward.

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the two. Clara stands as 
               one under an hypnotic spell.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (in a very low tone)
                         You vile, ungrateful strumpet -- 
                         running away in the night, like a 
                         deceitful sneak-thief --

                                     CLARA
                              (unrestrained)
                         Yes -- I'm running away -- and it's 
                         all your fault -- you're the one 
                         who's been deceitful and sneaking -- 
                         and don't think I don't know what 
                         you intend doing.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (very controlled)
                         -- And don't think I don't know what 
                         you intend doing.

                                     CLARA
                              (crying, as she moves 
                              away)
                         I don't care -- I'm not ashamed of 
                         it -- and nothing you can say or do 
                         is going to stop me.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (hardly above a whisper)
                         You little fool -- if you go to Garden 
                         City with that man -- you stand to 
                         lose everything.

                                     CLARA
                              (stops pacing)
                         But why? -- Why are you being so 
                         secretive? -- If you know something, 
                         why don't you tell me?

               ON DAVE AND ROCKLIN AT THE WINDOW LISTENING

                                     DAVE
                              (nods and mumbles to 
                              himself)
                         Yeah -- why don't you? --

               Rocklin quickly shushes Dave.

               ON MISS MARTIN AND CLARA

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (Unmindful of the 
                              presence of the men)
                         All right, I'll tell you -- Rocklin 
                         is a nephew of the late Mr. Caldwell. 
                         And, as nearest of kin, he stands to 
                         get everything -- according to the 
                         will. Because you are not the old 
                         man's niece, but only his grand-niece.

                         Rocklin turned up unexpectedly --

                                     CLARA'S VOICE
                         And you and Mr. Garvey knew the truth 
                         all the time?

                                     MISS MARTIN'S VOICE
                         Yes.

               If Dave keeps quiet any longer he'll burst. He spins Rocklin 
               around and speaks in his natural voice.

                                     DAVE
                         -- And you knew the truth all the 
                         time, too -- didn't you? -- No wonder 
                         you stuck around --

               From Rocklin's expression it is quite apparent to Dave that 
               he is right.

               CLARA AND MISS MARTIN

               Both women are staring dumbly toward the window. Now the 
               realization that she has been overheard staggers Miss Martin. 
               She utters a stifled scream and, seeing Rocklin starting 
               through the window, runs from the room.

               ROCKLIN - JUST INSIDE THE ROOM - TURNS TO DAVE

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Get in here and take care of her.

               Dave scrambles through the window and hurries in pursuit of 
               Miss Martin. Rocklin is at Clara's side.

               EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Bushes near the house. George and Bob Clews are crouched, 
               watching.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                         Come on --

               They move out.

               EXT. ROAD BETWEEN SANTA INEZ AND THE KC RANCH - DAWN

               The posse riding hard.

               EXT. JAW BONE CANYON - DAWN

               We see Arly and Julio as they descend a steep embankment 
               toward the raging torrent. They both are riding Julio's horse.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Arly and Julio; Arly seated behind Julio, considerably 
               disheveled and sobbing.

                                     JULIO
                              (comfortingly)
                         You are crying, senorita --?

                                     ARLY
                              (lying bravely)
                         No.

                                     JULIO
                              (knows she is)
                         It is too bad we lose your horse. 
                         She was good horse, for sure.

                                     ARLY
                         If only we make it in time.

               As they move away into a longer shot, a huge boulder comes 
               crashing down the canyon side, across their path, and tumbles 
               with a great roar and splash into the torrent.

               INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Clara is talking feverishly to Rocklin.

                                     CLARA
                         -- And I heard one of them tell my 
                         aunt not to worry, that he was just 
                         as anxious as she was to get even 
                         with you.

               Dave enters from the hall carrying Miss Martin over his 
               shoulder. He has her wrapped in a sheet and bound up in 
               tassled curtain cord.

                                     DAVE
                              (as Clara and Rocklin 
                              react)
                         This is the only way I could handle 
                         her.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         The Clews are around here some place -- 
                         Garvey sent 'em out.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT

               George and Bob Clews at the window. George has his gun 
               leveled, and a dirty smile twists his face.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                         You bet we're around.

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK as George Clews climbs into the room, 
               followed by Bob. They disarm both Rocklin and Dave as Clara 
               watches helplessly, and Miss Martin struggles in her wrapping.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (to Bob)
                         Untie her.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (to Dave)
                         Untie her.

               Dave puts Miss Martin down and begins undoing her as Bob 
               covers him with his gun.

               EXT. MOUTH OF JAW BONE CANYON - FLAT COUNTRY - DAWN

               Arly and Juan leave the hazardous trail behind and now start 
               across the flat on a run.

               INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Dave has unwrapped Miss Martin and she gets to her feet 
               bristling.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (to Bob)
                         Now tie him up.
                              (indicates Dave)

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (quickly, as she picks 
                              up the tassled cord)
                         I'll take part in this -- you -- you 
                         hairy beast.

               Bob Clews tosses the sheet over Dave's head. And as Dave 
               struggles,

               ROCKLIN AND GEORGE CLEWS

               Rocklin thinks he has George off guard and makes a pass at 
               him. But George is on the alert and strikes Rocklin on the 
               head with his pistol.

               ON CLARA AS ROCKLIN GOES DOWN

               She utters a choked cry and falls to the floor in a faint.

               WIDER ANGLE

               as Miss Martin comes to Clara and kneels beside her.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Help me get her to the bed.

               FULL SHOT

               of the room. Bob Clews has Dave securely tied, and now assists 
               Miss Martin in getting Clara to the bed.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (indicating Rocklin 
                              on the floor)
                         What'll we do with 'em?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Take them in to Mr. Garvey and tell 
                         him I must see him at once.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (triumphantly)
                         We'll dump them right in the Judge's 
                         lap.

               George Clews picks up the unconscious Rocklin.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (still administering 
                              to Clara)
                         Hadn't you better tie him, too?

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (to Bob, after a 
                              second's pause)
                         Get some more rope.

               Bob hurries to do so.

               EXT. ROAD TO THE KC RANCH - DAWN

               The posse riding.

               EXT. KC RANCH - DAWN

               Dave's wagon. Bob Clews is seen dumping Dave into the rear 
               of the wagon. George Clews stands near him with Rocklin's 
               unconscious form over his shoulder. Now he puts Rocklin in.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                         Get our horses and meet me at the 
                         gate.

               Bob runs after the horses. George gets onto the wagon seat -- 
               swings the team around and heads for the gate.

               EXT. FLAT LAND NEAR THE KC RANCH - DAWN

               Arly and Juan riding hard.

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE KC RANCH -DAWN

               George Clews sits in the wagon waiting for Bob, who now comes 
               out of the darkness with their horses. He dismounts, ties 
               the horses to the back of the wagon, comes around in front 
               to the gate. He is about to swing it open when he looks past 
               the camera at Arly and Juan, who now pull up to the outside 
               of the gate. Arly dismounts quickly, her gun in her hand. 
               Bob Clews backs up toward the wagon as Arly walks through 
               gate.

               CLOSE SHOT

               of Arly.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George Clews on the wagon seat. He is smiling and is going 
               to try to bluff it out.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (to Arly)
                         What are you doin' with that gun, 
                         Arly?

               CLOSE SHOT

               Arly.

                                     ARLY
                         Get down from there before I show 
                         you.

               INT. OF WAGON - DAWN

               Rocklin has regained consciousness and listens.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS' VOICE
                         Now listen, Arly -- this ain't your 
                         wagon --

                                     ARLY'S VOICE
                         Neither is it yours -- Get down out 
                         of there -- before I knock you down.

               Rocklin recognizes Arly's voice. Now he raises himself up 
               over the tailboard and falls out.

               EXT. REAR OF WAGON - DAWN

               The horses tied in back shy as Rocklin falls to the ground.

               EXT. FRONT OF WAGON - DAWN

               Arly, as she takes it and starts toward the rear of the wagon.

               BOB CLEWS - STANDING CLOSE TO GEORGE - WHO IS STILL ON THE 
               SEAT - SEES HIS CHANCE TO GET ARLY AND SLOWLY REACHES FOR 
               HIS GUN

               He no more than gets it out when a knife whirls in from o.s., 
               getting him in the small of the back.

               JUAN

               He sits calmly astride his horse, his gun leveled on George 
               Clews.

               EXT. REAR OF WAGON - DAWN

               Arly is cutting the rope binding Rocklin.

                                     ARLY
                         -- And they're headed this way and 
                         should get here any minute --

               Rocklin gets to his feet. Arly notices something shining on 
               the ground where Rocklin lay. She picks it up. It is the 
               tobacco pouch with the steer's head of hammered silver.

                                     ARLY
                         Where'd you get this?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (taking the pouch)
                         That belongs to the man who shot at 
                         me on Table-Top -- Dave found it.

               INT. OF WAGON - DAWN

               On Dave's Wrapped form, kicking the wagon tailboard. Arly's 
               head appears between the flaps above the tailboard and as 
               Dave groans and kicks, she takes her knife and slits the 
               rope binding him.

               EXT. FRONT OF WAGON - DAWN

               Rocklin has come to George clew and we see him wrest the gun 
               from his hand and yank George down from the wagon seat. Once 
               down, he lets him have a hard right that sends him sprawling.

               ON GEORGE CLEWS GETTING UP OFF THE GROUND AND ROCKLIN CLOSING 
               IN

               They start fighting viciously. Arly rushes in crying wildly.

                                     ARLY
                              (trying to stop Rocklin)
                         You've got to get away -- they'll be 
                         here -- they'll catch you --

               CLOSE SHOT

               Rocklin. There is but one thought in his enraged mind -- 
               Clews. He tears into him again.

               ON ARLY AS DAVE JOINS HER

                                     ARLY
                              (frantically)
                         You've got to stop him -- he's got 
                         to get away.

               THE FIGHT - AS DAVE AND ARLY FUTILELY ATTEMPT TO BREAK IT UP

               ON DAVE AS HE GETS IN THE WAY OF ONE THAT SITS HIM DOWN

               ON THE FIGHT AS ROCKLIN GETS IN A SUNDAY PUNCH THAT SENDS 
               GEORGE BACKWARD INTO A SHALLOW DITCH OUT OF SIGHT

               ON GEORGE CLEWS LYING UNCONSCIOUS IN THE DITCH

               The posse approaching.

               EXT. FRONT OF WAGON - DAWN

               Rocklin, Arly, Dave, Rocklin is about done in from the fight.

                                     DAVE
                              (anxiously)
                         Come on -- let's git goin' --

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (as he walks to wagon)
                         Where's the girl?

                                     DAVE
                         Back at the house --

                                     ROCKLIN
                         We've got to get her.

                                     ARLY
                         You haven't time -- they're coming -- 
                         don't you believe me? --

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Dave)
                         Come on --

               Arly's plea goes unheeded and he starts away toward the house 
               on the run.

                                     DAVE
                              (mutters)
                         Stubborn as an ole mule.
                              (shouts)
                         You're puttin' a rope around your 
                         neck --

               Dave runs after Rocklin.

               ARLY AND JUAN - ARLY CLIMBING HURRIEDLY UP ONTO THE WAGON 
               SEAT

                                     ARLY
                         Get him --
                              (indicates Bob Clews)
                         -- out of sight, and follow me.

               She takes up the reins now and swings the team around and 
               off the road into the thickness of the trees.

               EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Rocklin and Dave. They are approaching the house warily.

                                     DAVE
                              (softly)
                         But what'll we do with the ole lady?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Anything you like.

                                     DAVE
                         I'd like to pizen her.

               EXT. GROVE OF COTTONWOODS NEAR GATE - DAWN

               Arly is seated on the wagon seat looking toward the gate as 
               Juan comes in on his horse.

                                     ARLY
                              (pointing o.s.)
                         Look.

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO KC RANCH - DAWN

               At gate. The posse rides up. The gate is swung open and they 
               ride through.

               EXT. GROVE OF COTTONWOODS NEAR GATE-DAWN

               At wagon. Arly jumps to the ground and speaks to Juan.

                                     ARLY
                         Come on.

               As she starts toward the house, Juan dismounts and follows.

               EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               The posse comes riding in. Jackson, Garvey, Harolday, and a 
               few others dismount and go toward the door.

               ARLY AND JUAN

               as they move stealthily into a spot shielded by undergrowth, 
               which gives them full view of the front and one side of the 
               house.

               INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Miss Martin is coming into the room with a glass and a pill 
               for Clara, who is still stretched on the bed.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         If you'll just take this -- you'll 
                         go to sleep --

               The sound of someone knocking on the front door comes over 
               the scene. Miss Martin exits hurriedly.

               EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               At front door. Miss Martin opens the door, confronting Jackson 
               and the group. She is bewildered.

                                     JACKSON
                         Evenin' ma'am -- hate to bother you 
                         like this, but --

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (seeing Garvey, 
                              interrupts)
                         I'm so glad you've come, Mr. Garvey, 
                         the most awful --
                              (as though seeing the 
                              crowd for the first 
                              time)
                         -- Why -- what are all these people 
                         doing here?

                                     GARVEY
                         We're after Rocklin -- has he been 
                         here?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (smugly)
                         Oh yes -- here and gone.

                                     JACKSON
                         What!

                                     GARVEY
                              (astounded)
                         Gone --

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (triumphantly)
                         Yes -- the two men you sent out are 
                         taking him and that horrid old man 
                         back to town.

                                     GARVEY
                         The Clewses -- funny we didn't see 
                         them.

                                     JACKSON
                         Somethin' musta gone wrong -- We 
                         better fan out and see what's goin' 
                         on.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (quickly)
                         Don't leave, Mr. Garvey -- I've got 
                         to talk with you, privately --

               As all but Garvey and Harolday go back to their horses, Garvey 
               speaks.

                                     GARVEY
                         But, madam --

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         It's very important.

               Garvey looks at Harolday in a manner evidencing his distaste 
               and impatience.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         We'll go on and meet you in town.

                                     GARVEY
                         Perhaps you'd better.
                              (calls to Jackson 
                              o.s.)
                         I'll meet you in town, Jackson.

                                     JACKSON'S VOICE
                         Right -- come on, men.

               The sound of running horses comes over the scene as Harolday 
               hurries away and Garvey enters the house.

               ON HAROLDAY AS HE GOES TO HIS HORSE

               He starts to mount, but instead leads the horse into the 
               bushes close to where Juan and Arly are watching.

               ARLY AND JUAN - WATCHING

               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Miss Martin and Garvey have been talking. Garvey paces 
               nervously.

                                     GARVEY
                              (quickly, as he turns 
                              to Miss Martin)
                         -- And you're positive he knows 
                         everything?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Absolutely everything -- He was 
                         standing at the window all the time -- 
                         the scoundrel.

               INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Rocklin has his ear glued to the door. He can't help but 
               smile at Miss Martin's reference to him. Dave is behind the 
               curtain at the window, watching the outside. Clara is close 
               to Rocklin.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (whispers)
                         You better get back on the bed -- in 
                         case they come in here.

               Clara tiptoes away.

               EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Arly and Juan, as they watch Harolday approach the house and 
               go to the hall window.

               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Garvey and Miss Martin. Garvey is still pacing very nervously. 
               He is trying to think of his next move.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         If you were to ask me, I think the 
                         best thing to do is --

               Garvey stops and glares.

                                     GARVEY
                              (irritably)
                         I'm not asking you -- and don't bother 
                         me with your silly questions -- we've 
                         got to do something besides talk.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (drawing herself up)
                         You mean -- you have to do something.

               Garvey stops and looks at her again.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         -- This was all your idea, remember.

                                     GARVEY
                              (tossing it off)
                         My idea -- that's all you know about 
                         it.

               THE DOOR TO CLARA'S BEDROOM

               It is open and Rocklin stands there looking o.s.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         If there's anybody else in on it -- 
                         speak up, Judge.

               ON GARVEY AS HE WHIPS AROUND AND STARES AT ROCKLIN

               ON MISS MARTIN - GAPING OPEN-MOUTHED

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Well -- I do declare --

               She can say no more.

               FULL SHOT

               Rocklin steps away from the door, where Dave and Clara now 
               stand. He has Garvey covered. Dave is pointing his gun, and 
               grimacing at Miss Martin.

               EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE -DAWN

               At hall window -- on Harolday watching.

               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Garvey is stepping back, in a cold sweat, toward Miss Martin, 
               as Rocklin advances toward him.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Garvey, quite 
                              casually)
                         Talk.

               Miss Martin opens her mouth, about to speak.

               FLASH

               of Dave.

                                     DAVE
                              (blasting, to Miss 
                              Martin)
                         Not you.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Miss Martin. Her mouth snaps shut like a trap.

               THREE SHOT

               Garvey, Rocklin, Miss Martin. Rocklin takes the tobacco pouch 
               out of his pocket.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Garvey)
                         Ever see that before?

                                     GARVEY
                              (blanches)
                         No -- it's not mine.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Tell me whose it is.

                                     GARVEY
                              (shaking)
                         No -- no -- I don't know --

               EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Harolday at hall window. He raises his gun -- he is about to 
               fire when a knife whirls out of nowhere and sticks in the 
               window frame, inches from Harolday's head. He spins around 
               and stares wildly here and there at the darkness.

               GROUNDS AND BUSHES NEAR THE FRONT DOOR - FROM HAROLDAY'S 
               ANGLE

               There is no one in evidence.

                                     ARLY'S VOICE
                         Drop that gun.

               ON HAROLDAY AT THE HALL WINDOW - STARING HARD - TRYING TO 
               LOCATE THE VOICE

               He drops the gun. Arly and Juan come in to him. Arly has him 
               covered.

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK to a WIDER ANGLE, getting the front 
               door as it is opened by Rocklin, who evidently heard Arly.

               AT FRONT DOOR

               Arly is prodding Harolday into the scene.

                                     ARLY
                              (to Rocklin)
                         He was just getting ready to finish 
                         you off, through that window.

               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Harolday is herded inside, close to Garvey and Miss Martin.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (almost enjoying this)
                         You seem to like to do business 
                         through windows, Mr. Harolday.

               In the pause Harolday remains sneeringly silent.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You're not Clint's killer, by any 
                         chance --

                                     ARLY
                              (cutting in)
                         By one bad chance --
                              (glares at Harolday)
                         Juan saw you do it.

               Harolday looks at Juan, who slowly nods.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Well, now we're gettin' some place --

               He brings up the tobacco pouch. But before he can ask about 
               it, Arly speaks.

                                     ARLY
                         That pouch is his --
                              (indicates Harolday)
                         Juan made it for him a long time 
                         ago.
                              (to Juan)
                         Didn't you?

               Juan nods.

               Rocklin, with a sudden transition, speaks to Harolday in a 
               hard, threatening tone.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Harolday)
                         Why did you kill Caldwell?

               Harolday doesn't answer. He finally looks at Garvey in 
               desperation. Perspiration runs down Garvey's forehead. 
               Suddenly Harolday makes a mad dash for the door. Rocklin 
               shoots, but Arly pushes his arm and sends the shot wild. 
               Rocklin looks at her in amazement. Julio hurries out.

               EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               On Harolday as he rushes madly across the clearing toward 
               the bushes where his horse waits.

               The CAMERA SWINGS BACK to the porch in time to catch Julio 
               crossing it in pursuit of Harolday. Arly and Rocklin come 
               through the open door and stand on the porch watching.

               THE BUSHES WHERE HAROLDAY'S HORSE IS HIDDEN - ARLY AND 
               ROCKLIN'S ANGLE

               They see Julio disappear in the brush. For a moment nothing 
               happens; now Harolday's horse bolts out, riderless, and 
               gallops away. Now Julio comes slowly into view. He moves 
               slowly and deliberately back toward the house.

               AT PORCH

               Julio comes in to Rocklin and Arly. The three exchange 
               significant glances as we

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               In the hall are Clara and Miss Martin, Rocklin, Arly and 
               Julio, Dave and Garvey. Garvey is seated and has evidently 
               been talking in the way of confession.

                                     GARVEY
                         -- Harolday wanted the K.C. like he 
                         wanted the Santee and the Hardman 
                         place, for his land scheme -- He 
                         planned on breaking up the ranches 
                         into small holdings and selling to 
                         dirt farmers. He pretended to be on 
                         the outs with me so I could get 
                         Caldwell's confidence. And when Red 
                         caught me with the crooked cards and 
                         threatened to expose me -- Harolday 
                         shot him.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Why did he kill Clint? An' not me?

                                     GARVEY
                         That shot was an accident -- it was 
                         meant for you. We planned on getting 
                         the women to let me handle their 
                         business --

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (interrupting, furious)
                         -- And do us out of everything --
                              (moves close to Garvey)
                         You vile -- wicked -- despicable --

               She is beside herself in her anger -- and taking up a large 
               vase sitting nearby, she smashes it to pieces over Garvey's 
               head. Garvey goes down unconscious. Miss Martin rushes to 
               her room screaming. Clara follows her.

               ON DAVE GRINNING BROADLY - ROCKLIN COMES TO HIM

                                     ROCKLIN
                         When he wakes up -- we'll have him 
                         put everything on paper.

                                     DAVE
                         Well, you'll have to do the writin' -- 
                         'cause I don't know how to write.

               CLARA HURRIES BACK TO THE GROUP FROM UP THE HALL

                                     CLARA
                              (genuinely concerned)
                         Oh, Mr. Rocklin -- please -- I think 
                         Auntie is out of her mind -- she's 
                         in her room -- laughing.

                                     DAVE
                              (grimaces)
                         What that ole pelican needs is a 
                         good spankin'.

                                     ARLY
                              (who has been silently 
                              listening)
                         And I'll bet you're just the one who 
                         can do it.

                                     DAVE
                              (his eyes flash with 
                              an idea)
                         Yeah -- I believe I am.
                              (looks at the group)
                         I know I am.

               He starts away down the hall, rolling up his sleeves. 
               Rocklin's eyes wander to Clara, who seems quite at a loss. 
               Now he moves slowly toward her. In the b.g. Arly watches 
               Rocklin's every move.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I guess there's no rush for you to 
                         get to Garden City, now --

               After a slight pause in which she becomes conscious of Arly, 
               Clara speaks.

                                     CLARA
                         No -- I don't suppose there's any -- 
                         rush --

               There is another short pause. Rocklin glances at Arly, and 
               Arly assuming they want to be alone, turns and goes out the 
               door, leaving Julio attending Garvey.

                                     CLARA
                              (after Arly goes)
                         If I was like her, I'd stay in the 
                         West.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That means you're goin' back East -- 
                         Cousin Clara?

                                     CLARA
                              (smiles, nods)
                         It's where I belong -- I know that 
                         now --

                                     ROCKLIN
                         It's good to know where you Belong, 
                         I reckon -- Wish I knew.

                                     CLARA
                              (wistfully)
                         I can tell you -- you belong with 
                         her --

               Rocklin takes it -- a faint smile brushes his face. He turns 
               now and walks out.

                                                               DISSOLVE OUT

               DISSOLVE IN

               EXT. GROUNDS NEAR CALDWELL HOUSE - SUN-UP

               Arly is seated on the shaft of an old wagon. The first rays 
               of the morning sun streak through the trees across her as 
               she smiles wistfully down at the antics of a little woodchuck 
               cavorting on the ground close to her. In a moment Rocklin 
               comes into view in the b.g. He spots Arly, who has her back 
               to him, and walks over. His approach frightens the woodchuck 
               away, and turns Arly's head toward him. Neither has anything 
               to say. Now Rocklin sits beside Arly, but faces the other 
               way.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (after a pause)
                         Thanks.

                                     ARLY
                         For what?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Everything.

               There is another stilted pause.

                                     ARLY
                              (her eyes sweeping 
                              the morning)
                         Beautiful day.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (reflecting)
                         It didn't start out so beautiful.

                                     ARLY
                         That's true of lots of things.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Fer instance?

                                     ARLY
                              (hesitantly)
                         Well -- you and -- me.

               There is another pause. But worlds are being said in the 
               language of eyes. Their heads move closer and now Rocklin's 
               arms sweep around the girl and they kiss.

               A DRUM. Beating slow. And deep. Like a heart.

               FADE IN:

               EXT. THE GREAT PLAINS SOUTH DAKOTA - DAWN

               Something is rising from the Black Hills. A sphere of light, 
               too red to be the sun. A sphere of contained fire, undulating 
               in crimson and ochre, and rising slowly, majestically, to 
               the pulse. To the DRUM. It is the sun. But it is a Paha Sapa 
               sunrise. A Black Hills sunrise. And it is spectacular.

               The DRUM, pounds deeper, bigger, as the sun gets higher. 
               Stronger. Igniting a vast landscape of gentle slopes and 
               foothills; throwing shadows on the plains that look like, as 
               the Indians say, an old man dancing. The grass is golden. 
               And high. The wind moves through it, snakes through it. 
               Slowly.

               BEGIN CREDITS.

               Voices; a TRADITIONAL INDIAN SONG (Lakota), summoning Wakan 
               Tanka - The Great Mystery.

               And now, rising up over one of the small land waves, a head 
               comes into view. Shoulders. A man, running in ghostly SLOW 
               MOTION, his long black hair trailing in the wind. The INDIAN 
               MAN wears only buckskin pants and a bone choker around his 
               neck.

               Legs and arms churning, the man runs with antelope grace, 
               backlit by the sunrise, bounding toward us. Running... his 
               heart pounding. SONG RISING... DRUM POUNDING... FIVE MORE 
               VOICES in high-pitched tremolo join the song.

               And then the runner soars, like an eagle from a bluff, 
               airborne, flying over a small dip, arms outstretched, and it 
               would be a wondrous thing if there were not a fine, crimson, 
               mist all around him and if slow motion was not suddenly 
               overtaken by LIVE SPEED, revealing the brutal force of gunfire 
               which has slammed the Indian into the air, throwing him. 
               Slamming him hard into the grass. And it is over as quickly 
               and violently as a deer shot dead.

               LAKOTA SONG ends abruptly.

               LONG SHOT - THE GREAT PLAINS

               the sun burns like lava at the horizon. DRUM beats like a 
               heart. And Somewhere off in a distant cottonwood, an OWL. 
               Then Silence. Deep, disturbing stillness.

               EXT. CAPITAL BELTWAY - WASHINGTON. D.C - DAY

               ROCK N'ROLL shatters the silence.

               Cars -- a multicolored metallic criss-cross reflecting off a 
               building made of mirrors -- races past an electronic billboard 
               that blinks in red skyhigh digital: PRUDENTIAL LIFE INSURANCE. 
               7:59. 73 degrees.

               The D.C. Superhighway. And off behind it, in the distance, 
               Capital Hill holds imposing vigil, the massive cast iron 
               dome of The Capital, catching the sun. But everything is 
               soon smothered by a METRO BUS, hogging the far lane of the 
               Beltway, leaning on its HORN.

               Good morning.

               And the rock n'roll is everybody's radio, everybody's tempo.

               CARBON MONOXIDE WAVE

               shimmers across the beltway hugging then releasing a solitary 
               vehicle that we stay with... move with... A black Nissan 240 
               SX, hard-waxed.

               INT. 240 SX - TRAVELING

               Behind the wheel -- an intense young man with close-cropped 
               black hair, eyes hidden by sunglasses. Whatever he does for 
               a living, he does in a suit (not expensive but well-fit. But 
               we might also note that any extra suit cash has gone instead 
               into the silver-plated watch on his left wrist). Lean as a 
               rake, sallow in the cheeks, there is something insatiable 
               about him -- a hungry energy that won't let him go.

               RAY LEVOI, late 20's, early 30's, pulls out of a threatening 
               traffic jam and races on the narrow right between thirty 
               cars and a cement girder.

               EXT. T STREET - OUTSIDE WEST-CENTRAL

               The black SX has jumped off an exit and has entered the light-
               industrial section of Washington. It pulls up near a loading 
               dock behind an old gray building and several parked cars and 
               vans. Ray steps out, smooths his jacket, locks and SETS HIS 
               CAR ALARM.

               Another young man -- chubby, clean-shaven; in a nicer suit 
               than Ray's -- steps out from a parked Miata, and approaches 
               Ray. CARL PODJWICK balances a coffee, a U.S.A. Today and a 
               black eel-skin briefcase.

                                     CARL
                         Hey.

                                     RAY
                         Hey. Nice tie.

                                     CARL
                         Don't get too attached.

               They start walking briskly toward the loading dock.

                                     RAY
                         Ya got the paper?

               They mount steps.

                                     CARL
                         Yeah.

                                     RAY
                         You're my hero, Carl.

                                     CARL
                         Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm 
                         shakin', man, look at me.

                                     RAY
                         Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.

               They stop at the door of a service elevator and Carl breathes. 
               Expanding his chest, exhaling. Ray adjusts Carl's tie for 
               him, his collar. He speaks quietly. Quickly.

                                     RAY
                         Anyone stops us going in, we're with 
                         the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. 
                         We have rug samples.

                                     CARL
                         Rug samples.

                                     RAY
                         We are one-dimensional, boring 
                         peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.

               Carl nods. Ray hesitates, adjusts his own collar and enters 
               the service elevator. Carl follows. Door closes.

               BEGIN CREDITS END.

               INT. GRAY BUILDING - FENCING OPERATION

               Carl follows Ray into the big sparse room of unfinished 
               sheetrock walls. There is nothing in here but cardboard boxes, 
               and two people; a bearded HISPANIC MAN standing behind a 
               counter, writing on a clipboard. The other is a middle-aged 
               BLACK MAN in a purple silk shirt sitting in a chair with a 
               newspaper held open. He barely looks over the top of the 
               Wall Street Journal.

                                     BLACK MAN
                         Hey, look who's here.

                                     RAY
                         Louis, my man, what's happenin'?

               Ray walks up to the counter. Carl lingers, fidgeting. Ray 
               sets his briefcase on the counter and click-clicks it open. 
               The Hispanic fence man looks inside, and begins pulling out 
               stacks of treasury checks.

                                     FENCE MAN
                         Clean ones?

                                     RAY
                         Immaculate.

               Ray gestures to Carl and he nervously sets his briefcase on 
               the counter, fumbles with the first latch. The second. He 
               flips it open.

               The fence man casts his eyes down at a neat cache of Grade A 
               Treasury. A lot of it. Then his eyes rise to Carl.

                                     FENCE MAN
                         What ya got there, seventy-five 
                         thousand?

                                     CARL
                         A hundred and ten. Count it.

                                     LOUIS (BLACK MAN)
                         Have the girl count it, we can't sit 
                         around here countin' bonds, we got 
                         things to do here.

               The fence man pushes an intercom button and yells into a 
               speaker.

                                     FENCE MAN
                         SALLLLY!

               Carl's eyes flit to Ray. Ray's eyes flit to Carl.

               Louis crushes his newspaper down and lifts a big Colt Python 
               from his lap just as --

               A section of sheetrock kicks open and THREE FEDERAL OFFICERS 
               bust out, each clutching a handgun, SHOUTING inaudibly.

                                     LOUIS
                         F.B.I.! Get your face on the fuckin' 
                         floor! MOVE!

               Carl startled, does an almost effeminate dip down to one 
               knee, but that knee is swept out from under him, slapping 
               him flat onto plywood where he is instantly frisked down by 
               the fence man who is wielding a 9 mm handgun. But the white 
               collar criminal is more stunned by the fact that --

               Ray is walking across the floor with his hands in his pockets 
               over to the Mr. Coffee. He pours one, and adds some milk. 
               Turns and watches the bust while opening a packet of Sweet 
               n'Low.

                                     RAY
                         Slam dunk.

                                     LOUIS
                         Beauty. Beauty...

               Ray rests his weight against the coffee station, takes a 
               careful sip. Carl is yanked to his feet by the fence man and 
               he stands there, looking at Ray, baffled. Completely shocked.

                                     CARL
                         Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- 
                         Larry. That's not even your name, is 
                         it? What's your real name, you fucking 
                         scumbag?

                                     RAY
                         Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, 
                         man. Just like the numbers on those 
                         treasury checks. You stole from your 
                         own country, Carl. Shame on you.

               Coffee in hand, Ray walks briskly toward the door.

                                     LOUIS
                         Sugar Ray.

               Ray turns. Louis takes a few steps toward him, putting his 
               gun back in his waistband.

                                     LOUIS
                         They want ya Home. Upstairs wants to 
                         see ya.

               Ray stands frozen, holding the door knob, and digesting what 
               are apparently influential words.

                                     LOUIS
                         Make sure ya spell my name right.

               Ray just stares for a moment. Then hurries out the door.

               Carl, being arm-gripped by two agents and photographed like 
               a trout, gazes bewildered at the door.

                                     CARL
                              (incredulous)
                         We just spent four months together... 
                         I thought he was my friend... what 
                         the fuck, man?
                              (even more incredulous)
                         He had dinner at my mother's.

               CAMERA FLASHES at him, an agent on either side, striking a 
               natural pose.

               EXT. J. EDGAR HOOVER BUILDING - ESTABLISHING - DAY

               The huge, imposing, mausoleum-like Hoover building, bordered 
               by artificial turf, hemmed by cherry trees in blossom. Turning 
               out to be a nice day on Pennsylvania Avenue.

               INT. FBI DIRECTOR'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               8x10 BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOS dealt like cards onto a table, 
               one on top of another.

               1 -- an aerial shot of some wasteland.

               2 -- a closer bird's eye of the same, what looks like a NASA 
               photo of Mars.

               3 -- a vast expanse of the Great Plains.

               ROBERT F. TULLY, Number-Two-in-Command, deals a fourth photo 
               onto the table. He is an understated, fatherly man, well-
               manicured in cotton pencil-striped shirt, white-tab collar 
               and tie. The photos and maps and files a foot deep on the 
               huge table are neatly organized.

                                     INTERCOM
                         SA Levoi, Sir.

                                     TULLY
                         Please.

               Seated, at the far end of the table, engrossed in the deep 
               spread of information, SA (Special Agent) FRANK COUTURE is 
               about to break the record for longest single ash on the end 
               of a cigarette and the smoke forces his eyes into tight, 
               concentrating, slits. "COOCH" as they call him in the Bureau 
               has seen thirty years in some rough "provinces". He has 
               survived the Hoover era and is a legend in the Sessions era 
               but survival has honed an edge. An edge with a touch of ironic 
               cop humor.

               Ray enters, walks into a firm shake.

                                     TULLY
                         Ray...

                                     RAY
                         Mister Tully.

                                     TULLY
                         Do you want a coffee?

                                     RAY
                         No. No, no. Thank you.

               Ray sits nervously across from Cooch who looks up from the 
               photos and studies the younger man through reading glasses 
               and cigarette smoke, and he looks at him like he doesn't 
               know who the hell he is or why he's sitting there.

                                     TULLY
                         Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal 
                         Division.

                                     COOCH
                         Oh, yeah -- right.

               Cooch sticks his cigarette in his left hand, shakes with his 
               right.

                                     TULLY
                         Ray this is --

                                     RAY / TULLY
                         Frank Couture.

                                     TULLY
                         That's right.

                                     COUTURE
                         Hello, Ray.

               The handshake is still locked. Cooch is still squinting at 
               the younger agent. Ray obviously knows something about Agent 
               Couture.

                                     RAY
                         It's an honor.

               Tully leans back in his chair, crosses his legs casually.

                                     TULLY
                         Ray, we're taking you off the street. 
                         We need you out in South Dakota.

               Ray's enthusiasm suddenly deflates.

                                     RAY
                         South Dakota...
                              (confused)
                         Did I do something unsatisfactory, 
                         Sir?

                                     COOCH
                         No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame 
                         that on your grandmother.

               Ray looks completely baffled now, swinging a look from Cooch 
               to Tully.

                                     TULLY
                         Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.
                              (scanning file)
                         French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and 
                         one-eighth American Indian.

                                     COOCH
                         Sioux Indian, right?

                                     RAY
                         I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --

                                     TULLY
                         -- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.

               Ray nods, looks from Tully to Cooch. What's going on here?

                                     TULLY
                         Ray, there's been a homicide out in 
                         an area known as The Badlands. Indian 
                         Reservation.

                                     COOCH
                         It's not the first. There's been 
                         several. And our field office in 
                         Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... 
                         none of the investigations have turned 
                         up jack shit.

                                     TULLY
                         The main problem is, Ray, these people 
                         are extremely distrustful of 
                         outsiders, non-Indians. Relations 
                         have not been amicable.

                                     COOCH
                         Different culture. Hard to penetrate. 
                         The Indians don't like white cops 
                         poking around. And that's why we're 
                         in a position where we have to bring 
                         in an American Indian agent.

               Tully straightens the edges of a bureau memorandum.

                                     TULLY
                         With an Indian representative out 
                         there, we hope to keep hostilities 
                         dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, 
                         Selective Operations Unit, and it'll 
                         be easier on Agent Couture if you 
                         can gain the people's trust and maybe --

                                     RAY
                         Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what 
                         you're saying... I've got a little 
                         Indian blood, that's true. But --
                              (laughing)
                         I am not an... an Indian. I can't 
                         just go in and --

                                     TULLY
                         -- your father was part Sioux.

               A beat. Ray lowers his eyes to the photos.

                                     RAY
                         I didn't know him, Sir. He passed 
                         away when I was six.

                                     COOCH
                         Seven.

               Ray looks up at Cooch. Another uneasy beat. Cooch lights a 
               cigarette as if lighting a cigarette was a science.

                                     COOCH
                         Don't worry about it, Ray. As long 
                         as the people have proof that we 
                         sent them one of their own, no one's 
                         gonna ask you to weave baskets or 
                         make it rain.

               Ray sits before the files and photos, looking unsure. He has 
               come to garner a promotion but has just been sent to The 
               Graveyard. Or in the FBI argot, Indian Country.

               Tully pivots his leather chair in a full circle and slaps an 
               assignment folder down in front of the young agent.

               EXT. THE GREAT PLAINS - SOUTH DAKOTA - DAWN

               The very landscape from opening image. Gentle waves of land, 
               rolling out to touch the Black Hills. The sun rises up out 
               of the distant silhouette like a waking God. HEARTBEAT DRUM. 
               Hypnotic.

               And then a car blows by, throwing up gravel and agate and 
               gypsum. ZOOOOM! Right by us. Gone.

               When a dense screen of red dust clears, an old, bent, metal 
               sign at roadside becomes visible. It reads, through punched 
               and rusted bullet holes: "Entering Bear Creek Indian 
               Reservation."

               HEARTBEAT DRUM calls in the high-pitched, mournful voices of 
               LAKOTA SINGERS. The same haunting song.

               INT. LE BARON - MOVING

               Cooch is at the wheel. Ray, passenger. His lap is a desk for 
               several folders, and he works through them as they drive. 
               Both agents eat a sandwich as they travel.

                                     RAY
                         Eight murders in less than a year. 
                         All of them Indian. All of them 
                         unsolved. Is the law a non-entity 
                         out here or what?

               Cooch opens a folder that sits between them, and taking his 
               eyes off the road for a dangerous five seconds, locates some 
               photos, and hands them to Ray. Ray's expression tells us 
               they are not pretty.

                                     COOCH
                         Those are two agents who went into a 
                         reservation a few years ago to serve 
                         a warrant. They were executed at 
                         close range. That one there is a 
                         police officer killed by the Mohawks 
                         up in Canada more recently.

                                     RAY
                         Jesus...

                                     COOCH
                         The agents who have worked out here 
                         say its like going into Nam. 
                         Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, 
                         foreign customs... and you never 
                         know when you might walk into a few 
                         rounds. They hold a lot of old anger 
                         for the white man out here.

               Ray considers this as he looks out at the unfamiliar terrain 
               while on the RADIO, a D.J. speaks in LAKOTA LANGUAGE. Ray... 
               back at Cooch, studying his face.

                                     RAY
                         Were you in Nam?

                                     COOCH
                         Airborne. That's where they used to 
                         get us agents from. Now we get 'em 
                         from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. 
                         Accountants and computer whiz-kids. 
                         Yuppies with guns.
                              (lights a smoke)
                         That's scary shit.

               Ray smiles, sets the AC on high.

                                     RAY
                         Not as scary as a Hoover man with a 
                         computer.

               Cooch throws a quick look Ray's way. And a smile. He 
               appreciates the sting of a right off a left.

                                     COOCH
                         Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've 
                         loved you. He'd love anybody who 
                         joined the bureau to, what was it? 
                         "To enforce the laws of my country 
                         and protect her interests"?

                                     RAY
                         You crashed my file?

                                     COOCH
                         No. I consulted it. We're going into 
                         Indian Country, I wanna know what 
                         kind of individual is covering my 
                         ass. Don't you?

               Ray has finished his sandwich. He wipes his hands on a 
               kerchief while taking in the sight of chalky buttes cramming 
               roadside.

                                     RAY
                         You've been in the bureau for thirty 
                         years. You survived The Hoov, the 
                         Black Panthers and Abscam. I don't 
                         see any bullet holes. That's good 
                         enough for me.

               Cooch looks at Ray, amused. He likes this guy. And then he 
               notices a look of growing consternation on his partner's 
               face.

               RAY'S POV - MOVING

               as they drive through the first settlement, a little, broken 
               and scattered community, littered with wrecked cars on blocks, 
               and overpopulated with hungry dogs. HEARTBEAT DRUM softly 
               under.

               SIX INDIAN CHILDREN with dirty but beautiful faces and long 
               blue black hair run alongside the car, curious. One of them 
               YELLS SOMETHING we don't understand.

               PAST the trading post -- a white man's store -- where SIX 
               OGLALA SIOUX -- four men, two women sit like wax figures, 
               only their eyes moving to light on the freshly waxed 
               government car.

               A little house has a tipi erected beside it. And a satellite 
               dish. The house beside that one has been half chopped away 
               to feed the wood stove.

               Poverty.

               EXT. BEAR CREEK COMMUNITY - RESERVATION - DAY

               The federal car drives out of the community and further into 
               vast bluffs and strange rock formations where it is swallowed, 
               leaving the ramshackle village in dust.

               A lone dog -- all its ribs showing -- chases, BARKING.

               EXT. BADLANDS - SHORT TIME LATER

               We are on the Moon. Or Israel. But not America. Not any 
               America we've ever seen. A thirty-mile eroded landscape of 
               dunes and crevices, soft rock strata and fossils. Barren. 
               And eerie. A LAKOTA DEATH SONG underscores the otherworldly 
               ambiance of this place as --

               SHOES scuff through the gumbo and multi-colored stones. Two 
               pair of black, spit-shined, lace-ups. Three. Tripping. 
               Scuffing. And then a fourth pair. But they are not loafers. 
               They are Georgio Brutini's and they belong to --

               Ray, as he and Cooch follow two Special Agents from the 
               regional office. SA MILES is about Cooch's age, balding. SA 
               SHERMAN is closer to Ray's age but instead of a suit like 
               the rest, he favors an army-green jacket. Neither is a South 
               Dakota shit-kicker but transplanted field agents. All four 
               shield their eyes with dark glasses, and here in the Badlands 
               it is wise because the sun makes dunes shimmy and craters 
               become faces. It plays mischief on the eye, making Ray and 
               Sherman nearly trip on --

               A DEAD BODY

               lying face down in the rainbow sand. Dried blood and horse 
               flies cover his blown out torso. The agents stand over him, 
               breathless from the rugged walk.

                                     COOCH
                         Who found him?

                                     MILES
                         Indian kids. Hunting fossils.

               Cooch studies the body from where he stands. Sherman hands a 
               file over to Ray.

                                     COOCH
                         Okay. I think Agent Levoi and I can 
                         proceed from here. What are your 
                         call signals?

                                     SHERMAN
                         PX-10 and 11. Anything we can do to 
                         help you out, just radio.

                                     COOCH
                         Good. Thanks, Guys.

               The agents start back through the Badlands. Ray is already 
               squatting a safe distance from the body, covering his nose 
               with a kerchief while looking in the file.

               Cooch takes a bended knee on the other side of the body. 
               Flies buzz on and around the corpse.

                                     RAY
                         Leo Fast Elk... Thirty seven... 
                         single... Member of the Tribal 
                         Council.

               Cooch makes a note then slowly circles the body. He holds a 
               hand out to Ray and the younger agent turns the file over.

                                     COOCH
                         Looks like Fast Elk wasn't fast enough 
                         to outrun that load. What do you 
                         make of the damage?

               Ray gets closer, swats at Flies with the folder.

                                     RAY
                         Six rounds. 357.

                                     COOCH
                         That's what it looks like, doesn't 
                         it? But that's what a ten gauge, 
                         choke-bored, shotgun will look like 
                         when it hits your lower back from 
                         five feet away.

               Ray looks up impressed. Cooch rises and walks off gingerly, 
               scanning the surroundings.

                                     RAY
                         Somebody was serious about doing 
                         this guy, that's for sure.

                                     COOCH
                         Ray.

               Cooch is standing ten feet away, staring at the ground. Ray 
               walks over, carefully. He follows Cooch's frown down at the 
               twisted layers of earth.

               ON THE GROUND

               a circle has been etched deep in the soft gumbo, and in the 
               center of the circle, a white eagle plume sticks straight 
               up, dancing in the wind.

               Cooch and Ray each lower themselves to their haunches to 
               study the strange sight. Cooch puts his reading glasses on, 
               stares at it. Then lights a cigarette.

               Ray hefts up a camera and begins CLICKING off shots. He starts 
               moving around it, taking shots at different angles. And then 
               the sound of a DISTANT MOTOR draws both agent's attention.

               POV:

               way out in the bizarre moonscape of eroded rock and earth, a 
               lone figure on a motorcycle bounces and grinds, born out of 
               a silvery heat mirage. It's fifty yards off but heading 
               straight for us. The HEARTBEAT DRUM.

               REVERSE - RAY AND COOCH try to make the figure out.

               IN THE BADLANDS

               the archaic mud-caked Harley chugs and stalls, spits and 
               choices, and begins an incredible drive straight up the steep 
               side of this natural wonder. At the throttle is an imposing 
               figure.

               WALTER CROW HORSE is a portly Indian in his late-thirties 
               with a black reservation hat worn low over a face that seems 
               to have been cast from a bust of Sitting Bull. Sitting Bull 
               with aviator shades. Denim jacket over checkered shirt. Faded 
               jeans. Well broken duct-taped boots. His hair is worn long 
               in tight duel braids.

               The rusted bike bajas up and down slopes, finally stalling 
               out, twenty feet or so from the murder site. Crow Horse swings 
               his bulk off the bike like dismounting a horse. He looks 
               around suspiciously then pulls a rolled-up blanket from the 
               carrier rack.

               LEO LITTLE SKY

               lies in death. Crow Horse's boots move in stealthily, creaking 
               like saddle leather.

               He squats and looks at the corpse... then looks around with 
               animal alertness. He reaches into the front pocket of his 
               jacket and pulls out some Bull Durham tobacco. He pinches 
               some and offers it to the four directions around the body.

               He then unrolls the blanket, begins to move the dead man... 
               sense something and wheels to see Cooch standing behind him, 
               one hand behind his back where his gun must be, and the other 
               hand holding up open wallet. The sun hits his badge.

                         Good morning.

               Crow Horse hawks his eyes onto a big rock, a full second 
               before Ray steps out, his .45 drawn but held at ease.

               Crow Horse slowly raises his arms as Ray moves up to him, 
               studying him.

                                     COOCH
                         Taking ol' Leo somewhere?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Leo's been out here too long, man. 
                         I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.

                                     RAY
                         This is a restricted area.

                         Check him out, Ray.

               Ray frisks the Indian, finds an old leather wallet, and then 
               a gun. A .38.

                                     COOCH
                         Nice piece. You come back here to

                         your name?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         It ain't Geronimo.

                         I think maybe you guys got off the 
                         wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear 
                         Creek Indian Reservation.

               Cooch walks around to the front of Crow Horse, and studies 
               him.

                                     COOCH

                         I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born

                                     RAY
                         I did.

                                     COOCH
                         Who the fuck is he?

                                     RAY
                         -- a fucking cop.

               A pause. A long, dead of South Dakota, Badlands pause. Cooch 
               turns and looks at Ray who holds up the open wallet, revealing 
               a badge. Like Cooch's it shines in the sun.

                                     RAY
                         Walter Crow Horse. Tribal Police.

               Cooch stands staring at the Indian... then takes a few steps 
               over to Ray and grabs the wallet. He examines it. Then looks 
               at Crow Horse and laughs.

                                     COOCH
                         He's a fucking cop.

               The Indian cop has plenty of time to get up on his own but 
               he kneels there, tauntingly, waiting for Ray to help him. 
               Ray walks over and offers a hand. Crow Horse takes it, and 
               pulls himself up, looking square into Ray's sunglasses.

               Cooch walks over and hands the officer his wallet, and his 
               .23. Crow Horse takes the items, eyeing the older agent.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         We got the wire ya was comin'. You're 
                         the Indian official, yeah?

                                     COOCH
                         No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...
                              (searching his 
                              imagination)
                         Ray... Little Weasel.

               Ray does a take but quickly recovers, meeting Crow Horse's 
               scrutinizing gaze. Crow Horse nods to Ray, and Ray nods back 
               in case it's the Indian thing to do. Crow Horse nods again. 
               Ray nods again.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother.

                         Tell him, Ray.

               Ray stares at Crow Horse, uneasy. The wind sings through the 
               Badlands.

                                     RAY
                         Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.

                         Good. Thank you.

               Crow Horse says something in Sioux to Ray. Ray just stares.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         I said when can Leo be taken to 
                         ceremony?

                                     RAY
                         After we've completed our 
                         investigation.

               Crow Horse is staring at Ray.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         That's a nice suit.

               Ray looks offended. Cooch puts a hand on Crow Horse's shoulder 
               and walks him toward his beat-up motorcycle.

                                     COOCH
                         Somebody must be doing something

                         Officer Crow Foot.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         You ain't gonna cut his hands off 
                         and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? 
                         They done that to one of our girls

                         need his hands.

               Crow Horse turns and looks at Ray. Ray is quick this time.

                                     RAY
                         Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. 
                         He does quillwork.

                         I think Leo's retired from quillwork 
                         for the moment.

               Crow Horse appears to be getting on his bike when suddenly 
               he moves like a cat and lays his knife to the dead man's 
               head. He cuts away a patch of hair.

                                     COOCH
                         What the hell you doing?!

                         His mother needs a piece of his hair. 
                         It's for the Keeping of the Souls

                         Has to be kept for four days.

               Cooch and Ray stand there, watching Crow Horse mount his 
               bike and push off down a nasty slope back through the 
               Badlands. He starts his motor. It dies. Then starts again.

                                     COOCH
                         Keeping of the souls. Do they still 
                         burn their dead or something?

                                     RAY
                         Beats the hell outta me.

               Ray and Cooch look off across the Badlands, as far out of 
               their element as they can be.

               CLOSE ON - THE WHITE EAGLE PLUME

               in the circle in the sand, fluttering in the wind.

               The gold spit-shined Le Baron eases to a crawl, passing an 
               old wooden sign. "Leaving Bear Creak Indian Reservation."

               And immediately pulling in front of a squat old bar with a 
               burned out neon Miller light. DWIGHT YOAKUM croons "Youuuuuu-
               Got-Your Little-Ways" on the jukebox from inside.

               The Buffalo Butte bar has several cracked and sun-bleached 
               buffalo skulls hanging off the edge of its flat roof and big 
               faded white letters painted across the front read: "No Indians 
               Allowed."

               (This sign actually exists today in the res-line border town 
               of Scenic, South Dakota). The car pulls up beside a pick-up 
               and parks. Ray and Cooch step out, careful to walk wide around 
               a PITBULL in the bed of the truck.

               A WHITE LOCAL walks out of the bar and looks askance at the 
               suits. As the two feds approach the bar, Cooch looks up at 
               the warning sign. Ray sees it too.

                                     COOCH
                         Sorry, Ray. You're gonna have to 
                         wait in the car. I'll bring you out 
                         a cheeseburger.

               The young agent smiles, amused, starts to enter the bar but --

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Hey!

               Ray spins quickly, paranoid about entering. But the man 
               calling to them is --

               An Indian himself. TRIBAL PRESIDENT OLIVER CLEAR MOON, a 
               small man in his late fifties who peers out at the agents 
               through fat bifocals. He wears a straw cowboy hat, red 
               windbreaker and his hair is cut short, or "bobtailed" as the 
               Indians say.

               Clear Moon is walking away from a parked pick-up truck, toward 
               the white men, eyeing the two with deep curiosity.

                                     CLEAR MOON
                              (heavy Indian accent)
                         You made it. Was-te.

               Cooch discreetly peeks into a folder as he walks toward the 
               man

                                     COOCH
                         You must be... President Clear Bone.

                                     CLEAR MOON
                         Clear Moon.
                              (pointing to the sky)
                         Moon. You must be the Sioux.

               He is pointing his long, skinny finger at Cooch.

                                     COOCH
                         No. That's Ray here. Ray...

                                     RAY
                              (quickly)
                         Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.

               Clear Moon beholds the young agent with hopeful eyes, a smile 
               breaking across his flaccid brown skin. He takes Ray's hand 
               in a respectful double-clutch and grips him tightly... almost 
               desperately.

                                     CLEAR MOON
                         It's about time they sent us one of 
                         our own. Was-te.

               He keeps pumping Ray's hand, looking into his face with great 
               admiration. Cooch looks on with amusement.

                                     CLEAR MOON
                         Things are no good here. It is like 
                         war zone. We need an official who 
                         understands what is good for the 
                         Indian people. Who knows Indian way.

               Clear Moon has not released Ray's arm as he leads them to a 
               string of seedy motel units across the street.

                                     RAY
                         I thought we were staying on the 
                         reservation.

                                     CLEAR MOON
                         Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are 
                         on Indian land.

                                     RAY
                         I see.

                                     CLEAR MOON
                         Are you hungry? I have some nice raw 
                         kidney in the truck.

                                     RAY
                         Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.

                                     COOCH
                         He's starving, Mr. Clear Moon. Get 
                         him some raw kidney. He hasn't had 
                         any Indian food in days...

               And Clear Moon guides them through the front door of room 
               13. Ray looks over his shoulder threateningly at Cooch who 
               winks and pats his back.

               EXT. RESERVATION LINE - NIGHT

               A lone headlight appears out of the black. HEARTBEAT DRUM. 
               But faster. Relentless. A "res" car, a dented, rusted, peeling 
               old station wagon, drives slowly toward the reservation.

               Then suddenly, someone steps in front of the car. A BIG MAN 
               in cowboy boots and blue jeans.

               INT. MOTEL - ROOM 13 - NIGHT

               Ray lies in bed. Awake. He is hanging off the bed with a 
               file open on the floor and using the moon to light photos 
               and memorandums. And then he hears LAUGHTER outside. And 
               GLASS BREAK.

               He gets out of bed quickly, snatching up his pants, putting 
               their on, and going to the window.

               POV - OUT WINDOW:

               SEVERAL LOCALS out in front of the bar help a middle-aged 
               INDIAN MAN out of the station wagon.

                                     WHITE LOCAL
                         Where you goin'? Back to the res?

               A young local bends down behind the Indian while another 
               shoves him, sending him tripping over the bent man and onto 
               his back in the dirt.

                                     WHITE LOCAL
                         What ya doin'? You drunk?

               MORE LOCALS come out from the bar, beers and drinks and 
               interested in what's going on.

               REVERSE - RAY

               at the window, observes. Cooch enters from the connecting 
               room, puffy-eyed but quickly buttoning his shirt. He shares 
               Ray's view.

                                     COOCH
                         Let's take a walk.

               Ray is transfixed.

               EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - NIGHT

               The Indian man, is pushed into a stumble, and caught by 
               another white man as a little game of catch takes place. 
               Cooch, stepping into the circle, shirt half unbuttoned, hair 
               a mess, looks on. Then steps in front of a big local and 
               catches the Indian as he comes stumbling. He holds onto him, 
               looking at the faces that turn his way. Ray steps up beside 
               him, looking tense.

                                     COOCH
                         What's goin' on here?
                              (a beat)
                         I can't walk across the goddamn street 
                         without some breed-ass fallin' all 
                         over me?

               And then Cooch shoves the Indian with all his might back 
               across the road. The locals resume their fun, and Cooch looks 
               at a local man and shares a chattering laugh that makes Ray 
               do a serious take.

                                     COOCH
                         Watch out now, he wants a kiss, Ray, 
                         wants a kiss --

               The Indian ends up stumbling back toward Ray, and Ray catches 
               him this time. The man maintains a perfect vacant expression 
               and keeps acting as though nothing of the sort is happening. 
               But he is dizzy, and exhausted, and Ray keeps him from 
               falling.

               Cooch looks at Ray. Their eyes meet. Ray shoves the man 
               forward. This time, instead of catching him, the local on 
               the receiving end, hauls off and punches him in the face. 
               The Indian drops.

               Cooch runs in, grabs the Indian under the arms and drags him 
               back to his car.

                                     COOCH
                         Go ahead, skin, get your ass back on 
                         your sacred land. Get outta here.

               He shoves him behind the wheel as the locals crowd around. 
               They don't see Cooch throw the wheel stick in drive, and 
               lean into the man's ear.

                                     COOCH
                         Get outta here. Drive.

               Cooch slams the door, and kicks it, and the vehicle lurches 
               forward. A beer can clanks off the rear window, and rolls 
               clanking into the middle of the road.

               Ray stands there with the locals as they all watch the car 
               drive off across the reservation line. Cooch, belly sticking 
               out of his unbuttoned shirt, and a breathless smile on his 
               face, heads to the bar without breaking stride. This man has 
               done "underground" before.

               INT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - NIGHT - SHORT TIME LATER

               Cooch and Ray sit in a booth with DENNIS VAUGHN, a strapping 
               local man, ranch-raised, and gentlemanly. In fact, downright 
               likeable.

                                     DENNIS
                         So what type of salesmen are you 
                         gentlemen anyway?

                                     RAY
                         Liquor. We heard they like their 
                         drink on the reservation, and we 
                         were gonna see if we couldn't unload 
                         some surplus on the way to Nebraska.

                                     COOCH
                         Now keep that between us, Dennis, 
                         cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny 
                         Law they got here.

                                     DENNIS
                         Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want 
                         you to meet a coupla fellas from 
                         Denver.

               BROOKS, a small, older man with a feed store cap and a clean 
               cowboy shirt, comes over with a beer and a pensive look on 
               his face. He pulls up a chair and positions himself at the 
               end of the booth.

                                     DENNIS
                         Liquor salesmen. Be nice to them, 
                         maybe they'll give you a sample of 
                         some of that gin you like.
                              (to Ray)
                         He likes that Russian shit that --

                                     BROOKS
                         They ain't liquor salesmen. They're 
                         FBI.

               Cooch and Ray don't flinch. Dennis does. He looks between 
               the two, cautiously.

                                     COOCH
                         Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow 
                         like you, doing in a joint like this? 
                         Let me buy you a glass of some of 
                         that Russian shit you like.

                                     DENNIS
                         FBI? What you investigatin'?

                                     COOCH
                         A murder. On the reservation.

                         Again. Figures, man.

                                     BROOKS
                         You'll never find out who did it.

                                     COOCH
                         You underestimate me, Brooks.

                                     BROOKS
                         No. You underestimate these grass 
                         niggers. They're killing each other. 
                         That's all they do. Get drunk and 
                         kill each other. Then cover for each 
                         other. Who gives a damn really as 
                         long as they stay on their 
                         reservation. You ask me, the 
                         government shouldn't care one 
                         particle.

                                     DENNIS
                         You know how in your big cities, you 
                         got your niggers and you got your 
                         Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got 
                         Indians. That's just the way it is.

                                     COOCH
                         The only good Indian is a dead Indian, 
                         does that old adage still hold true 
                         out here?

               Cooch laughs good-naturedly. Ray smiles. But Brooks looks 
               offended.

                                     BROOKS
                         That set-to you saw out front, was 
                         nothin' more than a message we were 
                         sendin' to the sonsabitches that are 
                         divertin' water from the river.

                                     DENNIS
                         We got rights. We got a ranch just 
                         up here.

               Ray catches this. Glances a look off Cooch who works on a 
               cold draught beer.

                                     RAY
                         Did any of you gentlemen know Leo 
                         Fast Elk?

               Both men shake their heads. Get quiet.

                                     BROOKS
                         You fellas are here to investigate a 
                         Indian crime, you should keep to 
                         Indian land, and talk to them, not 
                         us. But you wanna drink here and 
                         shoot stick here, that's your right, 
                         and we respect that.
                              (to Dennis)
                         Come on, Son, we're up on the table.

                                     DENNIS
                         You fellas wanna play doubles?

               Cooch shakes his head, distracted, and the two locals leave, 
               enroute for the pool table. Ray watches them go, curious.

               EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - NIGHT

               Ray and Cooch, cross the street back to the motel. It is 
               black and chillingly still.

                                     RAY
                         Water. Worth killing for out here,

                                     RAY
                         I already did.

               Cooch looks at Ray, impressed.

                                     RAY
                         Couldn't sleep.

                         Good.

               They stop in front of their rooms and Cooch pulls a small 
               tape recorder from his waistband. A micro-cassette recorder 
               that he examines in the dim door light.

                                     RECORDER
                              (locals)
                         -- out here we got our Indians. And 
                         that's the way it is.

               Cooch shuts it off.

                                     COOCH
                         By the time you get to the main

                         fraternize. Socialize. Penetrate. 
                         Infiltrate. Eat some raw kidney, and 
                         get these Indians talking. I'm gonna 
                         Powwow with Big Chief Clear Moon and 
                         find out more about Leo.

               He hands Ray the recorder.

                                     RAY
                         Done.

               Cooch starts for his room but in a long, exaggerated country 
               step as he breaks into the HANK WILLIAMS tune that has all 
               but driven him insane inside the joint. Ray watches him go, 
               and cracks a laugh.

               INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING - SUNRISE

               Ray's at the wheel, looks intense as he studies the vast 
               expanse of slopes and rock formations and the rising sphere 
               of flame that lights the road in strange color. He is reading 
               a name list that he traps against the wheel.

               Ray pulls up a long dirt drive and parks.

               EXT. OLD TRAILER - ACROSS FROM BADLANDS  SUNRISE

               Ray walks to the front door of a war-torn trailer that is 
               halfway swallowed by weeds and plants. It is static out here. 
               Dead still. Ray approaches the front door. There is a huge 
               hole in it. He knocks above the hole.

               After a moment, the door opens a crack. A dark, weather-beaten 
               face barely shows.

                                     RAY

                         --Dreamer.

               Ray stands there for a moment then lowers himself to look 
               through the huge hole in the door.

                                     RAY
                         Sir?

               A tattered chair is pushed against the door, covering the 
               hole. Ray stands up, turns on the steps. And before he can 
               let out a flustered sigh, he spots something across the dirt 
               road. Something that makes him remove his shades, look again. 
               Whatever it is, it doesn't make him happy, and he is hurrying 
               across the road.

               EXT. BADLANDS - DAY

               A motorcycle, parked between the road and the badlands. We've 
               seen the ancient bike before. Ray walks past it, looking at 
               it.

               He pushes his shades up on the bridge of his nose and looks 
               down into the moonscape.

               Walter Crow Horse is down there, on his haunches, "feel 
               tracking", laying his fingers inside tracks and reading them. 
               He doesn't even look up at the sound of the FBI agent's 
               footsteps.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Ray Little Weasel. FBI. I like the 
                         way ya sneaked up on me. Must be 
                         Indian.

               The wind whistles and moans through the Badlands as Crow 
               Horse continues feel tracking.

                                     RAY
                         What are you --

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Watch out!

               Ray draws back.

                                     RAY
                         What?!

                                     CROW HORSE
                         You're steppin' on sign.

               Crow Horse lowers his face to the ground and blows some 
               scattered dust out of a print. Lightly lays his fingers inside

                                     RAY
                         Hey.
                              (ignored)
                         Hey, you, listen up --

                                     CROW HORSE
                         -- Leo wasn't killed here. He was 
                         dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald 
                         tread. Muffler held on with baling 
                         wire.

               Crow Horse checks out another track.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         The man you want... stepped outta 
                         the car, dragged Leo out, laid him 
                         down. Then walked over here and made 
                         a circle in the earth with a stick. 
                         I can't find the stick. He stuck an 
                         eagle plume in the circle, got back 
                         in his car, dustin' his own prints 
                         with a pine bough for about six feet, 
                         but he missed a print, right here, 
                         see. He got in his car and went Hell-
                         bent-for-Holy-Sunday outta here. He 
                         ditched that pine bough three miles 
                         across the flat, in the Little Bear 
                         River, it floated down to 
                         Thundershield Gap. The car hit paved 
                         road, and was outta here.

               Crow Horse rises, points down the road.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         The killin' was done where Leo's 
                         mother lives. But he was driven here 
                         into these Badlands.

               Ray is frowning at the big Indian, trying to get a fix on 
               this

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth 
                         of that print, pressure releases... 
                         I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --

                                     RAY
                         Bullshit.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         -- Well, maybe two-seventeen.

                                     RAY
                         You're trying to tell me you can 
                         read all that from a track?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         No. Not just a track. You gotta listen 
                         to the trees, man. To the leaves. To 
                         this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. 
                         You gotta listen to the earth.

                                     RAY
                         Is that right? Well, listen to this: 
                         drag your ass. This is a restricted 
                         area.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         No, this is the home of the Oglala 
                         Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who 
                         killed Leo. Whether you get him or I 
                         get him, I just want him. Shit's

                         Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow 
                         Horse, but I just flew in from a 
                         place called the Twentieth Century 
                         where we have such things as 
                         electrostatic tracking methods, 
                         psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; 
                         I don't have to crawl around with 
                         the scorpions and talk to the fucking 
                         trees to get answers. Leo was killed 
                         right here.

                         how chicken feed got in there. Trust 
                         me, there ain't chickens in the

                         -- his mother never lived here. She 
                         was from up in North Dakota.

                         To us Indians, our spiritual relatives 
                         are as close as family. I've got 
                         seven mothers on this reservation.

                         Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. 
                         I'm giving you a break. But if my 
                         partner finds out you're here, you're

                         Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.

               Crow Horse walks back up toward the road.

               Ray lets him leave then crouches where Crow Horse was, begins 
               looking at tracks.

                                     CROW HORSE (O.S.)
                         Hey, Little Weasel.

               Ray turns, and sees Crow Horse perched on a high bank -- the 
               one Ray came down -- and he's in a tracking stance.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         You weigh one sixty-three, yeah? Not 
                         a beer drinker. You're one of these 
                         tofu and pilaf characters. Pack your 
                         gun, under your coat -- left shoulder. 
                         But you got backup; a little .32, 
                         .38 maybe, in a ankle holster that 
                         gives you a right foot drag, Shoes 
                         are too tight at the toe but, man, 
                         they look cool. And that's what 
                         counts.

               Ray just stands frozen, blown away. Crow Horse rises, dusting 
               off his hands, and heading to his vehicle.

                                     RAY
                         Crow Horse.

               The Indian turns. The wind moans. Ray scrutinizes him, 
               deliberating.

                                     RAY
                         Fuck you.

               Crow Horse grins and waves, and ambles away. DOWN IN

               THE BADLANDS

               Ray stands, sweating under his suit jacket, and not sure if 
               he's amazed or pissed off.

               EXT MAISY BLUE LEGS HOUSE  BLACK TAIL DISTRICT - DAY

               A trailer sits off from the river in beaten solitude. There 
               are two junked cars and one burned black.

               Wind blows across deep bald tire tracks. Ray walks slowly 
               beside them, surveying, following them to a place where they 
               become puckers and skids next to a dilapidated outhouse. 
               There is a shotgun blast in the side of it. Ray studies it, 
               enters the outhouse. Exits, and walks the rutted gumbo earth 
               to where it meets rolling hills of golden grass. He stands 
               here, mesmerized.

               CHICKENS scratch around in the dirt.

               Like so many far-off res homesteads, this is a haunting place. 
               Made more so by a persistent SQUEAKING, a rusty, metallic 
               squeal coming from --

               A WATER PUMP

               across the yard, where MAISY BLUE LEGS, a Sioux elder, works 
               the handle. She wears thick bifocals and keeps her hair under 
               a bandanna. No water comes forth from the pump, and she tries 
               again and again until she breaks a sweat. And then she sees 
               the waal'cu standing out there.

               Urgently, she turns and starts back to her trailer with an 
               empty coffee can.

               Ray starts after her.

                                     RAY
                         Mrs... Blue Legs? Can I ask you a 
                         few questions --

                                     MAISY
                              (1/3 res speed)
                         -- go away. Leave us alone...

                                     RAY
                         Ma'am, Please --

               She mounts the metal steps. Ray is losing her. He gets a 
               foot on the bottom step, and attempts something he does not 
               want to do.

                                     RAY
                         Mrs. Blue Legs. I'm Indian.

               Halfway through the screendoor, Maisy turns and looks at the 
               young man in suit and shades.

                                     RAY
                         I'm Sioux.

               Maisy lowers her bifocals, studies him. Then walks in, slaps 
               the door shut, and locks it. A towel hung as a shade folds 
               down.

               Ray lingers at the bottom of the steps.

                                     RAY
                         Yeah, right.

               And he walks around the side of the trailer, looking at the 
               ground. In the gaping space between the trailer blocks, and 
               the grass, there is much junk stored, and Ray kneels to look. 
               He is drawn to a pair of cowboy boots, caked with dried mud. 
               He picks up a boot, looks at the sole, then touches the mud. 
               His fingers break through the hardened crust and come back 
               moist and blue. He looks at this sniffs it. There is a tense, 
               water-torture like tempo coming from the old pump where water 
               barely drips onto a hub cap in the dirt. Ray sets the boot 
               down. Goes to grab the other boot and --

               a WESTERN DIAMOND BACK RATTLER coils out from the shade of 
               the boot, RATTLING and HISSING from white mouth and three-
               inch fangs, and Ray has done a backflip and roll, slapping 
               his shoulder holster and pulling lead and BLAM! BLAAAM! he 
               unloads two, and the reptile is so dead, there's not even 
               enough snake left to make a truck-stop key chain.

               He kneels there, flushed in the face, holding his breath and 
               double-clutching his gun. The SHOTS ECHO through the Badlands 
               like the aftermath of dynamite. From inside the trailer, he 
               can hear CRYING. A low moaning. Praying softly.

                                     RAY
                         Shit. Mrs. Blue Legs! It's okay!

               Then his RADIO CRACKS IN.

                                     RADIO (COOCH)
                         X21, give me a 20.

               Ray looks relieved.

                         Cooch. You're my hero.

               Ray looks down at the dead snake, still rushed from it, and 
               he hurries out of there.

               IN THE SHADE OF THE TRAILER

               the snake's RATTLE moves spasmodically, still kicking with 
               reflex.

               EXT. LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - BEAR CREEK RES - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON an AMERICAN FLAG, flapping in the hot night wind. 
               But something is wrong about the image. The flag is hung 
               upside lit by --

               A full moon that also illuminates an overgrown field that 
               fronts a small, one-level house where the flag hangs. Three 
               old cars decorate the front yard. A busted screendoor creaks 
               in the wind, and somewhere off in the hills, a DOG BARKS 
               away his boredom.

               little place far down a dirt road on the outskirts of the 
               settlement.

               Cooch has the suspect's file on his knee.

                                     RAY

               He hands an open file over to Ray.

               fist-raising Indians, yelling at the camera.

                         The progressive Indians don't like 
                         them because they want everybody to 
                         go back to the old Indian ways, and 
                         the old way Indians don't like them

               RAY SHUFFLES TO

               PHOTO 2 -- a big Indian in a wheel chair, holding a rifle. 
               He is shirtless under a vest and on his muscular right 
               shoulder there is a clearly defined tattoo of a circle with 
               an eagle feather through it.

               PHOTO 3 -- a Close Up of the tattoo.

               PHOTO 4 -- a propaganda flyer with the letters W.A.R.N. and 
               the same symbol -- perfect circle, pierced by a white eagle 
               feather.

                                     RAY
                         White eagle feather through the 
                         circle. That's their symbol.

                                     COOCH
                         That's right.

               Ray shuffles through more of the same with great interest.

                                     RAY
                         They obviously wanted it to be known 
                         that they offed Leo. Some kind of 
                         statement.

                         Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head 
                         through a glass door of the tribal 
                         offices three months ago. And 
                         threatened him several times since. 
                         President Clear Moon and the regional 
                         FBI feel he made good on that threat.

               Cooch takes a long, tight breath then turns around in his 
               seat, coming up with an M-16. Ray lifts one of his own. He 
               looks out the car window.

                                     RAY
                         I'd just like five minutes alone 
                         with the motherfucker who hung that 
                         flag upside down.

                         Alright. Alright.

               Cooch whacks a top clip into the M-16. Ray slams a clip in 
               his.

               LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - CLOSER - NIGHT

               and Ray maneuver toward the house, rifles ready. Cooch gets 
               under the picture window, sneaks a look. Nothing. He follows 
               Ray around the side.

               POV:

               off in a backfield, lit by a hot fire, a small round hut 
               covered in patchwork quilts, canvas and buffalo hide. A 
               strange mist floats around it, and from inside, voices are 
               heard -- A DRUMMING AND CHANTING in LAKOTA. And EAGLE SOUNDS. 
               Dozens of shrill whistles. Are there birds inside this thing?

               REVERSE - RAY

               and Cooch, kneeling in the weeds, look dumbfounded. And more 
               than a little unnerved.

                                     RAY
                              (whispering)
                         What the hell is that?

               NEAR THE INIPI LODGE

               An INDIAN YOUTH DOOR TENDER with shoulder length hair falling 
               over a T-shirt, steps out of the dark and walks to the fire. 
               He prods it with a broken pitch fork.

               He turns to get some more wood and walks right into an M-16, 
               trained chest level. Ray stares him down.

                                     RAY
                         On the ground.

               The boy drops boot camp fast.

               Cooch moves up on the sweat lodge, looking quizzically at 
               it, trying to figure out how to open it. He grabs a canvas 
               flap at the front and after a moment's hesitation and a look 
               at Ray, he tears the flap away.

               A BLAST OF 200 DEGREE STEAM explodes forth and Cooch dances 
               back, throwing up his rifle.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                              (inside lodge)
                         Mitakue Oyasin!

               GRANDPA SAMUEL REACHES, a rail-thin Sioux elder, appears 
               through the steam like a vision. Bent in the tiny doorway, 
               he searches out the interruption.

               Cooch aims the M-16 at the old man.

                                     COOCH
                         This is the FBI! Come on out of there 
                         nice and slow. Let's move it! Hands 
                         on your head!

               Grandpa Reaches crawls out first, ignoring the "Hands on 
               your head" order from Cooch. His eyes move back and forth 
               between the two agents.

               FIVE MORE INDIANS, from 16-45 come out, looking confused. 
               Cooch makes the towel-wrapped men spread out in a line. The 
               old man is speaking to the others in LAKOTA, and Ray steps 
               up to him, cuts him off.

                                     RAY
                         Hands on your head, Sir. Come on, 
                         come on...

               The archaic figure just looks through him. Starts to walk 
               away. Ray takes his thin arm. He locks eyes with the old 
               man. Slowly, he obeys, raising his hands and laying them on 
               his head.

               From the lodge, the last man emerges. It's Crazy Horse reborn 
               out of the burning sage. JIMMY LOOKS TWICE is in his mid-
               thirties -- big, well over two-hundred pounds. But lean. His 
               braids fall nearly to his hips. His face is handsome but at 
               the moment, twisted in a full-blood's scowl.

                                     LOOKS TWICE
                              (outraged)
                         What are you doing?

                         That's right. What are you doing 
                         here? This is a religious ceremony 
                         you're desecrating.

               Looks Twice shoots hawk-like black eyes onto Ray.

                                     RAY
                         We're FBI, James. We just need to 
                         ask you a few questions.

                                     LOOKS TWICE
                         We are in the middle of a sweat lodge 
                         ceremony. Do you drag people out of 
                         your churches when they're in the 
                         middle of prayer?

                         Let's take a walk, Jimmy. Come on.

               Cooch takes a careful step behind Jimmy and cuffs him. Looks 
               Twice speaks to the others in LAKOTA, and they disband, 
               heading to a shade arbor where their clothes hang.

               As Cooch starts marching Looks Twice toward the house, Ray 
               keeps an eye on the departing. One of them stops halfway to 
               the fence and turns. Grandpa Reaches looks at Ray with eyes 
               that have seen one hundred and one hard years in Indian 
               Country.

                                     RAY
                         Go ahead. You can all go home.

               And he follows Cooch and the cuffed Jimmy to the house.

                                     COOCH
                         We just wanna take a look around

                         bust your balls.

               AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE

               Cooch leads the half-naked suspect to the backdoor. Cooch 
               show: a warrant, tries the door but it is locked.

                                     LOOKS TWICE

                         the key?

               Jimmy doesn't answer. He glares with hatred into Cooch's 
               eyes.

                                     COOCH
                         Ray, use the federal master key.

               Ray steps up, gets ready to throw a frontkick at the door.

                                     LOOKS TWICE
                         No. Don't do that. Don't deface the 
                         property, man. The key's in there.

               With his hands cuffed, he can only jerk his head toward a 
               big hole in the wall down near the foundation. Cooch quickly 
               drops to a knee and checks out the hole.

                                     LOOKS TWICE
                         Inside... in the coffee can.

               Cooch reaches in, probes.

                         There's no coffee can in --

               Something horrifying happens so fast, Cooch has no time to 
               react.

               Whatever has taken his arm has done so with such force, his 
               body jolts like he's touched raw voltage. The South Dakota 
               BADGER rips through his leather jacket -- we get a glimpse 
               of its striped face and yellowed teeth -- through his shirt. 
               Through flesh, and deeper, GROWLING insanely while COOCH 
               HOLLERS in shock tries to pull free and --

               Jimmy Looks Twice spins from the porch with a skillfully 
               executed back kick, knocking Ray off the step and to the 
               ground. The Indian bolts like a deer into the darkness.

               Ray rolls in the grass, throwing his M-16 up. He hesitates. 
               But only for a moment before FIRING and decimating the corner 
               gutter, a junked car, several trees. But no sign of Jimmy.

               Cooch falls back in the grass badly mauled. His arm has been 
               ripped open down to the bone.

                                     COOCH
                         Jesus... Jesus...

               Ray starts toward Cooch.

                                     COOCH
                         Get him...

               Ray takes off, crashing through weeds, into a stream, wading 
               through mud. He throws his flashlight left and right. He 
               crosses the river, shines the light in a field of wild sage. 
               Nothing. He runs like a sprinter, looking everywhere. But as 
               he enters an --

               OPEN FIELD

               all he finds is Jimmy's towel. He picks it up and looks around 
               the area, breathing heavily.

               And then suddenly, something leaps up out of the grass. Ray 
               swings his M-16 up, ready to blast. But it is a DEER, taking 
               off into a mystical blue night. THE DRUM. Beating fast. Heavy.

               TURTLESHELL RATTLE. EAGLE BONE WHISTLES.

               Cooch traps his bleeding arm between his knees to stanch the 
               blood. He speaks quietly but firm into his radio, trying to 
               stay in control.

               EXT. BEAR CREEK RESERVATION - LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE

               A mind-blowing Aurora. Living clouds. The incredible mesa. 
               PULLING BACK slowly to the dirt road where a line of federal 
               aerials high, enter Indian Country.

               HEARTBEAT DRUM. But a fast heartbeat. A relentless pulse 
               throughout --

               AN FBI SATURATION SEARCH

               FOUR AGENTS surround a little tar-paper shack, rifles up and 
               ready. Two go in, and flush out an OLD WOMAN, an OLD MAN, 
               and some TEN CHILDREN. DOGS.

               A SMALL TRAILER that has thirty junked cars in its yard and 
               serves as a reservation parts store is crawling with FEDERAL 
               MARSHALS; car doors are being opened, trunks. TRACKING DOGS 
               run through the cars. WARPATH DRUMS...

               -- A BELL UH 1-B "HUEY" HELICOPTER chutters low over the 
               grasslands, over the Badlands, flattening wheat. It swings 
               down over the main settlement. CHILDREN gather in the street 
               to look up at it but then run when --

               -- SIX FEDERAL CARS come down the main road. They pass by --

               -- THE FRONT PORCH OF THE TRADING POST where Ray stands, 
               talking to the elders. A few of the same from earlier but 
               several new ones.

               He is sweat-drenched, and has shed his jacket and tie. He is 
               showing them photos of Jimmy but getting no response. And 
               then, for a little iodine on top of that, a MOTORCYCLE ENGINE, 
               spitting and choking and coughing comes around the corner, 
               Walter Crow Horse, manning the handlebars.

               He pulls up to Ray and just looks at him. DRUMS FADE.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya 
                         walk like a penguin with a hard-on.

                                     RAY
                         Is that right? What are the trees 
                         saying today?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         They're sayin' that nobody's gonna 
                         talk to you cuz they don't give away 
                         one of their own. But they did say 
                         there's somebody way across the Little 
                         Walking River who wants to talk to 
                         you.

               Ray soaks sweat off his forehead as he eyes the Indian on 
               this one. He sees himself in the polaroid shades.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         He sent me to find ya. He says he's 
                         got information.

                                     RAY
                         Let's go.

               Ray quickly leaves the porch.

               EXT. GRANDPA SAM REACHES TRAILER - OUTSIDE SETTLEMENT - DAY

               Silent. The unnerving silence of the Great Plains filled 
               only by FLYS, big horseflies, buzzing around drying sage 
               that hangs from the rafters of a shade arbor. A GOAT stands 
               under it, just gazing across --

               the vast spread of grass and dry land where an ancient 
               Airstream trailer sits lop-sided. Sheets are hung as curtains. 
               Six old cars -- two from the early 50'a -- sit stripped to 
               the hubs on blocks in the overgrown grass. The air is dry 
               and heavy and the only sound is --

               FLYS. Ray swats at them as he steps over a truck seat that 
               lies in the grass, stuffing and springs hanging out. Crow 
               Horse walk. a few steps ahead, toward the trailer.

                                     CROW HORSE
                              (with reverence)
                         Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty 
                         medicine.

                                     RAY
                         Medicine. As in medicine man?

               Crow Horse nods slowly, looking at Ray in a very serious 
               manner

                                     RAY
                         Why does he wanna see me?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Good question. Hardly sees anybody 
                         anymore. Hasn't left this place in 
                         twenty years. Did you bring some 
                         tobacco?

               Crow Horse stops walking, making Ray do the same.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         When you go see an elder, you always 
                         bring some tobacco as a gift.

               Ray reaches into his shirt pocket and fishes out a pack of 
               Marlboro. Crow Horse glances at it, and shrug-nods. They 
               continue on toward the trailer.

               INT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER

               Grandpa Samuel Reaches sits in a taped and tuckered easy 
               chair, his alert black eyes moving from side to side. We 
               recognize him from the sweat lodge ceremony at Looks Twice' 
               although today he wears a straw cowboy hat giving him a more 
               youthful look despite a face like a map of the Badlands.

               He wears a vest over a western shirt, baggy work slacks, old 
               cowboy boots.

               His brown wrinkled hands run over the top of the Marlboro 
               pack as if he's reading braille.

               Crow Horse sits across from him on a stool. Ray leans on one 
               of the plain green walls, looking uncomfortable. A three 
               foot adhesive fly strip hangs from the ceiling, thick with 
               dead ones. There is a black and white TV with Sesame Street 
               wailing, honking and guffawing through static.

               Grandpa fixes his eyes on Ray for only split seconds at a 
               time but one gets the feeling he's doing an incredibly deep 
               reading of the young man. Slowly, he sits up -- focusing 
               intensely on Ray.

               He begins to speak. A hoarse, strained, string of LAKOTA, 
               spoken like it used to be, gesturing toward Ray. When he 
               finishes, he sits back in his chair. Ray looks intrigued.

                                     RAY
                         What did he say?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         He wants to know if you ever watch 
                         the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie 
                         Monster is not to be trusted -- a 
                         trickster.

               Ray looks puzzled. Crow Horse laughs bull-wild as Grandpa 
               takes up a fly swatter and takes out a big horsefly. The old 
               man begins speaking Indian again.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         He says there's something wrong with 
                         Big Bird -- he's crazy,
                              (stops laughing)
                         He says you stopped the Inipi ceremony 
                         last night...?

               Crow Horse turns a questioning look at Ray. Ray doesn't 
               flinch.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         But he is not unhappy with you because 
                         he knows you.

                                     RAY
                         He knows me?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         He says he saw you in a vision some 
                         time ago.

               Crow Horse stops translating suddenly even though the old 
               man continues speaking. Crow Horse looks concerned, and ASKS 
               A QUESTION IN LAKOTA. We don't know what he's asking but the 
               tone is absolute amazement.

               This question triggers an exchange between he and Grandpa, 
               the old one getting angry. Grandpa wins.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         I guess he had this vision some time 
                         ago, in the Moon of the Popping Trees -- 
                         uh, back in the winter. He says you 
                         come from Wasi'cu city in the East 
                         but that your people... way back... 
                         are of the Minniconjou Sioux. But 
                         you yourself don't know that.

               Ray's brow is drawn tense as he stares at the old Indian, 
               absorbing the translation. Grandpa speaks more fervently 
               now, incorporating Indian sign. Each time Grandpa does the 
               hard Sioux HAND SLAP, Ray blinks.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         He says he knew you'd be coming to 
                         Bear Creek. He was told. It is the 
                         will of Tunkasilia -- the grandfather 
                         that you come here. He says let's 
                         smoke the caanunpa the sacred pipe, 
                         symbol of truth. So that there will 
                         be no lies between us.

               The old man has taken a long wooden stem and a red stone 
               bowl from a beaded pipe bag. He joins the two together then 
               begins offering a pinch of tobacco to the Four Directions. 
               While this goes on, Ray fidgets.

                                     RAY
                         What's he smoke in that?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, 
                         we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture 
                         in The Pipe. That's a white man's 
                         myth. This is a sacrament.

               The old man is offering the pipe to Ray.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Mltaku Oyasin.

               Ray looks at Grandpa. The old man offers the pipe again.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         You don't smoke with him, it means 
                         you're hiding something.

               Ray takes the pipe, looks at it... then passes it to Crow 
               Horse. The big Indian takes it from Ray, giving him a long 
               eye, then offering the pipe to The Directions before smoking.

               Crow Horse puffs hard, eyes closed, then slowly releases 
               some smoke upward. Ray watches it climb and fade. The old 
               man then takes up an old turtle shell rattle. He speaks.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         He says Wakan. Sacred. Five hundred 
                         year old turtleshell rattle, passed 
                         down from the Grandfathers. Heavy 
                         duty.

               He shakes the rattle very slightly, moving it in front of 
               Ray. He speaks just above a whisper.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         He says, it is good. The Spirits are 
                         here. The Spirits want to know what 
                         you're doing here?

               Ray smirks.

                                     RAY
                         Tell him I'm trying to find the man 
                         who murdered Leo Fast Elk. Ask him 
                         if he knows where he is.

               Crow Horse asks the old man in Lakota. No answer. The pipe 
               is back to grandpa, and he offers it to the Directions, to 
               the Earth then upward before smoking himself. He begins to 
               speak again.

               Passionately. In long glottal Sioux sentences, adding sign, 
               fingers crossing, brushing an arm, a slap here and there,

               He is working himself into an excited state, and Ray keeps 
               looking at Crow Horse, very interested in the old man's 
               answer.

               Finally Grandpa's breath comes up short and wheezing, he 
               ends his oratory with a solid hand slap.

                                     RAY
                         What did he say?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         He said he doesn't know.

                                     RAY
                         He just did the Gettysburg Address 
                         in Sioux. What did he say?

               Crow Horse ignores him. Grandpa speaks again. More hand 
               language.

               The old man is staring at Ray while whispering to Crow Horse. 
               He strokes his badger claw necklace.

               Crow Horse looks at Ray and seems hesitant to translate this 
               new piece of information.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Uh... Grandpa likes to trade; no one 
                         stops by here without gettin' stuck 
                         in the old Indian barter. He, uh... 
                         he likes your shades.

               Grandpa smiles toothlessly. Ray who has his driving glasses 
               in hand, lifts them to say "these?" but Grandpa sees it as 
               an accepted deal, and swiftly removes his necklace. He holds 
               it out.

               Ray slowly, hesitantly surrenders his sunglasses, and takes 
               the necklace. Crow Horse bursts into laughter and so does 
               Grandpa, enjoying a good trade. He draws a hand through the 
               air in a sort of horizontal karate chop, meaning done deal. 
               Ray looks confused. Out of his element. And out of his shades.

               Another fly gets snagged on sticky tape.

               EXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER

               Crow Horse is hurrying toward his bike, Ray with him.

                                     RAY
                         What was he saying?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Why should I tell you.

                                     RAY
                         Because he was talking to me.

               Crow Horse keeps walking.

                                     RAY
                         Does he know something?

               Crow Horse stops walking and eyes Ray, deliberating.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         The old man saw an owl. Over there 
                         in the dry wash. Last week.

                                     RAY
                         And...

                                     CROW HORSE
                         He saw an owl.

               A silent moment. Ray tries to figure out what he's missing 
               here.

                                     RAY
                         So what?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         The owl is a messenger. When one 
                         shows itself to a Sioux... it means 
                         someone's gonna die. The owl told 
                         him about Leo.

               Ray stares vacantly.

                                     RAY
                         The owl told him about Leo. That's 
                         incredible. I guess we just broke 
                         the back of this investigation, didn't 
                         we? Evidence doesn't get any harder 
                         than that -- not for my money. Is 
                         there anyway we can seduce this owl 
                         into Federal Court?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         He also said "listen to the water."

                                     RAY
                         Listen to the water. Listen to the 
                         owl. He also said, don't trust the 
                         fucking Cookie Monster.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.

               Crow Horse KICK STARTS his bike and burns off down the drive

               Ray feels the presence of the old man, standing behind the 
               busted screen door. Just watching.

               OVER THIS, A SCREAMING. A HIGH-PITCHED, CHILLING, SCREAM 
               that takes us straight into --

               SLACK TAIL POWWOW GROUNDS - RES - LATER

               CLOSE ON A TERRIFYING FACE -- painted in blazing red and 
               yellow, black around the eyes. A ridge of feathers high along 
               the hairline, and a mouth open, tongue trilling -- SCREAMING.

               A WACIPI

               is going down. A Powow. Held in the center of a huge arbor. 
               This DANCER, a traditional Kit Fox dancer, is dressed in 
               authentic costume and is dancing with TEN OTHERS dressed in 
               various traditional garb and paints.

               Under the arbor, TWO HUNDRED INDIANS in modern clothing sit 
               on blankets or in lawn chairs, watching the dancing. A group 
               of SINGERS sit around a big drum, beating on it, and wailing 
               the song that keeps the dancers hopping.

               SIXTY CARS (res beaters) are parked off around the arbor, 
               less interested kids sitting on them, smoking cigarettes. A 
               few actually have MTV hair-cuts.

               Drifting through the cars and people are Special Agents 
               Couture, Miles, Sherman and Levoi. They stroll through, 
               incongruously, checking out faces. Vehicles.

               Ray slows his step and takes in --

               THE POWWOW CIRCLE

               as the dance ends. WEAK APPLAUSE. The POWWOW CALLER, a big 
               Sioux with a crew-cut and cowboy shirt, speaks through a 
               scratchy P.A. system.

                                     CALLER
                         Was-te Yelo! Let's have five more 
                         veterans. Five more veterans. Hoka 
                         Hey!

               An OLD-INDIAN MAN sitting in a lawn chair, removes his cowboy 
               hat and reaches down toward a blanket. He brings up his VFW 
               hat, adorned with medals and puts it on. Slowly, he rises, 
               and shuffles out to the center pole along with --

               FOUR OTHER VETERANS who have exchanged cowboy hats for 
               veteran's caps. There is even a traditional dancer in there, 
               wearing a veteran cap. As a mournful WAR SONG is banged out 
               by the singers, a flag is unrolled by the veterans. An 
               American Flag. Unrolled, and set on the mast. And together, 
               all five Indian men, hoist --

               THE AMERICAN FLAG

               high. Slowly it climbs. Proudly. It blows in the hot South 
               Dakota wind.

               OUTSIDE THE ARBOR

               Ray stands, watching this. And then the SONG ENDS. A loud, 
               angry voice breaks across the P.A.

               AT THE CROW'S NEST (CALLER'S BOOTH)

               ANDERSON CHASING HAWK, a young Indian in ribbon shirt and 
               long hair has taken possession of the microphone. SIX W.A.R.N. 
               MEMBERS stand behind him. He speaks loud, firm, with the 
               sharp gestures of an old way Chief.

                                     CHASING HAWK
                         What is that that you honor there, 
                         uncles? After all the Wasi'cu country 
                         has done to you, after all he still 
                         does to you, you honor that flag?! 
                         That flag has been desecrated by the 
                         United States, because they have not 
                         honored what that flag represents!

               The veterans just stand under the flag, solemn, looking at 
               Chasing Hawk. The flag undulates soundlessly.

                                     CHASING HAWK (O.S.)
                         To them, we are the Bank of America. 
                         Whenever they get into a little 
                         difficulty, they go to The Bank, 
                         withdraw a little land, withdraw a 
                         little oil --

               OUTSIDE THE ARBOR

               the four FBI agents stand, watching.

                                     MILES
                         Okay. Here we go.

                                     COOCH
                         Who's this guy?

                                     SHERMAN
                         Anderson Chasing Hawk. Second in 
                         command behind Jimmy.

               AT THE CROW'S NEST

               Chasing Hawk hands the mic over to another Warrior. MAGGIE 
               EAGLE BEAR would be the most beautiful woman Ray has even 
               seen if she was not the meanest-looking. Her thick black 
               hair falls over a denim jacket down below her horse-hair 
               belt. Her faded jeans are stuffed into worn cowboy boots. 
               And she is full of fire. She begins speaking in LAKOTA. 
               Fluently. And with hand sign, like the old man.

               OUTSIDE THE ARBOR

               the agents stand. Cooch is writing into a small notebook.

                                     SHERMAN
                         Magedelana Eagle Bear. Eagle's claws 
                         and a bear's balls.

                                     MILES
                         She keeps an AR-15 assault rifle in 
                         her truck. And she'll use it.

               As Ray watches her, someone approaches in a less hostile 
               manner. It is President Clear Moon, looking very upset. He 
               holds the hand of a LITTLE GIRL, dressed in traditional 
               dancing garb.

               He approaches Ray.

                                     RAY
                         Mr. Clear Moon.

                                     CLEAR MOON
                         Our police are afraid of them. Please 
                         get them out of here.

               Clear Moon gestures for the little girl to run off. He leans 
               in close to Ray.

                                     CLEAR MOON
                         They're going to kill me next. That's 
                         what I hear. These new Indians are 
                         destroying everything. Our people 
                         are a quiet people.

                                     RAY
                         They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let 
                         them go. We're tightening the net on 
                         him. We know he's on the reservation.

               Clear Moon is looking past Ray at the Warriors. They are 
               approaching the agents, and Clear Moon looks at Ray with 
               great concern.

                                     CLEAR MOON
                         Help us.

               And he slowly retreats to his lawn chair under the arbor.

               Chasing Hawk, Maggie and the other Warriors strut up to the 
               agents. All but one who is bound to a wheelchair. We've seen 
               RICHARD YELLOW BIRD, the big Cheyenne who wears a Red Power 
               baseball cap, an earring, and thick bifocals -- in one of 
               the file photos. His arms are plastered with tattoos.

                                     AGENT SHERMAN
                         Where's Jimmy? We thought he'd be 
                         dancing today.

               The warriors make a show of not acknowledging the FBI 
               presence. They have walked over here just to walk by them. 
               That is there statement. But Yellow Bird stops cranking the 
               wheels of his chair and stop: long enough to look up at Ray.

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         Are you the Washington Redskin?

               Even the agents crack grins at this bit of Indian wit. All 
               but Ray who just stands there, arms folded across his chest, 
               considering the crippled activist.

                                     AGENT MILES
                         Say hello to Richard Yellow Bird, 
                         Ray.

               Yellow Bird sits there, staring up at him through thick 
               glasses But then Maggie Eagle Bear takes the handles of Yellow 
               Bird's wheel chair. She looks at Ray with eyes that are choke-
               cherry black, eyes that look right through him. He returns 
               the glare. And then she pushes Yellowbird forward and leaves 
               the feds alone.

               Ray turns to Cooch who is lighting a cigarette, and 
               concentrating on the movements of this group as they wander 
               under the arbor, visiting people. LAKOTA SINGERS start up.

                                     COOCH
                         Ray, get to Jimmy's place and keep 
                         it tight. I'm gonna get a tail on 
                         his Warriors.

               IN THE POWWOW CENTER

               the under ten year-old "fancy dance" -- TWENTY-FIVE INDIAN 
               CHILDREN, whirling and stomping and dancing.

               JIMMY LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - NIGHT

               The battered old house sits under a full moon. The upside 
               down flag moves slightly in the cross winds.

               ACROSS THE ROAD

               several junked cars. Among them a black, rusted out VW van 
               with a smashed windshield. A PACK OF RES DOGS sniff at its 
               tires.

               INT. JIMMY'S VAN

               In the dim light, a boot. A black cowboy boot. Up on the 
               dash. Bluejeans. T-shirt. Second hand leather. And a black 
               cowboy hat. Ray is staking out Jimmy's house.

               Across the passenger seat and console is an M-16 rifle. On 
               his belt, a .357 Red Hawk. He yawns. From outside, he hears 
               a sound.

               POV: down below the van, a small, patchy RES DOG with a 
               missing leg is looking up at him with his tongue long and 
               salivating.

               RAY breaks off a piece of sandwich and drops it down to him 
               just as -- HEADLIGHTS catch his face. He slides down low, 
               watching an old pick-up truck creak onto the dirt road, 
               leading to Jimmy's.

               POV: the truck parks. Someone jumps out, gracefully. Indian. 
               Long braid. Quick steps. Front door. Inside.

               RAY lifts his radio.

                                     RAY
                         X22. Read.

                                     RADIO
                         Go ahead, Ray.

                                     RAY
                         I have a pick-up truck. No plates. 
                         Subject -- Indian -- entering 
                         suspect's house. Over.

                                     RADIO
                         Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts 
                         to leave the area, move in. And hold 
                         him. Over.

               Ray sets his radio down, unclips the leather guard on his 
               handgun. Picks up the Big Mac.

               EXT. LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - NIGHT

               The front door creaks open, and the subject dashes back out. 
               In the dark we cannot latch onto features.

               Suddenly the junker van comes alive, guns onto the dirt road, 
               racing toward the running Indian who gets the door of the 
               truck open but freezes in the van's highbeams as --

               Ray leaps out, M-16 in hand.

                                     RAY
                         FBI, freeze, Motherfucker -- drop 
                         it, drop it!

               Ray maneuvers in Quantico fashion, keeping the rifle on the 
               Indian's back. The Indian drops what he's holding. And turns 
               around. It's not a he. We've seen her before. At the Powwow. 
               Maggie Eagle Bear. Her hair is pulled back tight, braided.

               Ray moves in toward her, surprised at first, but still 
               cautious

                                     RAY
                         Turn around, put your hands on the 
                         roof of the truck.

               She does what he tells her. As Ray moves in on her, he notices 
               an INDIAN CHILD sitting in the passenger seat, looking out 
               into the highbeams, frightened.

               Ray toes Maggie's legs out wider, frisks her one-handed, 
               pats down her boots.

                                     MAGGIE
                         You're the Indian FBI.

                                     RAY
                         That's right. Turn around.

               Maggie turns around, looks Ray in the eye. He looks self-
               conscious in the cowboy hat.

                                     MAGGIE
                         The people are glad they sent you. 
                         They usually send in guys who come 
                         at ya with highbeams, screamin' "drop 
                         it, Motherfucker", stick a gun in 
                         your face, frisk ya down. Even if ya 
                         got a child with ya. No, it's good 
                         to have ya. It's gonna be was-te 
                         times on the res.

               Ray is looking down at what she dropped. A bundle lying in 
               the grass. He bends down, starts to untie it.

                                     MAGGIE
                         I was gonna warn ya about messin' 
                         with somebody's medicine bundle but 
                         I forgot you know all about that 
                         stuff.

               IN THE BUNDLE -- an eagle skull, tobacco strings, sage, sweet 
               grass, and several white eagle feathers.

                                     RAY
                         This Jimmy's?

                                     MAGGIE
                         You're not gonna catch him. He can 
                         shape-shift into different animals. 
                         Bear. Elk. Porcupine.

                                     RAY
                         Is that like an hereditary thing, 
                         Magdelana, or can one take classes?

                                     MAGGIE
                         Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you 
                         wanna do this?

                                     RAY
                         He tried to kill him twice before. 
                         That's a good place to start don't 
                         ya think? Leo was on the other side, 
                         wasn't he?

                                     MAGGIE
                         -- Leo was an apple, that's right. 
                         Red on the outside, white on the 
                         inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked 
                         his ass a coupla times. But he didn't 
                         kill him.

                                     RAY
                         Who did?

                                     MAGGIE
                         You're the FBI. That's your job, 
                         isn't it? Ya know how many of our 
                         Warrior brothers got killed out here? 
                         I never saw any investigating then. 
                         Why now? What's going down here?

                                     RAY
                         A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. 
                         Before somebody else gets a shotgun 
                         blast in the spine.

                                     MAGGIE
                         Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All 
                         over again.

               Ray doesn't have a clue as to what this radical bullshit is 
               about.

                                     RAY
                         Look. You and I can stand here in a 
                         culture clash til the sun comes up, 
                         talking about what's right and what's 
                         wrong. You're from the reservation. 
                         It's a different world.

                                     MAGGIE
                         I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. 
                         I did four years at Dartmouth before 
                         I ever set foot on this res. So I 
                         know about the other world, Ray.

               If this information doesn't throw Ray, the use of his first 
               name does.

                                     MAGGIE
                         Are you gonna keep that medicine 
                         bundle or are you gonna respect its 
                         power?

               Ray is holding the medicine bundle. He deliberates, then 
               hands it over. She takes it with careful hands, casting a 
               somewhat surprised look up at him.

                                     MAGGIE
                         Thank you.

                                     RAY
                         When you see Jimmy, tell him the 
                         sooner he turns himself back into a 
                         human being and gives himself in... 
                         the sooner we back off this 
                         reservation. Okay?

               Maggie gets in the truck, starts it up. She looks out at 
               him, studying him. Trying to figure him out. HEADLIGHTS are 
               coming fast from down the main road.

                                     MAGGIE
                         Grandpa Reaches says you come from 
                         heavy Indian blood. I used to think 
                         Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I 
                         know he is.

                                     RAY
                         Move it, Magdelana.

               Maggie drives forward, turning down another little wagon 
               road, and bumping into the black night only moments before, 
               Cooch's Le Baron pulls in.

               SA Miles and Sherman's vehicle pull in behind it. The regional 
               feds fall in behind Cooch, everyone, packing rifles.

                                     COOCH
                         Ray, you alright?

               Ray turns, nodding. An FBI van pulls in from the other 
               direction and FOUR AGENTS empty out, wearing FBI windbreakers 
               and heavily-armed.

                                     AGENT SHERMAN
                         What do we got, Ray?

                                     RAY
                         It was just Eagle Bear. I questioned 
                         and released her.

                                     COOCH
                         What'd she say?

                                     RAY
                         She talks a lot of shit. We're not 
                         doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. 
                         "What's the FBI really doing here." 
                         Some shit about the Fort Laramie 
                         Treaty.

               Cooch nods. The agents form a tight unit out below the upside 
               down flag.

                                     RAY
                         She took something from the house. 
                         What she called a medicine bundle. 
                         Most likely Jimmy's.

                                     COOCH
                         Let's see it.

                                     RAY
                         I gave it back to her.

                                     AGENT SHERMAN
                         Why?

                                     RAY
                         If it is Jimmy's, she's taking it to 
                         him. We'll have a runner. But I 
                         borrowed a little mojo...

               Ray reaches inside his pant leg, down around his boot and 
               carefully removes a white eagle feather. He gingerly tucks 
               it in a plastic bag.

                                     COOCH
                         Way to go, Raymond. Miles, take that 
                         to lab. Sherman, I want you to go 
                         back to base and produce some written 
                         material. Something that indicates 
                         that our girl Maggie is leaking 
                         information to us. And make sure 
                         that material finds its way into the 
                         hands of the Warrior Movement.

               Sherman and Miles, take off. Cooch, an impressive master of 
               COINTELPRO, now turns to the van squad.

                                     COOCH
                         You gentlemen missed that medicine 
                         basket. Go back through the house, 
                         and make sure you missed nothing 
                         else. And lay some wire, too. Let's 
                         do it.

               The van squad moves toward the house, leaving Cooch and Ray 
               alone in the highbeams that light the yard.

                                     COOCH
                         That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let 
                         the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.

                                     RAY
                         Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an 
                         informant?

                                     COOCH
                         Her own people start to suspect her, 
                         it creates discord from within. The 
                         Warriors don't know who to trust, 
                         they start infighting, and Jimmy 
                         loses his support.

               Ray nods, impressed.

               Cooch bends down near the road, touches the dirt.

                                     COOCH
                         Her oil pan is shot.

                                     RAY
                         Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?

                                     COOCH
                         Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. 
                         You're the Indian.

               Cooch wipes the oil on a handkerchief as he rises, smiling 
               playfully at Ray. He starts back toward his car. Some sort 
               of bird is COOING in the night.

                                     COOCH
                         Get a tail on her, Ray.

               Ray looks up at the upside down flag. Then watches Cooch 
               walking way.

                                     RAY
                         Cooch.
                              (a quiet, tired laugh)
                         Where the fuck did they send us?

                                     COOCH
                         A long way from home. You be careful 
                         out there.

               Cooch, standing there with his glasses on and his right arm 
               bandaged, looks tired, too. He gets in his car.

               In the yard, Ray starts for the van, the res dog, trying to 
               follow. He chases it away. And then as he gets closer to the 
               van, he looks up to investigate the COOING SOUND.

               AT THE TOP OF THE FLAG POLE

               there is a shadow. What looks to be a large bird. It just 
               hovers. In the shadows.

               DOWN BELOW

               Ray looks up at the pole, watching. Then walking on.

               EXT. BEAR CREEK RES - SUNRISE

               Mind-blowing sunrise of airbrush red. Clusters of lodge-pole 
               pine. The spectacular mesa. PAINT HORSES graze in a field, a 
               few out in the center of the road.

               AT GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER

               the old man comes down the front steps in a frail walk, 
               carrying a paper plate. He steps down into the sage clusters 
               that grow just off his trailer, and offers the plate up toward 
               the sky.

               He then stoops, and scrapes a half-eaten English muffin, 
               some potato chips and half a banana onto the Earth in a neat 
               pile.

               He straightens his back the best he can, looks up again, and 
               prays softly.

               THE BADLANDS

               possess an otherworldly beauty at this magic hour, a maze of 
               shadows and rainbows. In the distance we cannot mistake the 
               frame of Walter Crow Horse. He's out there, long hair blowing 
               against the white bluffs. Stalking. Tracking.

               ON THE VILLAGE ROAD

               a puppy chases a hen in a klutzy, innocent manner then bumps 
               into the tire of a parked car. Taking a shot at doghood, he 
               hikes his leg, squirts a hubcap belonging to --

               Cooch's Le Baron. Cooch leans on the hood, drinking a coffee 
               from a foam-plastic cup, and supervising SIX G-MEN who have 
               a map spread out over the hood and are discussing it.

               MAGGIE EAGLE BEAR'S HOUSE

               is way out in a remote corner of the res, a little home, 
               trailer and tipi right on the river. The river is rushing 
               hard this morning, catching the light of the sun. Maggie's 
               truck is parked in front.

               Out at the river, Maggie, her hair long and unbrushed, and 
               wearing an extra large T-shirt and nothing else is hauling 
               water in buckets from the river.

               THREE INDIAN CHILDREN are with her, helping her. Near the 
               house, an OLD WOMAN in bifocal glasses, feeds some chickens, 
               and a cat that gathers with the chickens and eats feed.

               INT. OLD VAN  NEAR MAGGIE'S

               Ray, still in his field clothes sits, training binoculars on 
               the distant house. He opens a carton of milk, drinks some. 
               Then hears a whimpering. In the passenger seat sits the three 
               legged res dog. Ray has taken him with him. He drinks some 
               milk, then opens the carton up fully and sticks it out so 
               the dog can lap it up. Ray laughs in disbelief, shaking his 
               head.

                                     RAY
                         For all I know, you're Jimmy. And 
                         you're just waiting for a shot at my 
                         jugular. Drink, Jimmy. Milk is good 
                         for you --

               The dog is lapping the milk, desperately. And then a ROARING. 
               A motorcycle.

               IN THE SIDE MIRROR: Crow Horse, racing up on the left of the 
               van. Ray pulls his hat down low, and sits back. The motorcycle 
               passes on the left, slowing enough so that Crow Horse can 
               flip Ray the middle finger. Then he races on, far down the 
               road.

               Ray sits there, shaking his head. He'll let it go. Bullshit. 
               He starts the car.

               EXT. TRIBAL POLICE SHOOTING RANGE - DAWN

               Crow Horse guns in, sliding in dirt up to the run-down, low 
               budget shooting range -- six plastic milk jugs on sticks, 
               jammed in the mud.

               A moment later, the van hammers in. Parks. Ray gets out. 
               He's removed his hat so as not to invite any crap from Crow 
               Horse.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Don't be mad. That was just an old 
                         traditional gesture that means hello, 
                         how are you.

                                     RAY
                         I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.

               Ray executes a hard, slapping, "up your ass" gesture.

                                     RAY
                         Have a nice day.

               Crow Horse bursts into laughter in his raspy, staccato laugh. 
               He walks off a few steps, picks up a spent shell and pitches 
               it. His laughter simmers and he gets serious.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked 
                         it out. You can stop taggin' my 
                         sister.

                                     RAY
                         She's your sister?

                                     RAY AND CROW HORSE
                         Spiritual sister.

                                     RAY
                         Gotchya. We just nailed a genetic 
                         match between the eagle feather left 
                         at the murder site and one in Jimmy's 
                         medicine bundle. It came from a white 
                         eagle. Same bird.

               Crow Horse fingers an eagle feather that hangs from his hat 
               band.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         So did this one. Wambli is a rare 
                         and sacred creature. When someone 
                         finds a dead one, the feathers get 
                         around the res. We share everything. 
                         A lot of power in the eagle feathers. 
                         But you think that's bullshit too, 
                         don't --

                                     RAY
                              (ala Crow Horse)
                         -- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the 
                         outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a 
                         car pulled into the yard. He came 
                         out, approached the vehicle then saw 
                         that the man behind the wheel was 
                         Jimmy. He tried to get back into the 
                         trailer, but the car came highballing 
                         at him. He started running for the 
                         open grass. With the car moving, 
                         Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, 
                         took aim -- missed once, hitting the 
                         shitter -- fired again, and severed 
                         Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and 
                         came to a stop in the grass. And 
                         some chicken feed. Stale chicken 
                         feed with four days mold.
                              (a beat)
                         Electromagnetic printing.

               Crow Horse stares, a little surprised.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy 
                         Looks Twice was nowhere near there. 
                         Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years 
                         old, his mother and father was killed 
                         in a car wreck right down there near 
                         Elk Mountain.

                                     RAY
                         I don't see the connection.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         The connection is, it did a head 
                         number on him. He's petrified of 
                         cars. Won't drive. I've known him 
                         all my life, and he's never gotten 
                         behind the wheel of a vehicle. He 
                         rides passenger and he rides horses, 
                         and that's it. The man that shot Leo 
                         down was behind the wheel of a moving 
                         car.

               Ray absorbs this with great interest.

                                     RAY
                         That's not solid.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         You want solid? That one, single, 
                         print he left in the Badlands -- the 
                         one the FBI missed and then stepped 
                         all over -- it belongs to a man who 
                         walks heels first. Like a white man. 
                         Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- 
                         ball of the foot first. The man who 
                         murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.

               Ray lets a pent-up sigh escape.

                                     RAY
                         You're saying a white guy did it...

               Crow Horse chews this over, unable to hide a nagging 
               frustration. He shakes his head.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         When Leo was dumped out there in the 
                         Badlands, he was dropped on his back. 
                         Our man made an effort to turn him 
                         over, onto his face. It's an old 
                         Ind'n belief that if a dead man is 
                         turned face down, his spirit won't 
                         leave. And in the killer's case, it 
                         won't come back and jump all over 
                         his shit. That's an Ind'n thing a 
                         white man wouldn't know.

               The two of them stand there, thinking this over. Ray takes 
               out his notebook and starts writing. Crow Horse walks away, 
               turns to face the propped up targets.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         And that's the way it is. Write it 
                         down.

               To punctuate, Crow Horse slaps leather, draws his .38, and 
               begins blasting at the milk bottles. He hits the bank. A 
               tree. One of the posts. But not a single target.

               When he is done, he looks over his gun, disappointed. Starts 
               reloading. Ray starts laughing, looking at the missed targets

                                     CROW HORSE
                         You laugh all you want, Breed. Sunset 
                         tonight, I get my man.

               Ray looks at Crow Horse, sees that he's serious, and follows 
               him toward his motorcycle.

                                     RAY
                         Alright, Crow Horse. I'm listening. 
                         I'm listening to the trees, to the 
                         stones. Who is it?

               Crow Horse turns toward Ray, and creates a long dramatic 
               pause.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Damned if I know.

               And he hauls his bulk onto his motorbike.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         But the Old One. He did a Yuwipi 
                         ceremony last night.

               Crow Horse winks at Ray as he slams the kickstart. To no 
               avail.

                                     RAY
                         The old man? He's gonna tell you who 
                         killed Leo?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's 
                         gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. 
                         I'm late.

                                     RAY
                         Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses 
                         you're wearing.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Grandpa traded with me.
                              (flips the bird)
                         Goodbye.

               And Crow Horse nails his kick start. The BIKE ROARS alive 
               and the Indian works the throttle hard, leaving gravel and 
               black exhaust. Ray stands there, drifting between logic and 
               instinct. He looks at his watch, then starts at a slow, 
               thoughtful shuffle toward his car.

               EXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

               The dust-buzzard broncs and bounces down Grandpa's driveway, 
               coming to a stop near the wrecked cars. Crow Horse dismounts 
               and unhooks a carton of smokes from the back.

               A moment later, the junker van pulls in, bouncing and shaking.

               Crow Horse stares at the approaching vehicle, his eyes hidden 
               behind Ray's former shades. He cracks a slow smile because --

               Ray is stepping quickly from the van, and carrying two packs 
               of Marlboros.

               INT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER

               Grandpa sits in his chair, his black eyes moving smoothly 
               from side to side. Smoke enshrouds his ancient face, giving 
               the sense of another time and place. He speaks LAKOTA.

               Crow Horse, sitting on a stool across from him, holds The 
               Pipe. He passes it to Ray who sits in a busted lawn chair 
               next to him. The room is dark as the sun sets out the window 
               in red and purple. Ray looks at the pipe. Grandpa will not 
               speak until Ray smokes. And so he does, drawing on the stem, 
               awkwardly.

               HEARTBEAT DRUM as Grandpa speaks Indian.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         He says, back behind Red Deer Table, 
                         where the Elk-People-used-to-live... 
                         there are strange creatures from 
                         another world who eat stones... and 
                         who will kill anyone who crosses 
                         into this place.

               Ray looks at Crow Horse, searching for a hint of lightness. 
               But there is only great reverence as he watches Ray blow 
               smoke upward.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         He says, in the Yuwipi ceremony last 
                         night, he saw you... going back into 
                         the land beyond Red Deer Table. I 
                         was with you. But that was all the 
                         Spirits let him see so he doesn't 
                         know if you were killed or not. But 
                         he thinks you probably were.

               Ray smirks as he passes the pipe to Grandpa. Crow Horse looks 
               nervous. Grandpa offers the pipe to the directions and then 
               disengages the bowl from the stem. He speaks again. Crow 
               Horse translates.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Go to the land where the Elk-People-
                         used-to-live and you will find the 
                         answers you came here looking for. 
                         But you must go as two. That is the 
                         vision. I have spoken. And this is 
                         so.

               Grandpa leans closer to Crow Horse and whispers some Lakota.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         He wants to trade.
                              (a beat)
                         He likes your watch.

               Ray looks at Crow Horse, nervous.

                                     RAY
                         I can't do that,
                              (explaining)
                         It's a Rolex.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         A what?

               And Grandpa is already holding out something to offer. It is 
               a cigarette. Grandpa offers it again.

                                     RAY
                         I'm sorry, this is --
                              (loud to Grandpa)
                         -- this is very, very expensive. 
                         It's --
                              (to Crow Horse)
                         Tell him this is an expensive watch.

               Crow Horse tells the Old Man. Grandpa speaks Indian.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         He says, you need to go on Indian 
                         time. He says your watch is ruining 
                         your life anyway.

               Ray buries his hands in his jacket pocket. No way. Crow Horse 
               signs to Grandpa "no." Grandpa gets up, crosses between the 
               two young men, up to the TV set. He turns it on.

               WHEEL OF FORTUNE

               explodes in PINGS AND PONGS and a WOMAN'S SHRILL SCREAM.

               EXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER - DAY

               Crow Horse and Ray walk down the steps. WHEEL OF FORTUNE is 
               heard from within.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Red Deer Table, Ray.

                                     RAY
                         Don't tell me: heavy duty.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi 
                         Spirits. It's one of those few places 
                         we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. 
                         Some of the old people say Crazy 
                         Horse is buried back there. We have 
                         to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.

               They step into the yard and Ray stops, turning to Crow Horse

                                     RAY
                         Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I 
                         say that evil spirits are killing 
                         everybody on the reservation?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Ray --

                                     RAY
                         -- no. No offense to the old man. I 
                         appreciate you trying to help. But I 
                         put my ass on the line coming out 
                         here, man.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         What'd you expect to hear?

                                     RAY
                         Not Native American myths and legends. 
                         I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? 
                         Not National Geographic.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         What you call myths, we call our 
                         history.

                                     RAY
                         It's not real.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         What's real to you? Wall Street? 
                         Capital Hill? Now they are myths.

                                     RAY
                         I can't be dicking around here. That's 
                         all I'm saying. I don't carry 
                         crystals, I don't wanna come back in 
                         another life. I just wanna do my 
                         job, and do it right, and get the 
                         fuck outta here.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal 
                         Mineo Indian.

               Crow Horse drives "Indian" home with a hard finger in Ray's 
               chest. Ray knocks his hand away, explosively. Crow Horse is 
               ready.

                                     GRANDPA (O.S.)
                         Knock it off!

               The old man is standing at the top of the steps. Ray and 
               Crow Horse are YELLING OVER EACH OTHER, and hands are up.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Will ya knock it off? You're actin' 
                         like a couple of old women.

               Ray stands there, one hand up in defense, another poised to 
               throw a punch. Bewildered, he stares at the old Indian holding 
               onto the porch railing.

                                     GRANDPA
                         For cryin' out loud. Knock it off.

                                     RAY
                         He speaks English.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Only when he's really pissed off.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Come inside. Watch TV.

               And Grandpa goes back in, screendoor slapping shut behind 
               him. Ray is just staring, his jaw dropped. Crow Horse starts 
               laughing. Harder than he has yet, and Ray starts walking 
               toward his car in fuck-this steps.

               He gets into the car, closes the door and looks out the open 
               window at Crow Horse. The Indian moves first.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Don't accuse nothin' of not bein' 
                         real, Little Weasel. Cuz the only 
                         thing around here that ain't real is 
                         you.

               Ray lifts his arm off the door, and springs his middle finger 
               up at Crow Horse. He holds it there for a long moment just 
               looking at the big Indian.

                                     RAY
                         Take care of yourself, Walter.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Likewise.

               Ray checks the time on his watch then guns away. Crow Horse 
               stands there, watching him go. Eventually he shuffles back 
               toward the trailer.

               EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - NIGHT

               Room 14 has been transformed into a major COINTELPRO base; 
               four computer terminals are set up, card tables spread with 
               photos, boxes of files stacked on the bed, and SIX AGENTS, 
               manning the computers, thumbing through files.

               THE CONNECTING ROOM (RAY'S ROOM)

               A meeting takes place around a table of paperwork and coffee 
               cups, and a .45 laid atop a file. Cooch, SA Miles, SA Sherman, 
               TWO OTHER REGIONAL AGENTS and Ray.

                                     SA SHERMAN
                         We've gotten word that Jimmy has 
                         been trying to hook up with Maggie 
                         Eagle Bear... but some of the Warriors 
                         have been sending word to Jimmy that 
                         she may be an FBI operative. So he 
                         doesn't know where to go.

               Cooch taps some ashes into an empty coffee cup. They sizzle 
               in cold residue.

                                     COOCH
                         Bingo. It's working.

                                     SHERMAN
                         He's out of room. All the reservation 
                         exits have been watchdogged. We got 
                         him. I give it twelve hours.

                                     RAY
                         Well we better use those twelve hours 
                         to apprehend the right man.

               The agents all look at Ray. A pin can be heard falling to 
               the cheap carpet.

                                     COOCH
                         The right man? Talk to me, Ray.

                                     RAY
                         Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from 
                         the driver's seat of a moving car 
                         then drove those eight miles to the 
                         Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never 
                         been behind the wheel of a car. It's 
                         a known fact out here that he's 
                         petrified of driving. His parents 
                         were killed in a car wreck.

               Cooch nods, lights another smoke, intrigued.

                                     SHERMAN
                         That's not very solid.

                                     RAY
                         There was also a print found in the 
                         Badlands that indicated diagetic 
                         locomotion. Heels first. Jimmy's 
                         walking pattern doesn't match. He 
                         has a distinct Indian walk.

                                     SA MILES
                         Indian walk? You been smoking hooch 
                         in the peace pipe, Ray?

               LAUGHTER. Except for Cooch who just stares at Ray, digesting 
               what he has said.

                                     RAY
                         They don't smoke hooch in The Pipe, 
                         Miles. They smoke something called 
                         kinickinick, it's like a tobacco.

               Sherman looks at Cooch.

                                     SA SHERMAN
                         Well, you're right about X21 being a 
                         Washington Redskin, that's for sure. 
                         What else, Ray?

                                     COOCH
                         You boys want a soda?

                                     SA MILES
                         Oh, yeah, a Coke. You buying?

                                     COOCH
                         No, Ray's buying. Sherman? Coke?

                                     SHERMAN
                         Oh... no. No, Cooch, I'm working on 
                         a coffee here. Indian walk?

               Cooch nods to Ray and Ray follows, gathering up some paperwork 
               He looks determined as a terrier.

               EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - NIGHT

               Ray and Cooch throw long, slim shadows on their way to an 
               archaic Coke machine.

                         I just wanna make sure no one else 
                         gets done in that way because we 
                         were in bed with the wrong doer.

               Ray studies him with a smile building. Cooch shrugs, sips 
               some soda.

                                     RAY

               He turns. Cooch looks at him for a time. It is a warm look.

                         I'll sleep around a little.

                                     RAY
                         Thanks, Cooch.

                                     COOCH
                         And get rid of the dog.

               Ray gets in and pulls the dog out. The dog sits at roadside, 
               tilting its head at him, confused. And he pulls out. It runs 
               after him.

               EXT. DIRT ROAD NEAR EAGLE BEAR'S - RES - NIGHT

               The van sits parked down the road from Maggie's dimly-lit 
               home. Ray sits behind the wheel, watching the house. LOCUSTS 
               make a steady and unnerving sound. It is black. Black under 
               big sky. Ray lets his head sag out the open window and he 
               takes in the vastness.

               POV: stars. Millions of stars. And an incredible full moon. 
               It hangs huge over distant fields, a perfect sphere. The top 
               half of the moon is yellow, the bottom half a lava red.

               REVERSE - RAY

               stares at it, lost in thought. From Maggie's house, he hears 
               someone SINGING. Singing a traditional SUNDANCE SONG while 
               they haul water from the creek. A WOMAN'S VOICE, trilling 
               out the beautiful but haunting "hey-o-hey-o-hey-o-hey-ohhhhh."

               Ray just sits, listening. And then something draws his 
               attention to his rearview mirror.

               The res dog, lying in the back seat is GROWLING. Lip curled 
               back, growling low.

               Ray looks at him, looks out the window. Blackness. Nothing 
               but the sound of locusts. And a slight crosswind in the wheat 
               fields. The dog stops growling. And Ray fixes his gaze on 
               the house again, lifting a pair of binoculars and --

               BOOOOOOM! The rear windshield is SHATTERED by an explosion. 
               Ray throws himself low across the passenger seat -- BOOOOOM! 
               The driver's side window and part of the door explodes.

               RES ROAD NEAR EAGLE BEAR'S

               The federal van is HAMMERED BY GUNFIRE. All the windows, 
               shattered, the metal doors splayed. Someone is going for the 
               kill,

               THE PASSENGER DOOR

               is thrown open just as its window implodes, and Ray slides 
               out belly first, gripping his M-16 and crawling like a dog 
               soldier into tall wheat at roadside as the car, the road, 
               the wheat, the dirt, the night are slammed by gunfire.

               The res dog overtakes Ray and vanishes in the wheat. Ray 
               vanishes, too. It is quiet for a moment, then Ray, pops up 
               ten feet away, and UNLOADS THE M-16, in a left to right, 
               clean sweep before dropping again. He lies there, listening. 
               The LOCUST HAVE GONE QUIET. His breath is heavy. His heart's 
               got to be pounding through the dirt he lays in.

                                     RAY
                              (whispering)
                         Motherfucker.

               LONG SHOT - THE ROAD

               the decimated van, aerial still high. The distant lights of 
               Maggie's house. And the giant Moon, hovering over it all.

               HEARTBEAT DRUM into --

               SAME ROAD  RES - DAWN

               TWENTY FEDS comb the dirt road, the wheat fields, picking up 
               shells with gloved hands, scanning the vast distance.

               IN THE FRONT YARD of Maggie's, FOUR INDIAN CHILDREN stand 
               with the Old Woman, watching.

               INT. LE BARON  TRAVELING  ANOTHER DIRT ROAD

               Cooch, flushed in the face, mans the wheel. He wears only a 
               T-shirt which indicates, a desperate rush to the scene. His 
               eyes scan the surrounding homes and fields.

               In the passenger seat, Ray sits, drinking a coffee. He looks 
               haggard.

                                     COOCH
                         Bastards...

                         All I could think of was... not here. 
                         I don't wanna eat it on an Indian 
                         Reservation, three thousand miles 
                         from home.

                                     COOCH
                         He's out there. He's out there playing 
                         Sitting Bull with us. I want the 
                         motherfucker so bad I'm getting a 
                         bleeding ulcer.

               Ray turns around in his seat, looking off across dry land.

                                     RAY
                         It may have been Maggie's way of 
                         saying "get off my ass."

                                     COOCH
                         She's that subtle?

                         Eagle's claws and a bear's balls 
                         that's what her profile says.

                                     COOCH
                         Well, she's running now, too. These 
                         fucking people like to run, don't --

                                     RAY
                         -- Cooch. Woh. Stop.

               He does. Ray is turned around in his seat, staring off into 
               the distance.

               EXT. DIRT ROAD

               The Le Baron whines backward, and off the road, into some 
               grass Ray steps out, keeping his gaze fixed. Cooch bails 
               from the driver's side, joins him.

               HEARTBEAT DRUM.

               RAY'S POV: Four-hundred feet across a flat area of sandstone 
               and grass clusters, something shimmers in the undulations of 
               the harsh morning sun. Something of pea green and rusty 
               metal... glass catches sunlight and makes prisms. A car. An 
               old res car, sitting in a long, chasm in barely a foot of 
               green water.

               EXT. DRY WASH - SHORT TIME LATER - PAY

               Ray and Cooch go through the car, around the car, with gloved 
               hands and grease pencils and plastic bags, sweating in the 
               hot sun.

                                     COOCH
                         Tread matches. It's the car.

                                     RAY
                         Yes.

               Excited, Ray walks off, scanning the area.

                                     COOCH
                         But this doesn't make any sense, 
                         Ray. If it's just been sitting in 
                         this dry wash for seven days... why 
                         the hell didn't we find it?

               Ray picks up a handful of stones, sifts them in his hands.

                                     RAY
                         Because this isn't a dry wash.

               Cooch watches him slosh shoes first through a rut where the 
               water shimmers a foot deep or less.

                                     RAY
                         It's the Little Walking River.

               Ray turns, shucking up mud.

                                     RAY
                         And it was full of water when I drove 
                         by here three days ago. Full. I 
                         mean... a river.

                                     COOCH
                         The Little Walking River. You're 
                         right. This is part of it. So whoever 
                         sunk this car didn't compensate for 
                         drought. Goddamn.

               Ray doesn't hear Cooch. He stares past the SAC at the long 
               wide chasm, wet in some places, arid in others, and what he 
               hears must be an echo in his head.

                                     RAY
                         Listen to the water...

               Cooch is listening to a TRANSMISSION across his radio and he 
               walks off a few feet, exchanging information with the 
               REGIONALS.

               Ray stands, ankle deep in stagnant water, his face sweat-
               soaked, his eyes transfixed on heat undulations.

               EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - ROOM 13 - DAY

               A flat-bed tow truck drives past the motel with the killer's 
               car on it. Behind the truck is a fed car which stops at the 
               motel, and the Le Baron which also pulls in. Miles and Sherman 
               get out from the first car, Ray and Cooch bail from the Le 
               Baron.

               With RADIOS TRANSMITTING, the agents walk, dusty and tired, 
               into room 14. Ray hesitates, snagged by the sight of --

               A motorcycle parked in front of the Buffalo Butte Bar. Parked 
               with pick-up trucks and station wagons. It's the mud-caked 
               old Barley. Parked right under the NO INDIANS sign.

               He puzzles over this.

               INT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - DAY

               Dark. Even during the day. Cigarette smoke. Sawdust. On the 
               archaic juke box, RANDY TRAVIS sings "Old 8x10" while behind 
               the bar, the BAR OWNER, an old man with long white hair and 
               beard, busies himself with leather work. SEVERAL WHITE LOCALS 
               sit on the old water drum bar stools.

               Heads lift, turn when Ray enters in his "fraternizing" clothes -- 
               jeans and boots, leather jacket. He scuffs up thick sawdust 
               as he heads to the furthest booth back where --

               Crow Horse sits, alone over a bourbon and a beer. Ray 
               approaches carefully, upset by the sight. He slides into the 
               booth and point blanks the Indian.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of

                                     RAY
                         Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What 
                         are you doing?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         You're right about the old man. His 
                         power's long dried up. He's supposed 
                         to be a medicine man but he won't go 
                         see the people. He says we changed, 
                         and we don't listen. Well, he don't 
                         go out and talk no more. I haven't 
                         had a drink in three years but I 
                         just turned my sobriety chip into 
                         that man behind the bar, and this 
                         Hoss is gettin' watered.

                                     RAY
                         Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in

                         What are you talking about?

                                     CROW HORSE

                         the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian 
                         Annihilation and said I was messin' 
                         with your case, man. I don't give a 
                         goddamn about your case.

                                     RAY
                         And I don't give a goddamn about 
                         whether you wear a badge or not, 
                         Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.

               Crow Horse shimmers his black eyes onto Ray.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Still after Jimmy?

                         They found prints at Blue Legs' place.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But 
                         they cross over Benjamin Black Star's 
                         prints. And he wasn't there until 
                         six o'clock the mornin' after to get 
                         eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy 
                         wasn't there til the next day. Follow?

               Ray just looks vacantly at Crow Horse. Crow Horse resents 
               the vacancy.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Look, man... you better bust Jimmy 
                         and get out before somebody shoots 
                         up more than your car next time.

               Ray glares at him.

                                     RAY
                         Next time I'll be ready. You get the 
                         word to who ever it is.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.

               Ray doesn't blink.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         You think you was sent here cuz you're 
                         a good cop?

                                     RAY
                         No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. 
                         And a good cop.

               Crow Horse leans toward Ray and speaks more quietly.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         You ever think that maybe you was 
                         sent here cuz the FBI's need one 
                         good reason to take out the entire 
                         Warrior Movement. And what better 
                         reason than one of their men, gettin' 
                         blown away on the res. A low-rent, 
                         expendable public servant sent in to 
                         take a bullet for his country.

               Ray is fuming. He can't believe what he's hearing, what's 
               being insinuated, but he's giving it thought and it's getting 
               him angry. He smashes a hand down on the table.

                                     RAY
                         I'm sick of your shit --

                                     RANCHER (O.S.)
                         I'm sick of the two of ya timber 
                         niggers spewin' off.

               Standing over the booth is a long, tall RANCHER'S SON. Rangey 
               with red curly hair tucked under a BLACK HILLS CLASSIC cap, 
               and arms built by tractor work. And behind him, TWO OLDER 
               RANCHERS fall in. And ANOTHER YOUNG MAN, grinning with 
               amusement.

               Ray and Crow Horse look up.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Sorry, we don't speak United States.

                                     RANCHER'S SON
                         Yeah, well I do. Get the Jesus up, 
                         and get the Jesus out or I'm gonna 
                         go out to my truck and come back 
                         with my hardware.

                                     RAY
                         Woh, hold on there, Jack, you're --

                                     RANCHER'S SON
                         -- don't "jack" me, Squanto. I'll 
                         bury your lazy ass right here.

               Ray realizes now that they think he's Indian, too. Crow Horse 
               sees this revelation and complicates it by suddenly speaking 
               LAKOTA to Ray.

               The rancher grabs Ray by the cheeks.

                                     RANCHER'S SON
                         I'm talkin' to --

               Ray decks him. Backhands him in the solar plexus then, lays 
               a burner of a Quantico roundhouse to his ear, knocking him 
               across the bar, over a mop and bucket and into sawdust.

               The others start to fall at him but someone has jumped in, 
               holding them back, and sticking himself in the way. It is 
               Brooks. The old timer Ray met his first night here.

                                     BROOKS
                         No! No, you butt holes! He ain't 
                         skin! He AIN'T SKIN!

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Yeah he's In'dn. Miniconjou Sioux.

               The rancher's son who is coming back with a broken beer 
               bottle, slows his step and shifts his eyes from Brooks to 
               the young fed There is a lot of heavy breathing. But no 
               talking just yet. The young rancher eyes Ray.

                                     RANCHER'S SON
                         You ain't Indian?

               Ray just stands tense, staring at him. And it's strange. 
               Because he hasn't really looked like he has any Indian blood 
               up to this moment. But dressed the way he is, and his eyes 
               glaring, face drawing tense, he might pass for a breed 
               although that's probably the Italian. But Ray doesn't answer 
               the question. Crow Horse starts laughing. Drunkenly.

                                     OLDER RANCHER
                         What's so damn funny?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Well, it's just that the cavalry 
                         used to always threaten the Lakota. 
                         The cavalry ain't around anymore. 
                         The Lakota still are.

                                     RANCHER'S SON
                         I got no trouble tellin' where you 
                         come from, Fat Red.

               Crow Horse rises and walks unsteadily across the floor, 
               leaving the bar. Brooks is whispering to the others, 
               apparently about who Ray is. The bar man comes up to Ray, 
               holding a tray, on which sits a shot and a beer. Ray looks 
               at it for a moment.

                                     BAR MAN
                         Sorry. On the house.

               Ray knocks the tray out of his hand, spilling beer and whiskey 
               all over the bar man and the locals around him.

               And he walks out, leaving the locals confused.

               INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING - RES - DAY

               Ray looks strung-out as he drives. If it's not the conflict 
               at the Butte, it's the dangerous seed Crow Horse planted, 
               and it is playing with his mind. He is on his RADIO.

                                     RAY
                         No plates. No registration. Serial 
                         numbers removed. And all prints washed 
                         off by the river. That's great. This 
                         is turning out to be a walk in the 
                         park, do you know that?

                         Never mind.

               But before he hangs the radio. IT CUTS BACK IN.

                                     RADIO

                         down.

                         They took it down, set fire to it,

                         13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your 
                         room.

               Ray seethes quietly as he drives.

                                     RADIO
                         We traced the number of the truck

                         one Maggie Sanders, also known as 
                         Maggie Eagle Bear. She's been all 
                         over the res, riling up the 
                         traditionals, telling them not to 
                         break, and to keep Jimmy in hiding. 
                         She's a problem now. And she's yours. 
                         Get her off the reservation.

               Ray keeps driving.

               EXT. WOUNDED KNEE MEMORIAL - DAY

               Maggie's old pick-up is parked near an arch gate of the tiny 
               cemetery where a tall monument is fenced off from other graves 
               There are tobacco offerings and other medicines hanging on 
               the fence and on the monument.

               It is a quiet place. Still.

               Maggie stands before the unkempt monument in her denim jacket, 
               her hair blowing across her face in the wind. She PRAYS IN 
               LAKOTA.

               Behind her TEN CHILDREN from the Bear Creek School stand, 
               heads bowed respectfully. Two of them sit on the lap of 
               Richard Yellow Bird who looks on from his wheelchair, praying 
               quietly with Maggie. When Maggie completes her prayer, she 
               ties some tobacco to the monument then turns and faces the 
               children. One of them, a LITTLE GIRL -- heavy-set -- raises 
               a hand that we might note is deformed. As many of the children 
               we have seen on the res, are.

                                     LITTLE GIRL
                         Are they all right under here?

                                     MAGGIE
                         Two-hundred and sixty-seven men, 
                         women, old people. And little ones 
                         like you. Many killed running along 
                         that road you see there.

                                     LITTLE BOY
                         Where were they runnin' to?

                                     MAGGIE
                         A place called The Stronghold.
                              (a beat)
                         They died for a dream. But you live. 
                         You are their great-great 
                         grandchildren and you live. We have 
                         to honor their dream. Of protecting 
                         the Mother Earth. And being proud of 
                         being Indian.

                                     LITTLE BOY
                         My mother told me that they call us 
                         Indians cuz Columbus was lookin' for 
                         India when he discovered our country.

               Maggie smiles at the boy.

                                     MAGGIE
                         Yeah, well, let me tell you something, 
                         Henry: just be glad he wasn't looking 
                         for Turkey.

               The CHILDREN LAUGH. All but one boy, who isn't paying 
               attention. He is staring up at a hill, off in the distance.

               MAGGIE'S POV: on the hill, a figure stands, hands in his 
               pockets, hair blowing in the wind. Ray.

               REVERSE - MAGGIE

               keeping her eyes on the Wasi'cu, but addressing Yellow Bird.

                                     MAGGIE
                         Richard. Sing the Honoring Song with 
                         them. I'll be right back.

               ON THE HILL

               Ray stands, watching Maggie walking into the wind, toward 
               him. Behind her an HONORING SONG, sung by ten children haunts 
               the still air.

               He doesn't budge as she mounts the gentle bluff and joins 
               him there.

                                     MAGGIE
                         We're praying at the grave. Do you 
                         wanna join us?

               A long silence. The voices carry in the wind.

                                     RAY
                         No, Maggie. But you're gonna have to 
                         join me for a ride. I'm taking you 
                         to Rapid City.

               Maggie looks at him. They lock eyes.

                                     MAGGIE
                         So much power. I see it in your eyes. 
                         This... hunger for power. Or for 
                         what you think is power.

               As if exhausted by the thought, Maggie sits down on the bluff, 
               looking out at the children who are still singing the song. 
               As she speaks, she begins digging her fingers in the earth. 
               Ray stands over her.

                                     RAY
                         You burned an American flag today. 
                         And left it for me...

                                     MAGGIE
                         -- You desecrated it, it had to be 
                         burned.

                                     RAY
                         I desecrated it?

                                     MAGGIE
                         You forced an innocent man to run 
                         like an animal. You've tried to poison 
                         my people's hearts against me with 
                         your manipulation, with letters I 
                         never wrote... you've been watching 
                         me eat, work, raise my family... 
                         wash myself in the river. And now 
                         you're here, arresting me at a sacred 
                         place.
                              (a beat)
                         In your eyes, that's power.

               Maggie lifts herself onto her knees and looks down into the 
               small hole she's dug. She picks up a little pine cone.

                                     MAGGIE
                         So I plant this tree for you. And I 
                         take all this stuff that you've laid 
                         on me and my people, and I put it in 
                         this hole with this pine cone.
                              (she covers it)
                         And I bury it. Cuz ya know what it 
                         is, Ray? Bullshit. And shit is 
                         fertilizer.
                              (she stands)
                         And The Mother will turn your lies 
                         into something that lives.

               Maggie rises, dusting off her hands. She looks him in the 
               soul.

                                     MAGGIE
                         That's what power is, in the Indian 
                         way.
                              (holds her hands out 
                              to be cuffed)
                         Take me to Rapid, Ray. I'm the enemy.

               Ray just stares at her, struggling with what he's feeling, 
               what he's hearing. What he's supposed to be feeling. Silence 
               hangs between the two of them.

                                     RAY
                         If I told you... that I think Jimmy's 
                         innocent... but I'm in over my head... 
                         would you believe me?

               Maggie looks at him, considering. Then toward the long dark 
               silhouette of a mountain range across the plains.

                                     MAGGIE
                         See those Black Hills out there, 
                         Ray? When the people lost the land 
                         in 1868, the government took 
                         everything but those hills. They 
                         allowed us to keep those Black Hills, 
                         to live there. Signed a treaty. Until 
                         they found gold. Then they told us 
                         we had to leave because of National 
                         interest. They broke that treaty. 
                         Anyone who fought or spoke out against 
                         it, wound up dead or in jail. And 
                         the people wound up here. On a 
                         reservation.

               While she looks off at Paha Sapa, Ray stares at her profile.

                                     MAGGIE
                         While up there, in the Black Hills... 
                         they carved the faces of four 
                         presidents.

               She looks at Ray with an ironic smile, and she catches him 
               transfixed.

                                     MAGGIE
                         Your relatives must've taught you 
                         something.

                                     RAY
                         NO.
                              (after thought)
                         My father never told anybody he had 
                         Indian blood. But he still used a 
                         few Indian words around the house. 
                         He called me Washee. Said it meant... 
                         good boy.

               Maggie starts giggling.

                                     RAY
                         What?

                                     MAGGIE
                         Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like 
                         tallow we put in stew. I think he 
                         was calling you chubby boy.

                                     RAY
                         Great.

               Maggie is laughing as she looks back at the children who are 
               no longer singing. Ray reaches inside his jacket and takes 
               out five polaroids. He shuffles them as he ponders. He hands 
               one to Maggie who has caught herself opening up too much to 
               the Wasi'cu.

                                     RAY
                         You ever see that car before?

               Maggie looks at the first photo and says nothing. She hands 
               it back quickly. Ray won't take it.

                                     RAY
                         Who's it belong to?

               Maggie ignores him. Ray studies her reaction.

                                     RAY
                         Help me, Maggie...

               Maggie is looking away. She picks a long blade of grass and 
               smoothes it in her hands.

               Ray looks at her a moment longer then rises, dusting off his 
               jeans, and standing there. He thinks for a long moment, 
               pinches the bridge of his nose, then looks out at the Black 
               Hills, pensive.

                                     RAY
                         I didn't see you today, Maggie.
                              (a beat)
                         Goodbye.

               Maggie watches him go. Looks away. Then watches him again.

                                     MAGGIE
                         Goodbye... Wa-shee.

               Ray stops. She stands on the bluff, her hair riding the wind 
               and her eyes searing. And then her lips do something that 
               might qualify as half a smile. A sense of humor rising up 
               through anger. Survival humor.

               Ray looks at her for a long moment. And then he walks on, 
               leaving her there.

               INT. LE BARON - PARKED AT WOUNDED KNEE - DAY

               Ray sits behind the wheel, going through files on his lap, 
               photographs of Indians. And thinking hard.

                                     RAY
                         Anyone who fought or spoke out against 
                         it... wound up dead or in jail.

               Ray looks out the window toward the monument.

                                     RAY
                              (to himself, flustered)
                         That was 1868, Maggie...

               Exhausted, Ray lays his head back on the seat, and lets a 
               long, constricted breath free. THUNDER ROLLS like the slow, 
               deep roar of some giant bear up in the hills. He opens his 
               eyes, looks out the window.

               POV: rain is coming down, and Maggie is getting the children 
               into the back of her truck. She helps them get a tarp over 
               their heads. Then as Yellow Bird pulls himself into the cab 
               of the truck, she hefts the wheelchair and two boys load it 
               in.

               She gets in, starts up, and rolls off down the sloping road.

               EXT. LE BARON - WOUNDED KNEE  STRANGE TWILIGHT

               Ray steps out of the car into the rain and closes the door. 
               He stares at the burial grounds. Then slowly, he starts toward 
               them as if magnetically drawn. HEARTBEAT DRUM.

               A shroud of mist lays over the cemetery, growing thicker as 
               the rain falls harder. DRUM BEATS DEEPER. Ray is walking 
               toward the memorial, getting drenched. Then he hears something 
               strange. HOOFBEATS.

               RAY'S POV:

               coming down the dirt road, toward him, a HORSEMAN drives his 
               mount at a fast trot. The rider is only a vague image in the 
               mist, his face hidden. As he rides closer, we can make out a 
               shotgun in his hand. And he throws it up, takes aim.

               REVERSE - RAY

               paralyzed for a moment. And then going for his gun. But it's 
               not there. He's left it in the car. He breaks into a run. 
               But there's a shorter distance now between the horseman and 
               the car and Ray has no choice but to turn and flee.

               His boots slap wet pavement, and his breath draws heavy and 
               desperate as he bounds off the road and races down a grassy 
               slope, looking over his shoulder, panicking.

               His legs and arms churning, his face contorted. And then 
               someone passes him out, running just as hard. AN INDIAN WOMAN 
               in 1890 Winter rags, clutching a BABY to her breast and 
               CRYING. SCREAMING. Ray looks at her, incredulous as he runs. 
               But he keeps running.

               The rider is right behind him. He FIRES. The GUNSHOT CRACKS 
               the sky like thunder. BOOOOM!

               INT. LE BARON  TWILIGHT

               Ray jumps awake. Cooch is POUNDING on the window. And the 
               three-legged dog inside is BARKING. Ray quickly rolls the 
               window down, letting in THUNDER.

               Cooch starts to say something then takes note of Ray's peaked 
               face. Sweat runs down his temples, beads at his nose.

                                     COOCH
                         Jesus, you alright?

                                     RAY
                         Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't 
                         believe it. I --

                                     COOCH
                         Never turn your radio off! I thought 
                         I was gonna find you scalped! Damn 
                         it!

                                     RAY
                         Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --

                                     COOCH
                         -- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got 
                         Jimmy nailed. Let's go!

               And Cooch runs to his car. Ray fires the car's big engine 
               and takes off behind Cooch who is driving a fed Chevy. CRAZY 
               HEARTBEAT DRUM INTO --

               EXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRATLER - LATE DAY

               The rain pelts Grandpa's little Airstream trailer, wind snaps 
               at sheet plastic in the windows. An ancient sewing wheel 
               CREAKS RUSTY in the wind.

               Three clean, late-model fed cars pull down the muddy drive 
               as two SWAT vehicles pull in from another road. The Le Baron 
               pulls in, and Ray bails out with the others. When he sees 
               where he is, he looks distraught.

               Agents are running behind junked cars, positioning themselves 
               around the trailer.

               INT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER  LATE DAY

               The holy man is sitting in his chair, smacking Flies with a 
               swatter. Tonight he wears a black reservation hat and stares 
               vacantly at the TV where RONALD MACDONALD swings a giant 
               baseball bat, and falls on his face, bouncing back up. And 
               then BOOM!

               The door is open and Cooch leads Miles, Sherman and Ray 
               inside. Cooch has a gun on the old man.

                                     COOCH
                         HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!

               The old man slowly removes his hat and hangs it on a knee. 
               Carefully he places his wrinkled hands on his thinning white 
               hair. His eyes seek out Ray who stands in the doorway, M-16 
               in hand, looking concerned. He stares at Ray.

               Cooch storms into a back bedroom, Miles moves to a window. 
               Sherman stands over the old man.

                                     SHERMAN
                         Where is he, Sam? Where's Jimmy?

               Grandpa looks at Sherman, ignores him, looks back at Ray.

                                     SHERMAN
                         He's a medicine man, Ray. The 
                         "spiritual leader" of the Warriors. 
                         That right, Sam?

               With RADIO TRANSMISSIONS crackling through the house, Cooch 
               comes back down the hall, and heads to the door.

                                     COOCH
                         Trailer's clean, let's go.

               Ray starts to follow but he sees Sherman pick something up 
               from near Grandpa. The 500 year-old turtleshell rattle. 
               Grandpa's eyes widen slightly.

                                     SHERMAN
                         You been the one making it rain like 
                         that, out there, Sam?

                                     RAY
                         Hey, put that down.

                                     SHERMAN
                         Can you make Jimmy outrun an M-16, 
                         Sam?

                                     RAY
                         Sherman!

               Sherman drops the turtleshell rattle on the linoleum floor. 
               Then drives his heel into it, CRUSHING the fragile 
               turtleshell.

               Ray grabs him and slams him into the tin wall. Miles gets 
               between them, grabbing Sherman.

                                     MILES
                         EASY, MEN! HEY! --

                                     RADIO
                         HE'S ON THE ROOF! HE'S ON THE FUCKING 
                         ROOF! COME ON GUYS, COME ON, GUYS!

               They're out the door, leaving the old man to sit looking 
               down at the shattered rattle. He closes his eyes.

               EXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER

               In a blizzard of rain, Jimmy Looks Twice in a cowboy shirt, 
               jeans and boots, leaps off the top of the Airstream, clutching 
               his medicine bundle. FLOODLIGHTS HIT him from all directions. 
               BULLHORNS screaming at him.

               He tries to turn a corner and runs right into a fed. Ray, 
               having run out the back door has slammed right into him. He 
               has his rifle on him, and they stare each other down for a 
               split second before he is converged on. Guns at his back, at 
               his head.

               He is swept off his feet, face down, and frisked. He looks 
               up at Ray, desperately.

                                     LOOKS TWICE
                         Brother, the old man told me about 
                         you. Listen to me: what was Leo trying 
                         to tell me? He wanted to meet me at 
                         Maisy --

               Another fed, pushes his face into the mud, cuffs him behind 
               his back.

                                     FED
                         Save your speeches for prison, Jimmy.

               With two FIVE MAN SWAT TEAMS swarming the area, and six agents 
               pushing Jimmy toward a car, Cooch stands there in the pouring 
               rain, looking relieved. Ray stands near him, looking abhorred.

                                     COOCH
                         Damn. That's one hard running Indian.

               Ray watches Jimmy as he is shoved into the back of Miles and 
               Sherman's car and driven away. He is twisting around in his 
               seat to look at Ray. Desperately. The SWAT teams disband, 
               return to their vehicles.

                                     COOCH
                         It's over, Ray. I aged five years. 
                         But it's over. At least I'm gonna 
                         look like I'm ready for the advisory 
                         desk. Let's go get a beer.

               Cooch heads to his car and Ray starts shuffling toward his 
               as if he is dared by it all. He is looking at the trailer 
               and there on the rickety porch is Grandpa. He comes down the 
               steps slowly, holding his hat on against the wind. He watches 
               the cars pulling out.

               Ray walks over to him, looking sick.

                                     RAY
                         Look... I'm not who you think I am.
                              (a long beat)
                         I'm sorry.

               And after a moment of locking gazes, he starts for his car,

                                     GRANDPA
                         Out back that way... is a placed 
                         called Wounded Knee.

               Ray turns.

                                     GRANDPA
                         I was one years old there when our 
                         people were shot down. My mother hid 
                         me in the snow in a blanket. One of 
                         those killed was a Holy Man called 
                         Wakiyan Cante -- Thunder Heart. They 
                         killed him while he was running for 
                         The Stronghold. It is his blood -- 
                         the same blood that spilled on the 
                         grass and snow at Wounded Knee -- 
                         that runs through your heart like a 
                         buffalo.

               Ray frowns, disturbed by this story.

               The old man is speaking with conviction. With power.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Thunder Heart has come. Sent here to 
                         a troubled place to help his people. 
                         That's what I am told. Maybe you're 
                         right and I am mistaken. Your mind 
                         is young, mine is old. If so, so be 
                         it. Ho Hecetu Yelo. I'll speak no 
                         more.

               Ray stands, almost paralyzed, digesting this. He turns and 
               looks into the old man's sharp eyes. Grandpa has closed his 
               eyes, and as he is pulverized by the rain, he turns his face 
               toward it and from way down in his belly, he begins to SING 
               IN LAKOTA. And it is too much. Too weird. He wheels and 
               hurries to the car. Gets in, and beats a fast path out of 
               the old man's lonesome patch of land.

               BLUE HEAT LIGHTNING knifes the sky. THUNDER ROLLS, and rumbles 
               into POOL BALLS --

               EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL AND BAR - LATE DAY

               The agents have taken over both sides of the streets, gathered 
               in front of the bar and the motel, putting firearms into 
               cases, removing flak jackets.

               POOL BALLS knock from inside the bar while outside, A DAKOTAN 
               takes a piss near a truck while his GIRLFRIEND stands at his 
               back, yelling at him. CHARLIE DANIELS sings country on the 
               juke Ray heads to room 13, starts unlocking the door. Cooch 
               comes up behind him.

                                     COOCH
                         Buffalo burgers and cold beer, 
                         Raymond. Don't worry about the sign 
                         out front... you don't have to be 
                         Indian anymore.

               Cooch throws a mock punch at Ray and he mock blocks, tired. 
               He musters a smile. But he isn't all there.

                                     COOCH
                         You have a fever. You okay?

               Ray nods. Cooch lets a few agents walk past, LAUGHING. He 
               speaks quietly.

                                     COOCH
                         Listen: when we get back tomorrow, 
                         you're gonna find Tully laying a 
                         promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to 
                         prove that his yuppie agents are 
                         making good. He's offering you New 
                         York. Tell him you want Atlanta.

                                     RAY
                         Why?

                                     COOCH
                         Cuz I want New York.

               Ray tries to break a smile again. Cooch cups his arm.

                                     RAY
                         Cooch. They sent us out here because 
                         the place was being neglected. Now, 
                         all of a sudden, there's two five 
                         man SWAT teams out there tonight. 
                         Bell Huey choppers flying all over 
                         the place. Federal occupation to 
                         catch one guy. Why, Cooch? What's 
                         going on?

               Cooch stares at Ray. The younger agent looks like he indeed 
               has a fever.

                                     COOCH
                         National security, Ray. Get some 
                         sleep. Tomorrow, we fly.

               Cooch hurries across the rain-swept street. Ray steps inside 
               and closes the door.

               INT. ROOM 13 - BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL

               Ray closes the door, and stands there. He seems to be having 
               trouble breathing. He looks down at his boots. There is 
               something on the floor. Something that has been slipped under 
               the door earlier. He just stares down at it. Then slowly 
               stoops.

               CLOSE ON: the polaroid of the res car he gave to Maggie 
               earlier. She

               has returned it. He turns it over. Written across the white 
               backing of the photo, in dark black marker is the name -- 
               YELLOW BIRD.

               Ray stares at this for a moment then hurries over to boxes 
               of files on the bed. He rummages like a nervous thief and 
               comes up with a folder. He flips through it, casting off 
               files and 302's and profiles and finally stopping on --

               The 8x10 BLACK AND WHITE of Richard Yellow Bird seen earlier. 
               Sitting in his wheelchair, Red Power cap on, tattoos marring 
               big arms. And under it a DOUBLE MUG SHOT stamped LEAVENWORTH 
               PRISON. Under that ANOTHER PRISON MUG SHOT stamped SIOUX 
               FALLS PRISON. And under that a --

               THIRD MUG SHOT stamped "PAROLED."

               Ray, his eyes fixed on this one, takes a few steps and sits 
               on the end of the bed. He then stuffs the file back in a 
               box, and takes off toward the door.

               EXT. RESERVATION ROAD - SUNSET

               The Le Baron throws up loose rock and red dust, driving toward 
               a place where the sun begins a slow drop behind the Black 
               Hills. HORSES run out of the road. HEARTBEAT DRUM.

               EXT. MULE DEER DISTRICT  RES - SUNSET

               A tarpaper shack. Outhouse. Clothesline on which jerked meat 
               hangs. No cars. A lonely, unnerving place. Le Baron pulls 
               in. Ray gets out, adjusting the gun at the back of his 
               waistband. He starts for the shack. Ray raps a fist on the 
               splintered plywood door. Knocks again. He checks out a boarded-
               up window. The door finally opens. Just a crack. Tiny black 
               eyes peer out into the fading light.

                                     RAY
                         I'm looking for Richard Yellow Bird.

               Ray sticks his open badge, gold eagle wings, near the crack. 
               The door closes. Then unlatches and opens. Yellow Bird sits 
               there in his wheelchair, tiny tobacco bundles in his lap. 
               He's been tying them.

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         The Washington Redskin. Thought you'd 
                         be gone by now.

               He pivots his chair to allow Ray room to enter.

               INT. YELLOW BIRD SHACK

               Yellow Bird, in a T-shirt that reveals twenty different ink 
               tattoos, rolls himself across the warped floorboards to a 
               cheese crate where his eye glasses sit. He puts the thick 
               bifocals on and focuses resentfully on Ray in the ochre 
               flicker of the dirty room.

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         What ya want?

                                     RAY
                         Must be a bitch getting around in 
                         that wheelchair. How long you been 
                         in it?

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         Since I got a iron pipe put across 
                         my knees, man. Fight with three 
                         wasi'cus, ya know.

                                     RAY
                         At Sioux Falls Pen?

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         No, that was Leavenworth. This --
                              (shows a scar)
                         was Sioux Falls. What ya want?

                                     RAY
                         Leavenworth a tough joint?

               Ray walks across the room, his eyes on a covert mission.

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         You ever try solitary confinement?

                                     RAY
                         No. Can't say that I have, Richard. 
                         Richard do you know why I'm here?

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         Washington sent ya. I know that.

                                     RAY
                         Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. 
                         They sent me here because this whole 
                         thing has been fucked. Do you know 
                         what I mean when I say this whole 
                         thing has been fucked, Richard?

               Yellow Bird stares at Ray.

                                     RAY
                         An arrangement was made between you... 
                         and us. Do you remember that 
                         arrangement?

               Yellow Bird looks at Ray, strangely, shaking his head. Ray 
               starts to look like maybe the game's not working. Like maybe 
               this doesn't add up. But --

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         I'm here, ain't I?

               Ray lets a tense breath out.

                                     RAY
                         Not for long, Richard. You got early 
                         parole under the stipulation that 
                         you would help us in a situation, 
                         and you didn't deliver.

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         What the fuck you talkin' about?

               Ray sits in a busted chair, reaches down to his ankle holster 
               and pulls out a .38. He holds it, resting it on the arm of 
               the chair. He strains to look out through the boarded window. 
               Yellow Bird fidgets in his chair.

                                     RAY
                         Get up out of the chair, Richard.

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         What's with you people? Why do ya 
                         have to fuck with my head all the 
                         time? I came through, man.

                                     RAY
                         Get up out of the chair, and walk 
                         toward the backdoor, Richard.

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                              (not moving)
                         I get thrown in solitary until I 
                         don't know my own fuckin' name, and 
                         then you people tell me I can beat 
                         nine years if I help you. I helped 
                         you!

                                     RAY
                         Get up!

               Yellow Bird stands. He takes a step forward. Limping. He's 
               got leg problems but he can walk. Heels first. And bowed. 
               But he can walk. He is shaking.

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         They said I'd never see FBI again, 
                         and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I 
                         don't feed ya information on the 
                         Warriors, it's back to the pen. I 
                         don't do this, back to the pen. Your 
                         word against my word. Against a con 
                         Indian's word. I really got a chance, 
                         man, right?

                                     RAY
                         They sent me here, Richard because 
                         they said you didn't hold up your 
                         end of the arrangement, and I have 
                         to transport you back to Leavenworth.

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                              (crying)
                         What the fuck, man? What do you people 
                         want? I did what you wasi'cu's told 
                         me to do.

                                     RAY
                         Leo Fast Elk... is alive.

               Yellow Bird wheels.

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         No way. No fuckin' way.

                                     RAY
                         How the hell do you know?

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         I blew his back out with a buffalo 
                         gun, that's how I know! Now you're 
                         gonna say I didn't, so you can throw 
                         me back in solitary?

               Ray is trying hard not to reveal his horror at this 
               confession, at this understanding of the machinery. He sits 
               there with his gun, blinking away sweat that beads at his 
               brow. Yellow Bird is weeping in a highpitched voice that 
               doesn't match his great bulk.

                                     RAY
                         The men who came to see you at 
                         Leavenworth. The one's who made the 
                         arrangement... who were they? Maybe 
                         I can talk to them.

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         Miles. Three other suits. That's all 
                         I know 'em as -- suits. Were you 
                         there?

                                     RAY
                         You turned Leo over on his face. But 
                         the coyotes must've turned him back 
                         over, man, cuz his spirit is out. 
                         It's out, and it knows.

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         What do you know about spirits? You 
                         ain't no In'dn.

                                     RAY
                         Leo knew something heavy and was 
                         trying to tell Jimmy. But you must 
                         not know how serious it was or you 
                         would have delivered. Do you realize 
                         what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do 
                         you?!

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         I took him out before he got the 
                         chance. He didn't say nothin' about 
                         Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in 
                         the dirt. Forever.

                                     RAY
                         What's Tashka Sha, speak English, 
                         speak English!

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         Red Deer Table! What's with you, 
                         man?

               Ray grabs onto these words, rolls them silently on his lips 
               And now Yellow Bird is getting suspicious of the fed.

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         Wait a minute. Wait -- what are you 
                         doin'? You ain't a FBI. You ain't 
                         the law. Let me see your --

               Ray snaps out his gun, straight-armed.

                                     RAY
                         I'm the fucking law!

               Yellow Bird jumps back, raising his hands.

                                     RAY
                         Keep talking, Yellow Bird...

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         All I know... is I did what I did... 
                         and I ain't in solitary, gettin' 
                         pumped up with downer, gettin' beat 
                         to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. 
                         Take me back. Cuz I can't take this 
                         shit no more.

               And then HEADLIGHTS pierce the gaps in the boarded windows. 
               Yellow Bird collapses against the wall, bangs his head off 
               it. He lets a long, pained, cry escape from under his breath 
               and he begins a slow slide down the wall, to the floor.

               Ray peers out the cracks in the boards.

                                     YELLOW BIRD
                         Man, I don't know who the fuck I am 
                         no more.

               Ray gets up, putting his gun away and heading to the door. 
               He stops and looks back at the Indian, sitting on the floor, 
               clutching his knees, staring into the kerosene flicker.

                                     RAY
                         You and me both.

               Yellow Bird looks at him, his glasses foggy, his face 
               contorted And Ray leaves.

               EXT. YELLOW BIRD'S SHACK - NIGHT

               Ray steps out into the falling night. There is a car parked 
               there. With a high aerial. Ray raises a hand in a slight 
               wave, walks on. At the fed car, A REGIONAL AGENT behind the 
               wheel, waves a hand. Watches Ray get into the Le Baron.

               Ray gets in the car and takes off.

               LE BARON - TRAVELING

               Ray drives like a crazy man through the dark reservation. 
               Through miles of open land and strange rock formations. And 
               he looks trapped. HEADLIGHTS flicker in his rearview. He 
               sees this. Slams the gas pedal.

               EXT. RES ROADS - NIGHT

               The Le Baron races at 85 down the dirt stretch. A moment 
               later a car rattles by at 90.

               INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING

               Ray reaches over to the passenger seat and pulls up the M-
               16. He lays it across his lap. Looks in the rearview again. 
               Then makes a sudden sharp turn.

               He pulls off the road quickly, throwing up dust into the 
               already foggy night, the car goes out of control.

               EXT. WOUNDED KNEE MEMORIAL - NIGHT

               The car that was following drives right past the narrow layby, 
               hidden by grassy slopes and keeps flying down the long 
               stretch.

               INT. LE BARON

               Ray skids through the dirt, trying to stop -- he can't -- 
               and the Le Baron fishtails, smashing into a chain-link fence. 
               And coming to a stop.

               Breathing as if he's been running not driving, Ray looks 
               behind him to make sure he lost the car. He did. When he 
               turns back to his wheel, he sees --

               THROUGH THE CHAINLINK FENCE

               lit by his headlights: THE WOUNDED KNEE gravesite. He is 
               right up on the arch, and the tall stone marker beyond it.

               EXT. WOUNDED KNEE MEMORIAL - NIGHT

               The Le Baron just sits parked, headlights making the night 
               fog crawl up from the base of the old tomb, along the fence.

               The driver's door opens slowly. And Ray steps out. He walks 
               through the arch. Into the small fenced area. Up to the stone 
               which is overgrown with stubborn weeds, half-hidden in mist. 
               Ray studies the tomb.

               POV: THE NAMES ON THE STONE ARE CHISELED VERTICALLY:

               CHIEF STANDING BEAR

               MR. HIGH HAWK

               AFRAID OF BEAR

               Weeds are grown up over the rest of the names. Ray's hands 
               clear them, grab at them and rip them away from more names:

               PRETTY HAWK

               BLUE AMERICAN

               SHERMAN HORN CLOUD

               With frantic abandon, Ray is ripping weeds away. He drops to 
               his knees, clearing weeds.

               STRONG FOX

               THUNDER HEART

               MOVING DOWN and then suddenly back up to the name:

               THUNDER HEART

               REVERSE ON - RAY

               kneeling in the weeds, the wind getting restless around him, 
               screaming the way plains winds do but only these winds are 
               filled with a whistling. What sounds like EAGLE BONE WHISTLES, 
               piping shrill.

               Ray kneels before the marker, staring at the name on the 
               stone, his hair thrown around by the wind that drives across 
               the grass, whistling eagles, building to an unbearable, pitch.

               Ray stares at the name as if he is looking through a small 
               hole into another world. A world that frightens him. He gets 
               up and backs away from the stone, through the gate. And gets 
               back in his car, quickly. He takes off.

               EXT. MAGGIE EAGLE BEAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The little home on the river. Dark. Empty. Ray runs up the 
               steps, pounds at the door. No answer. Pounds again.

                                     RAY
                         Maggie!

               He keeps knocking. Nothing. He hurries back down the steps, 
               starts around the back of the house and something attacks 
               him, leaps at him from the dark, knocking him off his feet, 
               into the grass. Hits him again.

               But as quickly as he falls, he rolls, throwing up his hands 
               and blocking a savage kick aimed for his face. He traps the 
               boot, twists it and drops the attacker onto his back. In a 
               matter of seconds, he is on top of the man, sticking his gun 
               in his throat. He grabs a flashlight from his jacket and 
               shines it in the man's face.

               Crow Horse. Breathing like a wild animal.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Five-hundred year old turtleshell 
                         rattle...

                                     RAY
                         Crow Horse, listen --

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.

                                     RAY
                         Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         You got Jimmy. Let her go.

                                     RAY
                         Crow Horse, listen. You have to come 
                         with me.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Why? So you can get rid of me, too?

                                     RAY
                         No. So we can do what the old man 
                         said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We 
                         have to go.

               Crow Horse lies there, breathing heavy. Ray on top of him, 
               still clutching his gun.

               INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING - NIGHT

               Ray and Crow Horse are quiet as they eat up the dirt roads.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Maybe the old man's visions are still 
                         strong.

               Ray nods, concentrating. After a time:

                                     RAY
                         Do they come in dreams, these visions?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' 
                         sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. 
                         Ya never know when.

                                     RAY
                         Just before we caught Jimmy... I had 
                         a dream that I was being chased. And 
                         I was running with other people. Old-
                         fashion Indian people. I got shot in 
                         the back. Like Leo.

               When Crow Horse doesn't respond, Ray looks over and finds 
               him staring. He looks back to the road. And when he looks 
               back at Crow Horse, he is still staring at him.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Where was this?

                                     RAY
                         At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where 
                         I was, and that's where the dream 
                         was. Why?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         You were running with the old ones. 
                         At The Knee. Heavy duty.

                                     RAY
                         Well, it was just a dream, I --

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? 
                         Who are you?

                                     RAY
                         What do you mean?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Nothin'. Forget it.

               Crow Horse looks out the window as if to avoid Ray who is 
               confused by the Indian's smoldering. After a moment, Crow 
               Horse looks at him.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         You had a vision. You had yourself a 
                         vision. A man waits a long time for 
                         a vision. Might go his whole lifetime 
                         and never get one. And along comes 
                         some instant Indian with a Mastercard 
                         and brand-new shoes, has himself a 
                         vision.

                                     RAY
                         Sorry.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         I'm a full-blood Oglala.

                                     RAY
                         We've driven a long way. Where is 
                         this place?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, 
                         just one of them, what do ya call 
                         'em, fitful dreams?

                                     RAY
                         Yeah. Fitful dreams.

               Crow Horse feels better. He looks out the window, nodding. 
               But it doesn't last long.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Bullshit. You had a vision. You got 
                         sign from the old ones.

                                     RAY
                         What the hell do you want me to do?!

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Stop.

               Ray brakes. Crow Horse is looking past him. Ray turns. The 
               spectacular mesa that we have admired with every sunrise, 
               looms massive now that we are under it. Moonlight falls on 
               it. And the HEARTBEAT DRUM pulses from it.

               EXT. WHERE-THE-ELK-PEOPLE-USED-TO-LIVE - NIGHT

               The land behind Red Deer Table is Badlands. Badlands pierced 
               by a few rutted old wagon roads. At a place between two 
               grotesque buttes, Crow Horse stops, looking uneasy.

               He digs into his pocket, pulls out some loose tobacco and 
               spills it on the ground. Then he walks on.

               Ray observes this, starting forward, then stopping long enough 
               to fish a cigarette out from his pocket and drop it next to 
               Crow Horse's offering.

               THROUGH THE BADLANDS

               Ray and Crow Horse walk, carefully under a full moon, scanning 
               the area. Crow Horse stops, checks out some tracks. Ray walks 
               on, looking up at the table. He shines his flashlight up and 
               it illuminates --

               A RED RIBBON, tied on stakes on a ridge. Ten stakes. Twenty 
               stakes. Ribbons blowing in the wind.

                                     RAY
                         What's that?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.

               Ray sweeps the light along, walking faster, and then something 
               frightening occurs. Something... some unseen thing snags him 
               by the leg, sucking him into the Earth with a horrible GUSHING 
               SOUND.

               Ray is drawn into a hole up to his hips, a bluish-black slime, 
               oozing out around him. Crow Horse grabs him, struggling to 
               pull him up. He does, stumbling back and stepping into a 
               hole himself.

               The two men are wheeling, throwing flashlight beams around, 
               slapping through a wet jelly, and finally getting their 
               bearings.

               Ray touches the ground where a blue-black chemical solution 
               oozes out with water from the aquifer below. His flashlight 
               scans --

               TWENTY DRILLED HOLES IN THE EARTH. A uranium strip-mining 
               grid laid out in a 50 x 60 pattern. The far side is fenced 
               by flagged stakes.

                                     RAY
                         Jesus. Oil?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came 
                         in from the Nebraska side, and did 
                         some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' 
                         ready to suck this baby dry.

                                     RAY
                         1868... 

                                     CROW HORSE
                         What?

                                     RAY
                         That's what we're doing here. National 
                         interest. National security. Only 
                         this time it's not gold. It's uranium.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         We're standin' on broken treaty 
                         ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to 
                         be here. It'll poison the water.

                                     RAY
                         Leo knew about it. Tried to tell 
                         Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         So they took care of Leo.

                                     RAY
                         Listen to the water... the river 
                         keeps goin' down then rising again.

               Ray goes to another hole and sticks his arm in up to the 
               elbow, sniffs the solution.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         They're drainin' our water table. 
                         That's our life, man...

               Ray is looking past Crow Horse at --

               Something strange in the moonlight. COYOTES. Some forty yards 
               away, on a flat stretch of stoney ground. Six Coyotes, dancing 
               in the shadows of rock formations. MOVING IN ON THEM as Ray 
               walks forward, they circle... scatter... run back... circle 
               again. Look straight at Ray, eyes glowing.

               And run.

               REVERSE - RAY

               and Crow Horse walk toward them. To the place they just left. 
               A place in the dirt, they were digging up. When they reach 
               it, they stare down into the dirt.

               A BODY

               lies there, face down. Denim jacket and a shock of black 
               hair, thrown into tangles and dirt. It was buried. Until the 
               coyote caught wind. Crow Horse bends down, touches the 
               jacket... turns the body over And almost vomits when he sees 
               Maggie Eagle Bear.

               RAY

               looks down in disbelief.

                                     RAY
                         No. No...

               Ray steps back, his boots squishing in solution and sealant 
               and soiled water. He covers his mouth, stopping himself from 
               getting sick. And then he explodes, YELLING.

               LONG SHOT - RED DEER TABLE

               in the moonlight. And RAY'S YELLING ECHOING up out of the 
               rocks

               EXT. BEAR CREEK VILLAGE - NIGHT

               The sordid little village the feds first drove through sits 
               sleepy on the rim of sunrise.

               A DOG BARKS hollow as the Crow Horse motorcycle chutters 
               down and coasts up in front of one of the little homes -- 
               rundown but it has a satellite dish and a decent car like so 
               many. The Le Baron pulls up behind it.

               INT. LE BARON - NIGHT

               Crow Horse walks over to Ray's window, his jeans and boots 
               muddy. No one speaks for a long moment, the night filled by 
               crickets. And that one dog.

                                     RAY
                         This Clear Moon's house?

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. 
                         You better wait here. He don't trust 
                         the white man.

               Crow Horse crosses the street. Ray sits there, and he looks 
               almost hurt by this statement. But he is the white man. But 
               he is Indian. He lets a long breath escape, rubs at a temple. 
               He takes out a smoke. Tries to light it. His hands are shaking 
               too badly. But he gets it lit, and sits tense, looking in 
               his rearview.

               INT. CLEAR MOON HOUSE - NIGHT

               Oliver Clear Moon sits in a chair, his strong Indian mouth, 
               beginning to tighten at the jowls.

               Across from him, Crow Horse sits on the edge of a couch. 
               MRS. CLEAR MOON, a rotund, gentle woman brings him a coffee. 
               A TEENAGE GIRL in a men's extra-large T-shirt stands in the 
               hall, looking at him.

               Clear Moon in pajamas, rises, and with a coffee in hand, 
               starts walking in slow steps toward the kitchen. He loses 
               control before he gets there and hurls the cup across the 
               room into the sink, smashing it. He wheels and faces Crow 
               Horse. He SPEAKS LAKOTA. Asking questions. Crow Horse SPEAKS 
               LAKOTA. Answering him.

               Mrs. Clear Moon, understanding, shakes her head in disbelief 
               and her eyes begin to well. Oliver, walking back to his chair, 
               sits, and thinks for a moment. MORE LAKOTA. He gets up, goes 
               to a drawer and rummages. He sits again, and tosses something 
               onto the coffee table. It is a badge. A tribal police badge.

               INT. LE BARON - PARKED - CLEAR MOON'S - DAWN

               Ray nervously awaits Crow Horse's words as he appears at the 
               window again. The Indian shows hope in his tired eyes.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's 
                         callin' council fire. All the old 
                         chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta 
                         be at Grandpa's place in two hours. 
                         We need to get the tribe together. 
                         We need to block this thing.

                                     RAY
                         What we need... is Richard Yellow 
                         Bird.

               Crow Horse looks at Ray who stares dead ahead.

               EXT. YELLOW BIRD'S SHACK - RES - DAWN

               The shack is just as Ray left it earlier, kerosene flickers 
               dancing yellow through the gapped boards. Ray and Crow Horse 
               with guns drawn, approach the front door.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         I thought it was a rare case of a 
                         brother getting a break in the courts. 
                         We did an honorin' song for him and 
                         everything.

                                     RAY
                         He's looking at a few hundred years 
                         in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come 
                         out without a fight.

               Crow Horse snakes around toward the rear of the shack.

               Ray knocks at the front door. It is unlatched and it creaks 
               open a little. Ray pushes it open and sees --

               INT. YELLOW BIRD SHACK

               An empty wheelchair.

               EXT. YELLOW BIRD SHACK

               Ray steps away from the door, looking around the vast plains 
               as the sun comes up out of the Black Hills. He is roadblocked, 
               and it shows in his eyes. It's all getting too big.

               Crow Horse leans against the shack, watching Ray. And then 
               RADIO STATIC from inside the Le Baron. Ray pivots and stares 
               at it as if someone is inside the car. His call signal is 
               being paged. But he just stands there, looking at it.

                                     RADIO
                         X21. Read. X21...

               Ray reaches inside the car and lifts the handset. He takes a 
               breath before pressing it to his lips.

                                     RAY
                         X21. Come back.

                                     RADIO
                         Ray. What's your 20?

               Ray looks at Crow Horse who looks equally spooked. The agent 
               clears his throat.

                                     RAY
                         Reservation.

               A long, unnerving pause. No response from the other side.

                                     RADIO
                         What are you doing on the reservation?

                                     RAY
                         I'm on my way back in. Over.

               Ray holds the handset down at his side, looking over the top 
               of the car toward the Black Hills.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. 
                         Ray...

                                     RAY
                         You go to the council fire. I'm going 
                         back in.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Ray.

               Ray swings in behind the wheel, starts the car, and barrels 
               off recklessly down the rutted road, leaving Crow Horse 
               behind.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Ray!

               The Le Baron is already out to where sight reaches farther 
               than sound and silent white dust mushrooms skyward.

               EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - MORNING

               A RAVEN is sentinel on a telephone wire that crosses the 
               road from the bar to motel. A few trucks remain parked in 
               front of the joint.

               Ray approaches room 13, looking shell-shocked. His boots 
               leave blue mud prints all the way to the door. He unlocks 
               it.

               INT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - ROOM

               Ray has cast off his field clothes and is halfway into one 
               of his cleaner suits. He looks haggard but still buoyant, 
               his eyes piercing. The connecting door creaks open and Cooch 
               walks in. The SAC is freshly showered and he is fidgeting 
               with a Windsor knot. He studies his number two man, says 
               nothing for a moment but is obviously holding something down. 
               His face is a red hue.

                                     COOCH
                              (extra casual)
                         Couldn't sleep, Ray?

               Ray looks at Cooch. When he speaks, his voice is dry.

                                     RAY
                         No...

               Cooch crosses the room, and picks up Ray's jeans which look 
               like they went through a sandlot tackle match in a mud hole. 
               Ray tucks his clean shirt in; watching Cooch.

                                     RAY
                         I had to finish something with Crow 
                         Horse.

               Cooch walks up to Ray slowly and takes his face in his hand, 
               turning it toward lamp light to study the bruise along his 
               left eye, a residual from a Crow Horse hook.

                                     COOCH
                         That's where you were. You had to go 
                         back and have it out with the Indian 
                         law...

               Ray nods, and Cooch slowly breaks a smile. An insecure smile 
               but a smile just the same. He starts to laugh.

                                     COOCH
                         You fucking hot head, we can get in 
                         trouble for that.

               Cooch laughs in amusement and Ray's face crinkles into a 
               grin as he lowers his eyes, wiping a paper towel over his 
               face. And then, suddenly, Ray lunges at Cooch.

               He slams the Agent in Charge against the hollow wall, and 
               holds him there. His eyes wild.

                                     RAY
                         Why didn't you tell me what we were 
                         doing here?

               Cooch is stunned.

                                     RAY
                         We're running a cover-up and you 
                         didn't --

               Cooch suddenly explodes, throwing Ray off of him and sending 
               him reeling back against the sink. He points a finger at his 
               charge.

                                     COOCH
                         You ever put your hands on me again 
                         and you'll be doing the books for a 
                         baitshop in the fucking Everglades, 
                         Mister.

                                     RAY
                         You didn't tell me about Red Deer 
                         Table --

                                     COOCH
                         -- what the hell is Red Deer Table?

                                     RAY
                         What is it? It's genocide, that's 
                         what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some 
                         U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for 
                         the people here. Uranium, Cooch.

               Cooch's eyes go frighteningly cold. He can't believe what 
               he's hearing.

                                     COOCH
                         Jesus Christ. What are you doing? 
                         What the hell were you doing out 
                         there?

               Ray says nothing. He just stands there, against the sink, 
               breathing like a fighter against the turnbuckle.

                                     COOCH
                         This was a Selective Operations Unit, 
                         Agent Levoi. There is classified 
                         information pertaining to our national

                                     RAY
                         -- if they mine uranium there, these 
                         people will have no place left to

                         We were sworn in on the Constitution 
                         to protect federal matters, Ray. I 
                         don't know about uranium, I don't 
                         know about Red Dog Table -- all I 
                         know is we did our job. It's over.

                                     RAY
                         We neutralized anybody with a voice. 
                         Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who 
                         was standing in the way of the land. 
                         Is that it?

                                     COOCH
                         No. We neutralized enemies of the 
                         United States. Anti-American radicals 
                         who have killed federal officers out 
                         here!

               Ray turns to the sink, turns the faucet on to get some water 
               on his face. The water only trickles into the basin.

                                     COOCH
                         Jesus, Ray. You think I don't like 
                         the Indians? Not true. These were 
                         noble people but their day is gone. 
                         They're a conquered nation. They 
                         want all of America back but they 
                         can't even keep the garbage out of 
                         their own front yards. It's sad, 
                         Ray. But it's just the way it is. We 
                         have to function as a colonial police 
                         force out here.

               Ray leans on the sink, watching the water start to spurt 
               free. He shuts it off. Turns to look at Cooch. And it is 
               then the door opens -- some knocking after the door is already 
               opened -- and SA Miles enters.

                                     MILES
                         You gentlemen ready -- hi, Ray.

                                     COOCH
                         Yeah, we're ready.

               Ray doesn't turn from the sink.

               EXT. RESERVATION ROAD - TOWARD GRANDPA REACHES - MORNING

               Crow Horse chugs along on his motorbike toward the council, 
               his long hair and eagle feather trailing in the wind.

               EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - MORNING

               Two federal vehicles are waiting in front of Cooch's Chevy 
               and Ray's Le Baron. One is an FBI van where Sherman helps 
               THREE AGENTS load file boxes and computers.

               Cooch walks with Ray toward the Le Baron, looking at him as 
               the go. Ray looks better as he breathes the morning air. As 
               they pass the second fed car, the back window power glides 
               down, and someone looks out with a friendly smile.

                                     CLEAR MOON
                         Ah, there you are. The Sioux.

               Ray stops dead. Beholds the Tribal President who wears a 
               western cut jacket and a strained expression behind his smile. 
               He hole a hand out to Ray.

                                     CLEAR MOON
                         You got the troublemakers off our 
                         land. Good, Was-te.

               Ray stares at him, speechless. Horrified. What is he doing 
               here? What about the council fire? Ray somehow nods. Then 
               walks on to the Le Baron. Cooch gets behind the wheel of the 
               car that Clear Moon sits in. Clear Moon's eyes follow Ray to 
               the car.

               EXT. RES ROAD - TO GRANDPA REACHES

               Crow Horse guns past a little shack. As he does, he looks in 
               his side mirror then out across the grasslands. Then quickly

               IN HIS MIRROR: a car has pulled out from behind the shack. 
               CROW HORSE observes this. Then twists the fuel throttle hard.

               INT. LE BARON

               Ray gets behind the wheel, looks at his watch. He is 
               panicking. He starts the car, reverses, slams into drive.

               RAYS POV: swerving and reckless as he races forward. Sherman, 
               walking around to one of the cars has to run out of the way. 
               The other agents clear out, looking in confusion as Ray cuts 
               a hard U -- sweeps PAST THE BAR, SMASHES INTO AND THROUGH 
               the old hitching post -- and HEADS TOWARD the reservation 
               which lies vast before him.

               EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL

               With agents scrambling about, looking after the car, Cooch 
               gets out, looking into the dust Ray left behind. HEARTBEAT 
               DRUM.

                                     COOCH
                         RAY!

               Sherman appears beside Cooch aiming a questioning look. When 
               Cooch quickly gets back behind the wheel, Sherman pulls his 
               radio up and starts yelling into it.

               Cooch reaches out the window and grabs his radio arm.

                                     COOCH
                         No, damn it. You call teams in and 
                         this is gonna be a fucking media 
                         event. Get me three cars, six agents, 
                         block all reservation exits. It's 
                         under control.

               And Cooch squeals out with a petrified Clear Moon in the 
               backseat, inquiring nervously.

               EXT. ROAD TO GRANDPA REACHES

               Crow Horse passes by an abandoned horse trailer. When he 
               does, another car pulls out. And follows. The first car passes 
               by.

               Crow Horse sees he's being followed. He cranks his throttle 
               and the engine grinds then dies. He heels his kickstart on 
               the fly, and keeps it alive. But his old horse is no match 
               for the big engines coming up fast behind him.

               INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING

               Ray is leaving little transitional developments and trailers 
               behind. His eyes bore into the road before him, looking for 
               a sign of Crow Horse, and in the rearview for a sign of his 
               FBI mentor.

               EXT. ROAD TO GRANDPA REACHES - BADLANDS

               Crow Horse has the throttle open. But the two cars are coming 
               up on both sides, trying to sandwich him. To his right the 
               Badlands loom deep, a drop into a caliche netherworld of 
               jagged rock.

               He throws the bike right, trying to ride the thin ribbon of 
               shoulder.

               THE FIRST CAR

               floors it, and swipes him, and the bike goes over the edge, 
               launched into --

               THE BADLANDS

               where it does a violent triple flip, throwing Crow Horse 
               then smashing into a tent shaped dune.

               A RIFLE

               sticks out from a window and punches the Badlands with THREE 
               SHOTS.

               EXT. ROAD TO GRANDPA REACHES

               The Le Baron rifles past the abandoned horse trailer. Black 
               smoke drifts in a wind ahead.

               Ray veers onto the shoulder, barely gets the car in park 
               before bailing and running wildly down into the Badlands.

               EXT. BADLANDS

               Ray runs, stumbles through the rock and gypsum, searching 
               the area. He runs around the burning motorcycle, looking 
               left and right.

                                     RAY
                         Crow Horse!

               CROW HORSE

               lies on his back in the Badlands, eyes open, fixed unmoving 
               on the sky. Ray comes out of the flame-waves, running with 
               his .45 held high. He throws himself to his knees beside the 
               injured Indian.

                                     RAY
                         Crow Horse!

               Crow Horse rolls his eyes toward the FBI agent. He has a 
               gash behind his ear, and pink sand clings to the blood. He 
               lifts his head, tries to form words.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear 
                         Moon...

                                     RAY
                         I know. Come on. We gotta get off 
                         the reservation or we're dead.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.

                                     RAY
                         Bullshit, let's get outta here,

               Ray gets an arm under the big Indian, helps him up out of a 
               jagged crevice.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Grandpa...

               EXT. RESERVATION ROAD

               Cooch's car speeds down the stretch. Followed by Sherman's. 
               The FBI van. All at one-hundred and five. Gravel and dirt 
               flies.

               INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING

               With Crow Horse half-passed out in the passenger seat, Ray 
               keeps the wheel steady. And then his RADIO STATICS.

                                     RADIO
                         X21, please read. Ray. Ray. X21,

               Ray just stares down at the radio, keeps the pedal floored. 
               The throws the wheel left.

               EXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER

               The Le Baron fish-tails in a cloud of dust and Ray leaps out 
               of the car, runs toward the little trailer, gun in hand. The 
               windows are all busted, and the door is wide open. Ray runs 
               in. Then straight back out, shaking his head to Crow Horse.

               Crow Horse hangs his head out the passenger window.

                                     RAY
                         He's gone.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         He hasn't left this place in twenty 
                         years. They got him.

               Ray starts to get back in then hesitates. He looks out across 
               the plains to see --

               THREE FED CARS in the distance, fast approaching, dust rising.

               Ray gets in quickly.

               EXT. RESERVATION EXIT

               Cooch's car is parked in a roadblock. Clear Moon stands near 
               him, and addresses UNIFORMED TRIBAL POLICE as they spill out 
               from a van, carrying rifles and shotguns.

               Cooch has torn his tie away, his shirt is open, and he is 
               sweat soaked. Miles gets out of a car that pulls up.

                                     MILES
                         We have a renegade agent, Cooch? He 
                         gets off the reservation...

                         -- he's not getting off the

               And Cooch gets back in the car, drives off.

               INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING

               With Ray driving like a maniac, Crow Horse is turned around 
               in his seat, watching the federal cars spreading out, the 
               chopper moving in.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         They got us sealed. What are we gonna

                              (Cooch)
                         Yellow Bird committed suicide at 
                         three o'clock this morning. Some 
                         gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him 
                         into a corner. You're playing a losing 
                         game. Pull over.

               Ray takes the mic and for some reason, he's putting it inside 
               his jacket near his shoulder where he keeps his leather. 
               Crow Horse looks at him, puzzled. And then the sound comes 
               forth, the static crackling of a micro-cassette recorder.

                                     RECORDER
                              (Ray)
                         How the hell do you know?
                              (Yellow Bird)
                         I blew his back out with a buffalo 
                         gun, that's how I know. And now you're 
                         gonna say I didn't and put me back 
                         in solitary?!

               Ray keeps the tape running into the radio as he drives through 
               rugged Badlands. Crow Horse, stunned by the voice, eyes Ray 
               as the tape rolls.

               INT. CHEVY - TRAVELING

               Cooch and Clear Moon stare in horror at the radio.

                                     RADIO
                              (Yellow Bird)
                         You people tol' me I could beat nine 
                         years if I helped you. I helped you!
                              (rewinding)
                         I could beat nine years if I helped 
                         you. I helped you!

               Cooch is shaking his head in vitrified disbelief. He slams 
               the pedal almost through the floor.

               INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING

               The tape ends and Ray now lifts the mic to his mouth.

                                     RAY
                              (into mic)
                         Fuck you.

               And he too, buries the accelerator.

               EXT. BADLANDS ROAD  TO THE STRONGHOLD

               The Le Baron burns forward and we SWEEP UP TO A MIND-BLOWING 
               AERIAL VIEW of the Badlands as four fed cars spread out in 
               formation, following.

               INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING

               Crow Horse is turned around, looking at the pursuit.

                                     RAY
                         Walter.

               Crow Horse turns, sees what Ray is looking at.

               POV: The Stronghold -- a narrow opening in hulking rock 
               formations. Large enough for a car to get in, and keep 
               followers out.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in 
                         there, we got a chance.

                                     RAY
                         We're in there. We're in there --

               just ahead, the earth is gone. A wavering heat pond turns 
               out to be a crevice and they nose down into it, burying the 
               front end in sand and rock. WINDSHIELD SHATTERS.

               EXT. THE STRONGHOLD

               The Le Baron is stuck, wheels spinning out. Ray and Cooch 
               bail. Guns drawn, they start running for the Stronghold.

               AT THE EDGE OF THE ARROYO

               the caravan slides in recklessly, two of the fed cars coming 
               dangerously close to going over the edge. The regional 
               officers and six Clear Moon goons empty out, running down 
               the dip, rifles and shotguns ready.

               Three more field agents come down from another direction, 
               followed by Cooch. Sherman hands a bullhorn to him.

                                     COOCH
                              (via bullhorn)
                         FREEZE! NOW!

               The sound of FIFTEEN PRIMING FIREARMS stops Ray and Crow 
               Horse in their tracks. Just twenty feet from The Stronghold. 
               Crow Horse, windless, stumbles to a knee. Ray turns slowly, 
               facing the small army.

                                     COOCH
                         DROP IT.

               Crow Horse, rises, sucking wind, and ditches his gun in the 
               Badlands. Ray holds onto his .45 a moment longer. Then drops 
               it. He stares at --

               THE WALL OF MEN

               Cooch, SA Miles, SA Sherman, Six regional officers, six Clear 
               Moon goons. And now, coming out of the backseat of Cooch's 
               Chevy, Oliver Clear Moon, walking tentatively, cautiously.

               Cooch lowers the bullhorn. He takes the opportunity to stare 
               at Ray. To let Ray stare at him. The older agent looks broken.

                                     COOCH
                         Crow Horse, get your face in the 
                         dirt. Ray... come forward. Let it 
                         go. Let's just let it go...

               AT THE STRONGHOLD ENTRANCE

               Crow Horse lowers himself to a knee then lies face down. Ray 
               just stands there, the wind against him.

                                     COOCH (O.S.)
                         Come on, Ray. Come forward.

                                     RAY
                         No way, Cooch.

               Ray refuses to move.

               COOCH

               sweating, tries to keep control. All around him, hands are 
               on guns. Cooch is walking toward Ray.

                                     COOCH
                         Ray. I'm coming to talk to you. I'm 
                         gonna walk you out of here. And we're 
                         gonna get the hell outta this place.

               Cooch walks toward him, a gun hanging at one side, bullhorn 
               at the other. The agents behind him, around him, all raise 
               rifles, all take aim.

               Sherman, looking sick, gets to a knee and sets aim. The sound 
               of clacking steel, all around. But Cooch seems disturbed by 
               the sound. Because its coming from above. He raises an eye 
               from the rifle sight to see --

               ALONG THE EDGE OF THE BUTTE

               FIFTEEN INDIANS, training rifles and shotguns down below.

               SHERMAN

               looks up from his rifle, bewildered. Then alarmed.

               ALONG THE EDGE OF THE BUTTE

               We PAN across fifteen Indians -- old people, women, kids. 
               Their weapons are weak but many.

               And at the end of the row, Maisy Blue Legs rises, clutching 
               a rifle. And PAST HER, ANOTHER. TRADITIONAL PEOPLE, many 
               from the trading post porch, rise to the edge, armed. Silent.

               Twenty, twenty-five, thirty traditionals, forming a line 
               along the ridge, a line that runs in a circle, broken by the 
               Stronghold entrance, then starting again on the next butte. 
               Thirty-five, forty of them. And more, standing along the 
               opposite craggy rock, some wearing tractor caps, some cowboy 
               hats, some just long hair blowing in the wind. Fifty, sixty, 
               SEVENTY-FIVE RESERVATION PEOPLE forming a circle on the rocks; 
               it's Little Big Horn revisited. A fourteen year-old boy 
               struggles to keep a huge shotgun at his shoulder.

               DOWN BELOW

               Clear Moon's mouth is as dry as Badlands soil. Cooch is 
               panicking, his eyes running along the high edge.

               RAY

               stands equally astonished, assessing the back-up.

               CROW HORSE

               lifts himself, stands, taking in the sight.

               AT THE EDGE OF THE BUTTE

               stepping stiffly but steadily through the line of armed 
               locals, pushing his way to the very edge so as to look down, 
               Grandpa Sam Reaches. The wind makes feathery tails out of 
               his long thinning strips of white hair.

               DOWN BELOW

               Ray looks up at the old man, then turns to face Cooch.

                                     RAY
                         You're right, Cooch. It's over.

               Cooch slowly, lets the bullhorn fall. Then the rifle. He 
               looks back at Sherman who does the same, and all the way 
               down the line, everyone dropping their arms under the threat 
               of a lot more guns from above. And now Ray walks forward, 
               collecting his gun. Anderson Chasing Hawk, one of the 
               Warriors, runs down to Ray, breathless.

                                     CHASING HAWK
                         All the exits are blocked. There's 
                         two more fed cars tryin' to get in. 
                         And some press.

               Ray notices that Cooch is staring at him, hard. He shakes 
               his head slowly. Strongly.

                                     COOCH
                         Ray...

                                     RAY
                         Let the press through.

               Chasing Hawk takes off, running, and Cooch watches in 
               consternation. Ray just stands eye to eye with him, holding 
               his ground.

               UP TO ARIEL VIEW - OVER STRONGHOLD

               And along the ridge, Grandpa and the locals don't budge, 
               watching every move.

               CLIMBING HIGHER, we rise above the circle of proud Sioux to 
               see, on the inside of the Stronghold, thirty old trucks and 
               res cars.

               CLIMBING HIGHER into and through the fast-moving clouds that 
               the Lakota call The Grandfathers as the HEARTBEAT DRUM and 
               LAKOTA SINGERS takes over all sound.

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BEAR CREEK RESERVATION - MAIN SETTLEMENT - LATER

               The HIGH WINDS of THREE MEDIA HELICOPTERS are delighting a 
               storm of Indian children and BARKING DOGS, running through 
               the streets past junked cars on blocks.

               Over on a little plot of grass and dirt, a pair of hands are 
               digging a small hole. Ray lays a pine cone in the hole and 
               looks down at it for a moment... before hand-plowing the 
               dirt back over it and patting it flat. He rises, knocking 
               dirt off his knees and hands.

               Crow Horse walks over, bandaged and favoring wounds, and Ray 
               falls in with him, walking down the middle of the village 
               road. His eyes are tired. But hopeful.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         The people are already talkin' about 
                         their vote for a new tribal prez. 
                         They wanna vote for Jimmy.

               Ray nods, encouraged as they walk along. His eyes follow the 
               helicopters.

                                     RAY
                         What about the water...

                                     CROW HORSE
                         You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't 
                         never gonna be over... but you bought 
                         her some time.

                                     RAY
                         Some Indian time?

               They reach the dusty, dented Le Baron and stand there, looking 
               at each other.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Indian time.

               Crow Horse offers a hand to Ray. He takes it in a white man's 
               shake then follows Walter's cue into the Indian "allies" 
               grip and slap. They hold it there, looking into each other's 
               eyes.

                                     CROW HORSE
                              (concerned)
                         Where ya gonna go, Ray?

               Ray ponders for a moment.

                                     RAY
                         I'll have to see what the visions 
                         say about that one.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         You didn't have another vision...

               Ray shrugs. Crow Horse discreetly gestures below his belt.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Yeah, right here.

               Ray cracks a smile, a long time coming.

                                     RAY
                         You take care.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         If you ever need a place to come 
                         back to and listen to the trees a 
                         little... we'll be here.

               Ray stands looking at him, searching for words.

                                     CROW HORSE
                         Ain't no word in Sioux for goodbye.

               Ray goes to get in his car. But he sees someone sitting across 
               the street on the trading post porch. The old man.

               Ray considers him for a moment then walks over. They lock 
               eyes. Grandpa stares at Ray as if he's never seen him before, 
               and then arcs a brow. He touches his sleeve at the wrist. 
               Ray rolls his sleeve back to reveal his Rolex. Grandpa smiles 
               and Ray strips it off. He hands it to the old man and his 
               face crinkles into caliche earth.

               Grandpa holds the watch up in the light, admires it then 
               puts it in his shirt pocket. He moves a flat hand through 
               the air in the "done deal" sign language. Ray, a little 
               surprised that he gets nothing in the trade, returns the 
               smile and walks away.

               He gets to his car and wipes away two inches of dust from 
               the broken windshield.

               INT. LE BARON

               After THREE TRIES, he gets the engine started. He pulls his 
               gun off his waistband, goes to lay it on the passenger seat 
               and finds something there.

               Grandpa's sacred caanunpa. The Pipe. Symbol of truth. Ray 
               looks out the window at the old man who is watching him with 
               those sharp black eyes. Ray lifts his hand, holds it flat, 
               and does the Sioux done deal sign.

               EXT. BEAR CREEK RESERVATION - DAY

               The Le Baron eats up the dirt road at a moderate, gravel 
               crunching pace. It slows as it passes Maggie Eagle Bear's 
               quiet home on the river. Children walk with the old woman, 
               carrying buckets from the river.

               The Le Baron slows to a crawl, then drives on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TRADING POST PORCH

               where the elders sit, watching the dust blow.

                                     CROW HORSE (V.O.)
                              (voice lingering)
                         We will be here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CROW HORSE walking off down the road. He stops, and looks 
               over his shoulder, trying to glimpse the distance.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LE BARON driving off the res, under big sky as it ascends 
               a rough hill, waddles through potholes, negotiates with some 
               horses in the road and rolls on toward the reservation line 
               where the sun throws shadows that look like an old man 
               dancing.

               AT THE PLACE IN THE ROAD

               where West goes to Rapid City, and East back to Bear Creek, 
               Ray stops like the bullet-punched sign orders. He doesn't go 
               West. Doesn't go East. He sits there. Fishes a smoke out 
               from a pocket, clicks a lighter, and fires up. He sits there, 
               smoking.

               Deliberating.

               SUDDEN CUT TO BLACK.

               And after a long silent beat, A DRUM. Like a heart.

               END CREDITS.

                                         THE END

1   EXT. HUNGARY - BUDAPEST - 1973 - DAY                          1

    Budapest skyline, looking towards the Parliament building.
    From here the world looks serene, peaceful. Then, as we
    begin to PULL BACK, we hear a faint whine, increasing in
    volume, until it's the roar of two MiG jet fighters,
    cutting across the skyline. The PULL BACK reveals a YOUNG
    BOY watching the jets, exclaiming excitedly in Hungarian.


2   EXT. BUDAPEST STREET - DAY                                    2

    LATERALLY TRACKING down a bustling street, as the jets
    scream by overhead. Pedestrians look up. All except one man
    who continues walking. This is JIM PRIDEAUX.

    ACROSS THE STREET: More pedestrians. We're not sure who
    we're supposed to be looking at - the short stocky man? The
    girl in the mini skirt? The man in the checked jacket?

    A car driving beside Prideaux accelerates out of the frame.
    Across the street the girl in the mini-skirt peels off into
    a shop. The stocky man turns and waves to us. But it isn't
    Prideaux he's greeting but another passerby, who walks
    over, shakes hands.

    Now we're left with Prideaux and the Magyar in the checked
    shirt, neither paying any attention to each other.

    Just as we are wondering if there is any connection, the
    two reach a corner and the Magyar, pausing to cross the
    road, collides with another passerby. He looks over and
    sees Prideaux has caught the moment of slight clumsiness
    and gives the smallest of rueful smiles. A tiny moment of
    contact between the two. Then both men walk on around the
    corner, just two strangers headed in the same direction...


3   EXT. SUBWAY EXIT - DAY                                        3

    Shooting up the steps of the exit to the imposing GALERIA
    building on the corner ahead. Prideaux and the Magyar walk
    up the steps, still paying no attention to each other, and
    head towards...


4   INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY                                 4

    A formerly grand arcade. Many of the shops are now closed,
    the one's that are open don't have much to sell. A CAFE
    occupies the middle space under the high vaulted ceiling. A
    JAZZ ROCK band rehearses in one of the nearby disused
    shops, incongruous in the window, music muffled by the
    glass. Customers sit around tables playing chess, drinking
    coffee, a mother breast-feeding, the hum of chatter. The
    ordinary world.
                                                               2.



We find Prideaux and the Magyar sitting at one of the
tables.

                    MAGYAR
              (Hungarian, subtitled)
          And porkolts. You know porkolts?

                    JIM PRIDEAUX
              (Hungarian, subtitled)
          Yes, I've had it.

                    MAGYAR
          It's very good. Better than
          goulash. But you won't get it in
          Budapest now.

                    JIM PRIDEAUX
          Why's that?

                    MAGYAR
          All the pigs have gone to Moscow.

He gives a sly laugh. Prideaux smiles, draws   on his
cigarette, nonchalantly examining the people   at the tables
around them. A WAITER arrives, belly bulging   out of his
grubby shirt, hair plastered to his head. He   puts two
wizened-looking sandwiches in front of them.

PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - A DROP OF SWEAT trickles from the
Waiter's face, drips onto the table top.

The Magyar catches Jim looking at the droplet and gives a
wry smile - "nice service." Jim smiles back but a bell has
begun to ring inside him.

                    JIM PRIDEAUX
          When do I get to meet your
          friend?

The Magyar chews on his sandwich, notices Prideaux is
ignoring his.

                    MAGYAR
          I'll take you to him. Not eating?

Prideaux pushes his sandwich across the table, his manner
still easy, but his eyes flick after the Waiter, who stands
at the entrance to the coffee shop, arguing with another
man. He looks around the Galeria again, looking low -
checking the feet of the other customers? Then raising his
gaze, he checks the windows of the apartments above which
look down into the arcade.

PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - An OLD WOMAN stands in the shadows by a
window above. She is watching him. Catching his gaze she
shrinks back into the darkness and disappears.
                                                                3.



Prideaux's expression doesn't change but he sets his coffee
cup down and casually stands. The Magyar looks up in
surprise.

                    JIM PRIDEAUX
          Would you excuse me a moment?

He starts to walk towards the exit of the Galeria. Behind
him his chair teeters for a moment, then slowly falls back
and lands with a CRASH, sending pigeons fluttering up to
the domed ceiling.

The WAITER starts, turns, sees Prideaux leaving. Panic
flashes across his face, he draws a GUN from the back of
his belt, aims after Prideaux and FIRES - the shot echoing
in the cavernous space.

The shot misses, RICOCHETING off the tiled wall and
Prideaux keeps walking, fighting down the impulse to run,
as behind him, out of focus - an image from a surreal
NIGHTMARE: the other CUSTOMERS stop what they are doing,
like actors at the end of a scene, and begin to rise, some
drawing guns. We hear a muffled voice shouting distantly in
Russian.

                       KGB MAN
          No firing!

Ahead of Prideaux   more figures appear, blocking the exit.
He looks over his   shoulder just as another SHOT rings out -
this one catching   him above the shoulder blade and sending
him flying out of   frame.

From around a corner a tall, over-coated man - KGB -
strides towards the scene, still bellowing in Russian.

                    KGB MAN (CONT'D)
          Who told you to fire? Who told
          you to fucking fire?

THE JAZZ BAND have stopped playing and are staring at the
ground, arms at their sides, anxious not to see anything.

In the TOP WINDOW - the OLD WOMAN slips back into sight.

HER P.O.V. - Prideaux lies face down in the arcade below.
As we watch one of his arms slides out, leaving a slick of
blood. Then he's still.

BELOW - The KGB Man has grabbed the Waiter and started to
beat him.

                    KGB MAN (CONT'D)
          Fucking Hungarian amateur! We
          wanted him alive!
                                                                       4.



     Behind him we can see the breast-feeding MOTHER. She's
     dead, a bullet hole in the centre of her forehead from the
     ricochet. The baby continues to suckle on, undisturbed.

     Through the cafe window we can see a MAN, partly obscured
     by the crowd in front of us, the only man still seated. He
     lights a cigarette.

     CLOSE ON THE LIGHTER as he replaces it. We can make out an
     inscription: "To George, from Ann. All my love."

     In the Galeria the KGB Man continues to bellow at the
     Waiter. The baby begins to WAIL.

                                               FADE TO BLACK.

                                                       FADE IN:


4A   EXT. HQ OF BRITISH INTELLIGENCE - "THE CIRCUS" - DAY         4A

     A bird's eye view of the Circus.


4B   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR -   - "MOTHERS" OFFICE - DAY       4B

     A woman, CONNIE SACHS, a face that's seen it all, leans
     against a wall, smoking. A middle-aged woman, one of the
     secretaries or "MOTHERS" walks past, pushing a trolley of
     documents. She nods at Connie mournfully. Connie looks
     stricken. The Mother walks on into...


5    INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                           5

     A long conference table. We are looking at an ELDERLY MAN
     at the head of the table. He's sitting on a rather ornate
     carving chair - a little like a throne - and he looks ill.
     He is signing documents, his signature a simple "C,"
     scrawled in GREEN INK, aware all eyes are on him. A
     cigarette burns away in an already loaded ashtray.

     This is the head of the Circus - known as CONTROL.

     Around him are four lieutenants - the inner circle of the
     intelligence service - PERCY ALLELINE, TOBY ESTERHASE, ROY
     BLAND and BILL HAYDON.

     Beside him, his right-hand man - GEORGE SMILEY.

     From the thick and embarrassed atmosphere we might guess we
     are at the end of a coup, the final ousting of a King. All
     we hear is the ticking of a loud clock and the scratch of
     the pen.

     Smiley looks up to find Alleline's gaze fixed on him.
     Alleline quickly looks down at his hands.
                                                                      5.



    CLOSE ON SMILEY - as he examines the others, gauging the
    SHIFT OF POWER occurring in the room.

    - Bill Haydon - handsome, urbane, frowning with tension,
    pulls on his cigarette.

     - Roy Bland - heavy set and moustached, flicking a guilty
    look up at Smiley and away.

     - Toby Esterhase - immaculate hair and suit, eyes on
    Alleline, watching for a cue, like a dog told to `stay'.

    No-one will look at him.

    ON SMILEY - realising there is no hope.

    Control finishes, puts the pen back in his pocket. He hands
    the file to the MOTHER who, red-eyed, walks with it out of
    the room.

                        PERCY ALLELINE
                  (Scottish accent)
              I wish I could have done more,
              Control.

                        CONTROL
                  (Coolly)
              You did all you could, Percy.
              (Beat) Well, a man should know
              when to leave the party.

    Beat. The clock suddenly gives a discordant chime as it
    sounds the hour. A hint of bitter amusement on Control's
    face, as though he's been waiting for this wrong little
    note to make his move. He grinds his cigarette out.

    Toby can't wait any longer.

                        TOBY ESTERHASE
              What about Smiley?

    Control looks at Smiley. His gaze impersonal...

    ON SMILEY - the faintest flicker in his eyes as he tries to
    prepare himself for the shock of dismissal.

                        CONTROL
              Smiley is leaving with me.


6   OMITTED                                                       6


7   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - DAY                               7

    PUSHING Control and Smiley as they walk down the corridor.
                                                                       6.



     Alleline and the Lieutenants are waiting for them. A
     horribly awkward moment. Toby pulls open the cage lift
     doors for them, as if to hasten the eviction. Haydon looks
     at him with contempt.

                         BILL HAYDON
               You little prick Esterhase.

     Control sweeps past them and the lift, determined to walk
     every step of the way. Smiley follows.


8    INT. CIRCUS - STAIRCASE - DAY                                 8

     Control and Smiley, begin their descent through the rigid
     hierarchy of the Circus. As we TRACK with them, we see that
     each floor is its own WORLD. The two men walk past the
     fourth floor REGISTRY - the vast archive of intelligence,
     staffed by RESEARCHERS.

     Smiley and Control pass down another flight and along the
     third floor - INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS - heads poking out of
     offices, amongst them JERRY WESTERBY.

     Down to the second floor - SCALPHUNTERS - the muscle of the
     Circus. The boredom of an air-port lounge, a sunken sofa
     and pool-table. The Scalphunters watching them go in
     respectful silence.

     On down to the first floor TYPING POOL - staffed by pretty
     young society girls - the DEBS - who watch open-mouthed, as
     their Chief passes them for the last time. And finally
     down to...


9    INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - DAY                        9

     An ancient doorman - BRYANT - feeling the moment must be
     marked in some way - leaves his sentry box and opens the
     main door for Control. Control acknowledges the salute with
     a flick of his eyes and we push through the doors...


10   EXT. CIRCUS - ROOF OF THE CIRCUS - DAY                       10

     Alleline and Bland stand smoking, watching Control and
     Smiley emerge onto the pavement.


11   EXT. CIRCUS - DAY                                            11

     CONTROL and SMILEY stand on the street. They stare at each
     other for a moment. This is goodbye. They shake hands.
     Perhaps there's a little reserve in Control's manner, a
     lack of warmth. From the expression on Smiley's face we see
     that he is pained by this.
                                                                       7.



     Control puts his collar up and walks away. Smiley stands
     forlornly as Control disappears into the crowd.

     TITLES OVER A MONTAGE


12   EXT. HAMPSTEAD POND - AUTUMN DAY                             12

     THE WATER OF THE POND - still, glassy.

     A MAN'S head breaks the surface - Smiley swimming through
     his retirement.

     He takes a breath and submerges again. Beyond him we see a
     straggled diagonal line of elderly heads, bobbing through
     the water.


13   EXT. HAMPSTEAD POND - DAY                                    13

     Smiley dries himself under the trees, pink and raw in the
     cold fresh air. He smooths his hair down, feeling a little
     less ridiculous. He looks over to where a VERY ELDERLY
     SWIMMER is being helped into the water - little more than
     trembling bones.

     Is this his world now?


14   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - DAY                              14

     A MOTHER unloads a stack of files from a LIFT shaft and
     places them into her wheeled safe. A piece of CHRISTMAS
     TINSEL is wound along the trolley. We track with her
     through the HIVE-LIKE atmosphere of the fifth floor, behind
     her the conference room - a glimpse of Alleline in
     Control's chair, surrounded by his lieutenants - smoke and
     whiskey - engaged in the business of the world.

     She pushes on into Alleline's OFFICE - loads the new files
     into the LARGE SAFE there, locks and spins the combination.


15   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - WINTER DAY                             15

     Smiley stands frying an egg in his small kitchen.


16   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    16

     Smiley sits eating his solitary lunch, reading a volume of
     Grimmelshausen. He turns a page, examines the illustration
     of a knight and a dragon - holds it at arms length, trying
     to focus on it.
                                                                        8.



16A   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                      16A

      Smiley lies in the double bed, a conspicuous empty space next
      to him. He leans over and turns the light out.


17    INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - ALLELINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT        17

      A HAND removes files from the LARGE SAFE.

      ON A BRIEFCASE - as the files - marked TOP SECRET - are
      slipped inside.


18    INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - EVENING                          18

      P.O.V. MYSTERY MAN

      ... TRACKING through the near-empty offices. All the
      drawers of the desks are OPEN. BINS on the tables. A few
      mothers working late, illuminated by their desk lamps. One
      of them is applying lipstick, prior to leaving. She doesn't
      react as we track by.


19    EXT. OPTICIANS - SPRING DAY                                  19

      We are looking at large blurred LETTERS. A lens is slotted
      into our frame and the letters leap into BOLD.

      Smiley is in a chair, being fitted for spectacles.


20    INT. OPTICIANS - DAY                                         20

      Smiley is selecting frames from a display. He tries on a
      pair, watched by a bored shop assistant, used to the
      pedantic ways of the retired.


21    INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - EVENING                   21

      TRACKING with the BRIEFCASE as the mystery man walks
      towards the main entrance. The ELDERLY PORTER- BRYANT -
      nods respectfully.


22    INT. LONDON UNDERGROUND - EVENING                            22

      A packed train - Businessmen in bowler hats, long-haired
      seventies youth - the old and the new bumping underneath
      the city. We track low level until we find our MYSTERY MAN,
      the BRIEFCASE clutched in his hand.
                                                                      9.



23   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - EVENING                                   23

     Tracking with the BRIEFCASE as it is carried towards the
     house...


24   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                      24

     An elderly lady - MRS McCRAIG - stands at the sink. Through
     the window she catches a glimpse of the Mystery Man's legs
     passing, the briefcase in his hand as he walks up the steps
     towards the front door. Calmly she dries her hands as the
     doorbell rings and her DOG begins to bark furiously.


25   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                      25

     Mrs McCraig opens the door and the figure passes her and
     the barking dog without a word and begins to walk up the
     stairs...


26   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                    26

     Smiley adds a LETTER to a pile on the mantelpiece. We see
     the letters are all addressed to ANN SMILEY.

     He straightens up, finds himself staring at a PAINTING on
     the wall - a muddy abstract.


27   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                      27

     The room is almost bare - two chairs at a small table on
     which stands two desk lamps and a CAMERA. The Mystery Man
     has crossed to the wall by the window and opens the GRILL
     on an AIR DUCT.


28   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT                                     28

     From across the street a tall good-looking man - POLYAKOV -
     watches as the opened duct spills a star pattern of light
     out into the night air. He walks towards the house...


29   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                      29

     The Mystery man settles at the table, sorting through the
     contents of the briefcase as, from down below, we hear the
     sound of the door bell, the dog barking and footsteps on
     the stairs. Polyakov walks into the room and joins the
     Mystery Man at the small table. He picks up the camera with
     a smile.

                         POLYAKOV
                   (In Russian)
               Shall we begin?

      END OF TITLES


30    EXT. LACON'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING                           30

      Lights glowing in the early morning gloom, an ultra-modern
      cube of a building sits in rather traditional grounds. This
      is the unlikely home of Oliver Lacon, Permanent under-
      secretary.


30A   INT./EXT. LACON'S HOUSE - MORNING                           30A

      As we watch a young girl - JACKIE LACON - appears at the
      living room window in her night-dress, playing with a toy. As
      we watch her we hear stealthy footsteps approach. Then a MAN
      steps into frame, his back to us, watching the girl through
      the window. He taps on the glass with one hand. Jackie looks
      up, surprised.

      As we pull back a little we see the man has his other hand
      behind his back.

      And in it is a long, bone-handled KNIFE.

      Behind Jackie we see a string bean of a man, OLIVER LACON,
      tying his silk dressing gown as he cautiously approaches the
      window. On the other side, the intruder stands, smoking.

                              LACON
                        (through glass)
                   This is private property. Who are
                   you?

      He takes in the man before him - filthy and bearded, you
      could mistake him for a tramp. But beneath the grime he's
      tanned and his eyes have a dangerous, feral edge. This is
      RICKI TARR.

                             RICKI TARR
                   Minister Lacon.

      He smiles.

                             LACON
                   What do you want?

                             RICKI TARR
                   I want to talk to Control. And I
                   want breakfast.

33    INT. CIRCUS - SCALPHUNTERS - DAY                             33

      PETER GUILLAM walks down a corridor. Handsome, boyish,
      bored. He hears a TRING behind him. It's Haydon, one foot
      up on his pedal, scootering along the corridor. Guillam
      waits for him. He likes this man.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                    (of the bike)
                Has that been cleared?

                          BILL HAYDON
                I'm not bloody chaining it
                outside. Mind you, probably no
                safer in here, with you bunch of
                cut-throats.

      They arrive at a half-paned office cubicle. Inside is a
      very pretty GIRL, a new DEB, being shown the ropes by an
      older woman.

                          HAYDON
                Thought I'd get a glimpse of the
                new girl. Before Bland gets to
                her. He seen her yet?

                          GUILLAM
                Oh yes. Down first thing.


      GIRL'S P.O.V. -

      ... as Haydon and Guillam pass, staring in at her, cropped
      above the waist. Haydon appears to be gliding
      supernaturally by. He gives a little wave.


      BACK ON HAYDON:

                          HAYDON
                You may fuck me, Belinda, but you
                still have to call me sir in the
                morning.

      Guillam grins. Haydon glides off, hand raised in farewell
      as Guillam turns into the Scalphunters arena.
                                                                        12.



34    INT. CIRCUS - SCALPHUNTERS - GUILLAM'S OFFICE - DAY          34

      Guillam sits at his desk over a pile of paper-work, slowly
      falling asleep.

      BANG! A pool ball thwacks the window, cracking it. At the
      same moment the PHONE begins to ring. Guillam jerks
      upright, looks over at the pool players, too bored to be
      angry.

                          POOL PLAYER (O.S.)
                Sorry Peter.

      Guillam answers the phone.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Peter Guillam...

      He listens to the voice on the other end. After a moment he
      turns away from his colleagues, his former drowsiness
      abruptly gone.


35    EXT. LONDON STREET - EVENING                                 35

      Smiley in his NEW GLASSES, towel rolled under his arm,
      walking down the street. He stops for a moment, feeling
      himself watched.


36    EXT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING                                36

      Smiley on the steps to his home, stops, examines the door,
      removing a WEDGE from the top of the door frame.


37    INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING                                37

      Smiley walks into the hallway, stopping to pick up post.


38    INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING                                38

      Smiley places the wedge and the letters on the mantelpiece,
      where a BUNDLE of LETTERS already sits, addressed to ANN
      SMILEY. Unopened.


38A   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING                     38A

      Smiley frying an egg.

      There's a knock at the door.


38B   INT./EXT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING                          38B

      Smiley opens the door to PETER GUILLAM.
                                                                        13.



                          SMILEY
                    (Surprised)
                Hello, Peter.

      They stare at each other. Smiley takes in his expression -
      this is not a social call.

                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
                Have I time to change?

      Guillam nods, following Smiley into the house. He glances at
      a painting on the wall - a muddy ABSTRACT. He crosses to
      examine it and then notices the bundle of Ann's unopened
      letters.


39    INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING                                39

      Guillam enters the kitchen, notes the single place set for
      dinner. It dawns on him that he really has invaded Smiley's
      privacy.

      Smiley appears in a coat behind him, taking in Guillam's
      awkwardness. He gives a thin smile.

                          SMILEY
                Are we going far?


39A   INT. GUILLAM'S CAR - EVENING                               39A

      Smiley and Guillam sit in silence, as Guillam drives through
      London. It's a Citroen DS, all sleek leather and mahogany
      interior.

40A   INT. LACON'S HOUSE - EVENING                               40A


      CLOSE UP ON:

      A half eaten bacon SANDWICH, sitting on a table.

      We pan up and through the open window see an anxious Lacon is
      leading Guillam towards the house. Smiley follows, talking to
      Lacon's daughter.

                          LACON
                How's your mother?

                           PETER GUILLAM
                Very well.
                    (referring to the window)
                Is this where he got out?
                                                                     14.



                          LACON
               Mmm, I came back in and it was wide
               open.
                   (beat)
               Do send her my love. Apologies for
               singling you out, but... very
               sensitive matter...

     He gives an uncomfortable bark of laughter.

                         LACON (CONT'D)
               If one can't trust one's own
               nephew... You know who he was?

                         PETER GUILLAM
               Ricki Tarr, sir. One of my scalp-
               hunters. He's been on the wanted
               list for a year. Last job was
               Istanbul, bit of coat-trailing for
               a Russian convention.

                         LACON
               Why is he on the wanted list?

                          PETER GUILLAM
                   (beat)
               He killed our man in Istanbul. Cut
               his throat. Been on the run since
               then.

     If possible, Lacon looks even more shaken.

                         LACON
               My God. In my own home... my
               family... The bloody animals you
               people employ!


41   INT. LACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                 41

     PULLING OLIVER LACON as he leads Smiley and Guillam down
     the hall, gesturing for his WIFE to take Jackie away. He
     attempts some social niceties, but his tone is strained.

                         LACON
               And how are you George? Missing
               one's work, one's buddies?

                          SMILEY
               Oh, I think I manage pretty well,
               thank you.

     They reach a large room, minimalist apart from a grand piano
     framed by vast glass windows. A tall, well built young man -
     FAWN - stands on guard. Lacon gestures to him and Fawn opens
     the french windows and he and Guillam walk out onto the
     terrace beyond.
                                                                       15.



     Behind them, unnoticed, young JACKIE creeps back into the
     room and slips behind the sofa.

                         LACON
               Your wife, the lovely Ann? She's in
               the pink, and so on.

                         SMILEY
               Very well. (Beat) Very bonny...

     Fawn closes the french doors behind him and Lacon is suddenly
     all business.

                         LACON
               Do you know this man Tarr?

                         SMILEY
                   (Mildly)
               I recruited him actually. In
               Penang. Good with women. Likes to
               talk. What did he say to you?

                         LACON
               He said he had some intelligence
               for Control. Had no idea he was
               dead. The news obviously hadn't
               reached Wonga Wonga land. Then he
               said he would only tell it to
               someone outside the Circus. If he
               couldn't have a Minister, he would
               settle for the Under-secretary.
               Lucky me.

     Lacon lights a cigarette, smokes a moment, building up to
     something. Smiley waits him out. The room has become very
     still.

                         LACON (CONT'D)
               He said there's a mole. Right at
               the top of the Circus. And that
               he's been there for years.

     Smiley absorbs this. The moment is suddenly broken by a few
     stray notes from the piano. The two jump slightly and turn to
     where Jackie sits at the keyboard, smiling triumphantly.

43   EXT. LACON'S HOUSE - TERRACE - NIGHT                         43

     Smiley and Lacon stand on the terrace alone. Lacon glances
     anxiously at Smiley, trying to read him.

                         LACON
               I was sad to see you go, George. I
               thought it was shabby, very shabby.
                         (MORE)
                                                               16.

                    LACON (CONT'D)
          But the Minister agreed with Sir
          Percy. New broom, clean sweep,
          wheat from the chaff and all that.
          And to be fair, Percy has had some
          marvellous results since you and
          Control left...

Realizing how this sounds, he glances at Smiley to see how
much damage he's caused.

                    LACON (CONT'D)
          Anyway, it does mean you're rather
          ideally placed to look into this
          matter for us now, doesn't it?
          Outside the family?

Smiley looks blandly back at him.

                    SMILEY
          I am retired, Oliver.

Silence. Lacon looks uncomfortable, something he hasn't yet
said.

                    LACON
          Thing is, some time back, when
          Control was still alive, he came to
          me with a similar suggestion.

Smiley looks at him, surprised.

                    LACON (CONT'D)
          He never mentioned his suspicions
          to you?

                    SMILEY
          No.

                    LACON
          I just thought... with you being
          "his man", so to speak.

                    SMILEY
          What did you say to him?

                     LACON
              (Beat)
          I'm afraid I thought his paranoia
          had got the better of him and he
          was pulling his own house down.
          That does happen in your business.
          And that bloody mess in Budapest...

Smiley stares out over the rolling countryside, inscrutable.

                    LACON (CONT'D)
          Damn it, George, this is your
          generation, your legacy!
                    (MORE)

                         LACON (CONT'D)
               If there's any truth in this you'd
               think you'd want to...

     He controls himself.

                          SMILEY
                   (Beat)
               I'll keep Peter Guillam. And
               there's a retired special branch
               man. Mendel. I'd like to have him.

     Lacon exhales, his relief palpable.

                         LACON
               Yes, yes. Do your own housekeeping.
               Good man.

     He glances back at Guillam and Lacon's daughter, picking out
     a melody on the grand piano.

                         LACON (CONT'D)
               Damn thing cost a fortune. Three
               years of lessons and all I hear is
               Edelweiss. You and Ann never had
               children, did you?

                         SMILEY
               No, we never did.

     We hear the piano playing on as we...

     GLOVED HANDS loading a COLONY OF BEES into a new HIVE.

     An APIARIST, in protective hat and gloves, turns to examine
     the MAN who has appeared in his back yard - GEORGE SMILEY.
     Smiley raises a hand.

     The Apiarist steps away from the hive and removes his hat
     to reveal a long thin face, keen eyes - INSPECTOR MENDEL.


46   EXT. MENDEL'S HOUSE - DAY                                    46

     Mendel, now in an overcoat and carrying a battered
     briefcase, climbs into the back of the car with a nod to
     Smiley and Guillam in the front. He begins to roll a
     cigarette as Guillam drives away.
                                                                       18.



     A stow-away BEE appears from somewhere and begins to buzz
     around the car. Guillam and Mendel swat at it clumsily.
     Smiley stares ahead in silence. He winds down the window
     and the bee flies to safety.


47   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - DAY                                       47

     A shabby rooming house, near Paddington station.


48   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - DAY                       48

     A large, faded floral monstrosity of a room. TWO single
     beds, a large leather CHAIR, a WIRELESS.

     Smiley's new landlady MRS POPE GRAHAM is supervising a
     gormless teenager - NORMAN - who is struggling into the
     room with a rickety card table. Mendel and Guillam take it
     from him and set it into the room. From the next room comes
     the unmistakable sounds of someone having sex.

                         MRS POPE GRAHAM
                   (re the table)
               It's Georgian, I shouldn't lend
               it to you but since Mister Mendel
               recommends you...

     She gives the table a sentimental tap, raising her voice a
     little to drown out the excesses from the room next door.

                         MRS POPE GRAHAM (CONT'D)
               You will love it for me won't
               you? It belonged to Mister Pope-
               Graham.

     She glances at Smiley who has his back to her looking out
     into the London street.


     SMILEY'S P.O.V.

     ... looking out at rooftops opposite and a travel agents
     sign which reads THE WIDE WORLD.

                         MENDEL (O.S.)
               My friend just wants peace and
               quiet in order to work, Mrs Pope-
               Graham, no disturbances.

                         MRS POPE GRAHAM
               And that's what he shall have.
               You want anything you can ask
               Norman, can't he, Norman?

     And they leave. A small silence...
                                                              19.



                    MENDEL
          Her real name is plain Graham.
          Added the Pope for a touch of
          class.

Guillam gives a grunt of amusement.

                    MENDEL (CONT'D)
          Best informant I ever had.

LATER:

Smiley has turned his attention to the bed. He examines the
stained sheets with distaste. As he speaks he strips off
the soiled sheet and replaces it with a clean one from his
bag.

                     SMILEY
          Control lived with his sister
          didn't he?

He straightens up from the bed, smooths the pristine sheet.

Mendel flips his notebook back. He's already there.

                    MENDEL
          Basingstoke. Not much of a paper-
          trail as you can imagine. His
          pension and she owns a block of
          bedsits in her own name in West
          London.

                    GUILLAM
          We should...

Mendel flicks another page.

                    MENDEL
          ... Webb and Bryson are the
          letting agents. Properties in
          half of the west end judging by
          this list...

LATER:

Guillam is lying on the bed. Smiley stands at the window,
Mendel slumped in an armchair.

                    SMILEY
          We're only looking for short term
          rentals. Within the last year.

                    MENDEL
              (Reading from the list)
          A Miss Hilliard. L. Cavaleri?
          D Weaver, M Crowley, M Cushing. F.
          Farling. G. Hiaasen.
                    (MORE)
                                                                      20.

                         MENDEL (CONT'D)
               A Mrs Hawcombe. R. Kee. M. Kass. H
               Staunton...

     CLOSE on Smiley as his eyes flickers at the name.

                         MENDEL (CONT'D)
               K. Menzies...

                         SMILEY
               How long was H. Staunton a tenant?

                         MENDEL
                   (Consulting the list)
               Still is. Been renting for a few
               years now. Something?

                         SMILEY
                   (Musing)
               Howard Staunton. Control used to
               say he was England's greatest chess
               master. Died in eighteen seventy-
               four.


49   EXT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY                                   49

     Guillam and Smiley approach outside a red-brick mansion
     block of flats in West London.


50   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - HALLWAY - DAY                         50

     Smiley and Guillam reach a flat near the shadowy top of the
     building. Smiley studies the door. He runs his fingers over
     the door-frame and there it is - a little WEDGE at the top.


51   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY                                   51

     Guillam, followed by Smiley, pushes in against a mound of
     dead mail.

     They advance cautiously into the dirty flat, the windows
     fogged out with Windowlene.


     THEIR P.O.V. - TRACKING TOWARDS THE DOOR

     Guillam has reached the DOOR and disappears into the room
     beyond...


52   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY                                   52

     A green velvet armchair sits at the centre of a room.
     Beside it an ashtray over-loaded with stubs.
                                                                       21.



     The rest of the room is mounded with PILES AND PILES OF
     PAPERS - files, document boxes, maps and charts, something
     insane in the sprawl of it all.

     Guillam stands with his back to us staring at a CHESS SET
     laid out before the chair, as if in mid-game. Four of the
     chess pieces have had PHOTOGRAPHS of FACES added to them -
     ROY BLAND. TOBY ESTERHASE. PERCY ALLELINE. BILL HAYDON -
     all wearing paper PARTY HATS. The effect is ridiculous and
     a little disturbing, like some Surrealist objet d'art.

     Guillam hears Smiley and turns, almost guiltily, and as he
     moves we see there is a FIFTH PHOTOGRAPH on a piece - and
     it is of Smiley himself.

     Smiley stares at his image.


53   INT. CIRCUS - TOBY ESTERHASE'S OFFICE - DAY                  53

     Toby Esterhase is on the telephone, speaking softly in
     Hungarian. A look crosses his face. He suddenly notices
     Haydon in the doorway, cup of tea in hand. Esterhase asks the
     caller to hold and places the handset on the desk.

                         TOBY ESTERHASE
               Help you with something Bill?

                         BILL HAYDON
               Looking for his Majesty.

                         TOBY ESTERHASE
                   (sullenly)
               He's walking the battlements.

     Toby's eyes flicker toward the handset.

                         BILL HAYDON
                   (in Hungarian, subtitled)
               Much obliged.

     Bill leaves, and Toby resumes the call.


54   EXT. ROOF OF THE CIRCUS - DAY                                54

     Alleline stands on the rooftop, staring out over the London
     skyline, his expression ambiguous - perhaps obscurely
     troubled to have found himself at the top. He becomes aware
     of Roy Bland standing behind him.

                            ALLELINE
                      (Without turning)
               Roy.

                         BLAND
               It's the Yanks. They want to come
               in and talk.
                                                                       22.



     Alleline continues to stare out over the world, but allows
     himself a small smile of triumph - and relief.

                         ALLELINE
               Of course they do. We have
               Witchcraft. And they don't.


55   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - DAY                       55

     Mendel and Guillam carry in boxes, each overflowing with
     files and bundles of yellowing papers.

                         SMILEY
               Thank you. Anywhere will do.

     They dump the files and Smiley turns to survey his room. In
     his hand he is toying with a black chess piece labelled
     "KARLA".

     The far wall is now stacked to the ceiling with the
     contents of Control's room - thousands of files and
     documents, piled in no logical order. The three survey the
     mountain of information in silence.

                         MENDEL
                   (Wryly)
               That enough for you to be getting
               on with?

                          SMILEY
                   (Beat)
               No. Peter, I need you to do
               something for me...


56   INT. CIRCUS - SCALPHUNTERS - DAY                             56

     The "Scalphunters" floor. Guillam is in his office, painted
     out panels below the waist, glass above. He sits, hands on
     the desk, steeling himself for what he has to do.

     Abruptly he stands and walks out.

     We TRACK with him as he walks through the Scalphunters
     "quad" area - a worn out sofa, the old pool table.

     One of the Scalphunters - KASPAR - stands flirting with a
     pretty SECRETARY - BELINDA - the "Deb" we saw earlier.
     Guillam acknowledges them casually as he passes. The girl
     gives a little wave. She LIKES him.

     Kaspar stares after Guillam. He doesn't.

     We continue tracking with Guillam as he leaves the
     Scalphunters area, walks down the corridor, turns left
     into...
                                                                       23.



57   INT. CIRCUS - MEN'S ROOM - DAY                               57

     He stands at the basins, checking the room is clear.
     Examines his watch, then crosses to the door and opens it a
     crack, peering out.

     GUILLAM'S P.O.V.

     We're looking though a glass panelled door at the PERSONNEL
     OFFICE. A dapper little man in a club tie - FAWLEY - sits
     behind his desk, idly tapping a desk toy - a Newton's
     Cradle. He too checks his watch. Lunch time. Gets up and
     walks out of his office.

     Guillam counts to ten under his breath and then abruptly,
     walks out of the men's room, across the corridor and
     into...


58   INT. CIRCUS - FAWLEY'S OFFICE - DAY                          58

     The Cradle is still swinging - steel balls clacking softly.
     Guillam is opening a safe, pulling out documents,
     photographing them with a SUBMINIATURE CAMERA.

     Close on the documents as Guillam silently photographs
     them.

                         SMILEY (V.O.)
               I want to see the records of
               staff recently retired. While
               you're there get the handbook on
               staff duties... and the diagram
               of the Circus's reorganization
               under Alleline...

     Guillam hears a voice outside. He draws a SMALL KNIFE from
     his pocket.


59   INT. CIRCUS - FAWLEY'S OFFICE - DAY                          59

     Kaspar opens the door and walks in, finding... the office
     empty.

     Then a faint noise. He works his way around the desk, finds
     Guillam crouched down, his back to him.

                         KASPAR
                   (Suspicious)
               Sorry Peter, didn't know you were
               doing... whatever you were
               doing...?

     Guillam straightens up to reveal his hand oozing blood from
     a cut.
                                                                      24.



                         PETER GUILLAM
               Trying not to bleed to death.
               Fawley's got a first aid kit in
               one of his drawers. Get me a
               plaster will you?

     Kaspar busies himself with the first-aid. Eyes hard.


60   INT. CIRCUS - LIFTS - DAY                                   60

     Guillam has just stepped into the lift. Roy Bland appears
     suddenly and steps in beside him.

     Silence for a moment as they descend...

                         ROY BLAND
                   (without looking at him)
               Heard you had an accident.

     Guillam makes a mental note against Kaspar.

                         PETER GUILLAM
               Cut it on a drawer handle.
               (Beat) When are we going to get
               some new furniture round here?

                         ROY BLAND
               I'll have a word with Esterhase,
               Peter. We'll make it a priority
               on the top floor.

     They arrive on the ground floor. Bland walks out ahead.
     Guillam exhales with relief. Then...

                         ROY BLAND (CONT'D)
                   (as he walks away)
               Where are you off to?

                         PETER GUILLAM
               Lunch.

                         ROY BLAND
               Want some company?


61   INT. PUB - DAY                                              61

     The two men sit drinking at a table in a nearly deserted
     local bar.

                         ROY BLAND
               Tell you the truth, I'm in no
               hurry to get back up there...

                         PETER GUILLAM
               Smothered by the Mothers.
                                                              25.



                    ROY BLAND
          Something like that. Those old
          birds, all pining for Control.
          Percy still can't get a decent
          cup of tea out of them. Still, I
          imagine it takes time.

                       PETER GUILLAM
          What does?

                       ROY BLAND
          Loyalty.

He takes a pull of his pint.

                    ROY BLAND (CONT'D)
          If it was up to me, I'd replace
          them all with those `naice' girls
          from registry. Like to hear a few
          high heels about the place.

He reaches suddenly for Guillam's coat, lying on the seat -
his hand heading for the pocket that holds the SUBMINIATURE
CAMERA.

                    ROY BLAND (CONT'D)
          Scrounge a fag?

                    PETER GUILLAM
              (Quickly)
          Here.

He pushes his cigarettes into Bland's hand before he can
fish in the coat. Bland smokes for a moment.

                    ROY BLAND
              (Suddenly)
          What do you think of Datsuns?

                       PETER GUILLAM
          What?

                    ROY BLAND
          Datsuns. Just got one. Wife made
          me. Hatchback. Caught sight of
          myself in it, driving past a shop
          window and I thought to myself
          "Who's that old fucker?"

He stares at Guillam with faint smile, but his eyes are
cold and watchful.

                    ROY BLAND (CONT'D)
          What are you driving?

                       PETER GUILLAM
          Citroen.
                                                                        26.



                          ROY BLAND
                French? Ooh la la...

      He continues to stare at Guillam with the faint smile, and
      Guillam feels a sickening wave of paranoia.

                           ROY BLAND (CONT'D)
                Drink up and I'll drop you back.
                You've probably got some girl
                waiting...


62    INT. GUILLAM'S FLAT - NIGHT                                  62

      Guillam sits alone at the table reading a newspaper. After
      a moment, a man, his lover - RICHARD - a decade or so
      older - walks behind him, stroking his hair tenderly, and
      joins him at the table. Guillam automatically checks the
      window - the flat opposite, a lit window - could someone
      see them? He gets up and closes the curtains, settles back
      at the table, passing Richard a section of the paper. The
      two sit in domestic contentment, reading.


62A   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - NIGHT                                    62A

      SMILEY'S P.O.V. - LOOKING DOWN FROM A WINDOW

      A ministerial car pulls up and Lacon climbs out.


63    INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - NIGHT                     63

      The music - a CHARLIE RICH track - plays on a TRANSISTOR
      RADIO. Smiley sits at the window listening to the MUSIC.

      Guillam dictates from a photograph of the documents he took
      at the circus.

      Smiley becomes aware that the others are watching him. He
      turns away, tunes the radio into a DIFFERENT STATION,
      cutting the Charlie Rich tune.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Jerry Westerby, dismissed
                December 4th. And... Connie
                Sachs, retired November 28th.
                That's just two weeks after you
                and Control were forced out.

      Smiley considers this, turns back to the CHESS SET. He
      writes Connie's name on a slip of paper, pastes it to a
      chess piece.

      There is a knock at the door. Mendel lets LACON into the
      room excluding a very excited MRS. POPE GRAHAM. Lacon's
      wearing a tux, looking extremely uncomfortable, almost
      offended at the role he finds himself playing.
                                                             27.



                    SMILEY
          I know that car.

                    LACON
          On our way to La Bohème. The
          Minister wondered if there was
          anything to report?

                    SMILEY
          Not much, I'm afraid. We were
          just discussing the departure of
          Connie Sachs. I wonder how
          Research manages without her.

                    PETER GUILLAM
          Probably relieved. She always
          struck me as unhinged.

                    SMILEY
          That was one of her talents.

LACON looks around him, dripping disdain.

                    LACON
              (Indicating the chess
               set)
          Looking a little unhinged
          yourself, George.

                       SMILEY
                 (Distracted)
          Hmm?

He turns to him.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          Yes, I suppose I am. Perhaps
          that's what we have to become? A
          little paranoid?

He turns back to the chess board.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
              (To Lacon)
          Your "clean sweep."
          What if the Mole was actually
          behind that sweep? What if each
          of us, whether we knew it or not,
          represented a threat to the Mole?

Lacon looks at a pile of files, distractedly picks one up.
He starts to leaf through one...

                    LACON
              (Unconvinced)
          Control lost his position because
          of that fiasco in Budapest...
          that poor chap...?
                                                                        28.



      He looks to Guillam for the name.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Jim Prideaux.

      Smiley nods thoughtfully.

                          SMILEY
                Yes. Yes, he did.

      He writes PRIDEAUX on a slip of paper, pastes it to a chess
      piece. Lacon picks up another file, Something catches his
      eye: a letter head of FLAMES. He looks up shocked.

                          LACON
                How did you get this? This is
                Witchcraft material.

      He grabs the piece of paper, stuffing it in his pocket.

      Smiley looks at him. Lacon reads something implacable in
      Smiley's gaze...

      Smiley turns back to the chess set.

                          SMILEY
                Control was out. And Alleline was
                in. Thanks to...

      He writes the name "WITCHCRAFT" and places it on a chess
      piece.


63A   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - NIGHT                                    63A

      Lacon stalks out of the hotel.

                          SMILEY (V.O.)
                ... Alleline's "special source."

                          LACON (V.O.)
                There is no connection.

      He climbs into the waiting car. We catch a glimpse of the
      MINISTER in the back.

                          SMILEY (V.O.)
                Everything is connected.

      The car drives away.


64    INT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                      64

      A third-rate English preparatory school. The string
      orchestra practice - rows of twelve-year old boys sawing
      away at their instruments. A teacher winces as he hacks at
      the air above their heads with a ruler.
                                                                       29.



     Near the back of the class we find BILL ROACH. He's plump,
     asthmatic, the last to be chosen for everything. He looks
     out of the window.


65   EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - DAY                                  65

     Roach stares out at us as the rain lashes against the
     window pane. As we watch an old blue Alvis, towing a
     battered, second hand CARAVAN, appears - reflected in the
     window - driving past.

     Roach watches, thrilled to realise he is the sole witness
     of this MYSTERIOUS NEW ARRIVAL.


66   EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY             66

     We're looking down into the dip, at the DRIVER of the blue
     Alvis, setting up his caravan on bricks, in the gloom and
     rain. He's wearing a waterproof cape and hood, obscuring
     his face, giving him something of an air of mystery and
     menace. There's something odd about the way he moves,
     something about his back, as if it's been knocked out of
     true...

     The Driver rocks the caravan from side to side, loading
     bricks underneath, trying to get the thing level.

     He senses something and turns to find Roach behind him.
     Roach instinctively takes a step back from the hooded
     figure. Then, gathering his courage, he holds out his hand.

     In his palm, a MARBLE.

     LATER:

     Roach stands in the caravan, watching the MARBLE as it
     rolls backwards and forwards on the windowsill - an
     improvised spirit level. THE MARBLE comes to rest at the
     centre of the sill, a temporary equilibrium.

     Roach turns excitedly to the camera, about to call to the
     Driver, but sees something that stops him in his tracks...

     The Driver has stopped, his back to us, breathing hard,
     perhaps from the exercise or perhaps fighting down some
     pain. The wind catches at his cape and it flutters to one
     side, revealing the sweat-soaked shirt beneath. As we watch
     a DARK STAIN appears at his shoulder blade and begins to
     spread. It's BLOOD.


67   EXT. LONDON - OFF LICENSE - DAY                              67

     Through the window we see Smiley buying a bottle.
                                                                      30.



68   INT. LONDON - PADDINGTON TRAIN STATION - DAY                68

     Smiley stands at a ticket kiosk.

                         SMILEY
               Return to Oxford please.


69   EXT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DAY                                   69

     A large dilapidated Victorian house. We hear the faint
     sound of voices and pop music coming from the garden.

     Smiley pushes open the gate, walks down the path, past over-
     grown shrubbery until he reaches the door with a bell marked
     "SACHS."

     Glancing sideways he is caught, entranced, by the sight of a
     young couple kissing in the window. They turn, suddenly aware
     of his presence and Smiley, embarrassed, continues walking
     round the house.


     SMILEY'S P.O.V.

     A group of students in togas are rehearsing a musical version
     of Lysistrata. A young woman, holding her script, is miming
     to the song `Don't' by Doris.

     An older woman wearing rather too much make-up is carrying a
     prop. This is CONNIE SACHS - former Queen of Intelligence at
     the Circus. She examines Smiley for a moment, and then breaks
     into a charming smile.


     ON SMILEY'S EXPRESSION

     This is not a social call. Connie can't keep the
     disappointment from her face.


70   INT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                    70

     Smiley sits in the cluttered drawing room, a plate of scones
     in front of him. Connie appears carrying a tray of tea.

                         SMILEY
                   (Of the tea)
               Oh, I brought...

     He takes the bottle of Scotch from his briefcase.

                         CONNIE SACHS
                   (eyeing it hungrily)
               Not supposed to. Doctor's orders.

     Smiley feigns surprise. Connie gives a little girl laugh.
                                                                       31.



                         CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)
               Wicked, wicked George.

     She takes the teacup he pours with crooked arthritic
     fingers and drinks. They sit, both staring at the students
     in the garden, caught up in memories of their youth.

                         CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)
               I miss it all so much. All my
               lovely boys.

     Smiley hesitates.

                         CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)
               I don't know about you, George
               but I feel seriously under-
               fucked.

     They look at each other a moment. Connie's smile fades.
     She looks at him almost sorrowfully.

                         CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)
               She doesn't deserve you, George.
               Not one hair on your head, never
               did...


71   INT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    71

     Smiley and Connie sit in a dirty, disordered room, Connie
     on her way to being drunk. As she finishes her glass Smiley
     fills it.

                         SMILEY
               You left the Circus shortly after
               I retired...

                         CONNIE SACHS
               I didn't leave. I was dismissed.
               Chucked out on the rubbish heap.
               (Beat) Like you.

                            SMILEY
                      (Ignoring this)
               Why?

     She shrugs, petulant, takes a drink.

                         CONNIE SACHS
               "Lost my sense of proportion."
               That's what that personnel cow
               said. Wouldn't let go of a bone.

                         SMILEY
               Which bone?

                            CONNIE SACHS
               Polyakov.
                                                                     32.



     Smiley nods, a look of boredom settling on his face - A
     SURE SIGN OF INTEREST.

                            SMILEY
               Polyakov.

                         CONNIE SACHS
               Cultural Attaché Polyakov.

                         SMILEY
               Stationed where?

                         CONNIE SACHS
               Here. London. Turned up in sixty
               five. And I had a feeling, as
               soon as I laid eyes on him. But
               that little swine Toby Esterhase
               told me I was seeing Spies under
               the bed.

                         SMILEY
               Esterhase said that?

                         CONNIE SACHS
               He had him graded Persil. Whiter
               than white. And that was that.

                         SMILEY
               But you disagreed?

                         CONNIE SACHS
               Pretty Polly? Very military
               bearing for someone who's never
               supposed to have been in the
               army. But, he was good. Went to
               Embassy functions, lectures. I
               love a man who lives his cover.
               Never put a foot wrong.

                            SMILEY
                   (Beat)
               Never?

     She can't help but smile.

                         CONNIE SACHS
                   (As if summoning him)
               Pretty Polly. Pretty Polly...


72   INT. CIRCUS - RESEARCH - EVENING - PAST                    72

     Connie is working late. She sits in front of a Steenbeck
     flatbed editing table, she's chain-smoking, unkempt, but
     completely focused on the moving images on the screen.
                                                                33.



                    CONNIE SACHS (V.O.)
          ... the busiest culture vulture
          that Embassy ever had.

On the walls around her are framed STILLS from the footage
she is watching: Russian Officials at ceremonies - each
picture gridded, each official labelled as Connie manages to
identify them.

                    CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)
          For years we'd been hearing rumours
          that Karla was building a private
          army of his own, outside Moscow
          Centre. We knew he had agents
          scattered round the globe. I
          started spending time with the
          Moscow gazers combing Soviet
          bulletins and any material I could
          get.

ON SCREEN - Ancient SOVIET VETERANS stand in rows displaying
the medals on their chests.

                    CONNIE SACHS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Late one night in Research, I was
          trawling through some footage of
          May Day in Berlin, 1969. I saw
          something, George.

Connie slows the images down, concentrating... OFFICIALS in
suits are walking into their designated places. We see
POLYAKOV amongst them.

One of the old SOVIET VETERANS, in dress uniform, a chest
full of medals, possibly a touch senile, LOOKS at him. Just
before he is obscured by another official we see what the old
veteran does.

He salutes Polyakov.

Connie's smile of triumph is reflected on the screen. She
lights a cigarette.

                    CONNIE SACHS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          I saw it, George.

Connie rewinds the tape and we see the salute - backwards.
And again - forwards.

                    CONNIE SACHS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Why would a distinguished soldier,
          four medals for gallantry, salute
          our cultural attache Polly? Unless
          Polly was a war veteran himself?
          And if he was, why hide the fact?

FROM DOORWAY - Connie sits smoking her celebratory cigarette,
at the centre of her obsession.
                                                                        34.



72A   INT. CIRCUS - RESEARCH - EVENING                            72A

      Connie is showing the footage to Alleline and Esterhase.

                          SMILEY (V.O.)
                What did you do?

                          CONNIE SACHS (V.O.)
                I went straight to Esterhase and
                Alleline. I said - "Polyakov is a
                Karla-trained Hood if ever I saw
                one. And if he's here it's because
                he's running a mole."

                          SMILEY (V.O.)
                What did they say?

      Alleline switches off the image.

                           PERCY ALLELINE
                    (Hard)
                You're to leave Polyakov alone.
                You're becoming obsessed with him.

      He glances at Esterhase and then back to Connie, eyes cold.

                          PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D)
                You're losing your sense of
                proportion, Connie. Perhaps it's
                time you went out into the real
                world.

75    INT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DAY - PRESENT                         75

      Connie sits on her bed, with Smiley, drunk now, eyes wet.

                          CONNIE SACHS
                Hate the real world. (Beat) What
                does it matter? Old Circus is
                gone anyway, apart from Bill
                Haydon. Better off out of it.
                (Beat)I know you never liked him.

                          SMILEY
                    (Sharply)
                What nonsense. What on earth
                makes you say that?

                          CONNIE SACHS
                    (Surprised)
                I don't know.
                                                                       35.



     She turns to the shoe box beside her, takes out a
     PHOTOGRAPH.

                         CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)
               Here we are. The Nursery in our
               day.

     She shows him the photograph - a young Connie in Wren
     uniform, young men in cricket whites on a mown lawn. More
     senior figures stand behind.

                         CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)
               There's Control himself, you
               behind him, as usual...

     A younger bespectacled Smiley, lost amongst his more
     glamorous colleagues. She traces other faces with a crooked
     finger.

                         CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)
                   (Fondly)
               Jim Prideaux... and Bill Haydon.
               Together of course. The
               Inseparables. All my boys. That
               was a good time, George.

                         SMILEY
                   (Chiding)
               It was the war, Connie.

                         CONNIE SACHS
               A real war. Englishmen could be
               proud then.

     She stares at the photograph with a sad smile.

                         CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)
               I was right, then? About
               Polyakov. There's a mole?

     Smiley doesn't answer, stands up to go.

                         CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)
               If it's bad, don't come back. I
               want to remember you all as you
               were.


76   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT                                      76

     The house we saw in the title sequence. The air duct opens
     on the front of the house, spilling out its star-shape of
     light.

     After a moment Polyakov walks up to the door and knocks. We
     hear the dog barking...
                                                                       36.



77   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                       77

     Mrs McCraig opens the door for him and he passes her with a
     smile, heading upstairs.

     We TRACK with Mrs McCraig as she walks back to her pantry,
     opens a cupboard to reveal a huge reel to reel TAPE
     RECORDER. With ancient fingers she presses down the clunky
     record button and the spools begin to revolve.

                         POLYAKOV (O.S.)
                   (In Russian)
               ... The Priest is surprised to
               see General Secretary
               Krushchev...


78   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                       78

     As we saw it in the titles. The Mystery Man sits at the
     table holding up pages of a document for Polyakov who is
     photographing them as he talks, the camera giving a
     satisfying CLICK and WHIR with each shot.

                         POLYAKOV
               ... He says "Father, father, I've
               just had sex with two 17 year old
               girls." The Priest says "That's
               quite a sin, but you're an
               Atheist, General Secretary..."

     HIGH ANGLE - the dusty candelabra above their heads, and
     the tint MICROPHONE, nestled beside one of the bulbs.

                         POLYAKOV (CONT'D)
               "... why are you telling me?"


79   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                       79

     ... spools churning silently.

                         POLYAKOV (O.S.)
               ... Krushchev says "I'm seventy-
               seven, I'm telling everyone."

     We hear his chuckle and the continued CLICK WHIR of the
     camera.


80   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - NIGHT                     80

     Smiley sits at his desk staring at the CHESS SET laid out
     before him. One of the pieces has had the photograph of
     POLYAKOV added to it.
                                                                      37.



     He begins to register the faint noises around him...
     Pigeons on the ledge outside the window, the television
     mast creaking on the roof above him...

     He hears footsteps approaching down the corridor and stop
     outside his room. He crosses to the door and opens it and
     finds CONTROL waiting for him.

                         CONTROL
               Step into my lair.

     And in an instant we are in...


81   INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - PAST                  81

     Control is at the HEAD OF THE TABLE. Ranged against him are
     PERCY ALLELINE, ROY BLAND and TOBY ESTERHASE- all a little
     nervous. BILL HAYDON sits to the side, feet up. Smiley
     joins them without his spectacles. Control throws him a
     FILE.

                         CONTROL
                   (To Smiley)
               Sit down and take a look at this
               nonsense.

     Smiley sits down and begins to read.

                         CONTROL (CONT'D)
               Report by Soviet High Command on
               their recent naval exercises in
               the Black Sea. Just what the
               Admiralty have been begging us
               for some information on.

                         SMILEY
                   (Engrossed)
               Where did you get it?

                         CONTROL
               I didn't. Percy and his little
               cabal walked in with it.

                          TOBY ESTERHASE
                   (Protesting "cabal")
               Control...

                         CONTROL
               Shut up, Esterhase.

     Control waves him down. Smiley considers the report
     dispassionately.

                         SMILEY
               If it's genuine it's gold-dust.
               (Beat) But its topicality makes
               it suspect.
                                                             38.



Control turns to Alleline, with a mocking smile.

                    CONTROL
          Smiley is suspicious, Percy.
          Smells a fake.

                    SMILEY
          Where does it come from? What's
          the access?

                    CONTROL
          Percy doesn't feel like telling.

Percy packs his pipe, enjoys the moment - the young lion
challenging the old.

                    PERCY ALLELINE
          A new secret source of mine.

                    SMILEY
          But how could he possibly have
          access to...?

                    PERCY ALLELINE
          He has access to the most
          sensitive levels of policy
          making.

Smiley stares at him, staggered. If it's true, this is the
jackpot. Alleline enjoys his amazement, he leans over -
points with bureaucratic pride to the FLAMES on the LETTER
HEAD.

                    PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D)
          We have named the operation
          "Witchcraft."

                      SMILEY
                (Faintly)
          We?

                    CONTROL
          Percy and his pals have bypassed
          us, Smiley. Gone straight to the
          Minister. Everyone's very
          excited. Percy's to be allowed to
          keep the identity of his new
          friend top secret.

                    PERCY ALLELINE
          The Minister agrees with me that
          too many secrets are blown around
          here. Too much failure, too many
          scandals, too little solid
          intelligence!

Control is still smiling but only now do we realise he is
almost shaking with fury.
                                                             39.



                    CONTROL
          Luckily Percy's cabal has come to
          save us.

                    PERCY ALLELINE
              (Bulldozing on)
          It's all office politics here.

                    ROY BLAND
          Percy does have a point, Control.
          We should be fighting communism,
          not each other.

                    PERCY ALLELINE
          Meanwhile we're losing our
          reputation, our partners...

                    CONTROL
          Your bloody Yanks!

                    PERCY ALLELINE
              (Shouting)
          And we've had enough! There's
          going to be changes, Smiley!
          Changes.

Toby Esterhase finds his moment.

                    TOBY ESTERHASE
          We need to decide if we're part
          of the past, or part of the
          future.

                     CONTROL
              (Contemptuous)
          I should have left you where I
          found you.

                    ROY BLAND
          Control, if we could all just...

                    CONTROL
          OUT! ALL OF YOU!

Alleline, Bland and Esterhase leave. For a moment it looks
as if Haydon will stay, but then he stands up, shaking his
head and saunters out.

                    SMILEY
              (Cautiously)
          If Witchcraft is genuine...

Now the others have left, Control seems to sag under the
weight of some unnamed fear. He turns a haggard face to
Smiley.

                    CONTROL
          I don't trust miracles.
                                                                       40.



     We hear a KNOCKING and find ourselves back in...


82   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - DAY - PRESENT             82

     Mendel holds two mugs of tea in one hand, gives the agreed
     knock at Smiley's door again. After a moment a bleary
     Smiley opens the door and lets him in.


83   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - DAY                       83

     Mendel passes him the tea, takes in the desk piled high
     with papers.

                          MENDEL
                   (Of the tea)
               Courtesy of Mrs P. You been up
               all night?

     Smiley sits down wearily, sips his tea.

                           SMILEY
               Yes.

     Mendel notices one SLIP OF PAPER, sitting alone on the
     opposite side of the desk.

                         MENDEL
               What's that?

                         SMILEY
               Request for a thousand pound's in
               cash from the reptile fund.

                           MENDEL
               What for?

                         SMILEY
               For a Mister Ellis.

                         MENDEL
               Who's Ellis?

     Smiley leans back, rubs his tired eyes.

                         SMILEY
               It was one of Jim Prideaux's work
               names.

                         MENDEL
               What's so strange about that
               then?

                         SMILEY
               The date. Prideaux was killed in
               Hungary a year ago. October
               twenty first. So why was
                         (MORE)
                                                                       41.

                         SMILEY (CONT'D)
               someone giving him a thousand
               pounds two months later?

     He takes another sip of tea, gazes at Mendel thoughtfully.


84   EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - PLAYING FIELDS - DAY                 84

     Prideaux is running around the track, pounding along with his
     odd, loping stride. A group of BOYS watch him pass. One -
     SPIKELEY - mimics the run to the amusement of the others.


85   INT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                      85

     A fire burns in the little grate.

     ROACH sits near the back of the class. The BOY behind slaps
     the back of his neck with a ruler. Roach flinches but
     doesn't say anything. The Boy does it again.

     Prideaux drops a pile of books onto the desk of a boy -
     SPIKELY.

                         PRIDEAUX
               Hand those out.

     He crosses to the board begins to write on it - JE
     M'APPELLE MONSIEUR ELL...

     Behind him Spikely hands out the books, continuing to walk
     like a HUNCHBACK.

     The class snigger. Prideaux hears but doesn't turn,
     continues writing.

     Then from the CHIMNEY comes an unnerving SCRABBLING sound.
     A little soot falls...

     The sniggering fades out as all eyes turn nervously to the
     fire... what is that noise?

     Then, with a terrifying SCREECH, an OWL drops down into the
     grate, thrashes in the flames before flapping out into the
     class, its wings now ON FIRE, shrieking hideously, headed
     straight for Spikely who stands frozen in shock as the bird
     swoops towards his face.

     Then...

     ... somehow, Prideaux is THERE and grabs the burning bird
     from the air and in a second has it folded in on itself,
     NECK SNAPPED, and strides out of the room with it.

     The boys stare after their new teacher in SHOCKED SILENCE.
                                                                       42.



86   EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY             86

     Roach is hiding, spying down on the caravan below, where
     Prideaux sits in the doorway, massaging his raised
     shoulder, and drinking something from a green beaker.

                         PRIDEAUX
                   (After a moment)
               Come down here.

     Frightened, Roach obeys, sliding down the dip to him.
     Prideaux examines him fiercely. Finally his face relaxes a
     little.

                         PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)
                   (Identifying him)
               Boy with the marble.

                          ROACH
               Yes sir.

                         PRIDEAUX
               Gave me a turn up there, parked
               on the horizon. Thought you were
               a Juju man. What's your name?

                         BILL ROACH
               Sir, Roach, sir. Bill. I'm a new
               boy.

                         PRIDEAUX
               New arrival, eh? Middle of year?
               What's the story?

     Roach hesitates.

                         BILL ROACH
                   (Blushing)
               My mother and father... my
               father's left, so...

     He doesn't know how to explain his misery any further.
     Prideaux pretends not to notice.

                         PRIDEAUX
               Bill? The unpaid Bill. Anyone
               ever call you that?

                          BILL ROACH
               No sir.

                         PRIDEAUX
               Known a lot of Bills. They've all
               been good `uns. What you good at?

     Roach tries desperately to think of something.
                                                                       43.



                         BILL ROACH
               Nothing sir.

     The boy's eyes start to MIST UP. Prideaux looks down,
     busies himself with brushing at something on his shirt.

                         PRIDEAUX
               You're a good watcher though eh?
               Us loners always are. No one else
               spotted me when I turned up here.
               Best watcher in the unit,
               Bill Roach is, I'll bet. Long as
               he's got his specs on. Right?

                         BILL ROACH
                   (Gratefully)
               Yes sir.

     Prideaux finishes his drink, nods to Roach.

                         PRIDEAUX
               Free period, isn't it? Don't
               waste it down here.

     Roach sets off up the dip. He looks back and sees Prideaux
     has walked into the caravan and stands with his back to
     him, rubbing his aching shoulder.


87   EXT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    87

     Smiley walks up to the steps of his home, stops, examining
     the door, his absent-minded air hardening into something
     more ALERT. He scans the step and stoops to pick something
     up. A WEDGE.


88   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    88

     Smiley walks into the hallway senses alert. He pads towards
     the drawing room, wipes sweat from his hands on his
     trousers, steels himself. Is it finally Them, come for him?
     He walks in and finds...


89   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    89

     RICKI TARR sits smoking in the darkness, the knife on his
     lap.

                         RICKI TARR
               Hello Mister Smiley. You remember
               me.

                         SMILEY
               Hello, Ricki.

     He tosses the wedge onto the table.
                                                             44.



                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          You missed a wedge.

                    RICKI TARR
          Losing my touch.

Smiley watches him closely, very aware of the knife. Tarr
rubs his beard.

                    RICKI TARR (CONT'D)
          I know what I must look like. Rip
          Van Winkle. Feel like him. I
          could sleep for a year. Two
          years.

                    SMILEY
          Where've you been, Ricki?

                    RICKI TARR
          Here, there. Run out of places
          now. They're gonna kill me.

                    SMILEY
          Who is?

                    RICKI TARR
          Your lot. Or their lot. Whoever
          gets me first. I'm innocent, by
          the way. Within reason. (Beat)
          You going to find him then? The
          Mole?

Smiley crosses to another chair. As he does so he's
scanning the room - automatically noting the changes - the
remains of a meal on a table...

                    SMILEY
          I'm going to try. How long have
          you been here?

                    RICKI TARR
          Few days. Needed somewhere to
          hide.

Smiley notices the pile of letters for his wife Ann -
they've been disturbed.

                    RICKI TARR (CONT'D)
              (Following his gaze)
          Old habits.

Smiley fights down his anger.

                    SMILEY
          I wouldn't use my home as a safe
          house. There's every chance
          they're watching it.
                                                                        45.



                          RICKI TARR
                Calculated risk Mister Smiley. I
                wanted to see you, figured you'd
                turn up here sooner or later.

                          SMILEY
                What do you want Ricki?

                          RICKI TARR
                There's a woman. I want you to
                trade for her. Get her back from
                Karla.

                          SMILEY
                What woman?

      Tarr finishes his cigarette, lights another.

                          RICKI TARR
                Her name's Irina.


90    EXT. ISTANBUL - AIRPORT - DAY - PAST                         90

      Ricki Tarr emerges blinking into the white sunshine.
      Groomed, smart, that same restless energy. A car pulls up
      across the road TUFTY THESINGER - a boiled-looking British
      spy, not over-bright, signals to him. Tarr pulls his shades
      down and saunters over to his ride.

                          RICKI TARR (O.S.)
                I met her in Istanbul. They'd
                found some Russian trade
                delegate, name of Boris. He was
                spending high and wide in the
                nightclubs and some idiot thought
                we could turn him.

      Tarr opens the back seat and gets in. Tufty's slightly
      foolish smile slips a little.


90A   INT. ISTANBUL - TARR'S APARTMENT - ENTRANCE LOBBY - DAY    90A

      Tarr enters, followed by Tufty carrying one of his bags.


91    INT. ISTANBUL - TARR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                     91

      Nineteenth century European grandeur. But the apartment
      we're in is deserted and in a state of disrepair. Tarr
      stands at tripod mounted BINOCULARS set back from the
      window, idly playing with a knife with a distinctive white
      BONE handle.
                                                                       46.



92   EXT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                        92

     TARR'S P.O.V. - the HOTEL opposite - a Brutalist concrete
     slab, the rooms have floor to ceiling windows. In the
     bedroom a heavy set man - BORIS - is having sex with a
     MAID.

                         RICKI TARR (V.O.)
               I took one look and saw that he
               was a hood, Moscow trained.

     We TRACK to one side, and see the "drawing room" of the
     hotel suite, where Boris' two MINDERS, SERGEI and IVAN,
     wait, smirking at the sounds coming from the bedroom.

                         RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Probably coat trailing, trying to
               draw one of our men out into the
               open.

     We TRACK further along again and see the CORRIDOR outside
     the hotel room, where a YOUNG WOMAN has just arrived. This
     is IRINA.

                         RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               He had a wife with him. Common-
               law.

     Irina opens the door and walks into the drawing room, where
     the Minders stare fixedly at the floor, trying not to
     laugh. She walks on past and into the bedroom. The Maid
     jumps out of the bed, grabs her clothes and flees. Boris
     lies, unconcerned, reaches for his cigarettes.

     Irina walks past him and we track with her as she enters a
     BATHROOM. The glass window here is two-thirds frosted and
     we lose her as she bends over a basin.

     Something about her has caught Tarr's attention and he
     leaves the binoculars, walking closer to the window.

     Suddenly IRINA straightens up, her head above the frosted
     glass and stares straight at us...


93   EXT. ISTANBUL - TARR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                     93

     HER P.O.V. -

     RICKI TARR standing at the window opposite, knowing he
     should turn away, but somehow snagged by that look.

     A moment between the two. Then a car sweeps past on the
     road below and there's a flash of light behind Ricki's head
     - the headlights reflected in the lenses of the now visible
     BINOCULARS. Irina absorbs this. Above everything else,
     anger at her humiliation being observed.
                                                                        47.



94    EXT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                        94

      RICKI TARR'S P.O.V.

      As Irina walks back out of the bathroom, picks up a vase
      and hurls it at Boris, just missing him. He stubs out his
      cigarette and calmly climbs out of the bed. As we watch he
      draws the curtains along the length of the room, obscuring
      our view. Seconds later the curtains billow as Irina is
      thrown against them. We watch as her shape is rolled along
      the window by the force of Boris' blows. Finally the
      billowing fabric settles. Moments later Boris opens the
      curtains again and starts to dress. Irina lies on the bed.


94A   EXT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                      94A

      RICKI'S P.O.V.

      Ricki watches the street below as Boris, Sergei and Ivan
      exit the hotel, head for a night out.

      Tarr pulls on his own jacket, grabs his knife.

96    EXT. ISTANBUL - NIGHT                                        96

      IRINA'S P.O.V. - Her husband and the Minders are heading
      for a row of gaudy nightclubs. And someway behind him,
      Ricki Tarr, trailing.

      She exhales a breath on the glass.


96A   EXT. ISTANBUL - NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT                         96A

      Tarr approaches the night club, glancing around quickly
      before slipping inside.


97    INT. ISTANBUL - NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT                           97

      Ricki Tarr enters. He scans the room for Boris, spotting
      Tufty Thesinger at a table. He crosses towards him,
      watching as Boris and the two minders are entertained by
      the clubs hostesses.

      Boris calls for more drinks, clutching a bundle of
      currency.

                          TUFTY THESINGER
                    (grinning)
                This is going to be a long night.
                                                                        48.



                          RICKI TARR
                You baby-sit this one.

      Ricki walks towards us.


98    INT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                        98

      Irina answers the door and finds Ricki Tarr outside.

                          RICKI TARR
                Your bloke's a bit of a bastard.
                (Beat) Just wanted to check you
                were alright.

      She stares at him.

                          RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                There was something about her.

100   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY - PRESENT                         100

      Tarr exhales smoke. Smiley studies him.

                          SMILEY
                You were due to fly home the next
                day. What did you tell London?

                          RICKI TARR
                Nothing. Didn't have anything to
                tell yet. But... I could sense it
                in her.

                          SMILEY
                Sense what?

                            RICKI TARR
                A secret.


101   INT. ISTANBUL - GARAGE - DAY - PAST                         101

      Ricki Tarr is talking to a man. A sports car lies under a
      sheet. The deal concluded, the man pulls back the sheet to
      reveal the car.


102   EXT. ISTANBUL - DOCKS - DAY                                 102

      Irina is driving, exhilarated, free. Ricki Tarr is on the
      back seat, sleeping.
                                                                         49.



103    INT. ISTANBUL - WORKERS CANTEEN - DAY                       103

       A workers canteen on the Bosphorus. Tarr and Irina sit
       drinking wine, talking.

                           RICKI TARR (V.O.)
                 I played the businessman, Michael
                 Trench. A Holiday Romance. Thought
                 I'd take my time with it...

       Tarr gently traces a bruise on Irina's arm.

                           RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                 But second date she made this open
                 play...

       We see a growing attraction between them.

       Irina and Tarr laughing, flirting. They move closer to one
       another.

       Tarr feels he is the master of this situation.

       Suddenly Irina withdraws. She stares at him.

                           IRINA
                 I know what you are.

       A long beat. Tarr waits her out.

                           IRINA (CONT'D)
                 I would like to talk to your boss
                 Control. I have something to trade.
                 Something big. I want a new life in
                 the West.

       Tarr desperately tries to stay looking calm.

                           IRINA (CONT'D)
                 That is the deal. You tell them.


103A   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING - PRESENT                  103A

       Smiley sits with his hooded, bored look, examining everything
       carefully.

                           SMILEY
                 What made you so sure she wasn't
                 coat-trailing?

                           RICKI TARR
                 We've all got our strengths. And
                 weaknesses.

       He flicks a look at the pile of Ann's letter, an insolent
       smile.
                                                                      50.



                          RICKI TARR (CONT'D)
                Me, I know women. She said she had
                a secret. The mother of all
                secrets. Said she'd only tell
                Control. She wanted to trade. New
                life for her and her kids.

                          SMILEY
                She had children in Russia?

                          RICKI TARR
                That's why they let her and Boris
                out. So, I said I'd tell the
                Circus.

                           SMILEY
                    (Beat)
                But you didn't?

      Tarr's smile fades.

      Irina prowls the room.

                          RICKI TARR (V.O.)
                Wanted to find out more first. So,
                I waited her out.

      Tarr lounges by a window, smoking.

                          RICKI TARR (CONT'D)
                    (Shrugging)
                You can't expect them to jump at
                every offer of service.(Beat.
                Carefully) If they had more
                information...

      Irina doesn't answer, paces. Tarr lets his face harden.

                          RICKI TARR (CONT'D)
                Well, if you won't tell me more,
                there's nothing I can do.

      She stares at him.

                          IRINA
                If I tell you, I'm putting my
                life in your hands. The lives of
                my children? Do you understand?

      She walks slowly towards him, bends over, begins to whisper
      in his ear.
                                                                        51.

      The two make love, passionate, Irina trying to bind him to
      her. Tarr responds, excited by her, now that she needs him.
      We intercut their intense love-making with...


107   INT. ISTANBUL - NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT                          107

      A drunk Boris groping a very young hostess on a dance
      floor, his shirt undone. He starts to strip the girl of her
      uniform, amused by her efforts to keep her clothes on. The
      two minders clap in time to the music, encouraging him.
      Boris grabs the girl by the hair, biting her neck,
      laughing, eyes glazed with drink, barely able to stand...
      The inane music blares on...


108   INT. ISTANBUL - TARR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                    108

      Silence. Tarr and Irina stare at each other. A long beat.

                    (tenderly)
                Promise me you'll be careful. No
                details to the Circus. Not until
                we're safe.

                           RICKI TARR

                I promise.

      Tarr threads his way through the crowds of evening shoppers

      We're gliding above the respectable front of a Business

      story of an Import/Export outfit...

      ...over a back-room and through a STEEL DOOR to the CYPHER
      ROOM beyond where we find a drunk TUFTY THESINGER watching
      Tarr send a CODED MESSAGE.

                          TUFTY THESINGER
                You were supposed to have gone.
                London stations's been on to me.
                They want to know what the hell
                you're doing.
                                                                      52.



                          RICKI TARR
                    (without turning)
                Fuck off.


111   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - PRESENT                     111

      Smiley takes off his glasses and wipes them.

                          SMILEY
                And what did your message say,
                Ricki?

                          RICKI TARR
                Just that I had a Moscow Centre
                trained hood wanting to defect.

                             SMILEY
                What else?

      Tarr looks at him. For the first time there's something
      else behind his smile.

                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
                I understand how you felt. You
                wanted to do something.

                          RICKI TARR
                I know what I am to the Circus.
                One of the scalp-hunters. Someone
                to give the dirty jobs to. I
                wanted to bring this one in
                myself.

                          SMILEY
                Yes. I quite see that.

                          RICKI TARR
                I said that she claimed to have
                information crucial to the well-
                being of the Circus.

                          SMILEY (O.S)
                And what else?

                          RICKI TARR
                That she had information
                concerning a Double Agent.

      He colours.

                          RICKI TARR (CONT'D)
                I was just trying to... to get
                the proper attention. (Beat) And
                I told them to tell Mister
                Guillam that this was the reason
                I hadn't come home, not because
                I'd defected or anything.
                                                                        53.



                          SMILEY
                What happened next Ricki?

                          RICKI TARR
                I waited for a reply.


112   INT. ISTANBUL - IMPORT/EXPORT OFFICE - NIGHT - PAST         112

      A tense Tarr sits waiting for a reply. It's dark outside.
      Thesinger is asleep at his desk. The TICKER MACHINE begins
      to rattle into life. Tarr jumps to it.

      Tarr begins to decode the in-coming message on a one-time
      pad.

      INSERT - "We read you"

                          RICKI TARR (V.O.)
                I waited hours but that was all
                they sent. It didn't make sense.
                Like they were stalling.


113   EXT. ISTANBUL - TARR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                    113

      Tarr stands staring across at Irina's hotel balcony with
      binoculars.


114   EXT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                       114

      BORIS stands looking straight at him. The hint of a mocking
      smile. Behind him we can just see SERGEI and IVAN sitting
      in the room.


115   INT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                       115

      Boris turns from the balcony, exhaling smoke from a
      cigarette, the faint smile still on his lips. He looks up,
      his expression CHANGING.


116   EXT. ISTANBUL - ALLEYWAY - DAWN                             116

      Tarr bolts down an alleyway.


117   INT. ISTANBUL - IMPORT/EXPORT OFFICE - DAY                  117

      The door is ajar... a radio is playing LOUD POP MUSIC. Tarr
      pauses on the threshold, senses alert. He takes out his
      KNIFE.
                                                                        54.



118   INT. ISTANBUL - IMPORT/EXPORT OFFICE - DAY                  118

      A fan stirs the dusty air. Tarr walks in and stops. Tufty
      lies on the floor, in a pool of blood. He's been tortured,
      one eye gouged out. The other manages to convey a rather
      touching amazement at the violence worked on him. His throat
      has been slit wide open. Tarr absorbs this, looks at the
      knife in his own hand, turns and runs.


119   INT. ISTANBUL - WORKERS CANTEEN - DAY                       119

      A desperate Tarr hurries towards a phone.


120   INT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - DAY                         120


      P.O.V. - BATHROOM THROUGH THE HALF-OPEN DOOR -

      Irina enters the hotel room. She stops a moment, afraid.
      Then she looks towards us.

      BATHROOM

      Irina is backing out of the room. We catch a glimpse of the
      BUTCHERED REMAINS of BORIS hanging from the shower rail, a
      garroting wire around his neck. He's been tortured, the
      shower curtain used to catch the pooling blood.

      She BACKS AWAY across the room to the door, leaving a trail
      of bloody footprints on the pale carpet.

      She turns to the door, looks out of the SPY HOLE.

      Her P.O.V. - two men, TINY DISTORTED FIGURES walking down
      the corridor towards her.

      The phone starts to RING. Irina glances at it, knowing it's
      too late for her.

      SPY-HOLE - The TWO FIGURES loom closer.


121   INT. ISTANBUL - PORT AUTHORITY - DAY                        121

      P.O.V. - Crowds of people throng the busy port.

      A paranoid Ricki watches from the back of the hall. He
      notices a child react to something - follows his gaze...

      TARR'S P.O.V. - behind glass panels - a glimpse of three men
      wheeling a gurney - a bandaged figure upon it. Just before
      the figure disappears, a hand moves a little...

      Tarr watches Irina's departure, sick with guilt.
                                                                        55.



122   OMITTED                                                     122


123   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - PRESENT                       123

      Tarr picks at a loose thread on his cuff, mind still back
      there.

                          RICKI TARR
                They put her on a ship. That's
                all I know. I've done a lot of
                things Mister Smiley, but... I
                don't know why... I keep thinking
                about her. (Beat)

      He smiles, almost bewildered by his own feelings.

                          RICKI TARR (CONT'D)
                She wasn't even my type. (Beat)
                I want to get her out. I owe her
                that.

      He stands up abruptly, heading for the door.

                          SMILEY
                Where are you going Ricki? You
                said yourself, Karla will be
                looking for you. I can take you
                somewhere. Keep you safe.

      Tarr's face twists with mirth.

                          RICKI TARR
                Who's going to keep you safe?


124   INT. CIRCUS - LIFT SHAFT - DAY                              124

      We are peering down the lift shaft as new secrets are
      winched towards us.


125   INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                         125

      Alleline sits in his baronial chair, alone in the room. He
      looks what he is. A man who knows he's OUT OF HIS DEPTH.

      Across from him the SAFE stands, an almost malignant
      presence.

      Alleline stares at it, a light film of sweat on his
      forehead.


126   INT. SQUASH CLUB - EVENING                                  126

      A dark warren of corridors and glassed SQUASH COURTS
      somewhere under-ground.
                                                                        56.



      Alleline walks along the courts, new racquet in hand,
      uncomfortable in his too- tight white shorts. He reaches a
      court. Inside LACON and the MINISTER are playing a furious
      game of squash.


127   INT. SQUASH CLUB - EVENING                                  127

      The three men stand talking within the transparent cube of
      the court. Lacon and the Minister are still sweating from
      their game. The Minister is smoking.

                          OLIVER LACON
                Percy has always resisted
                suggestions of wider exploitation
                of Witchcraft's intelligence.

                          MINISTER
                Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.

                          PERCY ALLELINE
                I've refused to share Witchcraft
                with our allies, so far,
                Minister.

                          MINISTER
                Greedy boy.

                          PERCY ALLELINE
                My goal has been to establish his
                track record beyond all doubt. I
                think the time has come to
                approach our American brothers-in-
                arms.

      The Minister considers this with some excitement, takes a
      drag on his cigarette.

                          MINISTER
                You think they'll take us back
                into bed?

                          PERCY ALLELINE
                I'm not interested in a one-off
                trade. I want on-going access to
                American intelligence.

      This stops the Minister. He turns to face Alleline.

                          MINISTER
                Do you think we can get it?

      Alleline senses he has just risen several rungs. He slashes
      inexpertly with his racquet.
                                                                       57.



                          PERCY ALLELINE
                With Witchcraft on our side, I
                think we can get anything we
                bloody-well want.


128   EXT. HAMPSTEAD PONDS - DAY                                 128

      Smiley swims in the placid water. We hear music. The tinkle
      of glasses from a happy Christmas party...

                          CONTROL (O.S.)
                    (mock out-rage)
                Percy?


129   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR PARTY - NIGHT - PAST             129

      - And we are back in the Circus.

      We find Control - arm outstretched, finger pointing.

                          CONTROL
                Percy. Did you do this?

      A Christmas Party of the past. Control, at the height of
      his powers, a punch glass in hand. Noise and music: the
      normally earnest atmosphere of the Circus released in an
      unexpectedly boisterous gathering.

                          CONTROL (CONT'D)
                You penny pinching Scot. Can you
                not take a bloody order. No one
                is to tamper with the recipe.
                It's going to take us five hours
                to get drunk on this piss water.

      Alleline tries to smile.

                          PERCY ALLELINE
                I followed the recipe.

      He glances nervously at his wife, a vivacious alcoholic,
      just beginning to make a show of herself. She puts a CROWN-
      SHAPED party hat from the cracker onto Alleline's head. He
      brushes it off, anxious not to appear the fool.

                          PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D)
                    (Muttering)
                For God's sake Mary...

      BILL HAYDON, wearing a crown from the cracker at a rakish
      angle, appears in the nick of time, leads Alleline's wife out
      for a dance, teasing the sullenness from her. They're good
      dancers. Alleline relieved, crisis averted.
                                                                         58.



129A   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR PARTY - NIGHT                    129A

       We find Smiley trapped in a conversation with an earnestly
       drunk deb. Control raises his arm above the melee. He's
       still at the punch bowl.

                           CONTROL
                 Smiley? Where's Ann? Get me a
                 lady of taste? Ann will sort it
                 out.

                           SMILEY
                     (grateful to get away
                      from the deb)
                 I'll go find her.

       Smiley threads his way through the party, walking amongst
       his colleagues, enjoying himself... Jerry Westerby and
       Connie Sachs are arm in arm, singing along to a song - "The
       Second Worst Spy in the World." They link Smiley to them
       for a verse, others joining in around them. The song segues
       into the Russian National Anthem. The crowd sing lustily,
       many of them Russian-speaking, enjoying the chance to sing
       with vigour.

       Smiley walks on. Behind him the song ends to be replaced by
       the CHARLIE RICH song we heard earlier.

       His P.O.V. -

       - One of the larger Mothers doubled up with laughter,
       pulling a cracker with a flushed TOBY ESTERHASE, hopelessly
       outweighed, but competitive to the finish.

        - ROY BLAND with his plain wife, eyeing one of the pretty
       debs as she dances by. A mother takes Smiley by the hand
       and leads him briefly into the dance. Smiley takes a turn
       with her, and extricates himself. Still smiling...


130    INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR PARTY - CORRIDOR - NIGHT          130

       ... he walks down a dark corridor, the noise of the party
       fading away behind him.

       He stops seeing something in the shadows of an office. For
       a moment he doesn't understand what he's seen.

       REVERSE

       Two shapes locked in an embrace.

       Smiley stands, nakedly absorbing the body blow. Then he
       turns and walks back to the heat and noise of the party.
                                                                        59.



131   EXT. HAMPSTEAD PONDS - DAY - PRESENT                        131

      Smiley and Guillam sit on a bench. Smiley has his towel,
      hair wet from his swim.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                You look tired.

      Smiley considers telling Guillam about Tarr's visit, but an
      instinct for secrecy wins out.

                          SMILEY
                Yes. I didn't sleep well. (Beat)
                I want you to get something for
                me, Peter. I need the duty
                officer's log book for last
                November. I'm sorry, but I'm
                going to have to send you up a
                floor, into the Lion's den.
                (Beat) If you have the slightest
                reservation...

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Is feeling sick to your stomach a
                slight reservation?

                          SMILEY
                If you're caught, Peter, you
                can't mention me. I'm sorry, but
                you're alone.

      Guillam nods. He gets up and walks quickly away. After a
      moment a MAN rises from a nearby bench and saunters over.
      It's Mendel.

                          MENDEL
                You're clean. Nothing on your
                back. Nothing on your conscience.


132   EXT. CIRCUS - MORNING                                       132

      A LORRY roars past, wiping frame and revealing Guillam
      arriving at the circus, carrying his briefcase. He springs
      up the four steps.


133   INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - DAY                      133

      Guillam is at the security gate at the dingy lobby. The
      security guard, Bryant, steps from his box. Beyond him is
      the row of lifts.

                          BRYANT
                Mister Guillam? How's the family?
                                                              60.



                    PETER GUILLAM
          Fine, Bryant. Up to Registry
          today.

                    BRYANT
          Okay sir. Yellow one for the bag
          sir.

Bryant stamps a PINK chit and hands it to Guillam, pulling
open the lift cage. He gives him a yellow slip for the bag.

Guillam climbs inside and begins to ascend, rattlingly
slowly. As Bryant's head disappears...

                    PETER GUILLAM
          Time you oiled this thing, isn't
          it?

                    BRYANT (O.S.)
          We keep asking...

Guillam examines the chit. He wipes his hands. For the
first time we realize how NERVOUS he is.

Polished shoes appear as they reach the floor, then the
uniform trousers of a short man. A self-important JANITOR.

Guillam steps out and the Janitor checks Guillam's pink and
yellow chit and motions him through a turnstile. Then he
stops him short. He gestures for Guillam to raise his arms.

                    PETER GUILLAM
          You're kidding?

                       JANITOR PETE
          New rules.

Guillam is briskly frisked.

                    PETER GUILLAM
          Mind the jewels.

                    JANITOR PETE
          Pen and watch sir.

He holds up a box and Guillam hands him his fountain pen
and watch.

The search over Guillam sets off down the corridor,
unnerved by the task ahead - betraying his own kind.

                    BILL HAYDON (O.S.)
          What the hell are you doing up
          here?

Guillam freezes. Then he turns. It's Bill Haydon standing
in a doorway, frowning at him over his spectacles. A
moment.
                                                                       61.



                          PETER GUILLAM
                You don't look pleased to see me,
                Bill?

                          BILL HAYDON
                Why would I be? You bloody
                pariah.

      Then Bill grins, the grin transforming his face. Guillam
      smiles back, relief mixing with real warmth.

                          BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)
                We like the Scalp-hunters to know
                their place. On the second floor.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Doing some research. Makes a
                change from sitting on my arse.

                          BILL HAYDON
                Heard it was quiet down there.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                As the grave. When're you going
                to give us something to do?

                          BILL HAYDON
                Haven't you heard? Technology's
                the future. No need for you apes
                anymore. I can get you a posting
                to Northern Ireland if that helps
                get the blood racing.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Thanks anyway. Stick to sitting
                on my arse.

      They've reached the end of the corridor. Haydon peels away,
      a hand raised in farewell.


134   INT. CIRCUS - READING ROOM - DAY                           134

      Guillam arrives at a counter which serves to block entry to
      the vast archive of files beyond. A Janitor appears in the
      entrance. He pushes a book towards Guillam to sign.

                          JANITOR ALWYN
                    (re: Guillam's bag)
                Want me to look after that for
                you, Mister Guillam?

                            PETER GUILLAM
                Thanks...
                                                                        62.



                           JANITOR ALWYN
                Gotta give you a chit. The
                Dolphin'll kill me if I don't.
                New Rules.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                So, chit me.

      The Janitor grins, slaps a chit on the bag, raises the
      counter and Guillam enters.


135   INT. CIRCUS - READING ROOM - DAY                            135

      A few researchers sit amongst stacks of files. Guillam is
      filling out requisition slips. Behind the desk, a woman -
      SAL - watches him.

                          SAL
                What you up to this weekend?

                          PETER GUILLAM
                    (rakish)
                Visiting aunts.

                            SAL
                I'll bet.

      She takes the flimsy's from the back of the slips and posts
      them into her desk.

                          SAL (CONT'D)
                Corridor D.

      She hands him back the top copies.

                          SAL (CONT'D)
                The two-eights are halfway on
                your right, the three-ones are
                next alcove down.


136   EXT. GARAGE - DAY                                           136

      Mendel sits in his car, watching the garage fore-court. He
      looks at his watch.


137   INT. CIRCUS - ARCHIVE - DAY                                 137

      The LIFT CAGE we saw earlier is being raised from the floor
      by a Janitor at the winch. Another janitor is removing
      files from it.

      Radiating out from the lift cage are the shelves of files
      that make up the reading room.
                                                                        63.



      We find Guillam moving along the shelves reading the
      fluorescent number cards. He takes a file out, leaving his
      green slip in the brackets provided by each file. Guillam
      looks across at his real objective...

      A row of anonymous looking files on the next aisle - the
      archived DUTY OFFICER'S LOG-BOOKS, spines bearing the year
      and month they cover.

      And in his way - a GIRL perched on a ladder, a MAN mending
      a radiator. The Man turns round and stares straight at
      Guillam. Suddenly he POINTS STRAIGHT AT HIM. For a moment
      Guillam freezes, unnerved. Then he glances over his
      shoulder and realises the Man is communicating with another
      WORKMAN behind him.

      Abruptly, Guillam walks over to the file and swaps it,
      keeping the title close to his chest. He goes back to his
      desk, a light film of sweat on his forehead.

      He sits, a pencil clamped between his teeth, waiting...
      From somewhere nearby comes the sound of a PHONE RINGING,
      then being answered. Moments later...

                          JANITOR ALWYN
                    (To Guillam)
                Telephone sir.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                    (as though distracted)
                Oh to hell, who is it?

                          JANITOR ALWYN
                Outside line, sir. Someone rough.
                The garage, I think, regarding
                your car.

      Guillam walks over to the counter, the stolen file hugged
      to his chest.

      A LOCKED BOX on a trolley is wheeled towards him and is
      opened to reveal the OUTSIDE LINE TELEPHONE.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                    (into the phone)
                Hello? (Beat) Well, damn. Can't
                you do the bloody repair?


138   EXT. GARAGE - DAY                                           138

      Mendel is using the office phone, an ELDERLY GERMAN
      MECHANIC, stands outside guarding the office door. In the
      background a POP TUNE is playing on the radio.

                          MENDEL
                Can't be done sir, you're going
                to need a new gear box.
                                                                      64.



139   INT. CIRCUS - READING ROOM - DAY                          139

      On Guillam...

                          PETER GUILLAM
                At least get on to the main
                dealers first...


140   INT. CIRCUS - MONITOR ROOM - DAY                          140

      One of the Mothers is listening routinely in on the call,
      TAPE SPOOLS revolving, recording the conversation. The POP
      TUNE plays, insidiously working its way into her head. She
      idly taps her pen along to the tune.

                          PETER GUILLAM (O.S.)
                Have you got the number?


141   INT. CIRCUS - READING ROOM - DAY                          141

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Well, hold on...

      He cups his hand over the mouthpiece...

                          PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D)
                ... Alwyn? Chuck me the bag a
                minute, will you?

      Alwyn gets Guillam's bag and brings it over to him.

                          PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D)
                Thanks.

      Alwyn goes back to his post. Guillam, still hugging the
      phone, takes out a BEIGE file from his bag and switches it
      with the one against his chest. He takes an address book
      from the bag and finds a number.

                          PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D)
                    (Into phone)
                946-0335. OK? Thanks.

      He hangs up, hands the bag back to Alwyn and steps back
      into...


142   INT. CIRCUS - READING ROOM - DAY                          142

      Guillam retraces his steps, placing his dummy file in the
      pink stack, replacing the one he placed there in its
      original shelf, remembering to take the green slip from the
      bracket. It's done.

      Guillam takes the green slip and hands it to Sal, who signs
      it and puts it on its spike. Guillam turns.
                                                                     65.



      TOBY ESTERHASE is standing in front of him. Unfriendly
      eyes.

                          TOBY ESTERHASE
                Could we see you Peter?

      For a second Guillam can't speak.

                          TOBY ESTERHASE (CONT'D)
                Percy would like quite an urgent
                word with you. Can you come now
                to the fifth floor? That would be
                so kind.

                             PETER GUILLAM
                Of course.

      Esterhase turns and Guillam, mind whirring, follows him
      back out through the counter.

                          PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D)
                    (to Alwyn, inspired)
                You might just throw that into
                the lift for me, mark it for the
                second floor, save me filling out
                more bloody chits?

                          JANITOR ALWYN
                Will do sir.


143   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - OUTSIDE ALLELINE'S OFFICE - DAY
                                                               143

      The Mothers sit over their typewriters as Guillam and
      Esterhase walk through into the anteroom.

                           PERCY ALLELINE (O.S.)
                    (shouting from the other
                     room)
                Esterhase, I'll have no phone
                calls, tell them...

                          TOBY ESTERHASE
                The Chief will take no calls,
                please, ladies...

                          MOTHER
                    (Muttering)
                We can hear.

      Toby holds the door open for Guillam.

                          TOBY ESTERHASE
                We are having a conference.
                                                                        66.



144   INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                         144

      Alleline sits in the baronial chair, Bland at his left.
      Haydon on his right. Esterhase trots over to his seat.
      Guillam takes in the REPORT they all seem to have spread
      out in front of them.

                          PERCY ALLELINE
                    (Reading)
                Well now young Peter Guillam, are
                you ready for me finally?

      Guillam, affecting ease, leans against the wall.

                          PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D)
                What are you getting up to down
                there these days, apart from
                chasing our virgins...

      Guillam catches a smirk from Esterhase - mocking him?

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Couple of Arab ploys look quite
                promising. Other than that,
                getting quite good at ping-pong.

                          PERCY ALLELINE
                Arabs... You can rent one but you
                can't buy one. Right Bill?

      He looks up from the report. Here it comes...

                          PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D)
                How's Ricki Tarr these days?

                          PETER GUILLAM
                    (Not missing a beat)
                Fine. We have tea at Fortnum's
                every afternoon.

                          PERCY ALLELINE
                I require the matter of your
                discussion with Tarr.

      Guillam shrugs.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled.

      Alleline lets the silence build, rather like a bad actor.
      Everyone is staring at Guillam.

                          PERCY ALLELINE
                    (Quietly)
                What's that shrug for?

      He SLAMS a hand on the desk, tea-cups rattling, a sudden
      roar.
                                                             67.



                    PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D)
          I'm talking to you about a
          murderer. I'm talking to you
          about a defector from your own
          damn section! I'm accusing you of
          consorting with an enemy agent
          behind my back! Don't damn well
          shrug at me! How'd you like a
          term in prison?

Guillam's own temper comes to his rescue.

                    PETER GUILLAM
          But I haven't been seeing him! So
          get your facts straight and get
          OFF MY BACK!

A moment, while the room digests this. A relaxation of the
tension, as if he's passed some kind of test.

                    PERCY ALLELINE
          So if I told you that Tarr had
          recently arrived in Paris would
          you be surprised?

                    PETER GUILLAM
          Nothing would surprise me about
          Tarr.

                    PERCY ALLELINE
          And if I told you we happen to
          know that thirty thousand pounds
          mysteriously appeared in his bank
          account last month, would that
          surprise you?

This DOES shock Guillam, but he manages to hold on to his
sullen expression.

                    PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D)
          Your man's a defector, Guillam.
          Got turned by the opposition
          months ago and now they've sent
          him back to us!

                      PETER GUILLAM
          What for?

                    PERCY ALLELINE
          Never mind what for! To muddy the
          water, that's what for! Spread a
          whole lot of damn nonsense to get
          us chasing our tails! The point
          is this - he's heading for home.
          The first peep from him you come
          to the grown-ups, understood?
          Anyone you see at this table. But
          not another damn soul!
                                                                        68.



145   INT. CIRCUS - CORRIDOR - DAY                                145

      Guillam is walking to the lifts, we note he is now carrying
      his BAG. Behind him ROY BLAND is walking down the corridor.
      He peels off, turning left, humming a tune to himself - the
      same POP SONG that was playing at the garage in the
      background of Guillam's call. Guillam reacts as he keeps on
      walking, trying to work out if this MEANS SOMETHING. We
      track with him as his anger and PARANOIA grow.


146   EXT. GARAGE - DAY                                           146

      Guillam drives down an alleyway full speed, screeches to a
      halt as he reaches a group of children playing, edges past
      them and on into the car body repair shop. He gets and
      strides past the elderly GERMAN MECHANIC we saw earlier.

                          MECHANIC
                    (German, subtitled)
                He's waiting for you.

      Guillam strides on, nerves at snapping point, to the other
      end of the workshop where a Vauxhall waits.

      Behind him the Mechanic and his SON are already beginning
      to strip the plates off Guillam's car.


147   EXT. GARAGE - DAY                                           147

      Mendel appears by Guillam's side as they walk towards
      another waiting car, Guillam simmering with rage.

                          MENDEL
                    (A faint smile)
                All go smoothly did it? (Beat)
                Where we off to?

                          PETER GUILLAM
                The hotel. I have to see George.

                          MENDEL
                Mister Smiley isn't at the hotel,
                sir. Change of venue.


148   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY                                   148

      Tarr sits in Control's green velvet armchair watching TV.
      There's a large tape recorder on the table behind him. We
      hear the door to the flat opening.

                          PETER GUILLAM (O.S.)
                George?
                                                              69.



Guillam hurries into the room, stops, seeing Tarr. Tarr
gives his sunny grin but he's sweating, his eyes full of
tension.

                    TARR
          Hello, Mister Guillam, sorry I
          took so long to come back.

Guillam punches him in the face, drags him from the chair,
the two struggling.

Behind them Smiley and Fawn appear. Smiley watches coolly
for a moment then signals Fawn, who drags Guillam off Tarr,
expertly pinning his arm.

                    FAWN
          Excuse me, sir.

Guillam pulls free angrily.

                    SMILEY
          Ricki's been helping us Peter.
          (Indicating TAPE DECK) He's been
          telling us all about his
          adventures.

                    PETER GUILLAM
              (To Smiley)
          He's a double, George! There is
          no Mole! The whole thing's a pack
          of lies thought up by Moscow.
          Karla's bought him for thirty
          thousand pounds!

He pulls the LOG BOOK out of his file.

                    PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D)
              (To Tarr)
          I stole that, because of you! I
          spied on my own. Do you know how
          that makes me feel?

Smiley holds out his hand for the log book.

                    SMILEY
          As you did take the trouble to
          steal it...

Guillam hands him the book and Smiley leafs through the
pages.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          Ricki, you said you sent the
          Circus a telegram concerning
          Irina's information?

Tarr sits up, wiping blood from his mouth.
                                                            70.



                    RICKI TARR
              (Sullenly)
          S'right.

                    SMILEY
          What was the date?

Tarr hesitates, considering.

                    PETER GUILLAM
          He doesn't know because there was
          no telegram! The whole thing...

                    RICKI TARR
          November 20th. It would have been
          November 20th. Evening.

Smiley has found the right month. He flicks through the
dated pages - 18th November, 19th November...

He holds up the book - the next page has been cut out.

                    SMILEY
          November 20th is missing. (Beat)
          Someone is covering their tracks
          Peter. Unless you think that's
          just a coincidence?

Guillam looks thrown.

                    PETER GUILLAM
          What about the money?

                    SMILEY
          Thirty thousand isn't so much for
          Karla to pay if it protects his
          Mole. I'm afraid someone in the
          Circus knows all about Mister
          Tarr and is doing everything they
          can to discredit him.

Guillam takes the log book from Smiley, runs a thumb down
the razored edge of the missing page. He notices some
writing on the next page.

                    PETER GUILLAM
              (Reading)
          "Enquiries to the fifth floor."

Smiley takes the book again, examines the note.

                    SMILEY
          You recognize that handwriting?
          (Beat) That's Toby Esterhase.
                                                                        71.



149   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - EVENING                                  149

      Smiley and Guillam pull up in front of the hotel. They sit,
      in weary silence, staring up at the unprepossessing
      building.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Why didn't you tell me? That you
                had Tarr?

      Smiley looks at him. Guillam reads the look correctly.

                          PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D)
                In case I didn't make it out of
                the Circus...

                          SMILEY
                Secrecy is a habit.

      Guillam rubs his eyes.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                I should get some rest. And I
                suppose you should get your
                reading done.

      Smiley nods. Doesn't move.


150   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - NIGHT                    150

      The two men are finishing off a bottle of Scotch.
      Unusually, Smiley is drunk - a result of the alcohol and
      the lack of sleep.

      Guillam lies on one of the single beds, staring at the
      PHOTOGRAPHS of the four suspects Smiley has pinned on his
      chessmen.

                             PETER GUILLAM
                I'm sorry.

                             SMILEY
                What for?

                          PETER GUILLAM
                I wanted to believe Tarr was
                lying. (Beat) All this time,
                thinking I'm fighting a war. It's
                a sham. Karla won years ago and
                we didn't even know it.

      Smiley watches Guillam, estimating how badly all of this is
      affecting him.

                           SMILEY
                    (Beat)
                I met him once. Karla.
                           (MORE)
                                                             72.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          In fifty-five. Moscow Centre was
          in pieces. Purge after purge.
          Half their Agents were jumping
          ship and I travelled around
          signing them up. Hundreds of
          them.

Guillam raises himself up on an elbow, listening.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          One of them was calling himself
          Gerstmann. He was on his way back
          to Russia, and we were pretty
          sure he was going to be executed.
          Plane had a twenty-four lay over
          at Delhi, and that's how long I
          had to convince him to come over
          to us instead of going home to
          die.

Smiley stares at the room around, projecting his memory of
the Delhi cell onto their present surroundings.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          Little room...I'm sitting
          here...he's sitting there...

He points to an EMPTY CHAIR in front of him.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          The Americans have had him
          tortured.

He holds up his right hand.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          No fingernails. It's incredibly
          hot. I'm very tired and all I
          want to do is get this over with
          and get back home. Things weren't
          going well with Ann.

Guillam flinches a little, but Smiley doesn't notice, lost
now in the past.

                     SMILEY (CONT'D)
          I give him the usual pitch...
          Come to the West and we can give
          you a comfortable life. After
          questioning. Or you can catch
          your plane and fly home and be
          shot, like Bykov, Shur,
          Muranov...

He stares at the CHAIR as if expecting an answer, and
slightly drunkenly Guillam finds himself turning to the
CHAIR for a response.
                                                             73.



                     PETER GUILLAM
              (Beat)
          What did he say?

Smiley doesn't answer - STARES AT THE CHAIR - the silence
stretching - it's all becoming a little surreal.

                    SMILEY
              (To the chair)
          Think of your wife. You have a
          wife, don't you? I brought you
          some cigarettes, by the way.

He mimes placing cigarettes on an invisible table, between
him and the chair.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          Use my lighter.

He mimes placing the lighter beside the cigarettes.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          "We could arrange for her to join
          you, we have a lot of stock to
          trade. If you go back, she'll be
          ostracised. Think of her. Think
          about how much she..."

He breaks off in sudden impatience with himself.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          Kept harping on about the damn
          wife! Telling him more about me,
          than... Should have walked out,
          of course, but for some reason...
          it seemed important to save this
          one. (Beat) So I go on. "Know
          you're a chain-smoker, help
          yourself," "We're not so very
          different you and I.."

He makes a vague "Etcetera" gesture, stares at...


THE EMPTY CHAIR

... something unsettling about it, as if somehow it is
acquiring the GHOSTLY PRESENCE OF KARLA.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
              (To the chair)
          Look, we've both spent our lives
          looking for the weaknesses in one
          another's systems. Don't you
          think it's time to recognise
          there is as little worth on your
          side as there is on mine?
                                                                        74.



      Silence. Smiley sits back, dropping the game.

                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
                Never said a word. Not one word.
                Next morning he got back on his
                plane, gave the pack of
                cigarettes back to me, untouched -
                this was a chain-smoker, mind -
                and flew off to what he presumed
                would be his death. He kept my
                lighter. It was a gift - "To
                George, from Ann. All my love."

      Guillam is still staring at the chair, a little awe-struck.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                That was Karla? And he flew back
                to die rather than give in?

                          SMILEY
                Yes. (Beat) And that's how I know
                he can be beaten. Because he's a
                fanatic. And the fanatic is
                always concealing a secret doubt.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                What did he look like?

                          SMILEY
                That's the thing. (Beat) I can't
                remember.

      He stands up, crosses to the window, embarrassed by what he
      has to say next.

                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
                After today, Peter you have to
                assume they're watching you. If
                there's anything you need tidied
                up... now's the time.

      Guillam stares at him, realising what he's talking about.


151   INT. GUILLAM'S FLAT - NIGHT                                 151

      Guillam and his boyfriend RICHARD sit at the table, Richard
      working his way through a stack of essays. Guillam stares
      at him.

                          RICHARD
                    (without looking up)
                Nearly done.

      He scores a red line down a piece of work.
                                                                        75.



                          RICHARD (CONT'D)
                    (to himself)
                For Godsakes... I think they're
                all sharing the same moronic
                brain.

      He notices the way Guillam is staring at him and his smile
      fades.

      LATER:

      RICHARD, bewildered and upset, is packing his belongings.
      He walks past Guillam, stops.

                          RICHARD (CONT'D)
                    (With dignity)
                If there's someone else, you can
                tell me. I'm a grown-up.

      Guillam doesn't say anything. Richard puts the flat keys on
      the side table and leaves.

      Guillam, stares after his one time lover, heart-broken.


152   EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - DAY                                 152

      Prideaux's BLUE ALVIS bumps and jolts towards us across the
      playing fields, an exhilarated ROACH at the wheel.

                          ROACH
                    (Braking)
                Time sir?

      Prideaux and the rest of the class stand at the "finishing
      line," but Prideaux is staring down to a line of beech-
      trees, where a MAN is walking. It's MENDEL.

                          PRIDEAUX
                    (Quietly)
                Got your specs on Jumbo?

                            ROACH
                Yes, sir.

                          PRIDEAUX
                Who's the fellow down there?

      Roach stares at the stranger eagerly.

                          ROACH
                    (Disappointed)
                Don't know sir.

                          PRIDEAUX
                Who is he? Beggarman? Thief? Why
                doesn't he look this way?
                          (MORE)
                                                                        76.

                          PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)
                Wouldn't you look if you saw a
                bunch of boys flogging a car
                around a field? Doesn't he like
                boys? Anyone sees him again, let
                me know. Don't hold with odd bods
                hanging about. Might steal the
                Alvis, which is...?

                          CLASS
                    (By rote)
                Best car in England!

      They dissolve into laughter, but Roach is still anxiously
      watching Prideaux, noting how his expression has darkened.

154   INT. CIRCUS - SCALPHUNTERS - POOL TABLE - DAY               154

      Belinda, the deb we met earlier, is doing up her blouse.
      She's teary and also a little excited that men are fighting
      over her.

                          BELINDA
                Stop it! Stop it!

      KASPAR has Guillam pinned against the wall and is punching
      him. Guillam accepts the blows with a bloody grin. Something
      of the school yard fight about it, as the other Scalphunters
      gather around, ostensibly to break it, up but clearly
      enjoying the distraction. One of them is trying to pull
      Kaspar off and, caught by a blow, joins in - the fight
      escalating as others join in the struggle.

                          KASPAR
                Keep your bloody hands off her!

      He kicks at Guillam, who falls. Belinda gives a shriek of
      alarm.

                          SCALPHUNTER
                Christ's sake, don't fight over a
                bit of skirt!

      Guillam lies on the floor taking another kick, but his face,
      turned to us, registers only relief. Job done.


155   EXT. CASINO - DAY                                           155

      Bright morning sunshine. Smiley and Guillam walk up
      concrete steps of a casino building - very modern,
      imposing.
                                                                       77.



                          MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                Haven't seen many of the boys and
                girls for a while, matter of
                fact.


156   INT. CASINO - CASINO FLOOR - DAY                           156

      Smiley, Guillam and the genial JERRY WESTERBY are sat at a
      blackjack table. The casino is empty, a cleaner vacuums in
      the background.

                          JERRY WESTERBY
                But that's the way it is, George,
                isn't it? When you're out, you're
                out. Too much of this stuff.

      He points to a drink on the table before him.

                          JERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D)
                    (An old joke between them)
                Too much wampum not good for
                braves. How.

                          SMILEY
                    (Obliging)
                How. (Beat) I need to talk to you
                about the night Jim Prideaux was
                killed, Jerry. You were duty
                officer, weren't you?

      Westerby looks at them both.

                          JERRY WESTERBY
                Yes. Control asked me to man the
                phones that night. Said someone was
                doing a special job for the
                service. He wanted someone from
                outside he could trust. If anything
                came in, I was to tell him and only
                him.


157   INT. CIRCUS - EVENING - PAST                               157

      Westerby walks down the corridor. We pass OFFICES - drawers
      pulled open, waste paper bins standing on desks - the end
      of day ritual.


158   INT. CIRCUS - DUTY OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT                   158

      Westerby is following a horse race on the radio. A dirty
      plate in front of him. He drinks from a can of beer.
                                                                        78.



159   INT. CIRCUS - DUTY OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT                    159

      Westerby is asleep. The Circus is deathly quiet, nothing
      stirring. Then...

      A PHONE BEGINS TO RING.


160   INT. CIRCUS - CONTROL'S OFFICE - NIGHT                      160

      Control sits surrounded by files. A dim green lamp on his
      desk the only illumination. He looks ill, tense with
      waiting. Cigarette stubs piled in the ashtray.

      He listens to the solitary PHONE below him in the building.
      Then it is joined by a SECOND. Then a THIRD...

      Control listens, nerves stretched to their limit. From just
      outside - the sound of someone running up the wooden
      staircase. A knock.

                          JERRY WESTERBY
                    (Entering)
                Been a bit of a panic, sir.

      Control raises his head.

                          JERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D)
                From the FO resident clerk... A
                Hungarian news bulletin, sir.
                (Reading) British spy, work-name
                Ellis, travelling with false
                Hungarian papers, has attempted
                to kidnap an unnamed Hungarian
                general in Budapest. He's been
                shot, other arrests imminent...

      Control stares at him, stands unsteadily, begins to put on
      his coat.

                          JERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D)
                Can I have a brief, please? Sir?
                Do you want me to deny it?

      Controls stares at him, lost.

                          JERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D)
                I have to have a brief sir?


161   INT. CIRCUS - DUTY OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT                    161

      Westerby is on the phone.

                          JERRY WESTERBY
                Ann? I'm sorry to bother you. Is
                George back yet?
                                                                     79.



162   INT. CASINO - CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT - PRESENT             162

      Westerby and Smiley sit opposite each other.

                          SMILEY
                You rang my house?

                          JERRY WESTERBY
                Just on the off chance you were
                back from Berlin.

                          SMILEY
                What did you say?

                          JERRY WESTERBY
                Just that there'd been a bit of a
                crisis. She said you weren't back
                yet. That was it.

                           SMILEY
                Go on.

                          JERRY WESTERBY
                All hell broke loose - military
                yelling about Hungarian tank
                movements on the border, Lacon
                and the Minister baying at the
                door. Thank Christ Bill Haydon
                turned up when he did.


163   INT. CIRCUS - NIGHT - PAST                               163

      PUSHING BILL HAYDON as he walks up the corridor towards the
      duty room, cutting a swathe through the people gathered
      outside.

                           BILL HAYDON
                Get out.

      The room clears.

      Bill sits down. He pulls out all the phone lines, decisive,
      taking charge. Kicks the door shut.

                           BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)
                Tell me.

                          JERRY WESTERBY
                I tried to get hold of you...

                          BILL HAYDON
                I just picked up half a story on
                the ticker-tape at my club...
                Tell me.

                          JERRY WESTERBY
                Jim Prideaux's been shot.
                                                                     80.



      Haydon goes white.

                          HAYDON
                Get me the Hungarian Embassy.

                           JERRY WESTERBY
                    (With relief)
                Yes sir...

      LATER:

      Haydon is on the phones.

                          BILL HAYDON
                You go and tell your Masters what
                will happen if one hair on Jim
                Prideaux's head is damaged...

      He covers the receiver, turns to Westerby.

                          BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)
                Get Esterhase on the phone. Tell
                him to pull in the Hungarian
                agents, anyone we're onto. Tell him
                to get down to the London School of
                Economics, sandbag some bloody
                students and put them on ice at
                Sarratt.

      LATER:

      Westerby watches Haydon on the phone from the door. Haydon
      listens to a voice for a moment, then hangs up. He stands,
      his back to Westerby.

                          JERRY WESTERBY
                Any more news on him?

      Haydon doesn't turn around, head bowed.

                          JERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D)
                Bill? (Beat) Oh God, is he...?

      For a moment it looks like Haydon won't answer but then he
      seems to master his emotions.

                          BILL HAYDON
                We need to go to his flat. Clear
                out anything linked.


164   INT. PRIDEAUX'S FLAT - NIGHT                             164

      Haydon walks around the neat rooms. A bike up on the wall,
      a pair of muddy climbing boots on a newspaper, waiting to
      be cleaned. Haydon walks past a shelf - photographs and
      books. He stops, picks up an unframed black and white snap
      from the shelf. It's a picture of HIMSELF.
                                                                        81.



      Haydon stands with his back to us, possibly crying. Westerby
      turns thoughtfully away.

167   INT. LONDON - WIMPY - NIGHT                                 167

      Smiley and Guillam sit eating side by side at a bar, Smiley
      examining the hamburger - his first - doubtfully. Guillam
      is thinking about what he's just been told.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Haydon heard the news at his
                club?

      Smiley is distant...

                          SMILEY
                The Saville.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                At one-thirty? The ticker-tape
                wouldn't be running.

      Guillam sits, mind racing.

                          PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D)
                So how did he know? Oh Jesus,
                George...

                             SMILEY
                Peter...

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Jesus Christ. Haydon? How could
                he have known?

                          SMILEY
                It's not him, Peter.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Then how did he know?

                          SMILEY
                    (gently)
                Because he was at my house that
                night. With Ann.

      Guillam doesn't know what to say. They sit in a hideously
      awkward silence.
                                                                         82.



                           SMILEY (CONT'D)
                     (of the Hamburger)
                 I quite like this.


167A   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT - PAST            167A

       The phone on the nightstand starts to ring. A woman's hand
       reaches into frame and picks it up.

                            WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                 Hello?
                     (beat)
                 Oh hello Jerry. No I'm afraid
                 George isn't back yet.

       In the bed beside her we see Bill Haydon.


168    EXT. LONDON STREETS - NIGHT                                 168

       A black Cab pulls up at the lights. Another black cab pulls
       alongside it. The two drivers acknowledge each other,
       chatting as the lights change to RED, but in no hurry to
       move.

       An impatient woman passenger flicks a look at the passenger
       in the opposite cab, wanting to share this moment of
       passenger outrage.

       We see ALLELINE'S profile staring stonily ahead.

       We follow his cab as it peels off into a FAMILIAR street,
       driving towards the house where we met Polyakov.


169    EXT. HAMPSTEAD PONDS - DAY                                  169

       Smiley slips into the water. It's late afternoon. Very
       still and calm. Very few swimmers. Smiley's head breaks the
       surface, dips in, breaks the surface...


170    EXT. HAMPSTEAD PONDS - DAY                                  170

       Smiley sits on a platform with his back to us, drying off
       from his swim, looking out over the water. A MAN'S HEAD
       appears, swimming up to the platform through the reeds. An
       old QUEEN, his face almost purple with the cold. He clings
       to the edge of the platform for a moment.

                           OLD MAN
                 Just in case it's of interest,
                 dear. We are observed. Old Filth
                 in the bushes. Not very subtle
                 but there you are...
                                                                        83.



      He swims away. The wind lifts up a little, rustling the
      trees and bushes around the pond. We stay on Smiley,
      watched and alone.

174   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   174

      Smiley walks into his hallway, picks up the MAIL piled on
      the floor. He crosses to the drawing room, still looking at
      the mail.

      The door is a little ajar and through the opening we catch
      a FLASH of movement in the room beyond - a COUPLE in a
      passionate embrace, glimpsed for a moment before they
      disappear out of sight. We can hear what may be their love-
      making. And a RECORD IS PLAYING. The same CHARLIE RICH
      track Smiley reacted to in the Islay Hotel.

      Smiley stares at the mail in his hand as if unwilling to
      look up.

      He pushes open the door and moves into...


175   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   175

      ... which is EMPTY. He sits in an armchair, starts opening
      some letters.

      A FIGURE walks past Smiley abruptly. Smiley doesn't look
      up.

                          BILL HAYDON (O.S.)
                Good flight?

      Smiley looks up.

      BILL HAYDON sits in the armchair opposite in shirt and
      trousers, SOCKS, NO SHOES. He sips a cup of tea. No sense
      of having been caught in an act of adultery.


176   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY - PAST                            176

      BACK ON SMILEY

      ... who is now wearing a raincoat and we realise we are in
      fractured memories of...
                                                                         84.



       THE PAST

                            SMILEY
                  Yes. Pleasant enough.

                            BILL HAYDON
                  I was just passing, thought I'd
                  call in. Ann was in bed but she
                  insisted on getting up. She said
                  she'll be down in a minute.

       Smiley glances at a half-wrapped oil painting lying against
       a chair.

                            BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)
                  That's what I'm dropping off.


177    INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  177

       Smiley stands in front of the muddy-looking abstract
       painting we saw earlier. It's now on the wall.

                            BILL HAYDON (O.S.)
                  Awful daub really but Ann
                  expressed a liking... What's
                  keeping her?

       We hold on Smiley but hear Haydon leave the room, a
       WHISPERED CONFERENCE in the hall between Haydon and Ann.

       P.O.V. - FROM THE DOOR - George with his back to us, staring
       fixedly at the picture, listening to the whispers behind his
       back.

178A   INT. PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - EVENING                          178A

       Prideaux lies on his bed. There is a tap at the door.

                            ROACH (O.S.)
                  Sir?

                            JIM PRIDEAUX
                  Come in, Roach.

       Roach walks in.

                             JIM PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)
                  Thought you were in sick bay? What
                  are you...

       He stops, seeing the anxiety on the boy's face.
                                                                        85.



                          JIM PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)
                What is it, Jumbo?

                          ROACH
                Sir there's a stranger parked down
                on the road. He's just sitting
                there.

      He dissolves into tears. Prideaux crouches beside him.

                          PRIDEAUX
                    (Gently)
                It's alright, old fella. Don't cry.
                Nobody ever watched like you, did
                they? Off you go, now.

                          ROACH
                Are you going to have to leave?

      Prideaux stares at him.

                          JIM PRIDEAUX
                I'll be fine. You get back to bed.

      Roach wipes his eyes and leaves. As soon as the door is
      closed Prideaux crawls under the little chest of drawers,
      grimacing with pain, working an arm further in...

      There is a FAINT SOUND - SOMEONE ON THE STEPS OUTSIDE.

      With a final effort Prideaux rips his RIFLE free from its
      hiding place, still trailing tape, and rolls to face the
      door, gun in hand. Silence. Then...

      A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. Prideaux aims the gun...

      The door opens...


179   OMITTED                                                     179


180   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - NIGHT - PAST                          180

      ... to reveal Control peering out at us. He steps aside and
      allows a PRE-INJURY Prideaux to enter.


181   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - NIGHT                                 181

      The flat Smiley visited. Control leads Prideaux into the
      same room - the green armchair, surrounded by mounds of
      files and papers, over-flowing ashtrays, the detritus of an
      obsession. The FIVE PHOTOGRAPHS of FACES fixed to the CHESS
      PIECES before him.

      Control, a walking corpse, lowers himself into the
      armchair, motions Prideaux to take another seat.
                                                            86.



                    CONTROL
          You weren't followed?

Prideaux sits, presuming the question is rhetorical.

                    CONTROL (CONT'D)
          Trust no-one, Jim. Especially not
          in the main stream. What
          Hungarian identities do you still
          have running?

                    PRIDEAUX
          Andras Benedek, Hungarian
          journalist based in Paris.

Control nods thoughtfully. Then...

                    CONTROL
          If you're caught, you keep me out
          of it. You were acting alone, bit
          of Private Enterprise.
          Understood?

Prideaux watches him, very still.

                    CONTROL (CONT'D)
          I've had an offer of service. A
          Hungarian General. Wants to come
          over. I want you to meet him. He
          has information I need, Jim.

                    PRIDEAUX
          What information?

                    CONTROL
          Rocketry. Ballistics. Bit of
          politics.

Something in his manner alerts Prideaux.

                       PRIDEAUX
          What else?

                     CONTROL
              (Beat)
          Treasure. He has treasure. The
          name of the Mole Moscow Centre
          has planted at the top of the
          Circus.

Prideaux's face doesn't change, but he's wondering if the
rumours could be true and Control really has gone mad.

                    CONTROL (CONT'D)
          There's a rotten apple Jim and we
          have to find it.

Laboriously he leans forward to the CHESS SET.
                                                                           87.



                            CONTROL (CONT'D)
                I'm   so close I can almost feel
                his   heart beating. I know it's
                one   of five men. All I want from
                you   is one word.

      He points to the PHOTOGRAPH of PERCY ALLELINE.

                          CONTROL (CONT'D)
                Alleline - Tinker. (Points at the
                next photo) Haydon - Tailor.
                Bland - Soldier. We drop Sailor,
                it's too close to Tailor.
                (Pointing at next photo)
                Esterhase - Poorman.


182   INT. PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - NIGHT - PRESENT                      182

      Prideaux sits with his visitor - Smiley -      recalling the
      meeting. He's drinking vodka.

                          SMILEY
                Which means I was...?

                          PRIDEAUX
                You were Beggarman.

      Smiley nods. Just a flicker of the eyes shows us that this
      is painful for him to hear.

                          SMILEY
                What did you make of it, Jim?
                Control's theory?

                          PRIDEAUX
                    (Stiff)
                I thought it was madness. To
                think any one of you could have
                been a traitor... madness.

      Smiley is watching him intently - sure he's hiding
      something.

                          SMILEY
                But still you went? Risking your
                life for a mission you thought
                was absurd? Why?

      Prideaux doesn't answer.

                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
                Perhaps some part of you wanted to
                know if Control was right? Wanted
                to know if there was a Mole, who it
                might be?

      Prideaux shoots him a dangerous look.
                                                                        88.



                              PRIDEAUX
                       (Hard)
                   I went because Control asked me to
                   go. It's called doing one's duty.


183   INT. BUDAPEST - TRAIN STATION - DAY - PAST                  183

      Prideaux climbs off his train and walks down the platform
      towards us. He pauses for a moment, drawing a Hungarian
      newspaper from his pocket. As he does so he glances at the
      other passengers walking past him. TWO WOMEN and a MAN, all
      apparently travelling alone, the SHOES they're wearing -
      BROWN SUEDE BOOTS, FUR LINED BLACK PLASTIC BOOTS and the
      man - a pair of BLACK GALOSHES.

      Prideaux walks on, tapping the paper against his leg.


184   INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY                               184

      The scene from the opening of the film. The Waiter puts
      down Prideaux's plate, a drop of sweat from his forehead
      hitting the table. He looks at the droplet, fakes a smile
      for the Magyar, looks after the Waiter, scans the floor
      around him...

      HIS P.O.V. - There it is - one of the women is wearing the
      BLACK PLASTIC BOOTS. Her coat is different and she's
      wearing a fur hat now - but the shoes are the one thing the
      surveillance agents don't have time to change.

      Prideaux glances up at the apartment windows above, sees
      the old woman, starts to rise... as we CUT TO:

      The SHOT -

      ... punching into his back, Prideaux falling forward... as
      we CUT TO:


      PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V.

      Those shoes again, stepping in the water and blood on the
      floor, passing us at eye-level. Grouping and regrouping as
      the operation comes to an end. The noise in the background
      comes to us muted and very faint. Faintly, a baby is
      crying, an ambulance siren is wailing.

      Hands appear and we are rolled onto a stretcher and lifted
      up to chest level where we seem to FLOAT past the faces of
      the MAGYAR and the other Officers, smoking cigarettes by
      the doors, and out towards the open doors of a waiting
      ambulance.
                                                                        89.



185   INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY                               185

      We are slid into the back of the ambulance as though into
      the drawers of a morgue. And snap to BLACK.


186   INT. LUBYANKA PRISON - CELL - DAY                           186

      We are looking at the back of Prideaux's head, hair damp
      with sweat, shoulders trembling.

      We PULL OUT and find Prideaux, a filthy dressing covering
      the wound on his back. The cell he is in has filthy,
      heavily padded walls, like a straitjacket. From a speaker
      in the ceiling comes a maddening jagged drone. Lights blaze
      down...

                          SMILEY (V.O.)
                What did you tell them?


187   INT. LUBYANKA PRISON - CORRIDOR - DAY                       187

      Prideaux, in too much pain to walk, is being dragged down a
      brightly lit corridor towards an INTERROGATION ROOM at the
      far end.

      He is taken inside, the door closed behind him.

                          PRIDEAUX (V.O.)
                Everything.


188   INT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT         188

      Smiley stands staring at the OWL Prideaux killed, which is
      now stuffed, keeping guard from the top of a bookshelf.
      Prideaux sits at a desk drinking the vodka.

                          PRIDEAUX
                I held on as long as I could, to
                give everyone else time to get
                the hell out of there. (Beat) Did
                they?

      Smiley seems to have been thinking about something else,
      looks at him, puzzled.

                          PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)
                My networks in Hungary. Did they
                get out?

                           SMILEY
                    (Beat)
                No. They were blown. The story is
                you blew them to save your own
                skin.
                                                             90.



Prideaux nods, makes an odd gesture as if he's about to
rise, but doesn't move. His expression hasn't changed, but
inside him something has just been decided.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          What was your last line of
          defence?

                    PRIDEAUX
          The Mole. Control's crazy theory.
          I was going to bury that so deep,
          they'd never get it out of me.
          Which was a joke.

                       SMILEY
          Why?

                    PRIDEAUX
          Because they already knew. They
          wanted to know how far Control
          had got in his investigation.

                       SMILEY
          What else?

                    PRIDEAUX
          Circus gossip. Was Percy's wife
          still drinking, who was Bland
          screwing in the office. That sort
          of thing.

                    SMILEY
          Did they ask about me at all?

                    PRIDEAUX
          One of them did.

Smiley becomes very still.

                    SMILEY
          What did he say about me?

                    PRIDEAUX
          He had a cigarette lighter. Kept
          flashing it round for me to see.
          Showed me the inscription.
          "To George, from Ann. All my
          love." He reckoned after Bill's
          fling with her, she might want to
          change the inscription.

Smiley doesn't flicker.

                     PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)
              (Still looking to the
               side)
          I told him to go to hell.
                     (MORE)
                                                                        91.

                          PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)
                If they had one man like Bill
                Haydon they could call it set and
                match!

                          SMILEY
                    (Beat, quietly)
                That was well said.

      They sit in silence for a moment. Smiley buttons his coat,
      finished here.

                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
                Try and put it all behind you, Jim.

      He makes to leave.

                          PRIDEAUX
                He gave me a cigarette.

      Prideaux looks down at his hands.

                           SMILEY
                Jim?

      Prideaux still doesn't look up.

                          PRIDEAUX
                I thought it was my last one.

192   INT. LUBYANKA PRISON - CELL - DAY - PAST                    192

      A concrete bunker of a room. Prideaux is standing in a slab
      of watery sunshine that falls from a sky-light above. He's
      smoking, trying to control the tremble in his hand.

      PRIDEAUX P.O.V. - The patch of sunshine only extends a few
      yards in front of him. The rest of the room is in granite
      shadow. The sense of other people watching from the
      shadows. The sound of a door opening and someone being led
      in.

      A woman walks across the dark room and into the slab of
      light, blinking as she does so.

      It's IRINA.

      Her hair is loose and dishevelled about her face. A man's
      voice comes from further back in the darkness...
                                                                        92.



                          MAN'S VOICE
                    (Russian accent)
                Do you know this woman?

      Prideaux looks at her. Frowns. Another voice murmurs in
      Russian. Irina pins her hair up in the way we saw before.

                          PRIDEAUX
                I don't know her.

      She looks at Prideaux and gives a small polite smile, as
      though good manners are going to save her.

                          IRINA
                I...

      A GUARD steps out of the shadows and SHOOTS her in the
      head, the shot THUNDEROUS in the room. It's horribly
      unexpected, and Prideaux jerks backward, bewildered and
      appalled.

                          MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                Tell Percy Alleline what we did.


193   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - GUILLAM'S CAR - NIGHT - PRESENT          193


      P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSCREEN

      ... rain lashes down, obscuring our view.

                          PRIDEAUX (V.O.)
                Do you know who she was?

                           SMILEY (V.O.)
                    (Cold)
                Nobody you need concern yourself
                with. An unfortunate...

      REVERSE - we see Guillam and Smiley are sitting in the
      parked car in the rain.

                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
                He said when he got out, when he
                was being debriefed at the
                Nursery, he had a visitor.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Who?

                          SMILEY
                Toby Esterhase.
                                                                       93.



194   EXT. SARRATT - DAY - PAST                                  194

      ... Prideaux stands watching a small, dapper figure
      crossing the grounds towards him - TOBY ESTERHASE. A man
      who's come up in the world.


195   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - GUILLAM'S CAR - NIGHT - PRESENT         195

                          SMILEY
                He gave him a thousand pounds.
                Told him he was dead now and
                couldn't come back. Had to become
                a Lotus Eater - forget everything
                that happened - Control's theory,
                Tinker, Tailor... all of it.

      Guillam stares at him, ALERT.

                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
                Yes, that's what I thought. How
                on earth did Esterhase hear about
                "Tinker, Tailor?"


196   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - NIGHT                                   196

      Smiley gets out of the car, into the rain. Looks around
      him, uneasy.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                You alright?

                          SMILEY
                Will you watch my back, Peter?
                Look out for a solo. Just a
                feeling I've had.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Yes, George. I'll watch.

      Guillam watches as Smiley heads off into the gloom.


197   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - NIGHT                   197

      Smiley stares at the CHESS BOARD - a complex pattern of
      related figures.

      He turns back to the tape-deck, puts the headphones on,
      presses play:

                          SMILEY (O.S.)
                    (Over headphones)
                What exactly did Irina say?
                                                                     94.



                           RICKI TARR
                    (Over headphones)
                She said there was a General,
                work-name Polyakov who was
                stationed in London. And that
                Polyakov's real job was to
                service the mole. He meets him
                regularly and takes back
                information the Mole gives him
                for Karla.

      Smiley presses STOP. He presses RE-WIND, watches the tape
      spool BACKWARDS. He goes too far, presses FAST-FORWARD,
      watches the tape REVERSE DIRECTION. And, at this moment, we
      can tell from his expression, a piece of the jig-saw falls
      into place.

199   INT. MINISTERIAL MEETING ROOM - DAY                      199

      Lacon and Smiley are meeting with the MINISTER.

                          MINISTER
                This meeting is not taking place.
                Is that clear?

                          SMILEY
                Perfectly, Minister. (Beat) There
                is a house, somewhere in this
                city, where Alleline and the
                others meet Witchcraft's London
                representative. I need the
                address of that house.

                          MINISTER
                I don't know what you're talking
                about.

      Smiley stares at him.

                          MINISTER (CONT'D (CONT'D)
                I don't know the address. And I
                fail to see the... I thought
                Lacon had made it clear to you,
                keep your nose bloody-well out of
                Witchcraft's business!

                          SMILEY
                    (Calmly)
                It's Lacon's advice I'm
                following. (To Lacon) You told me
                to follow in Control's footsteps.
                                                            95.



                    MINISTER
              (Snapping)
          Well, I wouldn't consider that
          sound advice, after the bloody
          mess Control left us with. It's
          taken Alleline - and, if I may
          say so, myself - this long to get
          us back into the race.

                    SMILEY
          I'm glad you take some of the
          credit.

Lacon glances sharply at Smiley - there's something
different about him, his tone...

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          The man Alleline and the others
          meet is called Polyakov. You
          believe his role is to bring
          information from Witchcraft to
          you. His real role is to receive
          information from the Mole to take
          back to Karla.

He has the Minister's full attention now. A long silence.

                    MINISTER
          That's... that's not possible.

                    SMILEY
          Made possible. By you. When he
          steals our secrets he does it
          under the very nose of the
          Circus, in the house which you
          persuaded the treasury to pay
          for. I'm sure you'll be able to
          take full credit for that.

                    MINISTER
              (Appalled)
          Witchcraft's intelligence is
          genuine! It's been gold!

                    SMILEY
          Just enough glitter, amongst the
          chicken-feed. Control didn't
          believe in miracles and he didn't
          believe in Witchcraft. But you
          were lazy and you were greedy and
          so you hounded him out of the
          Circus and you let Karla in.

His voice is still calm, but it's clear what's different
now. There's a quiet fury in him. The Minister is ashen.
                                                                  96.



                          MINISTER
                Oh God... We can't be made to
                look like fucking fools again!
                Forget Europe, if we have the
                black men getting to hear about
                this on Walla-Wallah News! What
                if we find the Mole and we move
                him sideways, some department
                where he can't do any harm? Is
                the Kremlin likely to boast about
                this?

                          LACON
                Not in their interests sir. They
                need the Enemy to look like a
                threat...

                          MINISTER
                Well, tell them to play the game.
                We don't go crowing about their
                fuck-ups!

      In their panic, both men are addressing each other,
      momentarily forgetting Smiley.

                          SMILEY
                    (Suddenly)
                We are not the prize. We're the
                bait.

      They turn to him.

                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
                You've opened negotiations to
                exchange intelligence with the
                Americans. What they tell the
                Circus, they'll be telling the
                Kremlin. Witchcraft's
                information, the "gold" Karla let
                you have? It wasn't to lure you.
                It was to lure the Americans.
                Now, do you want to take credit
                for that?

      Lacon and the Minister stare at Smiley.

                          MINISTER
                What can we do?

                          SMILEY
                We have one thing the Mole wants.

201   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY                                   201

      CLOSE on a belligerent Tarr, confidence regained.

                             RICKI TARR
                If I go...

                          PETER GUILLAM
                You'll go...

                          RICKI TARR
                ... I want your word you'll get
                Irina back. Don't care who you
                have to trade. I want a family.
                Don't wanna end up like you
                lot...

      He looks at Smiley, then he gives Guillam a knowing look,
      as though deliberately provoking him.

      Guillam absorbs the slur but his eyes are hard.

                          RICKI TARR (CONT'D)
                We're gonna live in Paris out of
                your hair. You'll get her back?

      Again a flash of the coldness in Smiley.

                           SMILEY
                    (Beat)
                I'll do my utmost, Ricki.

      The doors open to reveal TOBY ESTERHASE, chatting to a

      Guillam is driving. The radio is on. The car pulls up on
      the roadside and two people climb in the back. It's Smiley
      and Fawn. Guillam speeds off.

      Nobody speaks. Esterhase sits stiff, mind-whirring,
      uncomfortably aware of Fawn's unsettling presence behind
      him.
                                                                        98.

      ... as he stumbles through the muddy airfield. A vast,
      empty space all around. Toby starts to turn, but...

                          SMILEY (O.S.)
                Keep walking please.

      Toby stumbles on.

                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
                I want to talk about loyalty
                Toby. Control recruited you when
                you were trying to escape from
                Hungary didn't he? A wanted man.
                Saved you from a KGB bullet,
                didn't he? And yet, when the time
                came, when it came to picking
                sides between him and Alleline,
                you didn't hesitate?
                Understandable perhaps, with your
                war experience. You've survived
                this long, I suppose, because of
                your ability to change sides,
                serve any Master?

      Faintly we hear the low drone of an approaching engine.
      Esterhase scans the horizon, locks on the black speck in the
      sky - an aircraft flying towards them. Esterhase watches the
      approach with mounting anxiety.

                          TOBY ESTERHASE
                What... what's this about George?

                          SMILEY
                It's about which Master you've
                been serving, Toby.

      hands in the frame belong to Esterhase. He checks the

                Intelligence has been leaked,

                           SMILEY
                 The files were delivered to a

      Esterhase can't tear his eyes away from the propeller plane
      descending onto the runway ahead of them.

                          TOBY ESTERHASE
                Things aren't always what they
                seem. You know that George.
                Moscow thinks Polyakov's working
                for them, so, every now and then
                we give him the odd file to take
                back to them, just chicken-feed,
                keep his bosses happy. But
                Polyakov's our Joe, part of a big
                operation...

                          SMILEY
                Operation Witchcraft? Yes, I
                know.

      Esterhase stops, turns to look at Smiley.

                Why are we here? Why are we...?

      Guillam gives him a sudden VIOLENT SHOVE in the back.
      Esterhase straightens himself, runs a palm through his
      hair, real fear on his face now.

                          TOBY ESTERHASE (CONT'D)
                I don't... I don't deserve this.

                To get rid of Connie Sachs?
                Westerby?

                          TOBY ESTERHASE
                Bland or Haydon. I don't
                remember. One of them. Maybe
                Percy. I don't know who.

                          SMILEY
                You're just the messenger?
                Running between them all.
                Anything to serve Witchcraft?

      Esterhase flinches again.
                                                                        101.



                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
                I know all about your secret
                source. And I know something you
                don't. I know who he is.(Beat)
                He's Karla.

      Esterhase turns to look at them in horror. Guillam pushes
      him again. The plane has taxied to a halt ahead of them.
      Unmarked. Something sinister about it.

214   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - DAY - PAST                 214

      ... in the London House, spools turning. We hear the
      familiar Click... Whir of Polyakov's camera...


215   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - DAY                        215

      Polyakov is photographing... nothing. The table in front of
      him is empty, the shooting just a pantomime for the
      microphone above. As he continues to shoot we see the
      Mystery man sitting across the table from him. He takes out
      a canister of developed film and passes it to Polyakov.

                          SMILEY (V.O.)
                One of you has been giving
                Polyakov the Crown Jewels.


216   EXT. ABANDONED AIRFIELD - DAY - PRESENT                     216

      ... standing on the airfield.

                          TOBY ESTERHASE
                I didn't know. I swear I...

                          SMILEY
                Are you still a wanted man, Toby?

      Toby looks back at the plane, almost hysterical.

                             TOBY ESTERHASE
                George...!

                          SMILEY
                You picked the wrong side, Toby.

                           TOBY ESTERHASE
                    (crying)
                George, you've got to believe me. I
                would never... I'm loyal, George.
                I'm loyal!

      Smiley watches him cry for a moment, his face impassive.
                                                                       102.



                          SMILEY
                Give me the address. Where do you
                meet Polyakov?


217   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY                                      217

      A terrace of flat-fronted nineteenth century houses one of
      them the house we have already visited.

      A CAR draws up before one of them and Smiley, Fawn and
      Guillam get out and head for the front door.


218   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR                             218

      The men are fanning out, Fawn and Guillam heading into the
      kitchen. Smiley walks upstairs, dogged by the HOUSEKEEPER -
      MRS McCRAIG - not at all happy with the invasion.

                          SMILEY
                What are the safety signals?

                          MRS MCCRAIG
                There's an air duct. Open and
                all's well. Closed and you're not
                to enter.


219   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - DAY                       219

      They enter the EMPTY ROOM.

                          SMILEY
                Where is the mike, Mrs McCraig?

      She points at the candelabra.

                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
                And what's the procedure?

                          MRS MCCRAIG
                Whenever the gentlemen are
                meeting I record the session. The
                tapes are sent back to the
                Circus.

      From downstairs come the crash of furniture being moved,
      rooms searched.

                          MRS MCCRAIG (CONT'D)
                What are they doing? They
                shouldn't be moving things!

      The authority in Smiley's voice stops her.
                                                                        103.



                          SMILEY
                If you're at all worried you can
                call Lacon from the basement
                phone. Let's try the tape
                recorder shall we?

      CLOSE ON TAPE RECORDER   - SPOOLS SLOWLY REVOLVING

      Over the RECORDER we can hear GUILLAM'S VOICE reciting
      something from childhood, from the room above.

                          PETER GUILLAM (O.S.)
                The boy stood on the burning deck
                whence all but he had fled. The
                flame that lit the battles wreck,
                shone round him o'er the dead...

      Smiley is listening.

                          PETER GUILLAM'S VOICE
                ... Yet beautiful and bright he
                stood...


221   EXT. PARIS - STREET - EVENING                               221

      Establishing shot of a street in Paris.

      A squat Yorkshireman - MACKELVORE - walks out of a nearby
      restaurant and gets into a car.

      Out of nowhere Tarr suddenly appears, climbing into the
      passenger side, ramming a gun into his side.


222   INT. PARIS - APARTMENT - PARIS RESIDENCY - NIGHT            222

      Mackelvore leads Tarr into a grand but dilapidated
      apartment. An elderly FRENCHMAN - ex-Resistance - looks up
      from his evening meal as the two pass.

                          MACKLEVORE
                    (In French)
                Guest from London Station, Monsieur
                Fourcade.

      The Frenchman grunts a greeting, turns back to his supper.

                          MACKELVORE
                    (as they walk on)
                The whole service is looking for
                you, Ricki. They'll skin you
                alive if they find you.
                                                                       104.



                          RICKI TARR
                    (mildly)
                Maybe I want them to find me.

      Mackelvore frowns. They reach a door which he opens to
      reveal a STEEL DOOR beyond. He presses a bell and a hatch
      in the door slides open and a young man's face appears.
      This is BEN. He slides open a bolt, a double lock, and lets
      them into a ...


223   INT. PARIS - CYPHER ROOM - NIGHT                           223

                          MACKELVORE
                You can go home now, Ben. Leave
                the books where they are and put
                the keys into the machines. I'll
                be talking to London presently
                under my own steam.

                             BEN
                Okay boss.

      Tarr takes out his gun.

                           RICKI TARR
                    (Flat)
                Ben stays here.


224   INT. PARIS - CYPHER ROOM - NIGHT                           224

      Tarr stands over Mackelvore, who is sending a message to
      the Circus.

                          RICKI TARR
                    (dictating)
                Ricki Tarr claims to have further
                information vital to the
                safeguarding of the Circus.


225   INT. LONDON - TAILOR'S SHOP NEAR CIRCUS - NIGHT            225

      A dark workroom. WE TRACK through a crowd of TAILORS
      DUMMIES.

      Some of the dummies are draped in clothes, some just shapes
      in the darkness. As though we are moving through A ROOM
      FULL OF SPIES.

      By a great domed window, occasionally washed with yellow
      from the traffic outside, we find MENDEL, his back to us
      staring out.
                                                                        105.



      MENDEL'S P.O.V. - THE CIRCUS ACROSS THE ROAD.

      A taxi pulls up a few yards away from the circus doors. We
      see a man clamber out. It's Percy Alleline.

                          MENDEL
                    (into phone)
                Tinker...


226   INT. SAFE HOUSE - LISTENING ROOM - NIGHT                    226

      Smiley sits on an armchair, lit by a harsh over-head light.

                          SMILEY
                    (into phone)
                How's he look?

                            MENDEL (O.S.)
                Busy.

      Smiley puts the receiver on the arm of the chair, takes off
      his shoes and in his stocking feet crosses the room. As he
      does so he spools out a WASHING LINE, tying it to the far
      door knob.


227   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - TOW PATH - NIGHT                          227

      Guillam, waits on the tow-path looking back at the house.

      Someone, presumably Smiley, is moving through the house,
      turning the lights off until it is in complete darkness.

                            MENDEL (O.S.)
                Tailor...

      A torch light flashes once from a downstairs window.

                          MENDEL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                Here comes Soldier...


228   INT. SAFE HOUSE - LISTENING ROOM - NIGHT                    228

      Smiley sits in the darkness holding the phone to his ear.

                          MENDEL (O.S.)
                Full house.


229   INT. PARIS - CYPHER ROOM - NIGHT                            229

      The three men stand over the silent cypher machine. Tarr's
      gun rammed into his belt. Tarr is almost glittering with
      nerves. Then the machine clatters into life.
                                                                       106.



                          RICKI TARR
                Read it aloud.

      Ben starts to read, his high, rather imperious schoolboy
      voice carries over the next few shots...

                          BEN
                Personal for Tarr from
                Alleline...


230   INT. CIRCUS - ARCHIVE LIFT - NIGHT                         230

      A shot of the archive room, of the lift full of secrets
      slowly being lowered into the ground.

                          BEN (V.O.)
                ... require clarification before
                meeting your request...

      ON THE DOOR OF THE WAR-ROOM resolutely closed, a slither of
      light burning beneath it.


231   INT. TAILORS SHOP - NIGHT                                  231

      The tailors dummies standing to attention, as alert as
      Mendel watching from the window, phone to mouth.

                          BEN (O.S.)
                ... Quote information vital to
                safeguarding of the Circus
                unquote does not qualify...


232   INT. PARIS - CYPHER ROOM - NIGHT                           232

      Tarr has begun to laugh, gripped by a weird hilarity.    Ben
      reads even faster.

                          BEN
                ... send further information.

                          RICKI TARR
                That's the way Percy boy! You
                keep stalling. I better warn you
                Ben, there's some lousy people in
                this outfit. Don't trust a
                fucking one of them.


233   INT. SAFE HOUSE - LISTENING ROOM - NIGHT                   233

      Smiley sits in the BLACKNESS.
                                                                        107.



      SMILEY'S P.O.V.

      The washing line extends ahead of him, glowing faintly
      white in the darkness.

      The tinny sound of Mendel's voice comes from the receiver
      beside him...

                          MENDEL (O.S.)
                Mister Smiley...

      Smiley picks up the receiver.

                          SMILEY
                I'm here, Mendel.

                          MENDEL (O.S.)
                One's gone.

      Smiley puts the receiver back on the armchair. He goes to
      the window in his stockinged feet.


234   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - TOW PATH - NIGHT                          234

      Guillam, nerves taut, sees three long flashes. The mole is
      coming.


235   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT                                     235

      A long silent look at the dark house. Then the star of
      light spilling into the darkness from the air vent.


236   INT. SAFE HOUSE - LISTENING ROOM - NIGHT                    236

      Smiley, calm and contained, hears the sound of a CAB
      drawing up outside.

      A pair of footsteps on the path.

      Scrape of a key in the door.

      A pale rim of light appears around the kitchen door.

      And outside the sound of a second cab drawing up.

      Someone else enters the house. Movement in the kitchen. Two
      men's voices start to speak in Russian.

      Smiley gets up, GUN in one hand, and guided by the line,
      makes his way through the darkness to the door of the
      kitchen, groping, rather like a blind man walking towards
      the light.
                                                                      108.



                          POLYAKOV (O.S.)
                    (In Russian)
                What is your cover story in case
                we are disturbed?

      The sound of ANOTHER voice answering in Russian from
      further back in the room.

      ON Smiley inching across the room.


237   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                    237

      The tape recorder working...

                          POLYAKOV (O.S.)
                    (on tape, in Russian)
                This can be salvaged. Tarr can be
                found and liquidated.


238   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - TOW PATH - NIGHT                        238

      Guillam waits. He turns, his nerves taut, searching the
      shadows for movement. For a moment he's certain he's being
      WATCHED.

      Then, from the house, the signal he's been waiting for.
      Three long flashes. Guillam starts to run.


239   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - TOW PATH - NIGHT                        239

      A nervous Lacon is waiting on a corner, Guillam runs past.

                             PETER GUILLAM
                He's here.

                          OLIVER LACON
                I won't have bloodshed. I want
                absolute calm!

      A cab appears and Mendel jumps out. Mendel and Lacon hurry
      towards the house, Guillam sprinting ahead.


240   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                    240


      CLOSE ON THE TAPE SPOOL - REVOLVING

      ... churning the SILENCE. The sounds of the house
      amplified. No one talking. Perhaps the faintest of coughs.


241   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT                                   241
                                                                       109.



      GUILLAM'S P.O.V.

      Racing towards the FRONT DOOR and bursting through, into
      the hallway and on up the stairs, taking them three at a
      time, bursting through into...


242   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                     242

      An oddly formal scene. POLYAKOV stands pipe in hand.

      Smiley sits in a chair, GUN in hand. Absurdly, still in his
      STOCKING FEET.

      And opposite him sits BILL HAYDON.

      They all turn to look at Guillam who stands panting in the
      doorway.


      ON GUILLAM

      ... as his nerves and excitement and any hope he might have
      had of a sense of victory DRAINS AWAY, leaving him with
      just an odd sense of embarrassment and shame.


243   EXT. SARRATT - DAY                                         243

      Nissan huts surround a cricket field. Two cadets run laps.

      Smiley walks towards one of the huts, stops as Alleline
      walks out. Alleline, a broken man, can barely look at him.
      With a nod he walks on.


244   EXT. SARRATT - NISSAN HUT - DAY                            244

      An unshaven, exhausted Haydon stands outside the Sarratt
      building in a small fenced enclosure. We see Smiley walking
      towards him. He's brought a box of cigarettes.



245   INT. SARRATT - DAY                                         245

      Haydon is weeping quietly but without emotion. Smiley
      offers Haydon the box of Cigarettes.

                             SMILEY
                   I was assured there would be no
                   coercion.

      Haydon waves it away. Smiley hands him a clean handkerchief.
                                                           110.



                    BILL HAYDON
          It's almost funny George. I know
          the Inquisitors little bag of
          tricks. I taught most of them.
          Don't mind the tears. Just a
          reaction. An over-reaction, if you
          like. Craddox says I'll be off in a
          few days. I keep thinking how I'm
          going to miss the cricket in
          Moscow.

He weeps again.

                    BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)
          I rather hoped you would do a
          little light house-keeping for me.

                       SMILEY
          If I can.

                    BILL HAYDON
          There's a girl...Would you give her
          some money for me? Give her a good
          cover story. If it helps tell her I
          love her. It's all here.

                       SMILEY
          Of course.

                    BILL HAYDON
          There's a boy too. Bung him a few
          quid to shut him up. Take it out of
          the reptile fund.

                    SMILEY
          I did have one or two questions.
          About Prideaux.

                    BILL HAYDON
          Damn it! I got him back, didn't
          I?

                    SMILEY
          Yes, yes you did. That was good
          of you. (Beat) I'm surprised
          Karla didn't shoot him. Or do you
          think he held back out of
          delicacy towards you?

No response. Smiley looks carefully at Haydon's profile.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          Did Prideaux come and see you
          before he left on his Hungarian
          mission?

                    BILL HAYDON
          Yes, as a matter of fact he did.
                                                               111.



                    SMILEY
          To say what?

Haydon stares at him. For the first time the tears seem
real. Guilt and grief. He looks down. A long pause.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
              (almost to himself)
          To warn you. Because he knew,
          deep down, it was you all along.

                    BILL HAYDON
          So did you.

Haydon stares out, lost in thought.

                    BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)
          I had to pick a side George. It was
          an aesthetic choice as much as a
          moral one. The West has grown so
          very ugly, don't you think?

Smiley doesn't answer. A moment of silence.

                    SMILEY
          Did Karla ever consider having you
          take over the Circus?

For a moment Haydon looks rattled.

                    BILL HAYDON
          I'm not his bloody office boy.

                    SMILEY
          What are you then?

Haydon turns to Smiley, a flash of hauteur.

                    BILL HAYDON
          I'm someone who made his mark.

Smiley watches him, feeling him shrink in stature before his
eyes. Haydon lights a cigarette.

                    SMILEY
              (Quietly)
          Is there anything you want me to
          pass on to Ann?

For a moment Haydon looks genuinely puzzled.

                    BILL HAYDON
          Oh, that was nothing personal,
          George, I hope you understand that?
          Karla said you were good, the one
          we had to worry about. But you do
          have a blind spot.
                    (MORE)
                                                                        112.

                          BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)
                He reckoned if I was known to be
                Ann's lover you wouldn't be able
                to see me straight. And he was
                right, up to a point.

                          SMILEY
                Up to a point.


246   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY                                   246

      The flat is now empty, cleared of Control's possessions.
      Smiley looks around, places a CHESS PIECE on the piano. We
      see the piece bears the name HAYDON.

                          SMILEY
                    (Quietly)
                "Tailor."

      He walks away.


247   EXT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   247

      George comes up his path, looking old and tired.


248   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   248

      He stops still inside his doorway. The little figure on the
      console table is in the wrong position. Smiley puts his
      hand on it, but doesn't right it, listening to something
      from somewhere inside the house. A faint movement.

      Through the HALF OPEN KITCHEN DOOR we catch a glimpse of a
      WOMAN beyond. ANN is back.

      Smiley stands with his back to us, still in his coat,
      staring through the door at his wife beyond. Something of a
      Vermeer in the image.

      He's absorbing the different atmosphere - home. Deciding
      whether to go in. Or not.

      Suddenly we hear MUSIC - JULIO IGLESIAS, singing a disco
      version of LA MER - very seventies.

      CUT TO:


249   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR PARTY - NIGHT - PAST              249

      The same lively Christmas PARTY at the Circus we saw
      earlier. BILL HAYDON, a little drunk and happy, works his
      way through the packed room, dancing to the Iglesias'
      track, a drink in each hand, a little tongue-in-cheek,
      singing along.
                                                                      113.



      HAYDON'S P.O.V.

      ... other members of the Circus glimpsed as we pass them -
      CONNIE SACHS, WESTERBY, BLAND, drunk, grinning at us. TOBY
      ESTERHASE talking to one of the SECRETARIES...

      The MUSIC continues as we find...

      CONTROL and SMILEY

      ...sitting a little apart, talking. Haydon is still working
      his way through the party...

      We PASS PERCY ALLELINE and his DRUNK WIFE. Alleline looking
      fretful and hoping no-one is noticing the scene she is
      making...

      Haydon grins at all his comrades, feeling fond of everyone,
      but heads on to his destination...

      PRIDEAUX sits watching him come with a drink towards him,
      shakes his head, but can't help but smile fondly at the idiot
      Haydon is prepared to make of himself...

254   EXT. SARRATT - EVENING - PRESENT                         254

      The music continues as we see two cadets are running on the
      circuit, their white t-shirts only just visible in the
      dark.

      Haydon sits on his bench, smoking, watching them flit by.
      He smiles to himself, remembering. He senses something,
      turns and looks back. Prideaux stands in the shadows behind
      him, some fifteen foot away. The two men stare at each
      other, then Haydon turns back to watch the runners.

      We HOLD CLOSE on his face as Prideaux approaches, the only
      sound the soft wind and his hushed footsteps growing loser.

      Finally...

                             BILL HAYDON
                       (Of the runners)
                   Just like us Jim. (Beat) Best
                   days.
                                                                          114.



        A rifle is placed on the side of his head - the same
        execution shot that we saw used on Irina - the force
        blowing him sideways out of the frame.

        As the music continues we...

                                                        CUT TO:


255     EXT. SARRATT - DAWN                                         255

        Frost on the grass. We find a CADET staring down at the
        corpse of Haydon leaning against the back of the bench,
        outlined in silver frost.

        The music ends.


256     INT. PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY                               256

        Prideaux sits on his bed. From outside - the sound of a
        football game. Someone taps on the door. Low. Taps again.
        Prideaux, coiled with grief and anger, suddenly gets up.


257     EXT. PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY                               257

        Roach stands in the doorway, carrying a gift - a boot-
        scrape made in woodwork.

                            ROACH
                  I made you something.

        Prideaux stares at the boot scrape.

                            PRIDEAUX
                  I don't want you hanging around
                  here. Keep away from me from now
                  on. Go and join the others.

        Roach stands frozen.

                            PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)
                  Just bloody join in. Go and play
                  damn you.

        He watches Roach walk to the edge of the field and stand
        mutely at the side. A ball rolls towards him. Roach goes to
        kick it. Misses. He tries again, RUNNING OUT OF SHOT.


257aA   EXT. PARIS DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING                     257aA

        Tarr is walking through a busy street. He stops to light a
        cigarette. A woman in a YELLOW dress appears, reflected in
        the glass. She's holding the hands of two children. For a
        moment it looks like Irina.
                                                                         115.



       Tarr spins round, but the woman has disappeared. He stares
       after her, hoping to catch a glimpse of her again.


257A   EXT./INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - DAY                257A

       Smiley walks back into the lobby, hesitates for a moment,
       then pushes on through the turnstile.


258    INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                         258

       George takes his place at the baronial chair. He examines
       the CHESS PIECE in his hand. We see it is labelled KARLA.
       He toys with it for a moment, then places it on the table
       in front of him, clears his throat.

                           SMILEY
                 Shall we begin?

       Through the open door Smiley's new inner circle begin to
       enter and take their place at the table around him.

4.      EXT.  HIGHWAY, FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA - DAY

        A school bus.  TWO very buxom PROSTITUTES are being handcuffed by a
        plain clothes special agent, CHESTER DESMOND.  Another AGENT has his
        gun to the spread eagled BUS DRIVER's head.  The KIDS inside the bus
        are screaming.  The phone inside Chester Desmond's car starts to
        ring.  Desmond walks to the car.

5.      INT.  DESMOND'S CAR - DAY

        Desmond picks up the ringing phone.

        Desmond exits the plane.

7.      INT.  SECURITY LOUNGE OF THE AIRPORT - SAME

        Desmond enters.  Cole and another man, SAM STANLEY, walk towards him.

                                   COLE
                   (motioning to the man standing there)

        Desmond and Stanley shake.

                        It's a pleasure.  I've heard a lot about
                        you.

                                   COLE
                        SAM'S THE MAN WHO CRACKED THE
                        WHITEMAN CASE.

                                  DESMOND
                        Congratulations.  I heard about that.

                                   COLE
                              (plowing ahead)
                        YOUR SURPRISE, CHET.  HER NAME IS LIL.

        LIL walks to them from another room.  She goes into a contorted dance.

8.      LIL'S DANCE

        Things we notice.

        --  She makes a sour face.

        --  She walks in place.

        --  She puts one hand in her pocket and makes a fist with the other.

        --  While she is doing this, she blinks with both eyes.

        --  She is wearing a red wig.

        At one point during this Cole adds a sentence.

                                   COLE
                        SHE'S MY MOTHER'S SISTER'S GIRL.

        Cole holds four fingers in front of his eyes.

                                  DESMOND
                          (noticing the fingers)
                        Federal?

        Cole gives him the thumbs up.

        Lil finishes her dance.

                                   COLE
                        GOOD LUCK, CHET.
                              (turns to Sam)
                        SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT
                        HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.
                              (back to Chet)
                        YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE

                                  DESMOND
                        Right, Gordon.  We'll be in touch.

9.      EXT.  HIGHWAY ON THE WAY TO DEER MEADOW - DAY

        Desmond's car on the highway.

10.     INT.  DESMOND'S CAR - SAME

        As they barrel down the highway -

                                  STANLEY
                        That was really something.  That
                        dancing girl.
                              (after a beat)
                        What did it mean?

                                  DESMOND
                        Code.  If you work with Gordon you learn
                        that right away.

                                  STANLEY
                        Code, I've heard a lot about this.

        Desmond pulls his arm back so that only his fingers come out of his
        sleeve.

                                  DESMOND
                        Sort of shorthand.

                                  STANLEY
                            (missing the humor)
                        Shorthand.  really?

                                  DESMOND
                        We're heading into a difficult situation.

                                  STANLEY
                        How do you figure?

                                  DESMOND
                        I'll explain it to you.  Do you remember
                        Lil's dance?

        As Desmond explains we -

                                                        INTERCUT WITH:

11.     FLASHBACK:  LIL'S DANCE

        In slow motion.

        ON LIL'S SOUR FACE

                                  DESMOND
                        Lil was wearing a sour face.

                                  STANLEY
                        What do you mean?

                                  DESMOND
                        Her face had a sour look...  that means
                        we're going to have trouble with the
                        local authorities.  They are not going to
                        be receptive to the FBI.

        ON LIL BLINKING BOTH EYES

                                  DESMOND
                        Both eyes blinking means there is going
                        to be trouble higher up...  the eyes of the
                        local authority.  A sheriff and a deputy.
                        That would be my guess.  Two of the
                        local law enforcers are going to be a
                        problem.

        ON LIL PUTTING ONE HAND IN HER POCKET AND ONE IN A FIST

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        If you noticed she had one hand in her
                        pocket which means they are hiding
                        something, and the other hand made a
                        fist which means they are going to be
                        belligerent.

        ON LIL WALKING IN PLACE

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        Lil was walking in place which means
                        there's going to be a lot of legwork
                        involved.

        WE SEE COLE PUTTING HIS FINGERS IN FRONT OF HIS FACE AND SAYING LIL
        IS HIS SISTER'S GIRL.

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        Cole said Lil was "his mother's sister's
                        girl".  What is missing in that sentence?
                        The Uncle.

                                  STANLEY
                        Oh, the uncle is missing.

                                  DESMOND
                        Not Cole's Uncle but probably the
                        sheriff's uncle in federal prison.

                                  STANLEY
                        So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's
                        committed a serious crime.

        ON LIL'S RED WIG

                                  DESMOND
                        Right, which is probably why Lil was
                        wearing a red wig meaning we are
                        headed into a dangerous situation.  Let
                        me ask you something, Stanley, did you
                        notice anything about the dress?

                                  STANLEY
                        The dress she was wearing had been
                        altered to fit her.  I noticed a different
                        colored thread where the dress had been
                        taken in.  It wasn't her dress or she
                        must have lost some weight.

                                  DESMOND
                        Gordon said you were good.  The tailored
                        dress is our code for drugs.  Did you
                        notice what was pinned to it?

                                  STANLEY
                        A blue rose.

                                  DESMOND
                        Very good, but I can't tell you about
                        that.

        Stanley rides along quietly for a while.

                                  STANLEY
                        What did Gordon's tie mean?

                                  DESMOND
                        What?  That's just Gordon's bad taste.

                                  STANLEY
                        Why couldn't he have just told you all
                        these things?

                                  DESMOND
                        He talks loud.  And he loves his code.

                                  STANLEY
                        I see.  He does talk loud.

                                  DESMOND
                        Gordon would not have sent us to Deer
                        Meadow without thinking it was a
                        high priority situation.

                                  STANLEY
                        It must be a high priority situation.

12.     EXT.  HIGHWAY - SAME

        Desmond's car drives off.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

13.     EXT.  DEER MEADOW SHERIFF'S STATION - AFTERNOON

        Desmond and Stanley arrive.  The Sheriff's Station is in a sorry
        state outside...  They walk up to the old steps and enter.

14.     INT.  DEER MEADOW SHERIFF'S STATION, RECEPTION AREA - DAY

        Agent Desmond and Stanley walk into a very small reception area.  At
        the counter Desmond shows his badge to CLIFF HOWARD, the Deputy.

                                  DESMOND
                        Good afternoon, Federal Bureau of
                        Investigation, Special Agent Chet
                        Desmond.  I'd like to see Sheriff Cable.

        Cliff just smiles for a long minute.

                                   CLIFF
                        Why don't you folks have a seat.  Make
                        yourself at home.  It's gonna be a while.

        Desmond stays standing and Stanley sits.  After another long moment,
        Cliff joins the SECRETARY in a conspiratorial giggle over the long
        wait they are planning to give the FBI.  In the middle of a giggle
        Cliff smiles up at Desmond.

                             CLIFF (continued)
                        Why don't you have some of that coffee.
                        It was fresh two days ago.

        Cliff has a good laugh over this and leans again over the secretary
        pretending to look at some paper work.  They both laugh.

                                  DESMOND
                        Okay, that's it.  I've had enough of the
                        waiting room now.

                                   CLIFF
                              (still smiling)
                        Oh.

        Desmond walks towards the door that obviously must go to Sheriff
        Cable's office.

        Cliff blocks his way with his arm across the doorway, daring him to
        do something.  While they stare eye to eye, Desmond's hand goes up
        slowly towards Cliff's face in a slow mesmerizing way.  Cliff tries
        to knock Chet's hand away.  Chet counters by grabbing Cliff's nose
        and pinches a nerve to its side injecting Cliff with a great amount
        of pain.

                             CLIFF (continued)
                        AAAHHHHHHHH...

        Desmond spins the deputy 180 degrees placing himself on the inside of
        the office and then still pressing the nerve guides Cliff down into a
        chair.

        While the Deputy's eyes tear copiously Desmond turns to the secretary.

                                  DESMOND
                        You can start that FRESH pot of coffee
                        right now.

        Desmond stalks to Sheriff Cable's office.  Stanley remains behind
        continuing to observe every detail.

15.     INT.  SHERIFF CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY

        SHERIFF CABLE looks up from his work.

                                   CABLE
                        How the hell did you...

        Desmond shows his credentials.

                                  DESMOND
                        Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special
                        Agent Chet Desmond.

        Cliff, still holding his nose, appears just behind Desmond, who turns
        to him.

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        That's all right, Deputy, Sheriff Cable
                        can take it from here

        Cable signals Cliff to leave.

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        I'm here to investigate the murder of
                        Teresa Banks.

                                   CABLE
                        Well, little fella, we don't need any
                        outside help here.  I don't like you
                        people sniffin' around my neck of the
                        woods.  In fact, when the state boys
                        called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I
                        think I said, "So what?"

                                  DESMOND
                        Your behavior is not funny and is
                        wasting the time of the Federal
                        Government.

                                   CABLE
                        You're lucky I am not wasting you.

                                  DESMOND
                        Well, little fella, let me put it this way.
                        The operative word here would be
                        "Federal".  With or without the
                        semantics of all this, I am now ordering
                        you to release all pertinent information
                        concerning Teresa Banks, both while
                        living and deceased.

        Cable retrieves a box with the paper work and some personal effects.
        He throws it to Desmond.

                                   CABLE
                        A basic kill.  Banks was a drifter and
                        nobody knew her.  My boys have been all
                        over this.  It's a dead end.

                                  DESMOND
                        That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable.
                        Where's the body?

                                   CABLE
                        Out back in our morgue

        Desmond starts to leave.

                             CABLE (continued)
                        It's 4:30.  We close at five.

                                  DESMOND
                        We've got our own clock.  We'll lock up.

        As Desmond turns to leave he notices on the wall a framed Newspaper
        clipping with picture.

        The caption reads:

                            "CABLE BENDS STEEL"

        The newspaper shows a picture of Cable in a He-Man pose bending a
        steel BAR into a U shape.  He turns to leave and Stanley seems to
        have appeared right on time.  Desmond moves down the hall and Stanley
        follows.

16.     EXT.  SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

        As Desmond and Stanley walk to the adjoining morgue they see a pile of
        steel BARS similar to the one they saw Cable bending in the picture.

        AT THE MORGUE DOOR

        Stanley moves up to Desmond and speaks confidentially.

                                  STANLEY
                        You know, Agent Desmond, I figure this
                        whole office, furniture included, is
                        worth 27,000 dollars.

        Desmond doesn't know what to say to him.  They enter the morgue.

17.     INT.  TINY MORGUE - DAY

        Teresa's body is on the platform in the middle of the room,  Stanley
        hangs his recorder on the hooks at the end of the autopsy table and
        puts on rubber gloves.  Desmond opens Teresa Banks file.

                                  DESMOND
                                 (reading)
                        Teresa Banks lived at the Canyon
                        Trailer Park for a month.  We'll check
                        that.  And worked as a waitress at Hap's
                        Truck Stop.  Worked the Night Shift.
                        Good place for dinner when we're thru
                        here, Sam.
                          (flips to another page)
                        No one came to claim the body and no
                        known next of kin.

        As Desmond is doing this, Stanley takes out his SPECIAL MACHINE.
        Desmond looks up from his work and notices.

                                  STANLEY
                        Solved the Whiteman Case with this.

                                  DESMOND
                        That's what I heard.

                                  STANLEY
                        No one could find those splinters
                        without a machine like this.  And no one
                        had a machine like this.

                                  DESMOND
                        That's good.

                                  STANLEY
                        Yes, it is good.
                              (looks around)
                        What do you think is in these other
                        drawers?

                                  DESMOND
                        I don't know, Sam.

                                  STANLEY
                        Maybe, later we could take a look.

                                  DESMOND
                        Sure, but let's finish up with this first.

        Getting to work, Stanley's face goes right over Teresa's.

                                  STANLEY
                            (into his recorder)
                        Crushed skull.  Probable cause repeated
                        blows to the back of the head with an
                        obtuse angled blunt object.  Subject
                        looks to be between 16 and 18 years of
                        age.

                                  DESMOND
                        Cole said she was 17.

        Stanley's eyes drift to Teresa's left hand.

                                  STANLEY
                        I wonder where her ring is?

        Desmond notices the mark on her hand as well.

                                  DESMOND
                        Yeah.
                    (looking into the personal effects)
                        Personal effects include a watch, under
                        garments, and a blue waitress
                        uniform...  the ring is missing.  It says
                        the rest of her things haven't been
                        removed yet from the trailer.  Let's
                        hope it's there.

        Stanley picks up her left hand.

        INSERT: BANKS LEFT HAND

        In Stanley's hand.

        ON THE SCENE

                                  STANLEY
                        There appears to be a contusion under
                        the ring finger of her left hand.

                                  DESMOND
                        Oh.

        Stanley peers underneath the fingernail.

                                  STANLEY
                        A laceration.

        Stanley brings over his "Whiteman" instrument.  Works the left hand
        under it.

                                  DESMOND
                        Accidental?

                                  STANLEY
                        Agent Desmond, would you hold the
                        finger for me.  There's something up
                        there.

        He gets whatever it is with a long set of tweezers.

                                  DESMOND
                        What is it?

                                  STANLEY
                        It is a piece of paper with the letter "T"
                        imprinted on it.  Take a look.

        Desmond comes around and takes a look.

        On a piece of paper.

        CLOSEUP: DESMOND

        Pondering what he has seen.

        ON THE SCENE

        We move across to a clock on the wall that reads:  5:04.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        THE SAME CLOCK

        It now reads 3:33.  Stanley zips up a regulation body bag around
        Teresa.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

18.     EXT.  MORGUE - LATE NIGHT

        Desmond and Stanley come out of the morgue.

                                  STANLEY
                        Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty
                        in the morning.  Where are we going to
                        sleep?

                                  DESMOND
                        We're not.  You and I are going to get
                        some food.

                                  STANLEY
                        Yes, it's been several hours since we've
                        eaten.  I didn't realize that so much
                        time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?

        Desmond takes a long look at Stanley.

                            STANLEY (continued)
                        You've got your own M.O., don't you,
                        Agent Desmond?

        Desmond gets in and starts the car.

19.     EXT.  HAP'S DINER - LATE NIGHT

        Establish.

20.     INT.  HAP'S DINER, MANAGER'S OFFICE - LATE NIGHT

        Desmond and Stanley talk with JACK, the manager who has black wavy
        hair with a black full mustache to match, shiny silk shirt with silver
        strands sown in and an Indian turquoise belt.  He has a sign on his
        shirt that says, "Say 'Goodbye' to JACK".

        A GUY in the room is working on a light that keeps buzzing and
        shorting out.  He doesn't really know what he's doing so he is
        poking at the wiring.

                                   JACK
                        Had the FBI here once before.  Back in
                        the fifties when Hap was running the
                        place.

                                  DESMOND
                        Where's Hap?

                                   JACK
                        He's dead - good and dead.

                                  DESMOND
                        Sorry to hear it.

                                   JACK
                        He didn't suffer.

                                  DESMOND
                        I'd like to ask you a few questions about
                        Teresa Banks

                                   JACK
                        Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few
                        questions about Teresa Banks.  She
                        worked nights for a month.  That's it.

                                  DESMOND
                        Any friends?

                                   JACK
                        No.

                                  DESMOND
                        Ever see her with someone else?

                                   JACK
                        No.

                                  DESMOND
                        Did she ever mention any friends?

                                   JACK
                        No.
                                (pointing)
                        Ask Irene over there.

        He gestures thru a door that leads out to the diner, pointing out a
        woman behind the counter.

                             JACK (continued)
                        Now, her name _is_ Irene and it _is_ night.
                        Don't take it any further than that.
                        There's nothin' good about it.

21.     INT.  HAP'S DINER - SAME

        They sit at the counter and IRENE comes over to them.  Behind her is
        the coffee and she is working on a cigarette.  Lipstick smeared on
        the coffee cup.

                                   IRENE
                        Take a good look around.  There's nobody in
                        this place - you're meetin' the reason
                        why.  What'll it be?

                                  DESMOND
                        How come Jack let's you work here?

                                   IRENE
                        Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.

                                  DESMOND
                        Say no more.

        Stanley is casing the restaurant as Irene pours them a couple of cups
        of coffee.

                                  DESMOND
                           (showing credentials)
                        Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special
                        Agent Chet Desmond.  I'd like to ask you
                        a few questions about Teresa Banks.
                        Jack said you knew her.  How well?

                                   IRENE
                        She only worked here a month.  Nice
                        girl.  Never seemed to get here on time
                        though.  Ask me she had a little problem
                        with --

        She makes a sniff to indicate a "cocaine problem".

                             IRENE (continued)
                        Came looking for a job with a friend of
                        hers.  Pretty girl.  Could've been her
                        sister.

                                  DESMOND
                        What happened to her?

                                   IRENE
                        There was only one job.  Teresa took the
                        job.  Her friend took a hike.  Never saw
                        her again.

                                  DESMOND
                        Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?

                                   IRENE
                        No.

                                  DESMOND
                        Do you take cocaine, Irene?

                                   IRENE
                        No, I do not.  I never took cocaine or any
                        other drugs.  I don't take drugs.

                                  STANLEY
                        Nicotine is a drug.  Caffeine is a drug.

                                   IRENE
                        Who's Shorty?  Those drugs are legal.

                                  DESMOND
                        He's with me.
                            (back on the track)
                        Anything you would like to tell us about
                        Teresa Banks that would help us out?

                                   IRENE
                        I've thought about that.  I think her
                        death is what you would call a "freak
                        accident".

                                  DESMOND
                        Thanks.

        An OLD GUY, long and skinny, smoking, gets Desmond's attention.

                                  OLD GUY
                        You talking about that little girl that
                        was murdered?

                                  DESMOND
                        You have something to tell us?

                                  OLD GUY
                        Yeah.

                                  DESMOND
                        What?

                                  OLD GUY
                        I can tell shit from shinolah.  Gets me
                        along way down that road.

        Desmond moves away from him.

                                  STANLEY
                        You think we ought to question him?

        Desmond looks down at the coffee cup in Stanley's _left_hand_.

                                  DESMOND
                        What time is it, Stanley?

        Stanley checks his watch pouring hot coffee on himself.

                                  STANLEY
                        Oh...

        Desmond guides his laugh into a cough.

                                  STANLEY
                      (looking at his watch while his
                                legs burn)
                        Agent Desmond, it's...

                                  DESMOND
                        It's late, Sam.

                                  STANLEY
                     (to himself as be dabs his pants
                               with napkins)
                        It's not late, it's early.  Really early.

        Irene comes up to them with her purse in her hand.  She is going off
        duty.

                                   IRENE
                        You know, I never told anybody, but once
                        for about three days, just before her
                        time, Teresa's arm went completely
                        dead.

                                  DESMOND
                        What do you mean?

                                   IRENE
                        Her left arm.  It was numb.  She said she
                        couldn't use it.  Said it had no feeling.
                        Probably from the drugs she was taking.
                              (after a beat)
                        I just thought I ought to tell you.

                                  DESMOND
                        Thanks.

        Stanley watches her leave.

                                  STANLEY
                        I doubt it was drugs, more likely a
                        problem with a nerve.  I could recheck
                        the arm for injuries, but for real nerve
                        work we are going to have to take the
                        body back to Portland.

                                  DESMOND
                        I think that's a good idea.

22.     EXT.  HAP'S DINER - NEAR DAWN

        As Desmond and Stanley head towards their car.

                                  DESMOND
                        I think we should see the sun rise at the
                        Canyon Trailer Park.

                                  STANLEY
                        Are you speaking to me in a code?

                                  DESMOND
                        No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean
                        just exactly what I say.

                                  STANLEY
                        In that case, we should go to the Canyon
                        Trailer Park.

        Irene walks past them and towards the parking lot.

                            STANLEY AND DESMOND
                        Thanks, Irene.  Good...
                            (catch themselves)
                        Good morning.

                                  STANLEY
                        Thank god it is morning.

23.     EXT.  CANYON TRAILER COURT - DAWN

        Desmond and Stanley drive thru to the manager's trailer which is
        surrounded by a small white picket fence.  They park and step to the
        trailer.  Desmond knocks twice on the door.  From inside they hear a
        voice that makes Cole's voice sound like a whisper.

                                   VOICE
                        OH, GOD, WHAT...  WHAT...

        Just then Desmond and Stanley notice a sign on the door that reads.

                       "DO NOT EVER DISTURB BEFORE 9
                              A.M...    EVER"

                                   VOICE
                        CAN'T YOU READ!

                                  STANLEY
                        Nine's really late.  We are really early.

        They both fumble for their badges as they hear the manager coming
        closer to the door.  They meet the manager, CARL RODD.

                                   CARL
                        God damn, this better be
                        important.

        He stops in the middle of this when he sees the badges.

                                  DESMOND
                        Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special
                        Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam
                        Stanley.  Sorry to disturb you, but we
                        would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer,
                        please.

                                   CARL
                        More popular than Uncle's Day at a
                        whorehouse.
                    (takes one step out of his trailer)
                        GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS
                        BRIGHT!  BLUE BRIGHT.

        Carl steps thru the little picket fence's gate and leads them towards
        Teresa's Trailer.

                             CARL (continued)
                        Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she
                        lives in town.  Teresa rented it about a
                        month ago.

                                  DESMOND
                        Did she have someone with her?

                                   CARL
                        Right.  She had a friend with her.  The
                        friend took off.

                                  DESMOND
                        Was there an argument?

                                   CARL
                        Not that I know of.  But arguments do
                        happen, don't they?

                                  DESMOND
                        Yes they do.  Did she have visitors?

                                   CARL
                        No, hey, I already told this whole damn
                        thing to Sheriff "Not-Quite-Able"...
                        Here's the trailer now.

        He swings open the door.

                             CARL (continued)
                        And this is exactly the way she left it.  I
                        never touched a GOD DAMN THING.
                           (frustration rising)
                        GOD!

        Desmond and Stanley go in.

24.     INT.  TERESA'S TRAILER

        Desmond smells the room.  He and Stanley look around.  Stanley leans
        over to Desmond.

                                  STANLEY
                                (whispers)
                        She lived alone.

                                  DESMOND
                        She must have known someone.

        Desmond notices her personal effects on the dresser, but no ring.

                            DESMOND (continued)
                        You better dust this place, Sam.

                                  STANLEY
                        I'll get my kit.

25.     EXT.  CANYON TRAILER COURT

        Stanley walks towards the car.  He writes in his note book.

                                  STANLEY
                               (to himself)
                        5,600 dollars.

26.     INT.  TERESA'S TRAILER

        Desmond notices a picture hanging on the wall.  Takes the picture
        down and looks at it thru his magnifying glass.
                                  (more)

        INSERT - PICTURE

        Teresa Banks is wearing a ring.

        BACK ON THE SCENE

        Stanley returns with his equipment.  Desmond shows him the photograph.

                                  DESMOND
                        Take a look at this.

                                  STANLEY
                        She's wearing a ring.

        Stanley studies it.

                                  DESMOND
                        My guess is there isn't enough detail in
                        the photo to get an idea of the design on
                        the ring, but we should do a blowup of
                        this anyway.

                                  STANLEY
                        (squinting at the picture)
                        May I see the magnifying glass, Agent
                        Desmond?
                       (takes a look, then looks at
                                 Desmond)
                        There doesn't seem to be enough detail
                        in the photo to ascertain the design on
                        the ring.

        Carl leans in from the outside.

                                   CARL
                        I'm gonna make myself some Good
                        Morning America.  You want some?

        Both nod "yes".

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

27.     INT.  TERESA'S TRAILER - LATER

        Stanley is finishing up his work.  Carl brings them their coffee.
        Desmond tastes the coffee under Sam's watchful eye.

                                  DESMOND
                        You weren't kiddin'.  This stuff's got the
                        sting of the forty-eight hour blend.

                                   CARL
                        That's right.  That's the best coffee
                        you're gonna get around here.

                                  STANLEY
                         (watching Desmond drink)
                        We really do need a good "wake me up",
                        don't we, Agent Desmond?
                     (after a long look from Desmond)
                        We really do need a good "wake me up",
                        don't we, Agent Desmond?

        A WOMAN sticks her head into the trailer.  She has an ice pack over
        one eye and a load of idle curiosity.  Desmond notices her.

                                  DESMOND
                        Did you know Teresa Banks?

        She just nods in the negative and leans back out.  Behind her is
        Deputy Cliff, who looks into the trailer.

                                   CLIFF
                        Hey, how's J. Edgar doin'?
                                 (to Carl)
                        Bet you appreciate them bustin' your
                        mornin' in half, eh, Carl?  Bet they woke
                        you up.

                                   CARL
                        They're only doing their job.

                                  DESMOND
                        What are you doing here in the trailer
                        court, Deputy?

                                   CLIFF
                        Maybe I just live here, what do you
                        think about that?

                                  DESMOND
                        Can I ask you where you were the night
                        Teresa Banks was murdered?

                                   CLIFF
                        You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a
                        party and I got fifteen fuckin'
                        witnesses.

                                   CARL
                        Maybe if you did a little less partyin'
                        that little girl would still be alive.

                                   CLIFF
                        Is that right, Mr. Jack Daniels?

                                  DESMOND
                        Did you know Teresa Banks?

                                   CLIFF
                        Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's
                        from her.  That's it.  By the way where
                        do you get off questioning a lawman?  I
                        could ask you the same question.

                                  DESMOND
                        No you couldn't.

        Chet steps towards Cliff who looses his balance and has to step off
        the trailer steps.

28.     EXT.  CANYON TRAILER COURT - SAME

        Desmond stands in the doorway of the trailer and watches Cliff get
        into his car and drive to work.

        Stepping away from the trailer Desmond spots something underneath.
        He bends down and retrieves a Titleist Golf Ball.

                                  DESMOND
                        Is there a golf course around here?

                                   CARL
                        Not a lot around here, no.  Got some
                        clubs, but not very many fellas with
                        balls.

        Desmond drops the ball in a plastic bag and gives it to Stanley who
        puts it in his kit.  Desmond turns to Carl.

                                  DESMOND
                        Thanks for your help, Carl.  Sorry we
                        woke you up.

                                   CARL
                        That's alright.  I was having a bad
                        dream.  I was dreamin' about a joke
                        with no punchline.

        Desmond and Stanley nod to Carl and walk to their car.

                                  STANLEY
                        I couldn't help but notice that you had a
                        suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the
                        murderer.  You did think that, didn't you,
                        Agent Desmond?

                                  DESMOND
                        He's not the murderer.
                              (after a beat)
                        But he's a bozo.

                                  STANLEY
                        Yes, he is like a clown.

        Desmond walks around the car to the drivers' side and gets in.

29.     EXT.  SHERIFF'S STATION - MIDDAY

        The FBI MOBILE CRIME VAN sits outside as Desmond and Stanley pull up.

30.     INT.  WAITING ROOM, SHERIFF CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY

        Cable and Cliff meet Desmond and Stanley as they come in the door.
        The CRIME VAN DRIVER sits nearby.  The secretary is behind her desk.

                                   CABLE
                        What the hell is that thing doing out
                        there?  You're not taking that body
                        anywhere.

                                  DESMOND
                        We're taking the body back to Portland
                        and there's not a thing you can do about
                        it.

                                   CABLE
                        Maybe not _a_ thing, but maybe _two_
                        things.

                                  DESMOND
                        Teresa Banks had a ring.  Any idea what
                        happened to it?

                                   CABLE
                        We got a phone, here, that's got a little
                        ring.

                                  DESMOND
                           (turning to Stanley)
                        Sam, get the body and put it in the van.
                                (to Cable)
                        Sheriff Cable, where were you the night
                        Teresa Banks was murdered?

                                   CABLE
                     (flexing the muscles in his arm)
                        My alibi is as strong as these bands of
                        steel.

        He reaches out and stops Stanley from going out to get the body.
        Cable smiles menacingly at Desmond.

                             CABLE (continued)
                        Cliff told me you asked him the same
                        thing.  Why don't we step around back
                        and we'll have our final "discussion" out
                        doors.

        Cable exits followed by Cliff and the giggling secretary.

                                  STANLEY
                         (coming close to Desmond)
                        When he says, "Discussion", how do you
                        take that, Agent Desmond?

                                  DESMOND
                        I don't take it, Sam.  I give it.

31.     EXT.  BEHIND THE SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

        Desmond, Cliff, Stanley, Cable, the secretary and the FBI van driver
        all have stepped outside by the pile of iron bars.

                                   CABLE
                        Now, J. Edgar, I'm going to take off my
                        badge, here.  Do you mind?
                           (takes his badge off)
                        The only way you're going to get that
                        body is over mine.

        He picks up a steel bar and bends it ala the picture in his office.

                                   CLIFF
                               (to Desmond)
                        You try that you little monkey.

                                  DESMOND
                        I think I'll take off my badge as well.

        Desmond takes his coat and badge off.  Cable takes his shirt off and
        Desmond follows.  Cable is bare-chested and Desmond is in FBI issue
        underwear.

        Desmond goes to pick up an iron bar and Cable hits him with a sucker
        punch.  As Desmond bends away from this Cable rushes at him.  Desmond
        stops him with a few well placed punches to his face.  Cable falls
        down and Desmond stands over him.  Chet picks up the steel bar and
        bends it.  He then tosses the bar away.

        Cable stands up and rushes at Desmond who flips and flops him around.
        Cable tries one more grand roadhouse punch which Desmond expertly
        ducks.

                                  DESMOND
                        (eyeing Cable's glass jaw)
                        This one's comin' from J. Edgar.

        Desmond blasts him in the jaw and Cable goes over - lights out, all
        systems down.

        The no longer giggling secretary and Cliff stand and stare.  Desmond
        looks at them.

                                  DESMOND
                        Who's next?

        After a moment of unbearable humiliation they shuffle away.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

32.     EXT.  SHERIFF'S STATION - AFTERNOON

        Stanley and the driver finish loading the body into the van.  Desmond
        and Stanley talk.

                                  DESMOND
                        Take the van back to Portland, Stanley.
                        I'm going to take one more look at the
                        trailer park.

        They walk towards the van until Stanley stops.

                                  STANLEY
                             (confidentially)
                        One thing that has been troubling me.
                        That lamp at the diner.  Do you think
                        they were working on it for esthetic
                        reasons or was their work due to faulty
                        wiring?

                                  DESMOND
                        Faulty wiring.

                                  STANLEY
                        Esthetics are subjective, aren't they,
                        Agent Desmond?
                            (extends his hand)
                        I'm Sam Stanley.  If you ever need me.

                                  DESMOND
                        Thanks, Sam, for the good work.  You
                        have a good eye for detail.

                                  STANLEY
                        We do notice things, don't we, Agent
                        Desmond?  Are you going back to the
                        trailer park for the Blue rose?

        Desmond smiles at Stanley as they shake.

        DESMOND'S POV

        As he enters the van, Desmond can barely make out what Stanley says
        as he points to the driver.

                                  STANLEY
                              (very muffled)
                        83,000 dollars.

33.     EXT.  THE TRAILER COURT - DAY

        Desmond is standing in front of Teresa's trailer with Carl Rodd.

                                   CARL
                    (motioning behind and to the right
                           of Teresa's trailer)
                        And that's Deputy Cliff's trailer over
                        there.  The red one.

                                   CHET
                        Right.

                                   CARL
                        I'll be in my trailer if you need me.

        Carl walks away towards his trailer.  Desmond walks over and around
        Cliff's red trailer.  He gets a strange feeling.  He looks past
        Teresa's trailer to the edge of the trailer park, where he sees a
        HAND appear in the window of a trailer.  Then the hand disappears.

        Desmond walks to that trailer.  He knocks on the door but no one
        answers.  He looks under the trailer and sees a _mound_of_dirt_with_
        _a_small_indentation_at_the_top_.  In the indentation is _Teresa_
        _Bank's_ring_.  As he reaches out and touches it, _he_disappears_.

34.     INT. GORDON COLE'S OFFICE, PHILADELPHIA - DAY

        Cole and ALBERT ROSENFIELD talk.

                                   COLE
                        EVERY SYLLABLE OF EVERY WORD IS THE
                        SOUND OF TWO HANDS CLAPPING.  IS
                        THAT WHAT YOU SAID, ALBERT?

                                  ALBERT
                        Six to eight hands clapping.  I was
                        referring to the possibility of a little
                        silence.

        The phone rings and Cole answers it.

35.     INT.  PHILADELPHIA FBI OFFICES

        AGENT DALE COOPER, in the doorway across the hall, talks to DIANE in
        the next room.  While he talks he does some isometrics against the
        door frame.

                                  COOPER
                        I know you haven't changed your hair and
                        I've seen that beautiful dress before,
                        but I must say, Diane, you look
                        sensational today.

        Diane says something else that we cannot hear.

                                  COOPER
                              (enjoying this)
                        No, I am not trying to buy time.  It's
                        Thursday and I know you have changed
                        something in the room...  and this time
                        you've done very well...
                                (stalling)
                        And I am going to tell you exactly what
                        it is...  in a moment...  you have moved...
                            (snaps his fingers)
                        Got it!  It's the clock, you've moved it
                        12 inches to the left.
                                 (a laugh)
                        Another triumph for the dashing Agent
                        Cooper.  And you, Diane, now have to
                        clean the coffee cup, get fresh ground
                        coffee from Sally and make a damn
                        great pot of coffee.

        Cooper with a triumphant smile walks over to join Cole and Albert.
        But Cole's stern look takes his smile away.

                                  COOPER
                        What is it, Gordon?

                                   COLE
                        COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS
                        DISAPPEARED.  GONE LIKE THE WIND IN
                        DEER MEADOW.

36.     INT.  SAM STANLEY'S APARTMENT, SPOKANE - DAY

        All around the walls of Stanley's apartment are work benches with
        adding machinery sitting on top of them.  In the middle of the room
        is a portable plastic pool, with milky white water and crystallized
        salt formations clinging to the sides like quartz rocks.  From one
        odd looking piece of machinery there are wires which extend into the
        pool.

        Cooper's eyes go to the pool and back to Stanley as Sam talks about
        Desmond.

                                  STANLEY
                        Agent Chet said he wanted to check the
                        trailer court one more time.  He had me
                        drive the van with the body back here.
                        Which we did.  It was 105 miles.

                                  COOPER
                        Anything else?

                                  STANLEY
                        Did Gordon show you a woman named
                        Lil?

                                  COOPER
                        I'm up to speed, Stanley.

                                  STANLEY
                        Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the
                        Blue Rose meant.

                                  COOPER
                        And neither will I.

                                  STANLEY
                              (understanding)
                        Oh, alright.
                               (reflecting)
                        You know, I liked Agent Desmond.  He
                        had his own M.O.

        Stanley turns to one of his work tables and shows Cooper the Whiteman
        machine.

                                  STANLEY
                        I cracked the Whiteman case with this.

                                  COOPER
                           (trying to stop him)
                        Stanley, I heard all about it.

                                  STANLEY
                        No one could've found those splinters
                        without a machine like this and no one
                        has a machine like this.

                                  COOPER
                        Tell me about the letter.

                                  STANLEY
                        Take a look at this.  Chet and I found it
                        under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail.

        Cooper looks under the microscope to see the letter they found on
        Teresa.

                                  COOPER
                        And no one found the ring?

                                  STANLEY
                        No, sir, we did not.

        Cooper straightens up from the microscope.  Stanley extends his hand.

                                  STANLEY
                        I'm Sam Stanley, if you ever need me.

37.     EXT.  CANYON TRAILER COURT - DAY

        Carl Rodd shows Cooper to Teresa's trailer.

                                   CARL
                        GOD.  I'm beginning to lose faith in the
                        United States Government and that
                        includes the telephone system.  Don't
                        you folks talk to one another.  That's her
                        trailer there and I haven't touched a god
                        damn thing.  Agent Chet Desmond come
                        by a second time and asked too see
                        Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer
                       (gestures to the red trailer)
                        ...which I showed him.  I went back to
                        my trailer...
                          (gestures back to his)
                        After that I never saw him again.

                                  COOPER
                        Thank you, Carl.

        Cooper starts walking in the opposite direction from Cliff's trailer
        picking up on the same odd vibe that struck Desmond.

                                   CARL
                              (turning back)
                        That's not the way to Cliff's trailer.  I
                        told you.

                                  COOPER
                        I am not going to Cliff's trailer.

                                   CARL
                        Well, where are you going?

                                  COOPER
                        I am going over here.

                                   CARL
                          (coming along with him)
                        God damn, you people are confusing.

        Cooper reaches a pack of dirt which is now creased with tire tracks.

                                  COOPER
                        What was here, Mr. Rodd?

                                   CARL
                        A trailer was here.  What the hell do you
                        think?

                                  COOPER
                        Can you tell me who's trailer it was...
                        and who stayed in the trailer?

                                   CARL
                        An old woman and her grandson.

                                  COOPER
                        Can you tell me what their names were?

                                   CARL
                        Chalfont.  Weird.  Chalfont was the
                        name of the folks that rented the space
                        before they did.  Two Chalfonts.

        Cooper kneels to examine the tracks left by the exited trailer.
        As he kneels and inspects the tracks he is overcome by the presence
        of SOMETHING.

        Cooper struggles to his feet and looks around.  Under a tree and
        close to the tracks is a car.

                                  COOPER
                        Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?

                                   CARL
                        Yep, it sure is.

        Cooper walks to it.

        AT DESMOND'S CAR

        Cooper inspects the car.  Coming around to the front of the car he
        notices the windshield.  On the windshield someone has written the
        words, "Let's Rock".

38.     EXT.  WIND RIVER, NEAR DEER MEADOW - AFTERNOON

        Cooper stares into the stream.

                                  COOPER
                       (dictating into his recorder)
                        Diane, it's 4:20 in the afternoon.  I am
                        standing here at Wind River where they
                        found the body of Teresa Banks.  Diane,
                        this case has got a strange feeling for
                        me.  Not only has Agent Chester
                        Desmond disappeared but this is one of
                        Cole's Blue Rose cases.  The clues that
                        were found by Agent Desmond and Agent
                        Stanley have lead to dead ends.  The
                        letter below the fingernail gives me the
                        feeling that the killer will strike again.
                        But like the song says, "...who knows
                        where or when".

39.     EXT.  TWIN PEAKS - DAY

        Shot of the Twin Peaks Sign.  Then on screen it reads:

                       TWIN PEAKS ONE YEAR LATER -

42.     INT.  COLE'S OFFICE

        Cooper talks with Cole.

                                  COOPER
                        Gordon, it is 10:10, on February 15th.

                                  GORDON
                        SO?

                                  COOPER
                        I was worried about today from the
                        dream I told you about.

                                   COLE
                        RIGHT.
                          (not sure what to say)
                        GOOD WORK.

        Cooper looks at the calendar in the room and checks his watch.  He
        walks from the room.

43.     INT.  HALLWAY BELOW THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERA - SAME

        Cooper stares into the lens of the camera for a moment.  Then sprints
        to the Surveillance Room.

44.     INT.  SURVEILLANCE ROOM

        Cooper stares at the monitor.  Sees nothing on the screen but an
        empty hallway.

45.     EXT.  BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - DAY

        Nice sunny day.  The dity in all its glory.  On screen it reads:

                              "BUENOS AIRES"

46.     INT.  BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - DAY

        PHILLIP JEFFRIES checks into the hotel.

                                HEAD CLERK
                        Here's your key, Mr. Jeffries.  I hope you
                        enjoy your stay here at The Palm
                        Deluxe.
                              (grabs a note)
                        This is for you.  The joven...  ah...  young
                        lady...  she left it.

        Rings the bell.  A BELLHOP appears.  Young, sweating, and eager.
        Jeffries hands him the key.

                                  BELLHOP
                        612 --- very nice.

        He picks up Jeffries' bag and heads for the elevator.

47.     INT.  HALLWAY BELOW THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERA - SAME

        Cooper runs out to the hall again stares into the camera.  He stays
        there for a moment then runs back to the Surveillance Room.

48.     INT.  SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

        Cooper stares at the monitor which still shows an empty hallway.

49.     INT.  HALLWAY BELOW THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERA - SAME

        BACK ON COOPER

        He runs back out the door into the hallway.  Behind him at the end of
        the hall a door opens and _Phillip_Jeffries_who_moments_ago_was_in_
        _Buenos_Aires_ enters the hallway headed towards Cooper, but Cooper
        doesn't see him because he is staring intently into the camera as he
        has done twice before.

50.     INT.  SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

        Cooper races into the room and stares into the monitor.

51.     ON THE MONITOR

        This time Cooper is amazed to see himself staring into the camera,
        and behind him is Phillip Jeffries coming towards him and the camera.
        On the screen Jeffries walks past Cooper.

                                  COOPER
                                (shouting)
                        Gordon.

        Cooper runs into Gordon's office.

52.     INT.  GORDON'S OFFICE

        As Cooper gets to Gordon's office, Albert and Cole are standing there
        staring bug eyed at Phillip Jeffries.

                                   COLE
                        PHILLIP!

        Albert stands up.

                                  ALBERT
                        Phillip?

        Jeffries moves into the room.  Cooper steps into the office.

                                  COOPER
                        Phillip?

                                   COLE
                        COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP
                        JEFFRIES.  YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM
                        AT THE ACADEMY.

        Jeffries stares at the threesome.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        I'm not going to talk about Judy.  Keep
                        Judy out of this.

                                  COOPER
                        But...

        Cole calms Cooper.

                                   COLE
                        STAND FAST, COOP.

                                 JEFFRIES
                           (pointing at Cooper)
                        Who do you think that is there?

                                  ALBERT
                        (trying to calm Jeffries)
                        Suffered some bumps on the old noggin',
                        eh, Phil?

                                   COLE
                        WHAT THE HELL DID HE SAY?
                           (pointing at Cooper)
                        THAT'S SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER.
                          (focusing on Jeffries)
                        ARE YOU OKAY, JEFFRIES?  WHERE THE
                        HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?

                                 JEFFRIES
                        I want to tell you everything, but I don't
                        have a lot to go on.  But I'll tell you one
                        thing:  Judy is positive about this.

                                  ALBERT
                        How interesting.  I thought we were
                        going to keep Judy out of this.

        Jeffries stumbles to a chair.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Listen to me carefully.  I saw one of
                        their meetings.  It was above a
                        convenience store.

                                  ALBERT
                        Who's meeting?  Where have you been?

                                   COLE
                        FOR GOD SAKES, JEFFRIES, YOU'VE BEEN
                        GONE FOR DAMN NEAR TWO YEARS.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        It was a dream.
                         (takes Albert by the arm)
                        We live inside a dream.

                                  ALBERT
                        And it's raining Post Toasties.

                                 JEFFRIES
                                (shouting)
                        NO, NO.  I found something...  in Seattle
                        at Judy's...  And then, there they were...

        Albert is about to say something, but is stopped by Cole's gentle
        pressure on his arm.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        They sat quietly for hours.

53.     INT.  ROOM ABOVE THE CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

        SIX PEOPLE in a large, barren, filthy room.  Cheap plastic storm
        windows flap in the cold wind.  In the foreground the Man From
        Another Place (Mike) and BOB sit at a formica table.  Behind them
        on plastic torn chairs huddle MRS. TREMOND and her GRANDSON.  TWO
        BIG WOODSMEN with full beards sit quietly.

                              FIRST WOODSMAN
                                (subtitled)
                        We have descended from pure air.

                                (subtitled)
                        Going up and down.  Intercourse between
                        the two worlds.

                                    BOB
                                (subtitled)
                        Light of new discoveries.

                               MRS. TREMOND
                                (subtitled)
                        Why not be composed of materials and
                        combinations of atoms?

                          MRS. TREMOND'S GRANDSON
                                (subtitled)
                        This is no accident.

                          MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE
                                (subtitled)
                        This is a formica table.  Green is its
                        color.

        He touches the table.

                              FIRST WOODSMAN
                                (subtitled)

                                (subtitled)
                        With chrome.  Any everything will
                        proceed cyclically.

                        Boneless.

                                   MIKE
                                (subtitled)
                        Yes, find the middle place.

        Bob begins to scream with anger.

                                    BOB
                                (subtitled)
                        I HAVE THE FURY OF MY OWN MOMENTUM.

                             TREMOND'S GRANDSON
                                (subtitled)
                        Fell a victim.

        The Man From Another Place raises his hand.

                          MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE
                                (subtitled)
                        Fire Walk With Me...

        Bob claps his hand and a circle of fire appears in the room.

                                    BOB
                                (subtitled)
                        Fire Walk With Me.

        THROUGH THE CIRCLE

        We see the RED ROOM.

        ON THE SCENE

        Bob crawls into the Red Room and Mike starts to yell and leaps in
        after him.

54.     BACK IN THE FBI OFFICE

                                 JEFFRIES
                        I followed.

        Jeffries begins to cry quietly at his table.

                                 JEFFRIES
                               (to himself)
                        The ring...  ring...

                                   COLE
                                 (hinting)
                        ALBERT, I'LL TAKE THAT SECOND
                        MINERAL WATER.

        After a hesitation, Albert gets the "message" and discreetly leaves
        the room.

                             COLE (continued)
                        PHILLIP, LET'S CALM DOWN AND GET ALL
                        OF THIS INTERESTING STORY ON PAPER.

        Cole tries to raise someone on the intercom but it doesn't seem to
        have any juice.

                             COLE (continued)
                            (into the speaker)
                        HELLO...  HELLO.

        He is getting nothing.  The static begins to build on the intercom.
        The wiring in the wall and the flourescent lights start to hum as
        well.

                             COLE (continued)
                        LET ME HEAR SOME GOOD NEWS.  MY
                        DEVICE IS FAULTY.  WHERE THE HELL IS
                        THE SOUND IN THIS THING?
                         (pounds on the intercom)
                        MAYDAY...

        Hearing "May", Jeffries turns and stares at a _calendar_on_the_wall_.
        Move into Jeffries.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        May?  1989?

        CLOSEUP: JEFFRIES

        Staring at the calendar.  it is 1989.

        BACK ON THE SCENE

        Cooper looks out of the room to see if anyone is coming to help Cole
        who is still trying to get the intercom to work.  The static grows
        even louder.

                                   COLE
                        WHAT...  AM I ALONE?

        Cole turns back to Jeffries.  _But_there_is_no_one_there_.  Jeffries
        is gone.  Papers from Cole's desk are now sticking to Jeffries chair.

                                   COLE
                        HE'S GONE.

                                  COOPER
                        (coming back into the room)
                        What?

                                   COLE
                        ALBERT, COME BACK HERE.  HE'S GONE
                        CALL THE FRONT DESK.

                                  ALBERT
                              (on the phone)
                        I've got the front desk right now.  He
                        never was here.  No record of him
                        entering the building...  and the doctors
                        should be here any minute.

                                   COLE
                          (frustration building)
                        GREAT.  I, MYSELF, AM GOING TO BE
                        READY FOR THEM.

                                  COOPER
                        What's going on?

        Albert rushes back into the room.

                                   COLE
                        QUICKLY MEN...  WORD ASSOCIATION,
                        COOP.  WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT
                        RIGHT NOW?

                                  COOPER
                        Teresa Banks.

                                   COLE
                        ALBERT?

                                  ALBERT
                        Tylenol.

                                   COLE
                                (to Cooper)
                        WHY ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT TERESA
                        BANKS, COOP?

                                  COOPER
                        It was a year ago today that Teresa
                        Banks was killed.  I'm wondering if the
                        murderer will ever kill again.

                                   COLE
                        ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?

                                  ALBERT
                        No offense, sir, but after a day with you
                        it is mandatory.

55.     INT.  BUENOS AIRES HOTEL CORRIDOR - SAME

        Jeffries is suddenly standing in the second story hallway of the
        Buenos Aires Palm Deluxe Hotel.  The wall behind him is seared black
        and smoking.  A terrified MAID is whimpering and scampering away from
        Jeffries trying to stave away an epileptic fit.  She is looking at
        him like he is the devil personified.

        The bellhop had run further away, but has turned back to see Jeffries
        reappear.  He is afraid to come any closer.

                                 JEFFRIES
                               (to Bellhop)
                        Hey...  hey...

                                  BELLHOP
                               (half crying)
                        Oh, Mr. Jeffries.  De shit it come out of
                        my ass!  Santa Maria, where did you go?

        They stare at each other as the blackened wall continues to smoke.

56.     INT.  SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

        Cooper and Cole sit in front of the monitor.  Cooper plays back the
        surveillance tape.  _It_shows_Jeffries_coming_up_behind_Cooper_.
        _Then_moving_past_him_.  Cooper turns to Cole.

                                  COOPER
                        He was here.

57.     EXT.  HAYWARD HOUSE

        Laura Palmer continues down the sidewalk towards us.

        On screen it reads:

                      "THURSDAY - SEVEN DAYS BEFORE"

        Laura stops and turns.  We suddenly find ourselves in front of the
        Hayward House.

                                   LAURA
                        Donna?...  Donna?...

        LAURA'S POV

        DONNA HAYWARD gathering her books and coming out the door.

                                   DONNA
                        Just a minute, Laura.

58.     ON THE SIDEWALK

        Donna joins Laura.

                                   LAURA
                        If I am going to get through math today,
                        you're going to have to bring me up to
                        speed quick.

                                   DONNA
                        You didn't do your homework?

                                   LAURA
                        Noooo...

                                   DONNA
                                  (a pal)
                        Okay, this test is going to be about the
                        theorems I told you about last week.  You
                        remember the...

                                   LAURA
                        Don't tell me now.  Tell me right before
                        the test.  I won't be able to remember
                        long enough.

                                   DONNA
                        You graduating this year will be proof
                        that miracles happen.

                                   LAURA
                        Thanks.

        Laura tweaks Donna's cheek.

                                   DONNA
                        James called me last night looking for
                        you.

                                   LAURA
                        When?

                                   DONNA
                        The usual, 9:15.

                                   LAURA
                        He probably wanted to drive over.

                                   DONNA
                        Were you with Bobby?  Or are you two
                        still fighting?

                                   LAURA
                        No, and yes.  I don't know what I'm going
                        to do about Bobby.  I know he is seeing
                        someone else and that's okay with me,
                        and he thinks I'm seeing someone else
                        and that's not okay with him.

                                   DONNA
                        Are you going to tell him about that
                        "someone else"?

                                   LAURA
                        I don't know what to do.

                                   DONNA
                        You know what your problem is?
                                 (smiles)
                        You're just too adorable...

                                   LAURA
                               (smiles back)
                        You know, I think you're right.  I'm just
                        too adorable.

        Donna grabs her and shakes her shoulders.

                                   DONNA
                                (sing-song)
                        Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.

                                   LAURA
                         (joining her - laughing)
                        I'm just too adorable.  I'm just too
                        adorable.

        They continue up the sidewalk laughing.

        Establish.

60.     INT.  TWIN PEAKS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

        On Laura and Donna as they walk in.

        FIVE of their ADMIRERS watch Laura and Donna with love and worship.
        They sing a kind of pining but cool CHANT with knees bent and arms
        outstretched.

                                 ADMIRERS
                        "Laura...  Donna...  Laura...  Donna..."

        On Donna as they continue down the hall.  A cool MIKE NELSON snaps
        his fingers ala Bobby for Donna to come to him.  Without missing a
        beat Donna changes directions.  Mike has to hustle to catch up with
        her.

                                   MIKE
                      (putting his arm around Donna)
                        That's why you need a real man, Babe,
                        you're tough to handle.

                                   DONNA
                        And you're the real man?

61.     INT.  OUTSIDE THE GIRL'S BATHROOM

        JAMES HURLEY moves up behind Laura and pushes close to her.

                                   LAURA
                        James...

                                   JAMES
                        Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys.
                        ed.

                                   LAURA
                        Okay.

        James smiles and walks off.  Laura enters the girls' room.

62.     INT.  GIRLS' ROOM - DAY

        Laura ducks into a stall and does a quick hit of cocaine.  The school
        bell rings simultaneously.

63.     INT.  HALLWAY IN FRONT OF TROPHY CASE - SAME

        BOBBY BRIGGS saunters into school - late as usual.  The corridor is
        empty.  Everyone else is in class.  He walks to Laura's portrait in
        the trophy case.  Kisses the glass protecting it.

                                   BOBBY
                        Hey, Baby.

        He continues on happy and ultra-cool to his class.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

64.     SCHOOL CLOCK

        It reads:  2:30.

65.     INT.  CUSTODIAN'S ROOM - DAY

        James waits for Laura amidst the cleaning drums and brooms.  The door
        swings open and Laura slides in wearing only a towel.  They embrace
        in the half light.

                                   JAMES
                        Laura, do you love me?

                                   LAURA
                        Yes, I love you.  I've told you, but it
                        doesn't really matter.

                                   JAMES
                        Why?  It does.

                                   LAURA
                        No, it doesn't...  just kiss me.

                                   JAMES
                        It does matter.  We're in love.

                                   LAURA
                        James, you don't know what you are
                        talking about.  Quit trying to hold on so
                        tight.  I'm gone...  long gone like a turkey
                        through the corn.

                                   JAMES
                        You're not a turkey.  A turkey is one of
                        the dumbest birds on earth.

                                   LAURA
                               (small smile)
                        Gobble, gobble, gobble.

        He smiles.  She kisses him and he responds.

                                   JAMES
                        Don't ever leave, Laura, ever.  I'll never
                        leave you.

        Laura moves into him.  A hopeless embrace.  His eyes full of hope and
        Laura's empty.  She pulls him to the floor to make love.

66.     EXT.  THE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

        A bell rings and, after a moment, STUDENTS and TEACHERS start to move
        out.  Bobby catches up with Laura and Donna.

66.     CONTINUED:

                                   BOBBY
                        Where were you for the last hour?  I've
                        been lookin' for you?

                                   LAURA
                        I was right behind you, but you're too
                        dumb to turn around.
                           (laughing with Donna)
                        If he turned around he might get dizzy
                        and fall down.

        Bobby grabs her roughly and spins her around.  Students stop and
        stare.

                                   BOBBY
                               (very angry)
                        I'M NOT KIDDIN'.  WHERE WERE YOU?
                        WHO WERE YOU WITH?

                                   LAURA
                        Get lost Bobby.

                                   BOBBY
                        Oh, yeah?  You'll be callin' soon and
                        maybe I'm not gonna be there.

                                   LAURA
                           (very smooth, cooing)
                        Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of
                        your smiles.

        Bobby can't hold onto his anger.  Slowly a huge smile spreads across
        his face.

                                   BOBBY
                                 (smiling)
                        Love ya, Babe.

67.     INT.  HAYWARD HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

        Donna and Laura.  Eating nuts.  Donna is stretched out on the sofa
        and Laura is in a chair with her legs over the top.  She is almost
        upside down.  Nothing going on.

        EILEEN HAYWARD rolls through the living room in her wheelchair and
        makes a quick check of the nut supply.

                                   LAURA
                        Hi, E.H.
                                  EILEEN
                           (with a nod to Laura)
                        L.P.
                                (to Donna)
                        D.H.

                                   DONNA
                        Mom H.

        Eileen motors out.

                             DONNA (continued)
                                (to Laura)
                        Are you going to see James tonight?

                                   LAURA
                        Why are you suddenly so interested in
                        who I am going to see at night?
                        Nighttime is my time.

                                   DONNA
                        You're telling me, but only because you
                        never let me in on any of it...  you're not
                        going to see Bobby, are you?

                                   LAURA
                        Maybe.

                                   DONNA
                        Oh god, Laura.

                                   LAURA
                        Well, why not?

                                   DONNA
                        Because Bobby is a loser, you said so
                        yourself.  He's a goon.
                          (she sighs to herself)
                        James is the  one.
                           (getting very dreamy)
                        He loves you with that "lasting love"...
                        "true love".

        Laura looks at Donna.

                                   LAURA
                        Yes, James is very sweet.  Why don't you
                        get out your violin, Donna?

                                   DONNA
                        Sweet?  God, he's gorgeous.

                                   LAURA
                        James is very sweet and very gorgeous.

        Donna drifts off.

                                   DONNA
                        I wonder if Mike could ever write a
                        poem?

        Both of them drift off.

                             DONNA (continued)
                        Do you think that if you were falling in
                        space you would slow down after a
                        while or go faster and faster?

                                   LAURA
                        Faster and faster.  For a long time you
                        wouldn't feel anything.  Then you would
                        burst into fire...  forever.

        Donna studies her friend and thinks about what she has said.  After
        a beat.

                                   DONNA
                        Maybe I better start our homework.

                                   LAURA
                        Okay, I suppose I should go home.

                                   DONNA
                        Call me.

                                   LAURA
                        Sure.  What do you want me to call you?

                                   DONNA
                        Call me anything just don't call me late
                        for dinner.

        They laugh.

68.     EXT.  PALMER HOUSE - DAY

        Laura coming home from Donna's.

69.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE

        Laura comes in the front door.  No one seems to be home.

                                   LAURA
                        Mom...  Mom?

        No answer - she heads up to her room.

70.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE, STAIRS AND FAN

        Laura moves up to her bedroom.

71.     INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - DAY

        Laura comes into her room and drops her books on her bed.  She goes
        to the window and opens it - takes a package of cigarettes out, pulls
        one out and lights it.

        She goes to her "public" diary which she keeps on her desk.  Opens it
        to page one takes out a packet full of cocaine.  Like a pro she takes
        out her "cocaine gadget" from her purse and takes a snort.  Then
        another.  Big sigh of relief.

        Now she moves to her "private" diary behind her dresser - gets a pen,
        ready to write and starts to freak out.  Pages are missing.  First,
        she discovers one, then more.

        Laura panics.  Dropping her cocaine gadget back into her purse and
        taking her private diary, she sprints from the room.

72.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE, ENTRANCE WAY - DAY

        Laura runs down the steps nearly colliding with her mom, SARAH PALMER,
        coming home with a load of groceries.  A cigarette in her mouth.

                                   SARAH
                        Laura, honey...
                       (smoke going into her tearing
                                   eyes)
                        Cigarette...  Cigarette...

        Laura takes it out of her mouth.

                                   LAURA
                        Can I take the car?

                                   SARAH
                        Sure honey, what's the hurry?

                                   LAURA
                        I forgot my books at school.

        Laura runs from the house.

                                   SARAH
                        Laura.

                                   LAURA
                        What?

        Laura looks back to see her mom dangling the car keys in front of her.
        Laura comes back to get the keys still holding the burning cigarette.
        Sarah sternly takes the cigarette from Laura's hand.  As they make the
        exchange.

                                   SARAH
                        You'll never be a smoker if you don't

                             SARAH (continued)
                        start.  I mean it.

        Takes a drag.  With barely a nod, Laura is gone.

73.     EXT.  TWO LANE BLACK TOP IN LOTOWN - DAY

        Laura speeds through Lotown in her mom's '56 Roadmaster Buick.

74.     EXT.  HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Laura skids up outside the apartment.  Then backs the car up to a
        darker, more enclosed area amongst some trees.  Cautiously, she gets
        out of the car and then hurries to Harold's door.

        AT THE DOOR

        Laura frantically knocks at the door.  HAROLD SMITH answers.

                                  HAROLD
                        Laura?

75.     INT.  HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Laura rushes past him to the sofa, opening the book for him to see.

                                   LAURA
                        My secret diary.  There are pages
                        missing.

                                  HAROLD
                        Who would do that?

                                   LAURA
                        Bob.

                                  HAROLD
                        But Bob isn't real.

                                   LAURA
                        The pages are gone.  That's real.

                                  HAROLD
                        Maybe.

                                   LAURA
                        Bob is real.  He's been "having" me since
                        I was 12.

        Stunned, Harold doesn't know what to do.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        The diary was hidden too well.  He's the
                        only one who could know where it was.
                        He's getting to know me, now.  He's real
                        He speaks to me.

                                  HAROLD
                        What does Bob say?

                                   LAURA
                                 (whisper)
                        He wants to be me...  or he will kill me.

                                  HAROLD
                        No...  No...

                                   LAURA
                                (strangely)
                        Oh, yes...  yes...

        Laura starts towards him frightening Harold.

                                  HAROLD
                        What?  Please.

        She allows the feeling of Bob to come over her and she begins to
        scream.  Harold steps back, but Laura grabs him.  To his face with
        a horrifying expression on hers.

                                   LAURA
                        FIRE WALK WITH ME.

        She buries herself on his shoulder.

                                   LAURA
                                (whispers)
                        The trees...  the trees...

        They break.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        You have to hide the diary, Harold.  You
                        made me write it all down.  He doesn't
                        know about you.  You'll be safe.

        She stares at Harold.  Her eyes widen, terrified with suspicion.

                                   LAURA
                        You're not Bob are you, Harold?  If you
                        are, you can kill me right now.  Kill me
                        right now, if you are.

                                  HAROLD
                        Laura, no, I'm not.  I'm not Bob.
                         (begins to shake and cry)
                        Poor Laura.  I wish I could help you.

        He holds her.

                                   LAURA
                        I hate him, I hate it.  Sometimes I love
                        it.  But now I'm afraid.  I am so afraid.

                                  HAROLD
                        But you're strong Laura...  so much
                        stronger than I...  How can I help you?  I
                        can't.  I can't even go outside.

        Laura reaches up and tenderly touches his cheek.

                            HAROLD (continued)
                        What about James?  Can't James help
                        you?  You two are so in love.

                                   LAURA
                                  (flat)
                        He's in love with a girl who's dead.
                          (handing him the diary)
                        It _is_ dangerous for you to have it.  I'm
                        sorry.

                                  HAROLD
                          (thinking only of her)
                        I'm so sorry, Laura.

        She pulls him to her and kisses him passionately.

                                   LAURA
                        I don't know when I can come back.
                        Maybe never.

        Laura slowly goes out the door.  Harold can only watch.

76.     EXT.  HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY

        Laura goes out to the car.

77.     INT./EXT.  BUICK ROADMASTER - DAY

        Laura starts the car and takes a snort of cocaine.

        Laura pulls out onto the highway.  We stay with her watching her
        face - struggling with the prospects of the terrifying future.

78.     INT.  PALMER DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        Laura rushes in to find her mom setting the table.  Sarah stops and
        stares at Laura.

                                   SARAH
                        You lied to me about those school books.
                        I found them upstairs on your bed.

                                   LAURA
                         (suspicion and paranoia)
                        What were you doing in my room?

                                   SARAH
                        I was looking for that blue sweater that
                        you borrowed which I found balled up in
                        the bottom of your closet.  Now why did
                        you lie to me?  Where did you go?

                                   LAURA
                        I had to see Bobby.  I know you really
                        don't like Bobby, but there was a
                        problem and I didn't think you would
                        understand.

                                   SARAH
                        Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me.
                        Ever.  You can tell me anything.  I'll
                        understand.

                                   LAURA
                        I'm sorry, Mom.

                                   SARAH
                        Now hurry, dinner's almost ready.  Your
                        father says he's starving.

79.     INT.  PALMER DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        Laura is already at the table.  Sarah puts the rest of the dinner on
        the table and sits down just as LELAND PALMER enters from the kitchen.
        He is pretending he is a giant.  Using a voice like a giant.

                                  LELAND
                             (big giant voice)
                        Hello, Laura.  Hello Sarah.  Where's my
                        axe?
                                 (singing)
                        "I'm hungry".

                                   SARAH
                        Oh, Leland.

                                   LAURA
                               (embarrassed)
                        Dad.

                                  LELAND
                       (suddenly speaking Norwegian)
                        Hyggelig a mote dem.  Jeg Heter Leland
                        Palmer.

        Translation is:  How are you?  My name is Leland Palmer.

        Laura and Sarah stare at him.

                                  LELAND
                        The Norwegians are coming next week
                        and I want you to learn to say what I
                        just learned in Norwegian.  So you can
                        talk to them.  I want you to learn to say,
                        "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".

                                   LAURA
                        But my name isn't Leland Palmer.

                                   SARAH
                        Neither is mine.  And can't we talk
                        about something serious for a change.

                                  LELAND
                        This is serious.  Mr. Benjamin Horne's
                        got a delegation of Norwegians coming
                        in next week and I want both of you to
                        learn to introduce yourself.  Sarah, you
                        first.

        Leland repeats his phrase for Sarah's benefit.

                                  LELAND
                        Hyggelig a mote dem.  Jeg Heter Leland
                        Palmer.

        Sarah stumbles through it.

                                   SARAH
                        Hyggelig a mote dem.  Jeg Heter Sarah
                        Palmer.

        Leland repeats his phrase back to her.  Extends his hand in a friendly
        handshake.

                                  LELAND
                        Good.  We'll practice some more.  Laura,
                        now you try it.
54.

79.     CONTINUED: (2)

        Laughingly, Laura does the same thing.

                                   LAURA
                        Hyggelig a mote dem.  Jeg Heter Laura
                        Palmer.

        After Laura is done.

                                  LELAND
                        All together now...

        Leland extends a hand to each of them.  An air of insanity seems to
        come over the Palmer dining room as they all begin to laugh
        hysterically and talk in broken Norwegian.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

80.     INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

        The clock reads:  11:30.  Laura's hands open the window and release
        the screen.  Laura silently sneaks out the window and down the side
        of her house.

81.     EXT.  SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - LATER

        A big semi comes to a stop at a wide spot in the road.  Laura climbs
        into the truck.

82.     INT.  TRUCK - SAME

        The TRUCKER smiles.  Eager.

                                  TRUCKER
                        Friend of Leo's, right?  Partyland?

        Laura begins to unbutton her blouse.  Turns and sneaks a toot of
        cocaine.

                            TRUCKER (continued)
                              (catching her)
                        Wait a minute.  Leo says this is my
                        party.

        Laura puts her hand between his legs.

                                   LAURA
                        If you can fuck and drive the party
                        starts right now.

        Momentarily taken aback, the trucker stares at her.  Laura takes his
        hand and puts it on the gear shift.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        You shift that one.  This one's mine.

        She climbs over on top of him.

83.     EXT.  THE TRUCK - SAME

        The stack blows.  The truck rolls away onto the road.  We watch it as
        it moans into the distance - the sound slowly diminishing and fading.

        Natures' nighttime sounds take over.  Finally, we hear the _hooting_
        _of_an_owl_.

84.     EXT.  PHILADELPHIA FBI OFFICE - DAY

        Reestablish.

85.     INT.  OFFICE - DAY

        Albert and Cooper.

                                  ALBERT
                        Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is
                        rising up above our heads.  Do you
                        honestly think Cole's practice of word
                        association works?

                                  COOPER
                        The very fact that we are talking about
                        word association means we are in a
                        space that was opened up by our
                        practice of word association.  The
                        world is a hologram, Albert.

                                  ALBERT
                        Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus
                        ride, isn't it, Cooper?

                                  COOPER
                        Albert.

                                  ALBERT
                        You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think
                        something is going on somewhere in the
                        world right now that is connected with
                        her murder?

                                  COOPER
                        Yes.  Either right now or right when I
                        thought of it.  The name and memory of
                        Teresa Banks is haunting me.  Lately I
                        have been filled with a knowingness
                        that the murderer will strike again.
                        Because it is only a feeling, I am
                        powerless to stop it.  And another thing,
                        Albert, when the next murder happens
                        you will help me solve it.

                                  ALBERT
                        Let's test it for the record.  Will the
                        next victim be a man or a woman?

                                  COOPER
                        A woman.

                                  ALBERT
                        What color hair will she have?

                                  COOPER
                        Blonde.

                                  ALBERT
                        Tell me some other things about her.

                                  COOPER
                        She's in high school.  She's sexually
                        active.  She's on drugs.  She's crying out
                        for some help.

                                  ALBERT
                        You're describing half the high school
                        girls in America.
                            (off Cooper's look)
                        What is she doing right now?

                                  COOPER
                     (closing his eyes to see a mental
                                 picture)
                        She is preparing a great abundance of
                        food.

        Albert lets go a small laugh of disbelief and shakes his head in
        exasperation.

86.     EXT.  DOUBLE R DINER - AFTERNOON

        Establish.

87.     INT.  DOUBLE R DINER - AFTERNOON

        Laura comes out of the kitchen stacking some of her "Meals on Wheels"
        on the counter.

        On screen it reads:

                        "FRIDAY - SIX DAYS BEFORE"

        NORMA JENNINGS and SHELLY JOHNSON watch from the cash register.
        Shelly is ringing someone out, handing back their change.

                                   NORMA
                        Shelly, would you give Laura a quick
                        hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?

                                  SHELLY
                        I'm kind of busy, Norma.

                                   NORMA
                        You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.

        With a little squeeze of the hand and a gentle shove, Norma moves
        Shelly towards Laura who is at the end of the counter.

        The door opens to the Diner and ED and NADINE HURLEY come in.  Nadine
        stops when she sees Norma.

                                  NADINE
                        I changed my mind, I don't want any
                        coffee, Eddie.

        Nadine goes out.  As she walks past Ed he looks at Norma and makes a
        "What can I do" gesture.

                                    ED
                        Sorry, Norma.

        Ed goes out.

        SHELLY AND LAURA

        Shelly approaches sheepishly.

                                  SHELLY
                        Can I give you a hand getting the dinners
                        together?

                                   LAURA
                        That's alright, Shelly.  I know you have
                        better things to do.

                                  SHELLY
                          (disregarding the jab)
                        Norma asked me to give you a hand.

                                   LAURA
                        Okay.  You can help me carry them to the
                        car.

        Shelly gathers up a pile of the dinners and takes them out to the
        "Meals on Wheels" car.

88.     EXT.  THE DOUBLE R - DAY

        Shelly loads her stuff in the back.  She returns to the diner and
        Laura follows doing the same.

        As Laura places her dinners in the back something catches her eye and
        she turns.

        LAURA'S POV

        Mrs. Tremond and her grandson are standing in the parking lot staring
        at Laura.  Mrs. Tremond waves to Laura to come over.  When Laura comes
        to them Mrs. Tremond holds out a framed picture.

                                  TREMOND
                        This would look nice on your wall.

        She hands Laura the picture.  It is a picture of a room with flowered
        wallpaper and a dark doorway in its corner.  Laura's study of it is
        interrupted by the grandson.

                                 GRANDSON
                        He's looking for a book with pages torn
                        out.  He's walking towards the hiding
                        place.  He's moving under the fan now.

        ANOTHER ANGLE

        Shelly comes out of the Diner with another load of meals.  Laura turns
        back to her and then back to the Tremonds, who are walking away from
        her and are farther away than they realistically could be.  Laura
        comes to Shelly in a panic.

                                   LAURA
                        Shelly, you really can help me.  I can't
                        do the "Meals on Wheels" today.  I just
                        can't.

                                  SHELLY
                        Okay.

        Laura runs off.  Shelly puts her load into the car as she watches
        Laura.

89.     INT.  DOUBLE R - DAY

        Shelly goes to Norma.

                                  SHELLY
                        Laura just took off.  She asked me to do
                        the run today.  Should I do it?

                                   NORMA
                        What's with that Laura?  Yeah, sure,
                        take a look around.  There's no one here
                        anyway.

                                  SHELLY
                        You're right.  There's no one here.

                                   NORMA
                        There's no one here.

                                  SHELLY
                        Norma, are you alright?

        Norma just turns away and picks up some dirty dishes.

                                   NORMA
                        Come back as soon as you can.

                                  SHELLY
                        If Leo comes here, he won't believe that
                        I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".

                                   NORMA
                        Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.

        Shelly leaves the diner.

        ON NORMA

        In the empty diner Norma walks over and sits in a booth.  She studies
        the empty diner.  After a while the cook, TOAD, calls from the
        kitchen.  A distant forlorn call.

                                   TOAD
                        Kind of quiet.

        CLOSEUP:  ON NORMA

        She starts to cry.

90.     EXT.  PALMER HOUSE - DAY

        Laura runs home.  Holding the picture from Mrs. Tremond throughout.

                                   LAURA
                            (frantic whispers)
                        He's looking for the book, he's going to
                        the hiding place!

        LAURA'S POV

        She stops and stares.  Her house suddenly looks very frightening to
        her.  She slowly crosses her front yard and enters the house.

91.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE - DAY

        Laura comes in the front door still holding the picture.  She crosses
        thru the dining room.

92.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE, STAIRS - DAY

        Laura moves ever so slowly up the stairs - the fan still and silent
        above her.

        At the top of the stairs, she stops and stares at her bedroom door.
        Her whole body is shaking.  Her hand goes out in front of her.  She
        touches her bedroom door and inches it open.

93.     INT.  LAURA'S BEDROOM - DAY

        The opening of the door reveals more and more of her room.  Suddenly
        it reveals Bob standing in her room at her dresser.  He has pulled
        the dresser away from the wall looking for something.

        ON BOB

        He is frozen.  Smiling at her.

        ON THE SCENE

        With a scream, Laura bolts from her room.

94.     EXT.  PALMER HOUSE - SAME

        Laura races out of the house still holding Tremond's picture.

95.     EXT.  PALMER'S NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE

        Laura runs across two yards to a large tree and falls to her knees,
        crying.  She looks up and sees her father come out the front door of
        her house.  She watches him cross to his car and drive away.

                                   LAURA
                             (frantic whisper)
                        What?  It can't be...  It can't be him...  no...
                        no...

        Laura is coming apart, sobbing.  Behind her, on the sidewalk,
        a NEIGHBOR has noticed her.

                                   WOMAN
                        Laura...

        A closer look reveals how upset Laura is.

                                   WOMAN
                        What...  Laura are you all right?

        Laura turns away so the woman can't see her crying.  The woman takes
        a couple of steps off the sidewalk onto the grass.

                                   LAURA
                       (trying to hold it together)
                        I...  lost my necklace...  it must have
                        fallen.

        Laura mimes that she has found her gold half-heart necklace.  She
        pretends to be clasping her gold half-heart necklace which was already
        around her neck.

                                   LAURA
                                (clumsily)
                        Oh, here it is.

        Woman moves back to the sidewalk.

                                   WOMAN
                        Well, I'm glad you found it, darling.

        Slowly, Laura stands and moves away - leaving Mrs. Tremond's picture
        on the grass under the tree.

96.     EXT.  PALMER HOUSE

        Laura stands in front of her house.  Terrified.

97.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE - SAME

        No Bob.  Listens to the house...  stands in the entrance way.

98.     LIVING ROOM - SAME

        Laura listens.  Hears nothing.

99.     STAIRS AND HALLWAY

        She stops and stares at the fan then slowly makes her way up the
        stairs towards her room.

100.    INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - SAME

        No Bob in her room.  The dresser is back in its place.  Laura races
        out.

101.    EXT.  PALMER NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY

        Laura runs down the sidewalk.

102.    INT.  HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY

        Donna answers the door.  Laura stands there out of breath.

                                   DONNA
                        Laura?

                                   LAURA
                        Donna, are you my best friend?

                                   DONNA
                        Of course...

        Laura dives toward Donna and into a hug.

                                   DONNA
                        What is it Laura?  What's wrong?

                                   LAURA
                        I just want a friend.  Just one friend for
                        just one minute...

                                   DONNA
                        Laura, how about one friend for the rest
                        of your whole life?

                                   LAURA
                        Yes, that's what I want.  Thanks D.

                                   DONNA
                        Okay, L.
                     (looks into Laura's eyes, a step
                       toward confronting something
                                 unspoken)
                        I am your friend...  always.  But
                        sometimes...  lately...  I feel that you
                        don't like being around me because I am
                        so uptight.
                            (off Laura's look)
                        No, I am uptight.  I hate it...  I don't want
                        to be this way, but Laura I don't...  I
                        mean...  I'm your friend no matter what
                        way you are.

                                   LAURA
                        You know, even when I think about your
                        face I get happier.

        They go in and sit down on the couch.

                                   DONNA
                        Do you want to talk?

                                   LAURA
                        No, I want to smoke.

        She digs for a cigarette in her purse.

                                   DONNA
                        I'm in a mess today, too.
                             (takes a breath)
                        I'm thinking about doing it with Mike.
                        What do you think?

                                   LAURA
                      (still looking for a cigarette)
                        Donna, you are such a crack up.  You
                        don't even like Mike.  Is this what you
                        are going to do to show me you are not
                        uptight.

                                   DONNA
                        This is about sex, not like.
                          (yells to the kitchen)
                        Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have
                        one of those huckleberry muffins.
                                (to Laura)
                        You want a muffin?

                                   LAURA
                        If I can smoke it.

                                   DONNA
                        You want a muffin?

                                   LAURA
                        Donna, you are a muffin.

        They hear DOC HAYWARD in the kitchen.  He walks in with a magician's
        handkerchief.  With a flourish he tries to pull something out of it.
        Instead he stands there empty handed.

                                    DOC
                        The red rose.  Where is the red rose?
                               (frustrated)
                        You know the light at Sparkwood and
                        21?  It worked right there.  I just did it
                        right there.

        Laura finds a cigarette finally and lights it.

                                    DOC
                        (stands and stares at Laura
                                 smoking)
                        Why is it that you can't smoke at your
                        home and I'm a doctor and I don't allow
                        smoking in my home and I let you smoke
                        in my home?

                                   LAURA
                        (smiling her killer smile)
                        Because you love me so much.

                                    DOC
                        I do love you, you little smoking
                        whipper snapper.

        Eileen Hayward brings out the muffins on her lap in her wheel chair.
        All four have muffins.

                                  EILEEN
                        These muffins each have at least seven
                        full huckleberries in them.

        While eating Doc takes out a piece of paper and stares blankly at it.
        The girls exchange glances about what Dad is doing as they chew on
        the muffins.  Doc is struggling.

                                   DONNA
                        Dad, what in the world are you doing?

                                    DOC
                        What the hell is this?

        Donna peeks over his shoulder.

                                   DONNA
                        It's a prescription.

                                    DOC
                        Is it?

                                   DONNA
                        Dad.

                                    DOC
                        My handwriting is so bad that now I
                        can't even read it.  You girls better
                        hurry up and graduate from high school
                        so you can take care of me.

                              DONNA AND LAURA
                        We'll take care of you.

        They go over to Doc and give him a knuckle rub.  Eileen laughs along
        with the two girls.  The phone rings and Doc gets it.

                                    DOC
                              (on the phone)
                        Yep, she's right here, Leland...
                                (to Laura)
                        It's for you.  It's your father.

        Laura goes tentatively to the phone.

                                   LAURA
                        Hello...

                              LELAND'S VOICE
                        Time to come home for dinner, honey.

        Laura hangs up the phone.

                                   LAURA
                        I gotta go.

        Donna leads Laura to the door.  There is something wrong and Donna
        is beginning to feel it.  Donna tries to cheer her up.

                                   DONNA
                        Goodbye, Muffin.

                                   LAURA
                        No, you're the muffin.

        Laura leaves.  As Donna closes the door, Laura calls back to her.

                                   LAURA
                        No, you're right.  I am the muffin.

103.    INT.  PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT

        Laura comes in the door and there is Leland at the dining room table
        ready for dinner.  Leland sees her.

                                  LELAND
                        Hi, honey, how's Donna?

                                   LAURA
                        Fine.

                                  LELAND
                        School?

                                   LAURA
                        ...school's fine...

                                  LELAND
                        Sit down...  sit down...  Are you hungry?

                                   LAURA
                        Not really.
66.

103.    CONTINUED:

        Laura just plops into her seat.

                                  LELAND
                        You didn't wash your hands before you
                        sat down for dinner did you?

        From across the table Leland looks at her fingernails.  He stands to
        come for a closer look.

                                  LELAND
                        Let me see.

                                   LAURA
                        Dad...

        CLOSEUP: LAURA'S RING FINGERNAIL

                                  LELAND
                        Your hands are filthy...  look, there is
                        dirt way under this fingernail.

        Sarah, cigarette draped from her lips, is delivering some mashed
        potatoes to the table.

                                   SARAH
                        Leland, what are you doing?

                                  LELAND
                        Look at this finger here.

        He is looking at THE FINGER.

                                   SARAH
                        Leland...

                                  LELAND
                        Laura didn't wash her hands before
                        dinner.
                          (noticing the necklace)
                        And look at this.

        He reaches for it.  Laura's hand flies up and stops him.  Leland's
        other hand comes up and she lets him take the HALF HEART out.

                                  LELAND
                        Oh, is this from a lover?

        Laura has no response.

                            LELAND (continued)
                        Did you get this from your lover?

                                   SARAH
                        They don't call them lovers in high
                        school, Leland.

                                  LELAND
                        Bobby didn't give you this?

                                   SARAH
                        How would you know if Bobby didn't give
                        her that?

        Leland starts pinching Laura's cheek.

                                  LELAND
                            (as he is pinching)
                        Did Bobby give you that or is there
                        someone new?

                                   SARAH
                        Leland leave her alone...  She doesn't like
                        that.  Stop it.

                                  LELAND
                        How do you know what she doesn't like?

        A beat then a return to what is normal.

                                   SARAH
                        Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you
                        dinner.

                                  LELAND
                        Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are
                        going to start eating till Laura goes and
                        washes her hands.

        Leland sits stoically.  Laura rises from the table.

104.    INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

        As Laura washes her hands, she stares at her reflection.  Terrified.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

105.    INT.  LAURA'S BEDROOM

        It says:  10:35.

        Sarah and Leland get ready for bed.  Leland stops, stands frozen for
        a moment, then begins to cry.

                                   SARAH
                        What is it, Leland?

        Leland can barely speak.

                                  LELAND
                        I can't remember the last time I told
                        Laura that I loved her.

        Sarah goes to Leland.  They embrace, tenderly, across the many years
        of their strained marriage.

                                   SARAH
                        Well, honey, go in and tell her now.

107.    INT.  LAURA'S BEDROOM

        Laura stares at the hands of the clock.  With a start, she looks up.
        Her father is in her room.  He stands in the doorway.

                                  LELAND
                        Laura, honey...

        He moves to her and touches her face.

                            LELAND (continued)
                        I love you.  I love you so much.

        Laura can hardly speak.  She squeezes his hand.

                                  LELAND
                        Goodnight, Princess.

        He leaves the room.  Laura watches the door close.  She sits frozen
        for a moment, with a tear in her eye, then she remembers something.

        MRS. TREMOND'S PICTURE

        The picture lies there in the night dew under the tree in the
        neighbor's yard.

108.    EXT.  PALMER HOUSE, OUTSIDE LAURA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Laura goes down the trellises and runs across the lawn.

109.    EXT.  NEIGHBOR'S LAWN - NIGHT

        Laura hunts around the tree for the picture, finally finds it.  She
        runs back towards her house.

110.    INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - NIGHT

        Laura climbs through the window and hangs the picture on a little
        hook on the wall and crawls into bed.  She turns off the light and
        stares at the picture in the dark.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

111.    INT.  LAURA PALMER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

        She is asleep.

112.    MRS. TREMOND'S PICTURE

        We hold on the picture.  As if by magic, we suddenly begin to move
        into the picture - into the room in the picture and thru the dark
        doorway in the room in the picture.

        On the other side of the dark doorway there is another room.
        Mrs. Tremond is standing in that room.  She is beckoning us towards
        her and beyond her thru yet another doorway.  We move thru the second
        doorway and on the other side of that doorway there is another room.

        Mrs. Tremond's grandson is standing in that room.  He is holding his
        hands above him as if he is grasping an imaginary glass ball.  As we
        move towards the space between his hands a ring of fire appears there
        and we move thru that into...

113.    INT.  RED ROOM

        The MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE walks into the red room to a table.
        A ring lies upon the table.

        COOPER ENTERS THE RED ROOM.  The Man From Another Place turns toward
        Cooper.

                          MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE
                        Is it future?  Or is it past?...  Do you
                        know who I am?...  I am the Arm...  And I
                        sound like this...

        The Man From Another Place puts his hand in front of his lips and
        makes an Indian Whooping sound.

        The Man From Another Place picks up the ring and moves it very close
        to us.  We recognize it as Teresa Banks' ring.  The symbols on the
        ring are identical to the symbols of Owl Cave.

        Cooper seems concerned.

                                  COOPER
                                (to camera)
                        Don't take the ring...  Laura, don't take
                        the ring.

        The Man From Another Place moves the ring towards us till the ring
        fills the screen.

114.    BACK IN LAURA'S ROOM

        Laura in a somnambular state is half awakened by a noise.  She tries
        to move her left arm, but it has fallen asleep.  She moves it with
        her right arm.

        SFX: THE NOISE

        It sounds as if someone is calling her name.

        ON LAURA

        She turns to her right to see who it is, then turning back to her left
        she discovers ANNIE BLACKBURN lying in bed with her.  Annie has blood
        around her mouth.  She tries to raise herself and strains to speak.

                                   ANNIE
                        My name is Annie.  I've been with Laura
                        and Dale.  The good Dale is in the lodge
                        and he can't leave.  Write it in your
                        diary.

        ON LAURA'S DOOR

        Her mother calls her name.  The sound is distant and mournful.

        ON LAURA

        Laura looks towards her door then turns back to Annie but she is gone.
        Filled with fear she looks down and in her hand is Teresa Banks' ring.
        SHE SCREAMS.  Again, her attention is drawn to her door and her
        mother's distant call.  Still holding the ring she gets out of bed
        and goes to her door and slowly opens it.

        It is dark on the other side of the door.

        AT THE DOORWAY OF LAURA'S BEDROOM

        In the doorway Laura gets a strange feeling in back of her and turns
        to look at Mrs. Tremond's picture.  There in the picture is Laura
        (herself) in the doorway looking back into the darkened rooms where
        Mrs. Tremond and her grandson were.

115.    MRS. TREMOND'S PICTURE

        Laura is in the picture.  In the picture Laura turns around in the
        doorway of the picture and looks down at her room.

116.    LAURA'S PICTURE POV OF HER ROOM

        Laura sees herself asleep in her bed.

        CLOSEUP: LAURA

        Asleep in her bed.

        ON THE SCENE

        She wakes up from her dream.  Trying to clear her head.  Looks at the
        photo and nothing is there -- looks like the day before.  She looks
        in her hand and the ring is gone.

        Laura gets out of bed and goes to Mrs. Tremond's picture hanging on
        the wall.  She stares at it.  She slowly takes it off the wall and
        places it in the trash.  Trembling she does two lines of cocaine.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

117.    EXT.  PALMER HOUSE - MORNING

        On screen it reads:

                       "SATURDAY - FIVE DAYS BEFORE"

        James comes by on his bike.  He beeps out a signal on the bike's horn.
        After a beat Laura runs out to him.

                                   JAMES
                        Where were you last night?  We were
                        supposed to get together.  You didn't
                        show up.

                                   LAURA
                        You were supposed to show up.  Maybe I
                        wasn't.

                                   JAMES
                        We were supposed to be together.

                                   LAURA
                        How can I be together if I'm not
                        together?

                                   JAMES
                        You're on somethin' again, aren't you?

                                   LAURA
                        James...

                                   JAMES
                        When am I going to see you?

        Leland comes out the door of the house.  Looks at Laura and James.
        Laura can feel him staring.

                                   LAURA
                        I gotta go.

        James just looks at her then guns his bike and roars away.

        Laura walks back to the front door where her father stands.

                                  LELAND
                        Who was that?

                                   LAURA
                        A friend from school.

                                  LELAND
                        A special friend?

        Laura looks at her Dad, eyeball to eyeball for a moment.  Then she
        walks past him to the stairs.

118.    INT.  THE STAIRWAY - DAY

        The fan turns slowly as Laura goes up the stairs.

                                BOB'S VOICE
                        Laura.

        Laura's head snaps around.

                                   LAURA
                        No...  No, go away.

                                BOB'S VOICE
                        I'm glad you let me talk to you.  You
                        used to not let me talk to you.

                                   LAURA
                        Go away.  I am not talking to you.

                                BOB'S VOICE
                        I want you.

        Sarah Palmer is at the bottom of the stairs.

                                   SARAH
                        Laura?

        Laura jumps.

                                   SARAH
                        Laura, now I can't find that blue
                        sweater.  Did you take it again?

                                   LAURA
                        Mom...  what are you wearing?

        Sarah looks down.  She is wearing the sweater that she is looking for.

                                   SARAH
                        My god, I am going to have another
                        breakdown.  God, god.

                                   LAURA
                        Mom, take it easy.

        Laura starts down the stairs towards her mother.

                                   SARAH
                        No, no... this can't be happening.

        Laura holds her mother.

                                   LAURA
                        Mom, you're not having a nervous
                        breakdown.

        Sarah pulls away from Laura and wanders into the living room.  Laura
        watches her go feeling helpless.

119.    INT.  JOHNSON'S KITCHEN - DAY

        LEO JOHNSON is ragging on Shelly.  He is down on his hands and knees
        showing her how to scrub the floor.

                                    LEO
                        Someone who knows how to clean knows
                        where the object was before she
                        started cleaning and then that object
                        goes back to its exact same spot.
                        Shelly, I know where everything in this
                        house is.  Sometimes on the road I
                        mentally go through this whole house
                        and picture where every item is.

                                  SHELLY
                        Lay off the bennies, Leo.

                                    LEO
                          (continuing his tirade)
                        Anybody can clean the surface of an
                        object, but dirt can find its way
                        anywhere.  To really clean, you have to
                        scrub below the surface.
                                (shouting)
                        WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY.

        He scrubs more.

                              LEO (continued)
                        That's one thing you are going to learn,
                        Shelly, - HOW TO CLEAN.  It takes
                        scrubbing, Shelly.  There is no easy way.
                        THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.

                                  SHELLY
                        As if I didn't know.

                                    LEO
                        I'm going to show you how to wash this
                        tile and then you're going to do it.

                                  SHELLY
                        Come off it, Leo.  I'm late for work...

                                    LEO
                        What did you say?

        Leo goes over the top pulls Shelly down to the floor.

                                    LEO
                        Shelly, I am not fooling around anymore.
                        The first thing you've got to WORK on is
                        a good attitude.  That's the key.
                        Anybody will tell you that.

        Gives her a good shot to the back of the head.  Shelly falls to the
        floor.  The phone rings.  Leo gets up to get the phone.

                                    LEO
                        Don't even _think_ about going anywhere,
                        Shelly.  I'm not finished with you.

        He answers the phone.

                                    LEO
                        What are you doing calling me here?...
                        No way, you already owe me money...
                        Five thousand, to be exact.

        Leo looks over at Shelly suspiciously.  (Did she hear him mention the
        five thousand?)

                                  SHELLY
                          (silently mouthing it)
                        Five Thousand???

120.    INT.  DOUBLE R - DAY

        Bobby is calling from the pay phone at the diner.  We hear the end of
        the conversation with Leo.  Bobby hangs up.  He puts in another
        quarter and dials again.  The phone rings on the other end.

121.    INT.  ROADHOUSE - DAY

        A nearly empty Roadhouse.  JACQUES RENAULT answers the phone behind
        the bar.

                                  JACQUES
                        How come you only call me when you are
                        desperate?  Are you desperate, baby?

                        You interested or not?

                                  JACQUES
                        Maybe, Bobby, baby.  Maybe.  I have
                        friend who has what you want. His
                        stuff is the best.

        Bobby starts to write information down on a napkin.

                                   BOBBY
                                 (excited)
                        Jacques...  you crazy Canadian.  This
                        sounds BIG...

123.    EXT.  PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT

        Donna drives up in her car and gets out.

124.    INT.  PALMER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        Laura is having a quick shot from the family liquor cabinet.  A knock
        on the door.  Laura pulls a jacket on and goes to the door.  Opens it
        and sees Donna.  Donna looks at her coat.

                                   DONNA
                        Where are you going?

                                   LAURA
                        No place, fast.
                                (a warning)
                        And you're not coming.

                                   DONNA
                        Come on, Laura.  I'm your best friend.

        They move back into the living room.

                                   LAURA
                            (change of subject)
                        Isn't tonight the night you are going to
                        do it with Mike?

                                   DONNA
                        Laura, aren't you going to fix me a
                        drink?

        Laura shoots her a look.

                                   DONNA
                        Where are the Cookies?

                                   LAURA
                        You mean Fred and Ginger?

                                   DONNA
                        Dancing.

        Donna looks around at all the ashtrays filled to the brim with butts.

                                   DONNA
                        (looking at the cigarettes)
                        If I had a nickel for every cigarette your
                        mom smoked, I'd be dead.

                                   LAURA
                        Gotta go, Donna.  I'll call you tomorrow.

        Laura leaves the house.  Donna trails behind.

125.    EXT.  PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT

        Laura gets into her Mom's Roadmaster and takes off.  Donna watches
        her go and gets in her car and follows.

126.    INT.  THE ROADMASTER - NIGHT

        At the first stop sign Laura takes another hit of cocaine.

127.    EXT.  ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

        Laura parks her car and gets out.  At the entrance to the Roadhouse
        she meets the LOG LADY, who seems to be waiting for her.  She steps
        close to Laura.

                                 LOG LADY
                        When this kind of fire starts.  it is very
                        hard to put out.

        The Log Lady touches her.  Her hand is cooling on Laura's head.
        Laura moves in behind it.  Pushing the cool hand into her face and
        forehead.

                                   LAURA
                                (whispers)
                        Margaret?

                                 LOG LADY
                        The tender bows of innocence burn first
                        and the wind rises - then all goodness
                        is in jeopardy.

        They look into each other's eyes.  The Log Lady turns and leaves.

128.    INT.  ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

        LOTS OF BIKERS and the usual gang.  On stage a SINGER sings.

        As Laura comes in she makes eye contact with Jacques Renault who is
        behind the bar.  Laura sits at a table.

        Jacques nods to a COUPLE of BURLY TRUCKERS who come over to Laura
        with drinks.  One of them slides her a fifty with a packet of cocaine
        inside.

                                  TRUCKER
                        Let's go around the world, babe.

                                   LAURA
                        This isn't going to get you to Walla-
                        Walla.

        They all take a drink.

                                  TRUCKER
                        You do go all the way, don't you, little
                        girl?

                                   LAURA
                        Sooner or later.

        Laura reaches below the table grabbing him hard by the balls.

                                   LAURA
                        You willing to go all the way?  Huh?  You
                        wanna do it for me.  All the way for me
                        means all the way - DEAD.

        The trucker turns a couple of shades towards white.  Donna comes in
        just as a beautiful song of lost love begins.

        Laura and Donna see each other -- As the truckers toss down bourbons
        and beer chasers, Laura gets _lost_in_the_song_and_starts_to_cry_.
        Donna just stares at her from the other side of the Roadhouse.

        AFTER THE SONG

        Donna stands and walks over to Laura's table.  She reaches down,
        picks up one of the trucker's bourbons and downs it.

                                   DONNA
                        Let's boogie.

                                  TRUCKER
                                (to Donna)
                        You part of the deal?

                                   LAURA
                            (answering for her)
                        No, she isn't.

        Laura and Donna stare at each other.  For Donna's benefit, Laura
        turns and gives a big, juicy French kiss to one of the truckers.

                                   LAURA
                             (to the trucker)
                        What was your name again?

                                  TRUCKER
                        Buck.

                                   LAURA
                        Buck, that was really nice.

        Donna grabs Buck's buddy, TOMMY, and gives him the same type kiss.

                             LAURA (continued)
                              (very serious)
                        All right, Donna.  Let's go.

129.    EXT.  HIGHWAY 21 - NIGHT

        The car barrels down the highway.  It's a beat up Chevy Biscayne,
        with a hot monster engine under the hood.

130.    INT.  CAR (BISCAYNE) - NIGHT

        Tommy drives sitting next to a case of ice cold beer.  Donna and
        Laura sandwich Buck in the back seat.  Donna takes a long swig of
        beer.  Laura hides a hit of cocaine from Donna.

                                   DONNA
                        (to Laura, a little afraid)
                        What are you doing?

                                   LAURA
                        Nothing.

        Laura laughs at Donna then holds a beer up to show Donna, then turns
        and French kisses Buck.  Donna reaches forward to the front dash and
        turns the radio up full blast.  Buck and Tommy start to whoop and
        yodel like cowboys.

        Buck does an Indian whoop in Laura's face.  Laura freezes in horror.

131.    FLASHBACK:  THE RED ROOM

        The Man From Another Place (The Arm) yodels.

132.    INT.  CAR (BISCAYNE)/HIGHWAY 21

        Slowly Laura reaches over and touches Buck's face and arm.  Buck
        uncorks another yodel.  The fear leaves Laura.

                                   DONNA
                                (to Laura)
                        I'm goin' for it.

        Donna starts making out with Buck.

133.    EXT.  BORDER TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

        Establish.  Tommy takes the car like a rocket into the parking lot
        and does a complete three sixty before rocking to a stop.  Several
        big rigs shadow the lot.  They all pop out of Buck's car sporting
        "long necks".

        Laura takes a hit of cocaine and looks up to see Donna watching.
        Buck circles Donna with his big arm and puts a toot under her nose.

                                   DONNA
                        No.
                             (turns to Laura)
                        I don't need to take this to be you
                        friend.

                                   LAURA
                        YES YOU DO, DONNA.  What a downer you
                        are!!!

                                   BUCK
                     (pointing to skid marks behind a
                             heat popping car)
                        Hey, Tommy, Jacques beat us here.

                                   TOMMY
                        Hold on, I'm chokin' the farm fed.

        Tommy stands in the lot with his back to them, pissing.

134.    INT.  BORDER TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

        The front room is a bar and restaurant with about THREE PATRONS.
        Above the bar is a sign that reads:

                   CAN - A - DO and U.S. OF FUCKIN' "A"

        The BARTENDER presses a release underneath the counter that allows
        Laura to take her three friends thru a door over which a sign hangs
        announcing in red neon letters:

                                "PARTYLAND"

135.    INT.  PARTYLAND

        The group enters a large room with the filthiest wall to wall carpet
        imaginable.  In the back corner is a small stage.  On it a three
        piece HELL-METAL BAND is building up toward oblivion.  The LEAD SINGER
        is dressed in a buffalo skin complete with at least half the buffalo
        head and horns.  He wears spray painted, day glow orange cowboy boots.

        Some HALF DRESSED GIRLS and COWBOYS are dancing to the band.  In
        darkened corners away from the stage other groups are racing the
        band to oblivion.

        Laura leans over to Donna noticing her shocked look.

                                   LAURA
                        Don't expect a turkey dog in here.

        Jacques Renault comes up to the group.

                                  JACQUES
                        Hey, slow pokes, guess what?  There's no
                        tomorrow.

        He grabs Laura up and gives her a big, sloppy wet kiss.

                                  JACQUES
                        Baby, you know why?  Cause it'll never
                        get here.

                                   LAURA
                        Hey, Jacques...

                                  JACQUES
                                 (slurred)
                        No "Jacques".  I am the Great Went.

                                   LAURA
                                (for Donna)
                        I am The Muffin.

                                  JACQUES
                        And what a muffin you have.

        The two truckers laugh with Jacques.  He mimes a gun with his right
        hand and pointing it to his forehead pulls the trigger with a weak,
        slack cheeked puff sound.

                                  JACQUES
                                 (slurred)
                        I am as blank as a fart.

        Laura winks at Buck as he SECRETLY drops a red depth charge into
        Donna's beer.

                                   LAURA
                        Hey, Donna, chug-a-lug.

        As the cowboys gather around and begin to chant, both Laura and Donna
        chug down their drinks.  They finish and Laura smiles and pushes
        Donna out onto the dance floor.

        They start to dance expertly and smile at each other.  Soon Buck and
        Tommy cut in separating the two.

        Buck dances Laura over to ANOTHER of his buddies.  The two of them
        start to unbutton Laura's blouse as they dance.

        The hell-metal band kicks into high gear.  In the pulsating red and
        black light Donna sees Laura now topless dancing and kissing with
        Buck and his friend.  Donna stops.  Jacques sweeps in.

                                  JACQUES
                        Oh, Laura's friend.  I am "The Great
                        Went".

        Jacques holds her head in his huge hands.

                            JACQUES (continued)
                        There is no tomorrow.

        DONNA'S POV

        The room starts to spin.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        WE MOVE AROUND THRU THE EVENING

136.    INT.  ROADHOUSE

        DONNA

        A completely stoned Donna is being dances around by Tommy, who is
        falling in love with her.  Through some dancing legs and feet she
        spots Laura's blouse on the floor.  Teetering she leans over, picks
        up the blouse, and ties it around her waist.

        RONETTE PULASKI, flying high, makes her way through the crowd to
        Laura.  They spot each other and give each other a hug.

                                  RONETTE
                        You smell nice.

                                   LAURA
                        Haven't seen you since I was thrown out
                        of One Eyed Jacks.

                                  RONETTE
                        (trying to focus on Laura)
                        What else did we do together?  Oh, I
                        remember...
                        (tries to dance with Laura)
                        Hey, you know what?  It's been a year.
                        She's been dead a year...  she's been dead
                        a year.

        Jacques comes up to them.

                                  JACQUES
                        The party twins.  My high school
                        sandwich.  Let's put some meat inside...

        The three of them move around together.

                                  RONETTE
                        She's been dead a year.

                                  JACQUES
                        Who?

                                  RONETTE
                        Teresa...

                                   LAURA
                        Teresa Banks?  Yeah, a whole year.

                                  RONETTE
                        Yeah, she was going to get rich...  she
                        was blackmailing somebody...

                                  JACQUES
                        That's right.  She called me.  She even
                        asked me what your fathers looked
                        like...

                                   LAURA
                                 (jolted)
                        What?  She asked about my father?

                                  JACQUES
                        But it wasn't him...  she was after a huge
                        guy, six foot four with a broken nose.
                        She said he looked just like a boxer.
                        Speaking of sandwiches...  I think Bobby
                        was arranging something for you...
                              (gets the idea)
                        Speaking of arrangements...
                                 (louder)
                        SPEAKING OF ARRANGEMENTS...  Why
                        don't you two come up to the cabin this
                        week?  Leo and I know that Santy Claus
                        is coming to town...  Thursday.

        Ronette, Laura, and Jacques sway with distorted smiles.

                             RONETTE AND LAURA
                       (as they hug and almost kiss)
                        Okay, Jacques.

                                   LAURA
                         (turning to kiss Jacques)
                        "The Great Went".

        Buck and another FRIEND move in on Laura and Ronette.  Buck pushes
        Laura down on the carpet and gets on behind her.  His friend does
        the same to Ronette.  The two girls find themselves face to face.

                                  RONETTE
                        Here we go again.  Like we're back at
                        One Eyed Jacks.

                                   LAURA
                          (moaning with pleasure)
                        Oh, god.  It sure is.

        Ronette looks over Laura's shoulder.

                                  RONETTE
                        Shit, is that Donna Hayward?

        Laura looks across the rug through dancing legs and sees Donna's head
        tilted way back with some NEW COWBOY on top of her.

        CLOSEUP: LAURA'S FACE

        Seeing Donna.

                                BOB'S VOICE
                        SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO
                        DONNA?

                                   LAURA
                                (screaming)
                        NO!  GOD, NO...

        ON THE SCENE

        Laura stumbles and runs to Donna grabbing Jacques on the way.

                             LAURA (continued)
                          (screaming to Jacques)
                        Get her out of here...  get her out.

        He doesn't seem to be listening.

                             LAURA (continued)
                                (shouting)
                        JACQUES...

        Laura falls full of panic to Donna.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Donna, what are you doing?

        Rips her blouse off her waist.  Donna is completely gone.  Laura
        shakes her and screams into her face.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever
                        wear my stuff.  Never.

                                   DONNA
                                (mumbling)
                        Okay, I won't wear your stuff...  Why
                        can't I wear your stuff?

                                   LAURA
                        Jacques, help me get her home.  NOW!

        Jacques lifts Donna up and Laura follows Jacques and Donna out of
        Partyland.  Donna continues to mumble.

                                   DONNA
                        I won't wear your stuff.
                              (then laughing)
                        I promise.

                                   LAURA
                      (crying, holding Donna's hand)
                        Not you, Donna, not you.

137.    EXT.  TWIN PEAKS CHURCH - SUNDAY MORNING

        On the screen it reads:

                        "SUNDAY - FOUR DAYS BEFORE"

        FOLKS filing out of church.  A COUPLE strolling down the sidewalk.
        A happy dog bounds about.

138.    EXT.  BIG ED'S GAS FARM AND THE HURLEY HOUSE - DAY

        Out in the yard of the Hurley House Ed Hurley tries to skin a deer
        which is hanging off a branch of a tree.  He is not having much luck
        and is not showing much enthusiasm either.  Nadine Hurley comes
        storming out the house with her own very large butcher knife - very
        upset with Ed's progress.

                                  NADINE
                        ED...  ED.
                            (pushing him away)
                        I'll take over here.

        Ed backs off and Nadine dives in slicing.

                                  NADINE
                        You were cutting this deer like a
                        sissy...  Sit down and watch while I do
                        it.  AGAIN.  THIS YEAR.

        Ed slowly backs into the house.

139.    INT.  HURLEY HOUSE - DAY

        Ed joins his assistant, SPARKY, and they stand in the living room
        gazing out the window at Nadine ferociously skinning the deer.

                                    ED
                               (with a wink)
                        Works every year...

        They laugh.

                                  SPARKY
                        Sure wouldn't work at my house.  My
                        wife couldn't take the wrapper of a
                        twinkie.

140.    EXT.  CLEARING IN THE WOODS - DAY

        SHERIFF TRUMAN and JOSIE PACKARD break from a kiss.  Smiling, Truman
        goes back to gently strumming his guitar.

                                  TRUMAN
                        Josie, I think we should go public.

                                   JOSIE
                        That would be wonderful, but it's only
                        been a year since Andrew died.

                                  TRUMAN
                        What are you afraid of?  What people
                        think?

                                   JOSIE
                        I don't want to offend the customs of
                        your country.

                                  TRUMAN
                        Believe me, Josie, you would not offend
                        the customs of this country.  For
                        instance, I don't eat fish eyes.

                                   JOSIE
                        Fish eyes?

                                  TRUMAN
                        Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't
                        eat a fish eye.

                                   JOSIE
                        Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?

                                  TRUMAN
                        I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in
                        Seattle.  He was digging through his
                        food with his chopsticks for about five
                        minutes till he found the fish eye and he
                        dropped it into his throat.  I guess it
                        must have gotten stuck in his uvula
                        because right away he started to have
                        trouble.  His throat began to flutter
                        there like there was a wind blowing.
                        And he couldn't swallow and they rushed
                        to him and loosened his collar and they
                        were asking him if he was alright and
                        he started to turn blue and his eyes
                        started to roll back into his head and he
                        still couldn't get the fish eye out and
                        they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver.  I
                        went over to him as they were
                        preparing to do an emergency
                        tracheotomy.  They were over him with
                        a knife when he suddenly shot the fish
                        eye out of his throat and right onto the
                        ceiling.  Splat!  It just stuck up there
                        and spread out.  It was about the size of
                        a half dollar.  And that's why I don't ever
                        eat fish eyes.

        He plays the guitar for Josie.  Then stops.

                            TRUMAN (continued)
                        I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's
                        just the way I feel.  It's the custom
                        thing I was thinking of.  In America we
                        don't use any part of the fish but the
                        meat just to the side of the insides.  We
                        throw away the tail, the rest of the
                        insides and the head.

                                   JOSIE
                        I understand.

                                  TRUMAN
                        We throw away the _whole_ head.

141.    INT.  MOTEL ROOM - DAY

        PHILIP GERARD, the one armed man, in a deep sweat kneels in front of
        a circle of twelve lit candles, fighting for air and struggling to
        hear something.

142.    INT.  HAYWARD HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

        Donna and Laura sit across from one another on the couch.

                                   DONNA
                        I can't remember anything about last
                        night.  Is there something I should
                        remember?

                                   LAURA
                        No, you should forget about last night.

                                   DONNA
                        Laura, I am your friend.

                                   LAURA
                        I know you are and you don't have to do
                        anything crazy to prove it.

                                   DONNA
                        You're not mad at me?

                                   LAURA
                        No.

                                   DONNA
                        I feel so bad.  I had nightmares all night
                        long.
                           (studies her friend)
                        They all knew you at that place.

                                   LAURA
                        What can I tell you?

                                   DONNA
                        How did the car get back here?

                                   LAURA
                        WE got it back, that's all.

                                   DONNA
                        How did I get in the house?  How did I
                        get into my bed?

                                   LAURA
                        I can't help you there.

                                   DONNA
                        Was I wearing something of yours and
                        you got mad at me?

                                   LAURA
                        All my things have me in them.  I don't
                        want you to be like me.

                                   DONNA
                        But I love you, Laura.

                                   LAURA
                        And I love you, too.  But don't wear my
                        stuff.

                                   DONNA
                        Why do you do it, Laura?

                                   LAURA
                        Cause I like it.

        She takes Donna's head into her hands and kisses her.

        ON LELAND

        Leland is standing at the other end of the room.  As he stares at the
        girls we move in on his face.

143.    INT./EXT.  BLUE DIAMOND CITY MOTEL

        LELAND FLASHBACK

        Leland looking into another room seeing Laura and Ronette sitting face
        to face on a bed.

144.    ON THE SCENE

        Leland looking at the girls.

                                  LELAND
                        Excuse me, honey...

        Laura turns to him with a start.

                            LELAND (continued)
                        We're late to meet Mom for breakfast.

                                   DONNA
                                (to Laura)
                        Catch you later.

        Leland and Laura leave.

145.    INT.  LELAND'S CAR - DAY

        Leland and Laura drive along.  Leland becomes preoccupied with
        something in his rear view mirror.  Laura turns to see a car
        erratically coming up behind them.  Leland slows down and stops for
        a red light at Sparkwood and Twenty One.  In front of them is a huge
        logging truck.  Laura smells something.

                                   LAURA
                        Dad, is the engine on fire?  Something
                        is burning.

        Leland turns and gives her a look.

        The car that was tailing them races around them, races around the
        logging truck, and comes back around stopping on Leland's side of
        the car.

        Leland spots Gerard, the one armed man, behind the wheel - sweating
        like crazy.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Something is burning.

        Leland starts to rev his engine while holding the brake with his left
        foot.

                                  LELAND
                        It's the engine.

                                  GERARD
                        You stole the corn.  I had it canned
                        above the store.

        Leland is panicked.  The car is slowly screeching towards the large
        lumber truck in front of them.

                                  GERARD
                            (shouting at Laura)
                        Miss, the look on her face when it was
                        opened.  There was a closeness.  Like
                        the formica table top.

        The car is now smoking and making a horrendous sound.  Gerard
        continues to yell, but we can barely hear it.

                                  GERARD
                        The thread will be torn, Mr. Palmer, the
                        thread will be torn.

        Leland turns to Laura.  Sweat pours from his forehead.

        While Leland is turned away, Gerard holds up his hand with a ring on
        the little finger.  He is shouting over the engine noise and the horn
        which Leland has begun to blow frantically.

                                  GERARD
                                (shouting)
                        It's him.  It's your father.

        Laura can't make this out over the noise.

        The light turns green.  Gerard takes off away from them.  As soon as
        the logging truck moves Leland lets go of the brake and the car flies
        into a service station on their right.  Everyone around there has been
        watching a commotion on a Sunday afternoon.

                                   LAURA
                        DAD!...  What was that all about?  Who
                        was that?

        A YOUNG MECHANIC runs up to their car.

                                 MECHANIC
                        Mr., Mr., you shouldn't do that to your
                        engine.  You ought to take it easy, Mr.,
                        you're going to burn your engine out.

                        What the hell was all that?  Why doesn't
                        someone do something about all of this.
                        My god, that guy came out of nowhere.
                        He was harassing my daughter.

        Leland stares at Laura trying to compose himself.

                                   LAURA

                        Teresa Banks.  You look so much like my

                        That sounds like fun...  Where did you see
                        my picture?...  Okay, come to the Blue

                        your side of Blue Diamond City...  I'll be
                        there.  Room one two three...  Right, as in

        LELAND

        On top of Teresa in bed.  All whispers.

                                 (smiling)
                        When's the next business trip, big fella?

                                  LELAND
                        Soon.  How about next time we party
                        with the girlfriends you told me about?

                                  TERESA
                        I can arrange that.  I like that.

        He kisses her and covers her eyes with a hand.

                                  TERESA
                        What are you doing?

                                  LELAND

                        I don't know.

                        know him?  He looked familiar.  Have I
                        met him?

                                  LELAND
                        No, you haven't met him.  Have you met
                        him?

                                   LAURA
                        No.

                                  LELAND
                        We're late to get to your mother.

                                   LAURA
                        Just sit here for a moment.  You seem
                        very upset.

                           (mumbling to himself)
                        Guy just pulls up out of the blue...  I
                        mean...  what is this world coming to?

150.    LELAND FLASHBACK - BLUE DIAMOND CITY MOTEL

        Open on a sign saying Blue Diamond City Motel.

        Leland comes down an outside walkway towards an open room.  Suddenly,
        he stops short and jumps back.  He cautiously takes a second look and
        sees Laura and Ronette sitting on the edge of a king size bed talking.

        Leland is about to leave when there is a tap, tap, tap on his back.
        He spins around to see Teresa Banks who has come up behind him.

                                  TERESA
                        What's wrong?

                                  LELAND
                      (moving further from the room)
                        Nothing, I chickened out.

        He shoves a wad of money into her hand and practically runs away.
        Teresa cocks her head and wonders, while she watches him hurry away.

        End of Flashback.

151.    BACK IN THE CAR WITH LAURA

        Leland and Laura are in the car.  Leland starts the car.

                                   LAURA
                        Are you sure you're okay?

                        Yes.

                        Yes.

                                   LAURA
                        Did you come home during the day last
                        week?

                                  LELAND
                        No.

                                   LAURA
                        Oh, I thought I saw you.

                        You know, I did come home, come to
                        think of it, on Thursday.  I had a severe
                        headache and I was driving in the
                        neighborhood so I just darted in and out
                        of the house.
                              (studies Laura)
                        Where were you, Laura?  I didn't see
                        you?

                                   LAURA
                        I was down the street.

        Laura studies the look in her father's eye as long as she dares and
        then turns away.

                        Happy Birthday, Johnny.

        Ben reacts to a huge moccasin print in the middle of the birthday cake
        in the middle of his office floor.

                                    BEN
                        Why did we have to have the party here
                        in my office?

                                  SYLVIA
                        Because Johnny wants it in your office.
                        What's so "private" "private" about your
                        office, anyway?  Why can't we have the
                        party in your precious office?

                                   JERRY
                        It's a lovely place for a party, Ben.  And
                        look at the new decorations Johnny's
                        provided.

        They look down and see Johnny's foot completely ringed in white
        frosting roses.  Frosted footprints trail behind him everywhere.

        Johnny goes one inch in front of Laura's picture.

                                  JOHNNY
                        Happy Birthday, Johnny.

        Leland looks again at Laura's picture.  He looks up at Ben.

                          (oddly confrontational)
                        Don't you have a picture of Audrey, Ben?

        That sets Sylvia off again.

                                  SYLVIA
                        Don't you have a picture of your own
                        daughter, Ben?  Where's Johnny's
                        picture?
                                (exploding)
                        And where's _my_ picture I gave you?

                                    BEN
                        At the photographer's studio getting a
                        gold frame with floral monograms of
                        your birthday and our wedding vows.

        Johnny moves one inch in front of Ben.

                                  JOHNNY
                        Happy Birthday, Johnny.

                        Uncle and Leland talk.
                             (turning to Ben)
                        Ben...  Leland, we can play the French
                        against the Norwegians.  What do the
                        French love more than anything?

                        Exactment.  They are nuts about wood.
                        They get goofy over trees.

                                  SYLVIA
                        I've never heard anything like this
                        before.  The French liking wood anymore
                        than anyone else likes wood.  Are you
                        three crazy?

                        here.

                                   JERRY
                        History is on our side, Ben.  It's no
                        accident that the great explorers were
                        named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.

                                  LELAND
                        They were looking for wood.

                               (exasperated)
                        Oh...

        As they talk Johnny circles the blowup Indian and with a mighty bang
        pops it with his tomahawk.  "Bang".

                          (looks at him, waiting)
                        I guess you're saying there's an awful
                        lot of trails for us to cover.

                                   ANDY
                        No, I was thinking what a long hike
                        Bernie has to make.

172.    INT.  BEN'S OFFICE - DAY

        Laura quietly lets herself in.  Ben looks up, happy to see her.

                        Ssshhhh, your father's in the next
                        office.  You should've seen him get upset
                        at Johnny's party about your photo here.

                        He's always been jealous of you.  You
                        know that.

        She moves in closer and kisses him.  He responds.

        PETE MARTELL pulls into the station.  Big Ed comes out to meet him.

                        Hey, Pete.  Can't believe your tank's dry
                        up at the mill.

                                   PETE
                        No...  hell, no.  Just got in the truck,
                        started drivin', looked down at the
                        gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.

                                    ED
                        You know what that Big "E" stands for?
                        Big Ed's Gas Farm.

                                    ED
                        What'll it be?

                        I haven't got it yet.

        Ed laughs.

        Ed starts to clean his windshield.  Pete points out something on the
        windshield.

                             PETE (continued)

                        I did?  I didn't see anything.

                        Yeah...  look in here.  Look at it from this
                        angle.

                        The inside is your territory.

        Pete starts to clean the inside of his windshield while Ed returns to
        work on the outside.

                              (as he cleans)
                        Even this heavy work beats being at
                        home with the old ball and chain.

181.    EXT.  THE WOODS - NIGHT

        Bobby and Laura pull into a little clearing.  Bobby kills the lights.
        The doors open.  Laura and Bobby start to make their way thru the
        woods.

182.    EXT.  THE WOODS - NIGHT

        Laura and Bobby continue thru the woods.  It gets spookier and
        spookier.

        They reach the meeting place.  Awesomely quiet until a twig snaps,
        then a distant howling of a wolf.

        Bobby and Laura sit on the floor of the woods and do some more toot.
        Laura picks up a leaf and shows it to Bobby.

        knocking him on the head with it.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Bobby, I found a pinecone.

        They giggle three times as hard and start crawling around giggling.
        Suddenly, they hear footsteps.  They freeze and try to stifle their
        giggles.

                                   BOBBY
                        Here he comes.

                                   LAURA
                        Here he comes.

        They both start laughing again.  They see a guy coming through the
        woods.  We recognize him as the sullen deputy from Deer Meadow,
        Cliff Howard.

                                   BOBBY
                            (suddenly serious)
                        Who sent you?

                                   CLIFF
                        Jacques.

                                   LAURA
                        That's right.

        The deputy takes out a very big bag of coke, showing it to them.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Wow.

        Laura just grabs it out of his hand.  The deputy takes out his gun.
        Bobby panics and pulls out his gun.  BANG!!

        Bobby shoots the deputy in the shoulder, but the deputy still prepares
        to shoot at Bobby so Bobby shoots him again.  This time in the chest.

        The deputy spins and tries to run, but Bobby shoots him in the back.
        He topples over dead.

        BOBBY AND LAURA

        They stand there frozen.  Absolutely no more giggles.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        God, Bobby.  What did you do?

        They just stand there looking at the dead body.

                                   BOBBY
                        I shot him.  Oh, my god, I shot him.

        Bobby starts for the dead body.

                             BOBBY (continued)
                        Come on, you gotta help me.

        With Laura's help they get the body back to the clearing.  They fall
        down to their knees, out of breath, staring at what they have done.
        Their faces register the shock of having just killed someone.  Laura
        looks at Bobby's stunned expression.

                                   LAURA
                        Look at your face.

        A laugh squirts out of Laura.  Bobby turns to her in disbelief.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Bobby, you killed Mike.

        Bobby stares at her for a second like Laura has gone insane.

                                   BOBBY
                        This isn't Mike.
                        (suddenly unsure - surreal)
                        Is this Mike?

                                   LAURA
                        Bobby...  ssshhhh...  you killed Mike.

        Bobby breaks.  They begin to laugh uncontrollably.

        Bobby is about to get really pissed when Laura starts laughing again.
        Bobby fights to stay in control.

                        damn bit funny.

        Laura stifles her laugh with all her might.  Bobby hands her the
        money.  After a beat Laura starts to laugh, but stops herself again
        by biting her lip.  Bobby is furious and scared.  Laura covers her
        mouth.  Bobby breaks again.

186.    EXT.  THE WOODS - DAY

        Bobby's car skids to a stop.  Bobby jumps out and pops the trunk.
        He unwraps the big bag of cocaine from a blanket.  He tears a little
        hole in it to enjoy a taste test.  The second it touches the tongue
        he panics and frantically takes a deeper test.

        Never taking her eyes off him, she works her way around him and

        We stay on Leland.  His face changes.  He knows she knows and he

                                   BOBBY
                        No shit...
                                (whispers)
                        We killed a guy for baby laxative.

                                   LAURA
                        What is the world coming to when you
                        kill a guy for baby laxative?

                                   BOBBY
                        Don't get funny with me again.

                                   LAURA
                        I'm not...  Bobby I'm gonna need some
                        more stuff.  I mean it.  I'm out.

                                   BOBBY
                        Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten
                        thousand dollars back.

                                   LAURA
                        Sure, but I can't get it till after school
                        tomorrow.

                                   BOBBY
                        Let's ditch this place and party.

                                   LAURA
                        Not tonight.  Just give me something to
                        take home to hold me over till
                        tomorrow.

                                   BOBBY
                        Why?  Why not?  Where are you goin'?

        Laura smiles and leans forward.  She kisses him and he responds.

                                   LAURA
                        Bobby, I'm goin' home.  To bed...  my nice
                        warm bed...

        They kiss again.  He looks up and listens for his parents.

                                   BOBBY
                                (whispers)
                        We can do it right here.

                                   LAURA
                                  (flat)
                        Bobby...

        Bobby sees that she is not in the mood.

                                   BOBBY
                        You don't want me.  You just want the
                        stuff, don't ya?

        Laura stares at him.

                             BOBBY (continued)
                        It's okay.

        He reaches in his pocket and gives her a nice bag of coke plus pills.

                             BOBBY (continued)
                        Bobby's got it.

                                   LAURA
                            (taking the packet)
                        Thanks, Bobby.
                          (looking at the packet)
                        And my little round friends, too.

        They head upstairs.

203.    INT.  BRIGGS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        Mr. Briggs is reading aloud to Mrs. Briggs from the book of
        Revelations.  As Bobby hears this he turns to Laura and makes a look
        of horror which says, "Can you believe I live here".  Laura smiles.

        Bobby takes Laura to the door.  He gives her a small kiss, "Good
        Night".  After she leaves he cuts back thru the living room and just
        as he clears the room he lights up.

                                  BRIGGS
                        (looking up from the Bible)
                        Robert, put out the cigarette.

        And Briggs returns to the Bible.

204.    INT.  SHERIFF'S STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

        Sheriff Truman and Andy sit at the small table with doughnuts and
        coffee.  Andy monitors the radio.  LUCY MORAN cuts thru on the
        intercom.

                                   LUCY
                            (over the intercom)
                        Sheriff Truman?

        Truman hits the intercom button.

                                  TRUMAN
                        Yes, Lucy?

                                   LUCY
                              (over intercom)
                        Mrs. Packard called and said she heard
                        what she thinks could be a prowler
                        outside her house.

                                  TRUMAN
                        Okay, Lucy.  I better get on up there.

        He releases the intercom button.  But Lucy continues to talk over the
        intercom.

                               LUCY'S VOICE
                        It's probably raccoons which is what it
                        was last week...

                                  TRUMAN
                                 (to Andy)
                        You stay here and monitor the radio.  Let
                        me know right away, if you hear from
                        Hawk.

                               LUCY'S VOICE
                        And last week I thought of the same

                                  (more)

                         LUCY'S VOICE (continued)
                        thing.

                                   ANDY
                        Okay, Sheriff Truman.

                               LUCY'S VOICE
                        Raccoons remind me of my aunt who
                        lives in Wyoming where they have
                        raccoons, too.

        Truman stands up, puts on his gun and leaves.  Lucy's voice continues
        as we watch Andy sit there alone.

                         LUCY'S VOICE (continued)
                        She couldn't get rid of her raccoons
                        because she made the big mistake of
                        feeding them albacore tuna.  I don't
                        know why she fed them albacore tuna.
                        And albacore tuna is so expensive.
                         (voice raising an octave)
                        Sheriff Truman how did you get up
                        here?

        Over the intercom Andy hears Lucy make a small hysterical cry.  He
        stands and runs from the room.  Stay on the intercom.  Lucy's voice
        continues.

                         LUCY'S VOICE (continued)
                        Andy?  Are you there?  I am very
                        confused.  Who am I talking to?  Andy,
                        are you there?

205.    INT. SHERIFF'S STATION, RECEPTION - SAME

        Lucy gets up from the intercom.

                                   LUCY
                        Maybe I'm alone.
                          (whispers, frightened)
                        Andy...  where did Andy go?

        She races from her station and collides with Andy coming up from the
        interrogation room.  They both scream.

206.    INT.  PALMER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        Sarah sits smoking and reading a cheap magazine as Laura moves thru
        the living room.

                                   LAURA
                        Good night, Mom.

                        Good night, sweetheart.

        Laura moves up the stairs.

207.    INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - NIGHT

        She does three lines of Bobby's cocaine.

        ON THE CLOCK IN HER ROOM

        It reads:  9:30.

        ON LAURA

        Trying to hold on.  The phone rings.

                                   LAURA
                                 (whisper)
                        James...  Yes, okay...  No, James, I do love
                        you, but...  Okay, I'll meet you in fifteen
                        minutes...

        She hangs up the phone and does another line of cocaine then swallows
        down a handful of red round friends from Bobby - the pills.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Fifteen minutes...  god, why did I say
                        that?...  what did I say?...

208.    INT./EXT.  PALMER HOUSE

        As Laura sneaks out she sees her dad coming home.

209.    EXT.  PALMER HOUSE

        LELAND

        Leland comes out of the car.  Laura ducks into some bushes and hides.
        Leland stops in the middle of the yard sensing something.  He looks
        right at where Laura is hiding.  She can't tell if he can see her or
        not.

        CLOSEUP: LAURA

        She hears James' bike coming in the distance.

                                   LAURA
                         (frantically to herself)
                        Go inside...  go inside...

        James' bike sounds closer and closer.  Leland turns, opens the front
        door and goes into the house.

        James drives up.  Leland's face appears looking out the front window.
        Laura jumps on the bike behind James and off they go.

210.    EXT.  HIGHWAY 21 - NIGHT

        James and Laura drive thru the night.

211.    EXT.  CLEARING IN THE WOODS - NIGHT

        James brings the bike thru the woods and stops in the little clearing.
        James tries to kiss Laura, she pushes him away.

                                   JAMES
                        What the hell is wrong with you?

                                   LAURA
                        That's right.  There's no place left to go
                        is there, James?

                                   JAMES
                        What do you mean?

                                   LAURA
                        You know it and I know it.

                                   JAMES
                        What is wrong with us?...  We have
                        everything.

                                   LAURA
                        Everything, but everything.

                                   JAMES
                        Oh, Laura.

                                   LAURA
                              (mimicking him)
                        "Oh, Laura..."

        She gives him a terrible slap.

                                   JAMES
                                 (ironic)
                        You always hurt the ones you love.

                                   LAURA
                        You mean the ones you pity.

                                   JAMES
                        Say anything you want...  I know you love
                        me and I love you.

                                   LAURA
                        I do love you.
                                (whispers)
                        Let's get lost together.

211.    CONTINUED:

        They kiss again.  Hot.  Hands everywhere.

                             LAURA (continued)
                              (breaking away)
                        Shit, maybe he'll kill you.

                                   JAMES
                        What?

                                   LAURA
                        When he finds out.

                                   JAMES
                        What?

                                   LAURA
                        Bobby killed a guy.

                                   JAMES
                        What are you talking about?  Bobby
                        didn't kill anybody.

                                   LAURA
                        You want to see...

                                   JAMES
                        See what?

                                   LAURA
                                (disgusted)
                        Right.  Open your eyes, James.  You don't
                        know me.  Even _Donna_ doesn't know me.
                        Your Laura disappeared...  It's just me
                        now.

        James grabs her trying to control her.  She twists out of his arms.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        How 'bout this, James?

        She lifts her hand and gives him the finger.  James ignores the
        finger and kisses her, but she's gone ice cold.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        I think you want to take me home now,
                        James.

        She leads him back to the bike.  He won't start it.

                             LAURA (continued)
                        Oh, quit crying.  I've had enough of your
                        fucking caring.

        He kicks the bike to a start.  Behind him, Laura watches and silently
        starts to cry.

212.    EXT.  HIGHWAY 21 - NIGHT

        Laura and James on the bike make their way down to Sparkwood and
        Twenty One.

        Laura leans way back on the bike.

        LAURA'S POV

        Looking up at the trees as they fly by in a dark blur.

        LAURA AND JAMES

                                   LAURA
                        The trees...  the trees...

        Laura screams with agony and tries to get off as they approach the
        light.  Laura falls off as they skid to a stop.

                                   JAMES
                         (confused and terrified)
                        Laura...

        Laura crawls back up and puts her hands around James' neck.

                                   LAURA
                        (from far away she screams)
                        JAMES, I LOVE YOU.

        For a moment she focuses on him.  She looks like the Laura that James
        loves.  Innocent and Beautiful.

        Laura turns and sees the woods.  It pulls her.  She releases her hold
        on James and runs into the waiting darkness.

        The red light swings in the wind above James.  It turns green, but he
        doesn't move.  When the light turns red again, James guns the engine
        and lifts the bike up on its back tire.  James screams then roars down
        the road away from us.

        Off to the side of the road lies Doc Hayward's wilted red rose.

213.    EXT.  PACKARD LOGGING ROAD - MIDNIGHT

        Laura runs up thru the woods.  At the Packard Logging Road Laura
        meets Jacques, Leo and Ronette all standing around Leo's red corvette.

                                  JACQUES
                        Right on time, baby.

                                   LAURA
                        Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.

213.    CONTINUED:

                                  JACQUES
                        We're on our way, Baby.

                                   LAURA
                        Let's go _all_ the way.

        They pile into Leo's 'Vet and peel down the dirt road.

214.    INT.  JACQUES' CABIN - NIGHT

        The foursome getting roasted and toasted - very high.

        Jacques starts to tie Laura up with some light rope.

                                   LAURA
                           (drugged, screaming)
                        Don't tie me up, tonight.  Don't tie me
                        up.

        Jacques and Leo laugh.  Jacques starts to tie Laura up while Leo holds
        her.  Laura struggles and screams begging them not to do it.  With
        Laura tied up, Leo starts to tie up Ronette.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

215.    INT.  JACQUES' CABIN - LATER

        Both girls are half naked and have been tied up.  WALDO the bird is
        screeching.  Jacques is straddling Laura and is hurting her badly.
        Leo puts a One Eyed Jacks THOUSAND DOLLAR POKER CHIP in her mouth.

                                    LEO
                        Bite the bullet, baby.

        Like a ghost Leland appears in the window.

        No one sees him.

        Laura continues to scream.  Leo gets up and goes for the bottle of
        bourbon.  He takes a swig and then steps back to Jacques and Laura.

                                    LEO
                           (referring to Laura)
                        Let me have a little of that.

                                  JACQUES
                         (pointing at the bourbon)
                        Let me have a little of that, baby.

        Leo holds the bottle tight.  Jacques stands up and decks Leo with his
        big French Canadian paw.  He grabs the spilling bottle from the floor
        and stumbles outside.

216.    EXT.  JACQUES' CABIN - NIGHT

        When Jacques comes out of the cabin, Leland trips him, grabs the
        bottle and breaks it over Jacques head, knocking him out cold.

        Leo hears the crash and comes outside.  He sees Jacques bleeding on
        the ground.  He panics and weaves down the hill to his corvette and
        takes off.

        Leland goes into the cabin.  His smiling eyes are on Laura while he
        rapes Ronette.  Laura watches as her fear drives her to hysteria.

217.    EXT./INT.  LOG LADY'S CABIN - NIGHT

        In the darkness the Log Lady holds her log and listens.  She hears
        distant screams.  The camera moves down her leg to reveal her tattoo,
        beet red and burning.

218.    EXT.  TRAIL - SAME

        Philip Gerard, the one-armed man, runs like a madman up the trail
        towards Jacques' cabin.

219.    EXT.  PATHWAY FROM THE CABIN - NIGHT

        With the face of the devil, Leland double time marches Laura and
        Ronette out the cabin door and thru the woods.

                                   LAURA
                    (screaming - pleading for her life)
                        DADDY...  DADDY...

220.    EXT.  JACQUES' CABIN - NIGHT

        Gasping for breath Gerard arrives at the cabin too late.  He stares
        at the open doorway.  Jacques lies passed out at his feet.  Gerard
        cocks his head straining to hear something.  He hears distant screams.

                                  GERARD
                        Bob, I can hear you singing.

221.    INT.  TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

        Leland hauls the two girls into the train car.

        He SLIDES THE DOOR SHUT and it is completely quiet.

        BOB AND LELAND going in and out like breathing.  The two girls shudder
        in the corner as he circles them.

        Leland grabs Laura and begins to wrap the twine around her arms
        bending the arms back.

                                   LAURA
                                (whispers)
                        Are you going to kill me?

222.    EXT.  WOODS - NIGHT

        Gerard tearing thru the woods.  The wind comes up carrying with it
        cries and screams and the sounds of BOB.

223.    INT.  TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

        Leland hoists Laura up so that she hovers facing the floor a foot
        off the ground.  He places a mirror on the floor directly under her
        face.

        IN THE MIRROR

        Laura sees herself turn into Bob.  Leland screams into space.

                                  LELAND
                        DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.

                                   LAURA
                        NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.

                                  LELAND
                        I always thought you knew it was me.

                                   LAURA
                         (into Bob in the mirror)
                        NO!  YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.
                                (to Leland)
                        KILL ME.

224.    EXT.  TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

        Gerard arrives outside.  He bangs on the train door.

                                  GERARD
                        LET ME IN.  LET ME IN.

        The door opens a little bit because Ronette is pushing it with her
        feet.  Gerard reaches up to help her when suddenly she flies over
        his head having been hit.

        Ronette hits the ground, her unconscious head bent back at an odd
        angle.

        ECU: GERARD

        He listens to the sounds of murder inside the train car.

225.    INSIDE THE TRAIN CAR

        Laura screaming

        Knife entering flesh.

        Bob screaming.

        Bloody knife thru the air.

        Leland screaming.

226.    EXT.  TRAIN CAR

        ECU: GERARD

        Gerard leans in to take a look and steps back laughing.  he yells out
        for Bob to hear.

                            GERARD (continued)
                        THAT'S HIS OWN DAUGHTER YOU'RE
                        KILLING.

        He continues to laugh and runs away from the train car.

        A few moments later Leland stumbles out of the car carrying the body
        of Laura Palmer wrapped in a plastic shroud.  Leland's shirt is puffed
        out - a bloody towel inside.

227.    EXT.  WOODS/RIVER - NIGHT

        Leland/Bob lowers the plastic shrouded Laura into the river.

228.    EXT.  GLASTONBURY GROVE - NIGHT

        Leland stumbles to the centre of Glastonbury Grove and stops.  A
        frightening wind carries haunting music.  He digs into his pockets
        for the pages torn from Laura's secret diary.  he tosses them and
        the bloody towel to the wind.

        He goes to the centre of the circle of the twelve sycamore trees.
        The red curtains appear and he passes between them entering the red
        Room.

229.    INT.  THE RED ROOM

        It is not empty.  Gerard is just leaving the other side of the room.

        LELAND walks thru the Red Room after him.  He walks down a corridor
        and _into_the_Red_Room_again_.

        There on the other side of the room Leland sees Gerard and the Man
        From Another Place sitting side by side in a chair facing him.

        Leland stops when he sees them.  He divides.  One half becomes Bob -
        opaque.  The other half floats up and becomes Leland - transparent.

        ON BOB

        He reaches up and grabs Leland's wound.

        ECU - LELAND'S WOUND

        Bob heals Leland's wound.

        ON THE SCENE.

        Gerard and the Man From Another Place speak in unison.

                            GERARD/THE MAN FROM
                               ANOTHER PLACE
                                (subtitled)
                                (in unison)
                        Bob, you're not going home without me.  I
                        want all my garmonbozia.  (corn)

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

230.    EXT.  WATER'S EDGE BY THE PACKARD SAWMILL - DAWN

        At high tide Laura Palmer's body is floating up to and bumping against
        the logs.

231.    EXT.  GLASTONBURY GROVE

        On screen it reads:

                            "TWO MONTHS LATER"

232.    INT.  HOSPITAL EMERGENCY WARD - NIGHT

        Annie is being brought in on a stretcher.  A NURSE talks to a
        PARAMEDIC as they rush her towards the emergency room.

                                   NURSE
                        What happened?

                                   MEDIC
                        I don't know.  Sheriff Truman just
                        brought her in from Glastonbury Grove.

233.    INT.  THE RED ROOM

        The Man From Another Place stands with Cooper.

                          MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE
                        Is it future?  Or is it past?...  Do you
                        know who I am?...  I am The Arm...  And I
                        sound like this...

        The Man From Another Place puts his hand in front of his lips and
        makes an Indian Whooping sound.

                                  COOPER
                          (looking at the table)
                        Where is the ring?

                          MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE
                        Someone else has it now.

                                  COOPER
                        That would indicate that it's the future.

                          MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE
                        The later events have never been kept a
                        secret.

                                  COOPER
                        Where am I?  And how can I leave?

                          MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE
                        You are here and there is no place to
                        go...

        A pause.

                          MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE
                                 (shouts)
                        BUT HOME!

        The Man From Another Place begins to laugh uncontrollably.

234.    INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

        A NURSE mops the sweat from Annie's forehead.  Annie tries to get
        thru to her.

                                   ANNIE
                        My name is Annie.  I've been with Laura
                        and Dale.  The good Dale is in the lodge
                        and he can't leave.  Write it in your
                        diary.

        The nurse pats Annie's forehead and takes her hand.  We see
        _TERESA/LAURA'S_RING_ on Annie's ring finger.  The nurse gently
        slides the ring off Annie's finger.

235.    INT.  ANOTHER ROOM IN THE HOSPITAL

        The nurse enters.  With an anticipatory smile, then a selfish laugh,
        she puts the ring on her finger.

236.    INT.  HOTEL ROOM, GREAT NORTHERN - NIGHT

        Doc Hayward and Sheriff Truman watch the door of the bathroom
        anxiously.

                                  TRUMAN
                        Coop...  Coop...

                                    DOC
                        Cooper are you alright?

        Not getting any response Truman breaks open the door.

237.    INSIDE THE BATHROOM

        Cooper, in his pajamas, lies on the floor.  The mirror above the sink
        is shattered with blood all over it and the sink.  Cooper smiles up
        at them strangely.

                                  COOPER
                            (smiling strangely)
                        I slipped and hit my head on the mirror.
                        The glass broke as it struck my head.
                                 (laughs)
                        It struck me as funny, Harry.  Do you
                        understand me, Harry, it struck me as
                        funny.

                                    DOC
                        You are going right back to bed.

        Doc and Truman help Cooper up.

                                  COOPER
                        But I haven't brushed my teeth yet.

        Cooper smiles at the uneasy pair.

238.    BLACK LODGE/RED ROOM

        Laura is sitting in a chair.  As the end credits begin...

        We move back to see that Laura is sitting in Cooper's lap in the
        same chair.

                                                        FADE OUT.

                         FADE IN:

          INT. PASSENGER JET - EARLY MORNING

          Sleepy thick fatigue, the end of a red-eye flight. Most
          passengers still asleep, a few read, or stare blankly.
          In business class, A HUSBAND and WIFE, mid-30's. He's awake,
          reading a document. She sleeps nestled against his shoulder.
          He's trim, sharp, good looking in an academic way. Even in
          sleep, she's beautiful. Wide-mouthed and honey-haired.
          The plane's aspect SHIFTS, the pilot's voice comes on in
          German. The man lifts his window shade, peers out at the
          first rays of sun touching the skyline of Berlin.

          EXT. TEGEL AIRPORT, BERLIN - EARLY MORNING

          Halo of lights. Giant talons, the airplane's LANDING GEAR
          appears through cloud. Tires hit slick asphalt.

          INT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL, TEGEL AIRPORT - SAME

          The couple. Dr. Martin Harris and Elizabeth Harris. WIDER: a
          German IMMIGRATION OFFICER glances up at MARTIN and LIZ. KA-
          CHUNK! KA-CHUNK! Stamps both passports, swipes the bar
          codes over a scanner, hands them back. Martin slips his into
          a leather briefcase.

          EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL, TEGEL AIRPORT - DAWN

          Raining. A melee of travelers and vehicles. Liz beside him,
          Martin wheels a baggage cart through the crush. An ATTENDANT
          ushers them toward a waiting cab and DRIVER...
          a CRASH of THUNDER -- the rain suddenly triples in
          strength. A DELUGE. The taxi driver hustles Martin and Liz
          towards his car. He shields his head with a newspaper,
          piling their bags into the trunk, cursing.
          Martin sets down his case, moves to help the driver...

          I/E. TAXI CAB - DAWN
          The DRIVER merges onto the autobahn. Liz yawns with jet-lag,
          studies Martin who stares out at the passing city.

                         LIZ
          Hey... You're gonna do great.
          You always do.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          I/E. TAXI/HOTEL IMPERIAL, BERLIN - MORNING
          Modern 'Deco Revival' hotel/conference center. A banner
          welcomes delegates to the World Biotechnology Forum. The
          Harris' taxi pulls up in the forecourt thick with red-eye
          travelers arriving for early morning check-in.
          Martin takes out his billfold.

                         MARTIN
          I'll do this. You check in.
          Liz pecks his cheek, gets out. Martin leans forward.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          How much do we owe you?

          INT. HOTEL LOBBY - SAME

          Liz presses up to the crowded desk. A busy RECEPTIONIST
          takes Liz's booking slip.

                         LIZ
          The Eisenhower suite. Dr. and
          Mrs. Harris.

          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT - SAME

          A BELLHOP holds a large umbrella up to the rain, loads the
          Harris' bags onto his cart. Shuts the trunk, the taxi pulls
          away. Heading for the entrance...

                         BELLHOP
          Welcome to the Hotel Imperial.
          Have you stayed with us before?

                         MARTIN
          No, this is our first visit to
          Berlin. We're --
          -- he stops short, staring at their bags, stacked on the
          luggage cart. He turns, tracks the their taxi, already
          pulling out of the drive...

          INT. HOTEL LOBBY - SAME

          a stab of concern on Liz's face.

                         LIZ
          What do you mean the suite may
          not be available?

          Security inspections of the rooms
          are still being completed.

          But we confirmed two months ago.
          Receptionist raises an apologetic hand as she attends to a
          ringing phone. Liz sighs, glances back toward the entrance.
          Suddenly curious as she sees...

          LIZ'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH THE GLASS WALL
          . Martin standing in the open door of the next taxi in
          line. He speaks to the bellhop who nods, quickly pushing the
          cart in through the doors, headed for Liz...

          Martin getting in, agitated.

                         MARTIN
          Tegel airport. Arrivals. Quick.
          The driver pulls out into traffic. The rain still heavy.
          Martin stares out at the wet city. Eyes track as the shadowy
          columns of the Brandenburg Gate pass by. He lets himself
          relax a little, enjoying this moment of forced calm.
          He catches sight of the driver in the rear-view. Young,
          female, shortish hair. Tomboy cute. Smart eyes, older than
          her years. Layers of clothing. GINA.
          She glances into the mirror, catches Martin watching her.

                         GINA
          Everyone says how much it's
          changed. Berlin.
          Eyes connect, brief. Wipers flip-flap.

                         MARTIN
          .I wouldn't know. First time.

                         GINA
          Yes, me too. I mean, I wouldn't
          know either. You're American?
          He looks back at her, inquisitive...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          For the airport, it's always
          Americans in the morning...
          Asians at night.

          Martin nods, pulls out his phone. Service dies as Gina
          downshifts, Doc Martins working the pedals, accelerates away
          from the large "Flughafen" (Airport) sign, down a cobbled
          road next to main route.

                         MARTIN
          I think you missed...
          He stops, smiles as he realizes she's navigated around a
          large construction back-up, saving them time.

                         GINA
          You do what you do, I do what I
          do, right?

                         MARTIN
          What do you do, when you're
          not...?
          She laughs. He smiles, nods. Okay, dumb thing to say.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Sorry, I didn't mean anything --

                         GINA
          It's okay. I know what you
          meant.
          Her eyes meet his in the mirror.
          She swings the taxi onto Wilhelmstrasse. Stops at a red
          light. Ahead, the Marshall Bridge over the River Spree.

          LIGHT TURNS GREEN
          Gina moves the taxi mid-stream in the traffic heading onto
          the bridge. Martin checks his phone, he's got service. He
          starts to dial...
          Suddenly -- the cars in front of her start VEERING WILDLY IN
          DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, just missing the boxed REFRIGERATOR
          tumbling off the truck in front of them. The box BURSTS
          open. Gina swerves to avoid it, CLIPS the corner...
          front tire BLOWS OUT... taxi skids crazily, HITS the
          CURB. Tires SHREDDING... shower of SPARKS. Taxi SLAMS over
          the curb, THROUGH the rail. Plunges off the bridge.

                         MARTIN'S FACE
          Strangely serene. Intense vivid IMAGES... the playing card
          'ACE TAXIS' logo on the dash... GINA'S EYES in the MIRROR...
          Silent free-fall dive. Timeless. Dreamlike.

          Martin's head SMACKS against the side window. Gina cushioned
          by the airbags, which she wrestles back. WATER SPRAYS IN.
          Gina can't open her door. Steel steering-lock on the floor.
          Grabs it, SMASHES the side window. Hauls herself out...

          INTO THE RIVER
          . gasping. On the bridge above, people frantically flag
          down traffic... Gina turns, sees the Taxi, midstream,
          sinking. Martin still in back, unconscious.
          No time. Gina gulps air, dives. She reaches into the front
          of the cab, grabs the steering lock, HAMMERS it against the
          passenger window, glances up:
          THE SURFACE, starts to recede as the taxi slips underneath,
          sinking...
          Gina hammers at the glass again, it BREAKS. Grabs Martin's
          limp body, drags him up to the surface.
          A CROWD ON the bank. People wading out to help. Taking
          Martin from her, carrying him up onto dry land. LIGHTS,
          SIRENS... The POLICE arriving, pushing back the crowd.
          PARAMEDICS quickly laying Martin out on the concrete.
          Everyone's focus on the unconscious man. Gina eases back...
          melts away into the growing horde of on-lookers as the
          paramedics rip open Martin's shirt...
          feeding a tube down his throat. Pushing on his stomach.
          DEFIBRILLATOR paddles. WHINE as defibrillators charge.

          the audience. LAUGHTER of rapt students. Loud APPLAUSE. A
          jovial older COLLEAGUE eagerly shaking Martin's hand...

          SMASH BACK TO THE RIVER BANK...
          Paddles on Martin's chest. Paramedic calls out:

          SMASH CUT INTO MEMORY -- TWO BODIES MOVING...

          Martin's chest rising up...

          SMASH CUT AGAIN -- LIZ...

          Turning toward us. Smiles. Her lips moving...

          Martin's body slumping back. Sudden QUIET now, the world
          removed. Just his face. His eyes.

          MARTIN (V.O.)
          They say your whole life flashes

          It's only when you step back that
          you get the whole picture...

          she hurries from the room.
          We REVOLVE... finding... MARTIN HARRIS. Arms by his sides.
          A few days beard. A sutured cut on his temple. His eyes
          fluttering, barely open... then closing.
          Clipboard beside the bed. An admission form. In German.

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. - HIS SURROUNDINGS...
          Vision BLURRED, BLINKING to focus. Scrubbed floor, white
          walls, Banks of drips and monitors, his possessions on a

          Wenn Sie mich horen konnen,

          He watches as Martin's eyes tilt. Look directly at him. A
          sound. A dry croak... slowly forms itself into speech:

          in the Waldfriede Hospital. I'm
          the head neurologist here. You
          have been in an accident.

          Where are you staying? Is there
          anyone here, in Berlin, that we

                         MIGHT --

          hurt? Where is she --?!

                         FARGE
          Doctor Harris, it's all right.
          The taxi you were in went into
          the river. You were the only
          passenger. Your heart stopped
          for six minutes. It is Thursday,
          November 27th. For four days you
          have been in a coma.

                         MARTIN
          Thanksgiving... but my wife...
          she's in Berlin with me. Where
          is she? Why isn't she here?

                         FARGE
          We didn't find any identification
          with you, Doctor Harris... the
          driver, who saved your life,
          disappeared soon after the
          accident and no one else has come
          forward. I must apologize, but
          we had no idea who you were.
          It sinks in. Martin shakes his head wretchedly.

                         MARTIN
          Oh, Jesus... Liz doesn't know...
          She'll... she'll be worried sick.

          Where can we reach your wife?
          Does she have a cell phone?

                         MARTIN
          Yes... yes, she does... it's... I
          can't remember...
          His voice trails off. A long beat. Farge asks gently:

                         FARGE
          Can you tell me what you do
          remember, Martin? Do you
          remember what day it is?
          A beat. Giving it thought... then:

                         MARTIN
          Thanksgiving. You told me that.
          I remember... almost everything.
          But I don't know how I got here.
          Another beat. He shakes his head. Scared...

                         FARGE
          It's called retrograde amnesia.
          With severe trauma of this kind,
          memories get lost, or fractured.
          Most return... although it's
          unlikely you'll ever fully recall
          the events around your accident.

                         (BEAT)
          In the meantime, let us see if
          anyone has filed a report looking
          for a Martin Harris, okay?

                         MARTIN
          Yes, yes... okay.

           backplate: "E.H. to M.H. 7.18.03".

          FLASH OF MEMORY...
          Snow falling outside a warmly lit living room. A fire
          crackles. Martin unwraps a present: The Watch. He turns it
          over, reads the engraving, smiles up at Liz across from him,
          beautiful, also smiling...

          BACK IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          .She gave it to me, our
          anniversary.
          The Nurse smiles, shakes her head, not understanding.
          Martin sets the watch down, picks up the little blue book
          beside the watch -- 'Horticus' -- the classic botanical
          reference. He flicks through it, reads the handwritten
          inscription: "For Martin, that he may discover the worlds
          inside..." A distant smile...

          FLASH OF MEMORY -- GENTLE, LESS VIOLENT
          Martin as a child sits with his father in his father's study.
          His father shows him the illustrations in the new book.
          Martin's eyes are wide.

          BACK IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM
          Martin starts to close the book, tracks some NUMBERS,
          handwritten on the endpaper. A beat.
          He shuts the book, glances at the TV, silently playing the
          local English language TV News: "Prince Fahad arrives in
          Berlin..." Biotech Forum logo. A striking 30-something
          Saudi man shakes hands with German dignitaries. A shot of
          the Hotel Imperial...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Hotel Imperial... I'm here for
          the Forum...

                         (FRANTIC)
          Doctor! Please, get the Doctor.

          INT. EISNENHOWER SUITE, HOTEL IMPERIAL

          A high-end suite, empty, but with the signs of someone
          staying there. The phone rings... and rings...

          INT. NEUROLOGICAL WARD, RECEPTION AREA - MINUTES LATER

          Martin fully dressed. Farge has just hung up the phone,
          trying to reason with him.

                         FARGE
          -- you have to realize the risk --

                         MARTIN
          Doctor, I've been gone for four
          days. My wife is out there, in a
          city she doesn't know. She must
          be terrified... I need to find
          her before --

                         FARGE
          -- Let me call the hotel again.
          We can leave a message...

                         MARTIN
          Yes, fine, but look, I know her.
          She's looking for me. You're
          married, aren't you? What would
          you do?
          Farge tracks his own wedding band. A long beat. He sighs.
          Not happy about this at all.

                         FARGE
          This is my card. Any nausea,
          dizziness, difficulty with
          speech, you contact me
          immediately. Do you understand?

          EXT. HOTEL IMPERIAL FORECOURT - NIGHT

          A Taxi pulls up. Familiar biotechnology forum banner.
          Martin gets out, strong Deja Vu. Trying to orient.

          INT. HOTEL IMPERIAL - CONTINUOUS

          Eyes peeled for a possible glimpse of Liz, Martin heads for
          elevators. HOTEL SECURITY is everywhere. An entrance to a
          ballroom is flanked by guards, checking IDs and invitations.

          INT. 14TH FLOOR, HOTEL IMPERIAL - NIGHT

          DING. Martin steps out into carpeted silence, makes his way
          down the hall to the 'Eisenhower Suite.' About to knock when
          he sees the door is ajar. A beat. Martin pushes it open...

                         MARTIN
          .Liz?

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

          . hallway leads into the spacious sitting room. No one
          there. Draped over a chair, Martin recognizes Liz's jacket.
          Martin smiles, blinks against tears, he's home.
          Sound of MOVEMENT from the BEDROOM DOOR...

                         MARTIN
          Liz! I'm here, I...
          A HOTEL MAID appears from the bedroom door. Startled as she
          sees Martin...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          My wife... Meine Frau... I'm
          looking for Mrs. Harris...
          She suddenly gets him... nodding, pointing down.

                         MAID
          Ah. Entpfang... reception...

          INT. HOTEL IMPERIAL, MEZZANINE LEVEL - NIGHT

          World MUSIC. GUESTS flow in through the ornate doors. Martin
          moves among them. Significantly under-dressed in his
          tattered jacket, the sutured head injury. Almost at the
          doors... when a hotel SECURITY GUARD intercepts him.

                         GUARD
          Excuse me, sir. Do you have an
          invitation, sir?

                         MARTIN
          No... I mean yes...
          Distracted, still looking at passing faces...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          I don't have it with me. My
          name's Harris, Dr. Martin Harris.
          I'm on the list. My wife is
          Elizabeth Harris.

          I'm trying to find her. I've
          been in the hospital.
          As the guard checks a screen, a crop-haired man in a cheap
          suit nearby tracks them: HERR STRAUSS, head of hotel
          security. He approaches, also checks the screen as the guard
          speaks to him quietly in German.

                         STRAUSS
          Dr. Harris. Do you have any
          other identification? Passport?
          Drivers license?

                         MARTIN
          I've already told this gentleman,
          I've been in the hospital. I was
          in an accident...
          Martin sees someone through the crowd...

          P.O.V. -- ENTERING FROM THE FAR DOOR
          a striking, intense-looking man with dark, wiry hair, a
          designer laptop bag slung over his shoulder. Smiling, arms
          around his two ten year old daughters, twin GIRLS, prettily
          dressed. Immediately the center of attention. People moving
          forward to meet him. Flashguns POP...
          MARTIN, raises his hand, calling out:

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Professor Bressler!
          Words lost in the noise. Martin pushes toward him. But:

                         STRAUSS
          I'm sorry, sir...

                         MARTIN
          That's Professor Bressler, right
          there. He knows me, he can
          confirm who I am.

                         STRAUSS
          If you would be patient, sir.

                         MARTIN
          No, I'm done being patient...
          Martin stops short. Staring past them:

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          That's her, that's my wife. Over
          there. By the buffet table.

          P.O.V -- GLIMPSED THROUGH THE CROWD
          Liz. Looking superb in a black evening dress. In
          conversation with a group of men and women.

                         MARTIN
          Seeing her. The look on his face. Processing... an
          overwhelming mixture of confusion and relief.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          That's her. That's Liz, my wife.
          Strauss stares at him blankly. Martin starts to lose it.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Look I have been missing for four
          days and she has no idea what
          happened to me! So you need to
          take me to her, right now.
          Heads are turning. A beat. Herr Strauss mutters to the
          guard, then beckons Martin to accompany him inside.

          MARTIN AND STRAUSS
          thread through the crush. Martin ignoring the glances he's
          getting. His eyes fixed on Liz... her back to him. A glass
          of wine in her hand... her golden hair... the ivory skin of
          her shoulders. Strauss taps her on the arm. She half
          turns...

                         STRAUSS
          Excuse me Madam. Your husband is
          here. He needs to --

                         MARTIN
          Liz...
          Liz turns fully. That beauty. A flash of surprise as she
          sees Martin. His clothes. The suture on his head.

                          MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Oh, Jesus Liz, I --
          Moving in to embrace her... abruptly she steps away from him,
          a flustered look of confusion on her face. Beat.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Liz, I... I was in an accident.
          I was in the hospital, in a coma
          I'm so sorry, they didn't
          know who I was ---

                         LIZ
          Excuse me... do I know you?

                         CONTINUED: (3)
          Liz stares at him, nonplussed. Her group also staring.

                         MARTIN
          Liz...? Please. It's me.

                         LIZ
          And just who might 'you' be?
          Amused whispers. Martin, bewildered, growing angry.

                         MARTIN
          It's me. Martin. Your husband.
          Liz half smiles, glances around. Is this a joke? To the
          security guard, flustered:

                         LIZ
          This is a... misunderstanding.
          I... I don't know this man. This
          is my husband... Martin.
          She calls to a MAN nearby engaged in conversation. Mid-30s
          like Martin. Elegant, groomed, athletic... conspicuously more
          handsome in a chiselled way. Know him as MARTIN B.

                         MARTIN B

                         (COMING OVER)
          What's up?

                         STRAUSS
          You are Dr. Harris?

                         MARTIN B
          Last time I looked...
          He checks his name tag. There it is: 'Dr Martin Harris.'

          MARTIN B (CONT'D)
          Yeah... still me.
          More laughter. Martin pales. A beat. Turns to Liz.

                         MARTIN
          Is this some kind of a joke?

                         LIZ
          What are you talking about... ?

                         MARTIN
          -- because it really isn't funny.

                         LIZ
          joke about what?

                         MARTIN

                         MARTIN
          I've been in the hospital for
          four days! Where were you? Were
          you even trying to find me --?!
          Moment's strained silence. Strauss unsure what to do,
          signaling a guard. Martin B steps in...

                         MARTIN B
          Look, You seem like you've had an
          accident, or perhaps --

                         MARTIN
          -- who the hell are you!?

                         MARTIN B
          Okay, okay. Can you please just
          get him out of here?
          Martin rounds on Martin B. Jabs a finger.

                         MARTIN
          You. Whatever you think you're
          doing, you need to stop it.

                         (TO LIZ)
          Liz, please. This is...
          He tries to put his hand on her arm. Liz shies away. Martin
          B between them now. Martin shoving him back.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Get out of my way --!
          Guard GRABS Martin's shoulder. Martin shakes him off. Guard
          grabs him again. Martin elbows him. A scuffle.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Liz --! Please...
          . Martin's hauled back... away from Liz.

                         STRAUSS
          If you don't leave now, sir,
          we'll have to call the police.
          Martin pulling free, steps away.

          (loud, sardonic)

          Liz just stares at him, afraid, anchored to Martin B's arm.

          TNT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
          Seen through glass. A WALL OF MONITORS show images from
          around the hotel. Inside, Martin sits, surrounded.

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME

          Martin rocks in a chair; restless, hands knotted. A FEMALE
          DETECTIVE watches him. An OLDER DETECTIVE is on the phone.
          Strauss sits near him, studying him, while a TECHNICIAN fast-
          forwards 4-PANE video of the hotel reception area, the drive
          in front of the hotel...

                         MARTIN
          There! Right there!
          ON THE VIDEO: Slowing to real-time. Liz, arriving at
          reception, speaking with the Receptionist, gesturing outside.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          That's Liz, and I... I must have
          been outside, I... I can't
          remember.
          The video plays on. Liz thanks the receptionist, leaves.

                         STRAUSS
          As you can see... you're not
          there.
          Martin STARES at him, helpless. The Older Detective hangs up

          Immigration confirms the arrival
          of a Doctor and Mrs. Harris on

          later they checked into their
          suite at the Hotel.
          Martin breathes in. Chooses his words carefully.

                         MARTIN
          He's not Martin Harris. I am
          Martin Harris. The man
          downstairs is pretending to be
          me.

          Silence. Martin searching for a response. The hint of a
          smile on the female detective's face.

                         MARTIN
          He's forcing her... he must have--

                         STRAUSS
          -- but why? Exactly? .Why?
          There's no answer to that. Martin looks down. A beat.

                         MARTIN
          This... this is insane.
          He stares at their faces. He calms himself, trying to get a
          grip. A memory resurfacing...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          My lab number... at Dartmouth...
          Call my assistant, she can verify
          who I am. Call her right now...
          He picks up a pad, scribbles down the number. Beat. The
          female detective picks up the phone, dials. She switches to
          speaker. RINGING TONE. CLICK. A recorded message...

           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Hello. This is 235-0535, the
          office of Doctor Martin Harris.
          If you're calling...
          The older detective presses "off". Martin recalling...

                         MARTIN
          it's Thanksgiving... no one's
          going to be there till Monday...
          (racking his brain)
          Rod... Rodney Cole... he's a
          colleague. A friend. I know his
          number... 603-389-4457...
          Female detective dutifully dials the number. RINGING again.
          CLICK of a machine. Then a jovial male voice:

          VOICE (O.S.)

                         (THROUGH PHONE)
          This is Doctor Cole. I'm having
          an out-of-office experience right
          now, so... leave a message.
          Click. Awkward SILENCE. Martin flailing...

                         MARTIN
          Professor Bressler, talk to him.
          He's why I'm in Berlin.

          You want us to disturb a Nobel
          prize winning scientist, simply
          to attest to your story... when
          no crime has been committed?

                         MARTIN
          But it has!... That man has taken
          everything from me, don't you
          see? You have to arrest him...

                         STRAUSS
          For what? Entering the country
          legally? Presenting all the
          correct documentation?
          ON ONE OF THE MONITORS: A view of the Rose Room: Liz and
          Martin B visible in the corner, dining.

          (off the monitor)
          .And sharing a hotel suite with

                         (EYES GLUED)
          She is my wife!

                         OLDER DETECTIVE
          Even if she is your wife, sharing
          a room with her is not illegal.
          Not in Germany.

                         FEMALE DETECTIVE
          (German, subtitled:)
          Look at her. Soon we'll have
          twenty more men claiming to be
          her husband.
          The room tries not to laugh, can't help smiling. The monitor
          image flips, now just a corridor.

                         MARTIN

                         (COLD)
          I'm sorry, I didn't realize this
          was funny to you.
          The Older Detective frowns, offended. The Female Detective
          speaks into her radio. Martin tracks, panicking.

                         OLDER DETECTIVE
          Listen... you have no proof you
          are even American. We can arrest
          you only for that.

          I lost... I lost all my -- Wait,
          what are you doing...?
          The Female Detective listens to the radio response, nods to
          the Older Man who checks in with Strauss.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Oh God... You're going to arrest
          me. You're going to --

                         OLDER DETECTIVE
          On Monday, you can speak with a
          lawyer. Tell him who you are.
          The Older Detective confers with the Female Detective.
          ON THE MONITORS: the image from the Rose Room reappears: Liz
          and Martin B visible: laughing, drinking.
          Martin's gaze darts, panicked: The image. The detectives.
          Strauss. Martin... coming to a decision...

                         MARTIN
          (low, pained)
          I'm sorry... you're probably
          right.
          Faces look over, interested.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          I... the accident. I haven't
          been remembering things, very
          well. Perhaps this is just...
          perhaps I'm confused.
          Martin remembers something, fumbles in his jacket and
          produces Farge's card.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          This is my doctor, at the
          hospital. He warned me this
          might happen. I should go back
          there. I'm really embarrassed...
          Strauss LEANS in, half convinced.

                         STRAUSS
          So... now you are saying that you
          are not Dr. Martin Harris?
          ON MARTIN. Eyes tight. Point of no return.

                         MARTIN

          doctor. Please.

          EXT. SERVICE ENTRANCE, HOTEL IMPERIAL - MOMENTS LATER

          Martin in a humiliated daze as TWO HOTEL GUARDS escort him
          out of a service entrance. Dirty pavement, a few bellhops
          smoke in the cold by a propped-open door. The guards move
          Martin along, out towards the hotel taxi stand.

          INT. TAXI CAB - SAME

          Martin climbs into the back seat. One of the guards hands
          Dr. Farge's business card to the driver, speaks to him in
          German. Door slams, cab starts to move.

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- THE HOTEL
          Even as they pull away, several high-end Mercedes are
          sweeping up. SAUDI SECURITY get out of the first and last
          cars, check around before opening the doors of the center
          car. The man we saw on TV gets out. PRINCE FARAD, flanked
          by bodyguards and gorgeous female companions.
          The HOTEL MANAGER and CONFERENCE HEAD greet him, smiles and
          handshakes, they usher his entourage inside.
          Martin tracks the Prince, then FOCUSES BEYOND: A view into
          the hotel bar. Liz and Martin B entering...

                         MARTIN
          His gaze FIXED on them as the cab starts to move again...

                         MARTIN
          Wait! Stop! I've changed my
          mind...
          Martin thrusts a few bills forward, steps out...

          EXT. KONIGSTRASSE - NIGHT

          SCRRECH! A large brown Range Rover locks up tires as Martin
          steps out in front of it. A brief moment, Martin staring up
          into the tinted front glass... can't make out the driver.
          He holds up his hand, apologizing, makes his way to the
          street. weaving back through pedestrians, eyes fixed on the
          bar... FREEZES as he sees them.

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- LIZ AND MARTIN B

                         CONTINUED:
          He leans into her, speaks quietly. She nods, intimate,
          smiles and shakes her head. What an evening...
          Liz and Martin B get up, leave. She takes his arm, intimate,
          heading out to the lobby. P.O.V. DARTING, SEARCHING... PICKS
          them up again in...
          . an EXTERIOR ELEVATOR rising up the side of the building.
          The two of them inside. Alone...

          EXT. BERLIN STREETS (VARIOUS) - NIGHT

          Martin walks fast, blind, lost. Miasma of LIGHTS and SOUNDS.
          Frozen MANNEQUINS in windows... the din of CLUBS and BARS...
          sex-shop neon SIZZLING. Nowhere to go but to keep going.
          The river. Martin gazes at the dark water...

          MARTIN'S P. O. V. -- SHOCK CUT -- MEMORY FLASH
          silent free-fall. WHAM! The taxi hits the water.
          The RATTLE of a U-BAHN TRAIN on a bridge snaps him back. Its
          PULSING LIGHTS STROBING like a silent movie.

          EXT. STREET PAY PHONE - NIGHT

          Faint VOICE in Martin's ear as Rodney Cole recites his
          message. Hands numb with cold, Martin pumps in change.

                         MARTIN
          Rodney it's me, Martin. Rod, I'm
          in Berlin for the conference, but
          it's Liz. She's... I'm in
          trouble, Rod...
          Phone issues a DEMAND for more money. Martin fumbles for
          change, drops a crumpled ball of Euros into the GUTTER.

          INT. TRANSIT HOTEL - ROSENTHALER PLATZ - NIGHT

          'Hotel' is a charitable description. Martin counts out
          sodden bills, hands them to a WOMAN behind the desk. She in
          turn gives Martin a form to fill.

                         WOMAN
          Fur Reisepaf3... passport...
          A beat. Martin looks at her, helpless. The woman sighs.
          Pushes back his money.

                         WOMAN (CONT'D)
          Nicht Reisepal3, nicht

          23.

          EXT. TRANSIT HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

          Martin exits, pulling dirty clothing closed against the cold.
          He scans the street, unnerved, frowns as he spots A BROWN
          RANGE ROVER, up the street, parked, idling. He squints,
          paranoid, checks the other way...
          His eyes lock on a lit S-BAHN station across the Platz.

          EXT. S-BAHN STATION BERLIN MITTE - NIGHT

          Martin pushes through the turnstiles, his footsteps echo in
          the empty tile corridor as his eyes play over the
          advertisements. Happy sexy Germans smile back at him... The
          SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS behind him, matching his. He slowly
          becomes aware, glances back.
          MARTIN'S P.O.V.: The empty corridor, curving away...
          Martin STOPS, listens... nothing. He starts to move again,
          aware that the delicate "click" of the following steps also
          begins again.
          UP AHEAD, the corridor straightens out at the train platform,
          several late-night travelers waiting. Martin begins to
          hurry... the FOOTSTEPS also increase in speed.
          Another sound: A TRAIN APPROACHING. Martin gives up cool,
          starts to run as the train barrels into the station, its
          noise eclipsing all sound. Doors open and Martin leaps in,
          turns to face the open door...
          .moments pass, the car's bell signals. Then a MAN appears,
          rushing from the corridor, one hand raised.

                         MAN
          (German, subtitled:)
          Please! Hold the door!
          He's mild-faced, glasses, carrying a shopping bag in one
          hand. He FROWNS as Martin does nothing to stop the door.
          The two men stare through the glass as the train begins to
          move. The man shakes his head: foreigners.

          INT. S-BAHN TRAIN - NIGHT

          Martin shivers with cold and exhaustion, eyes play over the
          few passengers in the car... a nondescript man a few benches
          down who stares at him, then back to his paper.
          Martin eyes him, paranoid. Slowly gives up, lets his gaze
          plays over the adverts. Times, dates... Nov 26th. Memories
          reawakened...

          Has to write something down. Fumbles in his jacket for his
          the copy of 'Horticus,' looking for a blank page to write on.
          A piece of CARD falls from between its pages. Something
          printed on one side. Martin flips it over, scribbles on the
          other: "28th. Bressler. 12.30..." Other times, dates,
          numbers. Everything he can remember...
          Sudden overwhelming fatigue. The roar of the train. VOICES.
          Lights racing by the windows. Martin's eyelids droop.
          Flickering. Closing...

          SUDDEN FLASH CUT - FRACTURED MEMORY...
          . LECTURE HALL, younger Liz in the audience. Students
          CLAPPING. Smiling older colleague SHAKING his hand...
          becoming... bees' WINGS swarming in their hive... YOUNG
          MARTIN watching mesmerized through a magnifying glass...
          their movement morphing into NAKED BODIES. Urgent,
          passionate. Martin and Liz making love.

          WHOMPF! SUDDEN SHIFT -- A HOTEL BEDROOM...
          . Liz towelling her hair. Only now it's dark, and cut
          short. Turns, smiles at him. Face close. Lips moving.

                         LIZ
          Are you ready...?

          INT. S-BAHN TRAIN - MORNING

          Martin's eyes creak open. The train is still moving, but
          everything has changed. Morning passengers crowd the car,
          giving him space. An AMERICAN COUPLE, their bags tucked
          tight. The WIFE staring down at him.

          INT. S-BAHN BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Martin runs water, combs his hair with his fingers. Tries to
          press creases out of his stained suit. He stares into the
          graffiti-stained metal mirror of the bathroom.

                         MARTIN
          Are you going to give up?

                         (BEAT)
          okay. Solve the problem...

          INT. INTERNET CAFE - NIGHT

          Martin sits in front of a stickered and stained monitor, eyes
          glued to the screen as he types in an URL. The Dartmouth
          Mail website appears. Martin types in his login, password.
          "Login failed. Please try again."

          Another attempt. Same results. He switches tactics. Types
          "Martin Harris" into Google... 605,000 results come back at
          him. On an impulse, he clicks "IMAGES."...
          .page after page of men young and old. Getting married,
          posing, partying, historical illustrations...
          Behind Martin, door jingles, a YOUNG MAN comes into the cafe,
          seats himself across and to the side of Martin.
          Martin focuses, tries 'Martin Harris, Phd'... Cursor clicks.
          A new window opens. 'The role of Gorytini and Thynnidae in
          Drakea pollination.' 'Research Faculty information: Dr.
          Martin Harris...' Contact numbers. No picture.
          He stares in disbelief... suddenly becomes AWARE of the man
          across: Young, nondescript, his head bobbing gently to
          whatever his Ipod earbuds are playing, staring into his
          computer... The young man looks over, meets Martin's eyes,
          holds for a long moment, small smile, looks back.
          Martin studies him for a moment, forces his gaze back to the
          page, the negation of his life on a small screen.

          THE YOUNG MAN
          . Glances over again. Martin catching him.

                         MARTIN
          Can I help you? Hello?
          The guy points to his headphones, shrugs. Martin STARES at
          his screen, ears listening for the tell tale sound of music
          seeping from the earbuds... nothing.
          Martin rises suddenly, looks to the bored ATTENDANT who nods
          towards the back. Martin moves past college kids on
          Facebook, to a dim back corridor, a door marked "Manner," and
          what's he's looking for: a back door, cracked.

          EXT. ALLEY BEHIND THE INTERNET CAFE - NIGHT

          Martin slips into the alley, trots towards the street,
          glancing back. No one is following.
          He moves onto the street, waits at a light... eyes lock onto
          the familiar "Ace Taxi" logo of a taxi passing...

          SUDDEN FLASH OF MEMORY --: CARTWHEELING TAXI...
          Silent freefall dive. The 'Ace Taxis' logo... The face in
          the mirror. Looking back at him. Gina. Eyes meet...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

          I /E. TAXI DEPOT - BUCHER STRASSE - EARLY MORNING
          Revving ENGINES. Echoing VOICES. Hunched against the
          drizzle, Martin pauses outside it. The playing card 'Ace
          Taxis' logo. Martin ducks under the open steel shutters...

          INT. 'ACE' TAXIS - DISPATCH OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

          The DEPOT MANAGER, a bully with a face like boiled meat,
          rants at Martin in German. BIKO, a gentle-looking Somalian,
          translates. His English is impeccable.

                         BIKO
          He says he doesn't care if she
          saved your life... the bitch cost
          him 20,000 Euros... the insurance
          won't cover the cab because she
          had no license... the driver who
          was letting her moonlight in his
          taxi, skipped town...
          The depot manager's rage reaches a Hitlerian climax...

                         BIKO (CONT'D)
          . He says illegal immigrants
          are destroying German society...

                         MARTIN
          So. I'm guessing he doesn't know
          where she is.

                         BIKO

                         (SMALL BEAT)
          No one knows where she is.
          Martin studies Biko, nods.

                         MARTIN
          Please thank him for his time.

          EXT. TAXI DEPOT BUCHER STRASSE - EARLY MORNING

          Biko exits the depot, starts to tuck in Ipod earphone when
          Martin catches up with him, meets his pace.

                         BIKO
          Hey, American. I'm sorry we
          couldn't help you --

                         MARTIN
          You know where she is. You
          paused. I could tell.

          Please, I just want to thank her.
          She saved my life.
          Biko eyes him, wary...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          I thought, maybe she could use my
          help. Maybe I could give her
          some money...

                         (SOFTENING)
          I just want to thank her.
          Please.
          Martin puts out his hand, sincere. Biko sizes him up, then
          takes his hand, shakes it.

                         BIKO
          Solomon... Solomon Obiko. My
          friends just call me Biko.

                         MARTIN
          Martin. Martin Harris.

          INT. HASIR CAFE - CONTINUOUS

          Berlin's 'Little Istanbul'. A Turkish working man's joint.
          Steam rises around a busy food counter. Condensation on the
          windows.
          GINA picks up steaming food from the kitchen, drops it off
          with two Turkish men, chats with them briefly in fast
          Turkish. There's a bruise around her eye, now healing.
          She moves to the register where a beefy OWNER counts off a
          week's pay and stuffs it in an envelope for her. She thanks
          him in German, tucks it away and ducks behind the counter to
          steam milk for a coffee. Glances up... freezes.

          ACROSS THE COUNTER: MARTIN
          . Stares at her, gauging her reaction. A long moment, she
          looks back down to her work.

                         MARTIN
          You remember me. You know who I
          am.
          She finishes the Turkish coffee, starts another.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          I was in your taxi.

                         GINA
          I don't drive a taxi.
          She takes the two drinks towards a table. He follows.
          Across the room, the owner eyes them.

          No, you do. I was in your taxi,
          we crashed. Why did you leave?
          Why didn't you talk to the
          police? Hey!
          She puts up a hand, calming him.

                         GINA
          Okay. Okay. How did you find
          me?

                         MARTIN
          Your friend, Biko.
          (cutting her off)
          It's not his fault. I told him I
          had money for you.

                         GINA
          Do you?

                         MARTIN
          No. I mean, not now. I --
          Gina laughs, shakes her head, tries to push by him. He gets
          in her way. Eyes from around the room track.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Please. Listen to me, I've been
          in the hospital, since the
          accident. My memory, it's... I
          don't remember what happened but
          something is going on and there
          are some people I need you to
          speak to. I need you to tell
          them what happened.
          Gina ducks back behind the counter.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Look, things have been happening
          to me. I think I'm being
          followed.
          That got her attention. Her eyes lift, scan outside.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          You're my only link to before
          everything went...

                         GINA

                         (MOVING AWAY)
          Crazy?

                         MARTIN
          Yes, crazy... but it's true.

          You have to help me --
          She rounds on him. Patience snapping. Pushes through doors,
          gesturing him with her into...

          INT. KITCHEN, HASIR CAFE - CONTINUOUS

          .pots, pans, food bubbles. Immigrant cooks work, glace up
          but speak no English. Gina, really angry.

                         GINA
          What do you expect me to do? I'm
          an illegal, driving a taxi
          without a permit, in an accident
          without insurance. If the cops
          catch up with me they'll throw me
          in jail. If I'm in jail, I lose
          everything, understand? If I'm
          in jail, they deport me.

                         MARTIN
          You're not listening to me --

                         GINA
          No! It's you who is not
          listening. You're an American.
          Go to your fancy embassy. Go to
          the Police. There a million
          people here who will help you.

                         MARTIN
          But you know who I am.

                         GINA
          No, I don't. What's your name?

                         MARTIN
          Martin Harris, Doctor M --

                         GINA
          Okay, fantastic, you're Martin
          Harris. You're whoever you say
          you are. Yes, I picked you up
          and we crashed. It doesn't mean
          I know who you are!
          She backs off, a hand raised against him. He STARES after
          her, the truth of what she's said hitting him.

                         MARTIN

                         (SUDDENLY)

          (beat, softening)
          To the airport. Arrivals. You
          were in a hurry.

                         MARTIN
          But I'd just arrived. It doesn't
          make any sense...
          She raises her hands, enough. He looks at her, takes in the
          bruise on her face.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          You got hurt, too. In the crash.
          (off her shrug)
          Thank you. For saving my life.
          Thank you.

                         GINA
          You'd have done the same.

                         MARTIN
          No. You can't be sure how you'll
          act. Not until something like
          that happens.

                         GINA
          Well... I know me. I jump in
          without thinking. It causes me
          lot of trouble.
          She looks up at him. Meets his eyes square for the first
          time. Then...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          So please. Just leave me alone.
          He nods. She turns, pushes back into the restaurant. He
          watches her explaining to her boss... Then turns away,
          towards a back door.

          INT. US EMBASSY - MORNING

          Fluorescent lights. Linoleum floor. Martin sits in a small
          plastic chair filling out paperwork. Alone. The place is
          closing early for the long weekend.
          A man opens a door, looks at Martin.
          Martin Harris?

          INT. OFFICE. US EMBASSY - DAY

          MARC SPIEGLER is German, fluent English. Patient, but
          wishing he was on his way home as well. He looks over
          Martin's paperwork as Martin places his watch and the
          "Horticus" book on the table.
          Where the form asks for a complaint, Martin has written
          "Identity Theft."

                         SPIEGLER
          (not looking up)
          Have you contacted your Credit
          Card companies?

                         MARTIN
          No. You don't understand. As I
          explained to the last guar -- who
          went home by the way -- it's not
          about Credit Cards. Someone has
          taken over my identity. Someone
          is pretending to be me. Here.
          In Berlin.
          Spiegler nods, sensing this won't be an easy one.

                         SPIEGLER
          Did you contact the local
          authorities?

                         MARTIN
          Yes. They... They believe the
          other man. I need a new
          passport, papers to prove --
          Spiegler sighs, a mixture impatience and sympathy.

                         SPIEGLER
          Why do they believe the other
          man?

                         MARTIN
          Because... Because my wife. He's
          staying with my wife. They must
          be forcing her --
          Spiegler suppresses a small laugh, looks away.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          You don't think I know how it
          sounds? Let me ask you this, if
          my wife was having some hot and
          heavy affair with another man,
          why not just leave me? Why this?
          After all, we're in Europe,
          right?

          Look, I need a passport.
          (tapping the forms)
          I need the documents that this
          embassy is supposed to provide.

                         SPIEGLER
          Do you know, the things people
          will do to get a US Passport...?

                         (BEAT)
          Anyway, we're closing until
          Monday. If you come back then --

                         MARTIN
          Monday?! They've kidnappedmy
          wife. You need to find out who
          this other man is, you need to be
          in contact with my wife --
          Spiegler exhales, cuttint Martin off. He picks up Martin's
          Rolex, glances at the initials. Looks at his copy of
          'Horticus', the inscription on the inside cover. As he does,
          a slip of paper comes loose, Martin picks it up.

                         SPIEGLER
          You understand, we're not a
          detective agency, we...
          Spiegler stops, sensing Martin isn't listening anymore.
          Martin's staring at the slip of paper where on one side is
          scribbled: "28th. Bressler. 12.30 pm..."

                         MARTIN
          I have a meeting with Bressler...

                         SPIEGLER
          What?

                         (COLLECTING THINGS)
          Never mind. You've been very
          unhelpful. Earlier a woman
          yelled at me because I had it so
          easy... being an American. Have
          a nice day...
          Spiegler watching him. Second thoughts. Consults his
          address book. Scribbles down a number...

          been corresponding. He invited
          me here to discuss my thesis.
          Dr. Martin Harris...
          She frowns, rises from the desk.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Wait here please.

                         MARTIN
          Is there some sort of problem?
          No answer, she disappears into a back office. Martin shakes
          his head, exasperated. He scans the building plan on the
          wall... 'Bressler. L.P - Molekulare Botanik - 305'...
          Suddenly about-turns, heads for the stairs. The woman out of
          the office. SEES him.

                         RECEPTIONIST

          She quickly grabs the phone on the desk, speed-dialing.

          INT. BRESSLER'S LABORATORY - MORNING

          Surreal. Rows of head-height CORN in a large humid chamber
          under bright lights. Above, ancient rusting girders and
          brick. Insects HUM. RESEARCH STUDENTS clip seed spikelets,
          bagging and logging the samples.
          Martin slips quickly in through a door, unseen. Heat and
          moisture hitting him. Above the drone of bugs... VOICES.
          Martin tenses. He recognizes one of them...

          MARTIN B (O.C.)
          Drakea, named after Anthea
          Drake, the English botanist who
          wondered how it manages to
          reproduce when it doesn't appear
          to attract any insects...
          A wave of anger... that's Martin's work he's discussing!

          THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAB - MARTIN B WITH BRESSLER...

                         BRESSLER
          It's puzzling, one wonders how --
          Bressler stops talking. Stares past Martin B at MARTIN,
          heading toward them down a corn row, eyes burning.

                         MARTIN
          Professor Bressler...
          Martin B turns, sees him. His eyes harden. But it's
          Bressler who speaks first. Alarmed, indignant:

                         BRESSLER
          This laboratory is a restricted
          area. Who are you?

                         MARTIN
          It's all right, Professor...

                         MARTIN B
          What the hell are you doing here?

                         BRESSLER
          You know this man?

                         MARTIN B
          -- how did you get in here? Are
          you absolutely out of your mind?

                         MARTIN
          Professor. He is not Martin
          Harris. I am Martin Harris.

          35.

                         CONTINUED:
          That's a conversation stopper. Bressler looks to Martin B...
          who shakes his head, embarrassed. Martin pointing:

                         MARTIN B
          oh, Jesus...
          A phone RINGS somewhere in the room. It's picked up.

                         BRESSLER
          So what is this? Some sort of
          hybridized propagation? There
          are two Martin Harrises?

                         MARTIN B
          No... let me explain. This man
          showed up at the hotel last
          night. Security had to remove
          him. The police were called...

                         MARTIN
          I called the police, you
          sonofabitch --!

                         MARTIN B
          -- seems he checked himself out
          of the hospital. He was in an
          accident of some sort.
          . one of the research students CALLS to Bressler in German.
          Martin catches the word "polizei". A surge of panic. He
          looks around. Sees a straw he can grasp at...

                         MARTIN
          Drakea Drakensis... Miss Drake
          was wrong...
          . the PLANT SAMPLE on the table behind Bressler.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          A single insect was attracted,
          but she couldn't see it. It's
          too small and it moves too fast.
          Thynnidae. It's a kind of wasp,
          but it looks like an ant. Only
          the males have wings. The orchid
          re-produces the pheromones of the
          female wasp to lure it in. It's
          a trick. It's pretending to be
          something it isn't...
          Bressler looks to Martin. Surprised... curious now. Martin
          sees his opening. Hope in his voice...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          We talked... you and I... on the
          phone...

          we discussed your interest in
          alternative forms of propagation.
          I told you about my father, a
          school teacher... his passion for
          science... how he passed that on

          I said I'd like to do the

          about your children... Two
          girls... right? Yeah... their --
          His voice falters... tails off into silence. Searching his
          memory. Expression shifting to one of panic...

          You... you told me their names...
          I can't... I know them... I...
          Martin B picks up for him. Icy clarity:

                         MARTIN B
          ... Laurel, and Lily.
          Martin frozen as Martin B goes on...

          MARTIN B (CONT'D)
          Twins... ten years old. The same
          age I was when I told my father I
          wanted to be a botanist. We
          discussed that on the phone,
          Professor... how I'd never seen
          him so happy.
          Martin sways on his feet, sweat beading...

                         MARTIN
          No! That wasn't you. Don't you

          Martin B suddenly seems to SNAP.

          MARTIN B (CONT'D)
          This is my wife we're talking
          about! My father, whom I loved.
          You may think it's funny, but
          it's my life. Whatever sick
          pleasure this gives you -- I'm
          tired of it. I'm done. You need
          to... STOP.
          Martin just STARES at the Martin B who's shaking, upset.
          Like looking in a mirror that has taken your emotions.

          face. Dr. Martin Harris. Then he opens his wallet. Credit
          cards, New Hampshire driver's license... a PHOTOGRAPH in the
          wallet's plastic sleeve...
           Martin sees the photograph. His EYES WIDEN...

          Tuileries in Paris, his arm around her. The image CLOSER
          BLURRING out of FOCUS... VERTIGO SPIN... The floor RUSHING

          TAKES SHAPE. A familiar bearded FACE...

          INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, WALDFRIEDE HOSPITAL - DAY

          DR. FARGE fans a penlight across Martin's eyes. Propped
          up on a gurney. Flinches at the glare.

                         FARCE
          The police brought you here. The
          mistake was mine. I should never
          have let you leave.
          Martin blinks, bleary. Farge talks briefly to the nurse in
          German. She nods, starts prepping a hypodermic at a table.
          Farge looks back to Martin. Explains gently:

                         FARGE (CONT'D)
          Confusion... memory loss... the
          complete or partial loss of
          identity... these are common
          stages in recovery. Some
          temporary, others longer term.
          We're going to do an MRI. Try to
          find out what's happening.
          Martin stares out the window, not fighting, hardly listening.
          A bird alights on a branch.

                         FARGE (CONT'D)
          The mind is like a jigsaw puzzle.
          The pieces fit together to create
          the person we are. With major
          trauma, the puzzle is shattered.
          But the brain's ability to
          recover is remarkable. The mind
          needs a narrative, an identity...
          a soul. Without memory, without
          a past, we are nothing. In the
          coma state, memories are rebuilt.
          In some cases the pieces move.
          In others they go missing. And
          sometimes... completely new
          pieces are found.
          The bird flies off. Martin's eyes track... empty.

                         FARGE (CONT'D)
          Comas sometimes perform a kind of
          alchemy. A patient awakes
          convinced of a reality that was
          previously only fantasy.

          feels like, to become insane?

          Martin looks over, Farge almost RECOILS at the intensity in
          Martin's eyes. Fear. Loss. Anger.

                         (ALMOST CALM)

          Martin SMILES. Tight, hurting, fatalistic. Farge, almost

          realization that he's not insane. This man is HERE. His
          eyes DART as the other orderly glances over, the man from the
          train tunnel. Call him SMITH. He smiles at Martin, polite,
          nondescript. Ghostly in his disinterest.

                         JONES
          Hello, Martin. This won't take
          very long.
          Martin tries to raise up but can't move -- his arms and legs
          are like lead. He opens his mouth to call out, his voice
          barely a murmur. His eyes lock on the IV bag, the steady
          drip... drip... down the line into his body...
          The two men quickly lift Martin, hefting him face-down onto a
          gurney. One arm dangles.

          (German, subtitles:)
          We have instruction to move this
          patient to the American Hospital
          at Wiesbaden. Here are the
          papers.
          The rustle of paper. Martin CONCENTRATES, eyes on the IV
          tube, hanging between the bars of the gurney and his arm.
          Great Effort, He LEANS, pinching the tube closed.
          CLOSE ON THE IV: The drips... stop.

                         NURSE
          (German, subtitles:)
          I'm surprised I wasn't
          informed... Let me check with --
          A SOUND, like paper torn quick...
          and THE NURSE FALLS TO THE FLOOR, STARING UP AT MARTIN,

          HER THROAT CUT.
          Martin gazes down at her in HORROR as she bleeds out, staring
          upwards at him, the light in her eyes dying.
          Around him Smith and Jones start to MOVE, locking the door,
          opening cabinets, working fast, Martin's eyes lock on: a pair
          of scissors, tucked in her apron.
          Eyes watering, adrenaline surging, Martin WILLS his hand to
          reach down, palm the scissors, just as the Nurse's body is
          dragged away, leaving a trail of red...

          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

          The MRI ROOM door opens, the two 'orderlies' wheel the barely
          conscious Martin out into the corridor. Behind them, the
          room is spotless.
          They round a corner, almost at the EXIT... Doors ahead BLOW
          OPEN. Doctors, Paramedics rushing forward with various
          WOUNDED on gurneys. Something big has happened.
          Smith and Jones eye the madness coming their way, command
          decision, they duck into

          INT. PATIENT'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          . where a feeble OLD MAN mumbles at them from his bed.
          They ignore the man, go about checking Martin. Jones lifts
          his head, pries open one eyelid after the other while Smith
          ties down his arms, covers him with a sheet.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         CONTINUED:
          Suddenly, the door OPENS. A DOCTOR, breathless.

                         DOCTOR
          (German, subtitles:)
          You two. We need help!. Right
          now!
          (off their hesitation)

          COME ON! NOW!
          No choice. They exit after the doctor, Jones glancing back
          at Martin as the door swings shut behind them.
          A beat. The covered shape on the gurney starts to MOVE.
          Martin's hand saws back and forth, using the scissors to cut
          the straps that bind him.
          ACROSS, the Old Man tracks the motion... scared.
          Success! A strap gives way. Martin paws the blanket weakly
          away. Feels along his arm, and pulls out the IV. Blood
          drips. He rises up, trying to orient...

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- FLARED, DISTORTED
          . the old MAN staring at him... DAZZLING daylight framed by
          a window... strange reverberating ECHOES...

                         MARTIN
          . pulls himself upright. Tries to stand, but his body is
          like Jello. Reaches out, grabs the leg of a steel equipment
          trolley which TEETERS... CRASHES to the floor, showering
          Martin with a CASCADE of instruments and dressings.

          INT. RECOVERY ROOM (ALONG CORRIDOR) - SAME

          ALARMS RING. Emergency team clusters around a lifeless
          PATIENT, working fast. Smith and Jones, resentfully holding
          drip bags. They heard that. Turn, eyes meeting. Set down
          their drip bags. Edge back toward the door...

          INT. HALLWAY, HOSPITAL - SAME

          Smith and Jones, hurrying down the hall. Quick check
          into the patient's room reveals Martin GONE, the old man
          GESTURING, panicked...
          They moves on, fast, around a corner into...

          INT. HOSPITAL E.R. RECEIVING AREA - CONTINUOUS

          Very busy. Patients... doctors and nurses. Smith and Jones
          push into the room, scanning... see:

                         CONTINUED:

          A FAMILIAR FIGURE
          shuffling towards the doors! Given away by the plastic
          bag and the hospital gown showing under the jacket.
          BAM! Entrance doors SLAM OPEN. PARAMEDICS charge in,
          wheeling in MORE ACCIDENT PATIENTS on a gurneys past Martin
          as he exits. Smith and Jones break into a run, trying to
          press through TWO MORE CREWS coming through with more CRASH

          VICTIMS...

          EXT. HOSPITAL E.R. ARRIVALS - SAME

          CHAOS here. Ambulances arriving, departing. Crews slamming
          their rigs closed, taking off, SIRENS WAILING. Other
          arriving with wounded...
          Smith and Jones rush out of the hospital doors, pull up. The
          many ambulances, the crowds... no sign of Martin.

          I/E. AMBULANCE/ BERLIN STREETS - SHORT WHILE LATER
          Cop cars and fire trucks surround an accident scene where a
          truck has side-swiped a trolley-car. Ambulance pulls up
          behind them. PARAMEDICS jump out, one of them pulling open
          the back doors...
          startles as he finds Martin, now dressed back in his
          clothes, a reassuring hand held up, climbing out unsteadily:

                         MARTIN
          It's okay... I'm fine...
          Paramedic would do something, but his colleague's YELLING at
          him to hurry. Just has to watch Martin go...

          EXT. FRIEDRICHSTRASSE, BERLIN MITTE - DAY

          . weaving down the busy sidewalk, buffeting against annoyed
          shoppers. Looks behind to see if he's being followed.
          Nobody. Keeps pressing on, finally arriving at

          A FOOD CART
          tended by a Middle-Eastern Man who stares at Martin.
          Martin eyes warm Gyros and Souvlakis, rummages for money...
          comes out with just a slip of paper with writing on it: The
          slip the man from the embassy wrote on.
          He focuses, his mind clearing: A name: Jurgen. An address.
          It's something.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

          A CORONER's hand slides a zipper closed, past the lifeless
          eyes of the Nurse.

          ACROSS THE ROOM
          The two DETECTIVES from the Hotel Imperial sit with Farge who
          pours himself a drink with remorseful hands. The entire
          scene in German, subtitled:

                         FARGE
          .The man's condition was
          unusual, yes. But there was
          nothing to indicate violence.

                         OLDER DETECTIVE
          Is he still dangerous?
          Farge watches the Coroner wheel away the Nurses's body.

                         FARGE
          To someone who threatens that
          fantasy...? Yes. I believe he
          is.

          INT. S-BAHN - NIGHT

          Metro train car almost empty, save for a few noticeably down-
          at-heel passengers. Martin looks up at the map.

          EXT. MARZAHN, EAST BERLIN - NIGHT

          Bleak, uniform blocks of Communist-era housing. Graffiti-
          covered walls: hammers and sickles, swastikas... Martin stops
          outside one, checks the address on the card.

          INT. APARTMENT BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

          Urine stench. Water pooling on concrete. 'Gebrochen' sign
          blocking off the elevator. Martin climbs the steps.
          Approaching FOOTFALLS, SHOUTS from above. A group of young
          SKINHEADS thunders past him, on downward...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

          INT. FIFTH FLOOR, APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT

          Martin presses a bell. Hears it RINGING. No answer. A door
          behind him OPENS. A grey-haired LADY peers out. A beat.
          Martin tries the BELL again. COUGHING from inside, the sound
          of a LOCK. The door half opens...
          revealing ERNST JURGEN. Piercing eyes in a face far
          older than its sixty-some years. Frayed suit jacket, stained
          shirt; grey hair yellowed by nicotine.

                         JURGEN
          Alles in ordnung, Frau Brunner.
          He smiles. Frau Brunner retreats back behind her door.
          Jurgen turns to Martin. Eyes reading him.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Come in. Come in.

          INT. JURGEN APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          Jurgen leads Martin down a hallway piled with books.

                         JURGEN
          Siegler used to work for me.
          Did he tell you that?
          His laughter becomes a COUGH that racks his body. Lets it
          pass, before ushering Martin into a tiny living room.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Sit down...
          Points Martin toward a battered chair. opens a bottle of
          cheap brandy, pours two glasses. Turns to find Martin
          looking at FRAMED PHOTOS on the sideboard...
          . a YOUNGER JURGEN in East German army uniform... in a
          large office... smiling beside a Russian-made sedan...

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          The Staatssicherheit. The
          Ministry for State Security.

                         MARTIN
          That's where Spiegler worked for
          you? The secret police?

                         JURGEN
          A true believer, like the rest of
          us. Now look at him. I should
          have had him shot.
          Another laugh, more COUGHING. Hands Martin a brandy.

          46.

                         CONTINUED:

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          He forgot. Germans are experts
          at forgetting. We forgot we were
          Nazis. Now we've forgotten forty
          years of Communism. All gone.
          But it's not just history that's
          forgotten. It's people, too.
          He sinks into a chair. Tired smile.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          But enough of me...

          LATER -- SMOKE RISES FROM A CIGARETTE
          Jurgen jots notes in a pad. Hand unsteady, he perches his
          cigarette on the ashtray, picks up the 'Horticus'.

                         MARTIN
          I always have it with me. It was
          a gift from my father...
          Jurgen flips it open. Notices the inscription, the NUMBERS
          written inside the front endpaper. A beat.

                         JURGEN
          These mean anything to you?

                         MARTIN
          No. It's my wife's handwriting.

                         JURGEN
          So, they mean something to her.
          He looks to Martin. Direct.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Her involvement in this. There
          must have been something... in
          the past... some indication?
          A beat. Martin shakes his head, at a loss. Jurgen leafs
          on... the piece of CARD drops from between the pages. Jurgen
          picks it up. Martin's notations from the night before in the
          train: times... dates... places.

                         MARTIN
          My schedule... for this week.
          It's everything I remember.
          Jurgen turns over the card. German print. A cheery cartoon
          Uncle Sam: 'Uncle Sam's Bowling & Billiards'.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          My friend Rodney Cole told us to
          go, said it was a blast.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

          LATER STILL -- JURGEN
          Tapping his pencil on the pad... intrigued.

                         JURGEN
          Passport, credit cards, family
          photos... things like these take
          time to prepare. You say this
          man has detailed knowledge of
          your research, of your
          relationship with...

                         MARTIN
          Professor Bressler. He knows
          everything...

                         JURGEN
          Including the fact that you were
          going to have a random accident
          that would allow him seamlessly
          to take your place? These people
          may be good, but they're not God.
          The question is, why would they
          want to take your place? What
          could they gain from being you?

                         MARTIN
          They tried to kill me.

                         JURGEN
          Yes, did you a favor I'd say.
          Now you have... Redlichkeit...
          Now you know you are right.

                         MARTIN
          Do you believe me?
          A beat. Jurgen pours them both another brandy.

                         JURGEN
          In the Stasi, we had a basic
          principle: Ask enough questions
          and a man who is lying will
          eventually change his story. But
          a man who tells the truth cannot
          change his, however unlikely his
          story sounds. I believe you are
          telling the truth, Doctor Harris.
          A long beat. Jurgen closes the notebook.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          I'll start by calling these
          numbers again... as you say, it's
          Thanksgiving...

                         CONTINUED:

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          and there's the time difference,
          so it may take time to make
          contact. And then there is the
          question...

                         MARTIN
          of money... ?

                         JURGEN
          Yes. Of money.
          Martin takes off his Rolex. Sets it on the table.

                         MARTIN
          It's all I have. I'll pay you in
          cash as soon as I can.
          Jurgen nods, picks up the watch. Turns it, looks at the
          engraving on the back. As Martin turns to leave...

                         JURGEN
          Doctor Harris...
          A wince of pain as Jurgen gets up. Lifts a tea tin off the
          shelf. Opens it. Takes out a hundred Euros...

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          A loan against your guarantee.

                         MARTIN
          Thank you.

                         JURGEN
          I'll need twenty-four hours.
          Call me tomorrow afternoon. Do
          you have a place to stay?
          A long beat. Off Martin's FACE...

          INT. HASIR CAFE - NIGHT

          Gina is cleaning up for the night, counting her tips, jotting
          numbers in a small notebook. The television plays the
          evening news quietly. In a corner, her boss is tallying the
          days receipts at a table.
          Gina ducks under the counter, calls out to a man who's parked
          in a corner seat, out of sight.

                         GINA
          (Turkish, subtitled:)
          Hey, friend. We're closing...
          The man looks up: It's Martin. He's exhausted, wet. His
          eyes full of need and fear.

                         (STEPPING BACK)
          I thought I told you to --

                         MARTIN
          I'm sorry. Please. I had
          nowhere else to go...
          She starts to respond, holds it back. Nods.

                         GINA
          I know the feeling.

                         MARTIN
          I just need to know. The man you
          picked up, the man who's life you
          saved. That was me, right? It
          was me.
          She looks down at him, moved. Eyes track his wedding ring.

                         GINA
          You're married. What about your
          wife?

                         MARTIN
          I... don't know.

                         (BEAT)
          Can you imagine what it's like,
          to wake up one day, and your
          life... has been erased.
          Beat. He starts to rise, collect himself.

                         GINA
          It was you. Martin Harris. You.

                         MARTIN

                         (NODDING)
          Thank you.
          He starts to go. She puts a hand on his arm. He stares at
          it. Human contact.

                         GINA
          Don't be an idiot. Come on...
          He hesitates, then lets her lead him out of the cafe.
          In the corner, the owner watches them go. The TV NEWS
          changes, flashes a special. The Owner looks up:
          ON TELEVISION: Martin's face, caught by a camera at the
          hospital. Juxtaposed next to it, a smiling picture of the
          Nurse. German text scrolls: "Wanted for Murder..."
          The Owner's hand moves, picks up the phone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

          E/I. STREET / RANGE ROVER - NIGHT
          The Brown Range Rover idles on the street. Exhaust plumes.
          Inside, two figures statue in silence. Smith and Jones.
          Waiting. The engine idles, the vents blow heat. Suddenly,
          an ELECTRONIC SCRAMBLER on the dashboard SQUAWKS in German.

          EXT. BERLIN STREETS - NIGHT

          Martin and Gina walk side by side, unused to the company.

                         GINA
          So, how long are you married?

                         MARTIN
          .Five years.

                         GINA
          Where did you meet her?

                         MARTIN
          Yale... I was a teaching
          assistant. Liz heard me lecture.

                         GINA
          And there's no way she just
          didn't... recognize you?
          He shakes his head. They reach the cement steps of an
          overpass, climb.

                         MARTIN
          .You don't have to believe me.
          It's crazy, I know.
          Gina pauses, stares through chain-link at the cars below.

                         GINA
          Everyone has a story... Where
          they came from, where they are
          going, what happened to them.
          Why they're not happy, or
          alone.
          ( l ooking over)
          Who cares what I believe. It's
          bullshit. All that matters is...
          (pokes his chest)
          Who you are, what you do, right
          now.
          She reaches in her jacket. Opens the notebook she was
          writing in. Columns of figures.

                         CONTINUED:

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          This is me. 2,259 Euros and
          counting. The number's the only
          thing that changes. I reach
          4000, I can buy papers...

                         (BEAT)
          Or maybe I'll come home one day
          and find a stranger who claims to
          be me. I'd like that. Walk
          away. Leave it all behind.

                         (BEAT)
          You could do that.
          Martin shakes his head.

                         MARTIN
          I'd still have my memories.

                         GINA
          You see? We're different. You
          like your memories. very
          American of you.
          He nods. She shrugs, turns away.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Come on...

          INT. GINA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Key in the lock, door opens. Gina shows Martin in.
          Run-down but clean. Rainwater seeps in through the window.
          Martin sits, watches Gina as she goes to a sideboard and
          uncorks a bottle. Pours Martin a glass of clear liquor.

                         GINA
          Slivovic.

                         MARTIN
          Thank you.
          He takes a sip. Then another. Gina watching him. Muffled
          TV and arguing VOICES in Turkish from the floor below.

                         GINA
          The walls are made of
          cardboard... but it's home.
          Another smile, tired. A long beat. Abruptly, Gina gets up
          and leaves the room. Sound of drawers opening.

          GINA (O.S.)(CONT'D)
          You can sleep on the floor in
          there. I have an extra mattress.

          She reappears... tosses something to Martin. A sweater, a
          pair of man's jeans. Before he can speak...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Don't ask.

          EXT. INTERNET CAFE, STRAUSBERGER PLATZ - NIGHT

          Night-owl STUDENTS and BACK-PACKERS at rows of terminals,
          fingers tapping. The unlikely figure of Jurgen waits in the
          line at the counter. Signs in, gets his swipe key.

          AT A COMPUTER TERMINAL
          Moment's thought, Jurgen types Martin Harris Ph.D into the
          search window. Hits return.
          CLOSE on the list, the same Martin got. No pictures.
          Jurgen writes something in his notebook. Types again...

          Security move to intercept. EXPLOSIVE FLASH of a grenade.
          Blood on the lens, hand-held pandemonium.

          INT. HASIR CAFE - NIGHT

          The Cafe Owner is still watching the local news, looking for
          another glimpse of Martin. Door jingles. He glances over to
          see two men, one holding up a POLICE Badge.

                         CAFE OWNER
          (German, subtitled:)
          You guys are quick...
          The BADGE lowers. It's Jones. Looks utterly nonthreatening,
          plain. But the Owner's voice falters.

          INT. GINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Martin sets the borrowed clothing down on the bed, looks
          around himself as he takes off his jacket.
          Intimate, to be in here. Photographs on a cluttered vanity:
          Old country, Bosnia. Men in suits and women in long dresses.
          Children, a boy and two girls... Gina?

          IN THE KITCHEN
          Gina goes to the fridge, removes a pot of plain stew and sets
          it on the stove. She uses a spoon to pull off a chunk of
          fatty meat. Drops it on a chipped plate and opens the
          window...
          leaning out into the rain, Gina reaches up, slides the
          plate onto a sloping roof above. Excited YOWLS as stray cats
          come running from every direction.
          Gina ducks back inside, pulls the window shut, glances
          towards the cracked door to her bedroom as she ducks into the
          bathroom, turns on the hot water...

                         GINA

                         (CALLING OUT)
          The light's bust so you have to
          leave the door open if you want
          to see anything. Don't worry, I
          won't peek.

          EXT. GINA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          The RANGE ROVER pulls up outside the building.

          INT. GINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Martin takes off his shirt, lays it down. Notices several
          charcoal drawings, tucked behind a radiator. He pulls a few
          out. A lonely man in the park. A woman with her child.
          Dark, shadowed... Beautiful.
          Gina clears her throat. Martin looks over, sees Gina
          standing in the doorway, realizes.

                         MARTIN
          Oh. I'm sorry, I just... I'm
          sorry. Did you do these?

                         GINA
          I give you a place to stay, it
          doesn't give you the right to --

          54.

                         CONTINUED:

                         MARTIN
          No, you're right...
          (putting them back)
          I'm sorry. They're beautiful.
          You should --

                         GINA
          I should what? Have been an
          artist? Perhaps in Bosnia...
          (beat, quoting him)
          "Can you imagine what it's like,
          to wake up one day. And your
          whole life... has been erased?"
          He STARES at her, moved. That connection again. He looks
          away. Looks back again...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          What is it?

                         MARTIN
          Your eyes... It's the one thing
          I remember about the accident.
          Your eyes in the mirror...
          He tails off. Face-to-face...
          BANG! BANG! Pounding on the door. Gina motions Martin out
          of sight as she opens the door...
          .It's Biko, the soft-spoken Somali taxi-driver. He grins.
          Tries teasingly to peek past her into the apartment.

                         BIKO
          You got company?
          She puts her foot against the door, inscrutable. Biko drops
          a set of keys into her hand.

                         BIKO (CONT'D)
          Bring it back to my place. Leave
          the keys on the TV. And don't
          forget to reset the meter.

                         GINA
          You're the best.
          She pecks him on the cheek. Biko pushes in the door, just a
          little, but enough to catch Martin, in his undershirt,
          carrying the rest of his clothes, halfway to the shower.

                         MARTIN
          I'm... I'm just going... in here.
          Biko looks at Gina, raises an eyebrow.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         GINA
          Yes, that's right. I sleep with
          every married American you send
          my way -- Thank you for that, by
          the way.

                         BIKO
          Hey, no need to explain to me.

                         GINA
          Get on your way! Go!
          She pushes him out, closes the door. The stew has started to
          SMOKE. Gina moves it off the burner.

          IN THE STAIRWELL
          Biko trots down stairs, laughing to himself. Passes two men,
          working on the PHONE BOX tucked below the stairs.

                         BIKO
          (German, subtitled:)
          Hey, while you're at it, check
          the line to number eight. She's
          always getting bad service.
          One of the men lifts his face. It's JONES. Biko takes them
          in, their clothes... frowns.

          EXT. PAY PHONE, KARL MARXSTRASSE - NIGHT

          Jurgen making a call, rain dripping off his coat.
          "The Eye". Banks of CCTV SCREENS monitoring Tegel's
          passenger areas. Night-shift STAFF sip coffee.
          An incoming CALL. DESK OFFICER answers. Calls to an older
          UNIFORMED MAN, who picks up, punches a button.

          JURGEN (O.S.)
          (German, subtitles:)
          Hans. It's Colonel Jurgen. From

          INT. GINA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Gina punches PLAY on an old boom-box and a cool Bosnian hip-
          hop groove plays. She spoons some of the stew into a bowl,
          sets it on the table.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Martin lets the hot water run over his head, drip across his
          face, allowing himself a tiny moment of relaxation.

          IN THE KITCHEN
          BANG! BANG! Knocking on the door again. Gina puts the bowl
          in the sink, heads for the door.

                         GINA
          Just a moment, Biko. And you're
          going to be late --
          She throws open the door... SMITH and JONES press in! Jones
          clamping a hand over her mouth.
          Watching them work is awe-inspiring, chilling. There's no
          wasted motion whatsoever. Their faces calm, observant.
          Jones holds Gina, gun covers the dark entrance to the
          bathroom where the shower still runs as Smith turns the music
          up LOUD, then opens the oven, blows out the pilot light,
          turns on the gas...
          CLOSE ON THE GAS -- A hazy layer, rippling over the floor...
          Smith grabs a candle off Gina's table, lights its wick,
          sets it on top of the stove.

          IN THE DARK BATHROOM
          PRESSED against the wall, trapped, fully aware of what's
          _ going on, Martin. He's pulled on clothes. By looking in the
          small mirror over the sink, he can see the men going about
          their work. He can see their weapons.
          His eyes SEARCH for anything useful, anything at all.
          There's nothing. He reaches towards the small window to the
          exterior. It swings open, revealing the FIRE ESCAPE beyond.

          IN THE APARTMENT
          The gas HISSES as it spills into the room. Smith grabs the
          bottle of alcohol, douses Gina as with one hand Jones
          produces a hypodermic...
          . A LOW THUMP from the bathroom. Smith REACTS instantly,
          KICKS in the bathroom door, gun lined...

                         CONTINUED:

          exterior swings gently.

                         GINA
          Terror-stricken, realizing Martin has abandoned her.
          Jones nods to Smith who goes out the door, covers the hall.
          Jones FLIPS Gina onto her stomach, presses her face to the
          floor, pulling down the top of her pants as he prepares to
          inject her with the hypodermic.
          She struggles, SCREAMS IN RAGE, chokes on the gas. Her EYES
          WIDEN as Jones slides the needle in, starts to PRESS...
          . CRASH! Martin blasts in from the fire escape, through
          the window nearest them, catching Jones in the face, cutting
          his face. He tumbles over -- his gun sliding away...

          MARTIN AND JONES
          . Tumble together, SMASH into the sideboard which
          collapses, splintering into the kitchen.
          Martin tries to hit Jones who easily deflects the blow, leaps
          cat-like to his feet, moving towards his gun as Smith re-
          enters, weapon drawn, and FREEZES, his eyes tracking:
          THE CANDLE, teetering on the stove... now falling over...
          rolling...
          Jones, Smith, Martin... all track the candle, its progress
          towards the edge of the stove...
          Jones and Smith RUN towards the door. Martin grabs Gina,
          HAULS her towards the bedroom as the candle falls...
          KABOOM --!!! GAS EXPLODES. Doors SPLINTER outward...
          . BLAST hurls Gina and Martin onto the bedroom floor.
          Martin covering Gina. PRESSURE WAVE sweeps over them,
          burning debris raining.

          FRACTURED VISION... TINNITUS DAZE...
          Fires spreading, the main room beyond the bedroom an INFERNO.
          Martin pulls Gina up. They move to the window and the fire
          escape. Gina begins to slide it open...

                         MARTIN
          No, look!
          She tracks his gaze: Down below, Jones exits the building,
          looks up amidst other onlookers. Wipes blood from his face.
          Martin looks around, wild, for anything, his gaze settling
          on: the far wall. Flames FLARE in, growing.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          With a ROAR Martin rushes the wall, IMPACTS it with his
          shoulder, goes right through!

          INT. NEIGHBORING APARTENT - NIGHT

          LANDS HARD in a small empty bedroom, Turkish decorated.
          Drywall and plaster everywhere. Gina follows him through as
          they thread through the abandoned flat out into...

          INT. STAIRWELL, GINA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          Martin and Gina slip out a door, into a crowd of immigrant
          families, other residents fleeing down the stairwell. Smoke
          is thick, flames roar.

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- SMITH
          Laying in wait near the entrance to Gina's place. Hand
          tucked in his coat. Gaze RACKS, looking for another way...

                         MARTIN
          We have to go up...
          He starts to pull her, but she's FROZEN, staring in horror.
          Martin tracks her gaze: Biko's body, tucked under the
          stairs. Lifeless eyes stare back.

          EXT. GINA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

          Immigrant families emerge from the flaming building. Jones
          stands next to the Range Rover, eyes tracking the crowd, the
          upper floors, now engulfed in flame...

          EXT. ROOF TOP, GINA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

          Martin and Gina emerge at the top, run to the edge. He
          LEANS... reaching across to the next building...
          BELOW HIM: Five flights down. A mortal fall.
          Martin's hands grip a ledge, pull him over. He reaches back,
          pulls her across. They keep moving...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

          EXT. STREET, KREUZBERG DISTRICT - CONTINUOUS

          Crowds parting as FIRE TRUCKS scream around the corner.
          Smith comes out, the last to exit the building. He meets
          eyes with Jones, satisfied.

          DOWN THE STREET
          Martin and Gina emerge from the neighboring building. See
          Smith climbing into the Range Rover.
          Martin takes Gina's arm, steers her away. Notices an old
          Mercedes Diesel taxi at the curb, covered in debris. Biko's.

                         MARTIN
          The keys. Where are the keys?
          Gina stares at him, lost. Martin reaches into her pockets.
          Finds Biko's keys. He HAULS broken panes, debris off the
          car, manages to get it open. He bundles her inside.

          INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

          Martin fumbles the key into the ignition. He turns it.
          Warning light delay as the diesel's glow-plugs warm up.

                         MARTIN
          C'mon. C'mon...
          IN THE REARVIEW: The Range Rover, making a U-Turn, heading
          their way...

          INT. RANGE ROVER - SAME

          Jones drives, Smith shotgun. They cruise slowly, keeping an
          eye peeled. Pass the debris-covered taxi, empty. They keep
          moving, gaze still tracking. Smith pops his cell phone.

          I./E. TAXI/KREUZBERG DISTRICT STREETS - SAME
          Crouched down, Martin watches in the mirror as the Range
          Rover turns a corner. He restarts the engine, puts the car
          in gear and pulls them away from the curb.
          Gina still in stunned silence. Wipes tears and grime off her
          face. She looks across at Martin. He glances up at the
          mirror...
          sudden change in his expression. Gina turns, sees...

                         CONTINUED:

          BEHIND THEM -- THE BROWN RANGER ROVER
          Four cars back. Jones driving. Smith riding shotgun. Faces
          expressionless as they swerve out into traffic, deftly cut
          back in one vehicle closer to Martin and Gina.
          Gina turns back to Martin. Eyes wide. This can't be
          happening. Adrenaline clearing her mind...

                         GINA
          Left --! Turn left...
          Martin spins the wheel. Taxi swerves across oncoming traffic
          into a SIDE-STREET. Gina waving frantically...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Left again! Left again! Now
          right. Here. HERE!
          Just in time, Martin pulls a right. Cab drifts, SLAMS a wall
          side-on... bounces back into the center of the road.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Jesus!
          A look from Martin: What? Gina glances behind. No sign of
          them. Moment's relief. Turns to her right. Sees the RANGE
          ROVER racing down the parallel side-street...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          They're going to cut us off!
          Right. Turn right -- !
          Martin SCREECHES into a turn. Heads for the parallel alley.
          Range Rover FLASHES through the intersection just ahead.
          Taxi cuts across feet behind them...

          IN THE RANGE ROVER
          Jones spots the taxi in the mirror. BRAKES, high speed
          180... races back up the alley.

          IN THE TAXI
          Martin floors the gas. SCREAMS out into oncoming traffic,
          across a red light. Zig-zags past cars. Edge of control.
          Zooms through open gates into...

          EXT. VOLKSPARK CEMETERY - CONTINUOUS

          Tree-lined avenue. Closed GATES at the far end...
          . Range Rover moving fast down the street alongside the
          cemetery. Suddenly cutting left across traffic. Bounces
          over the curb, full-speed into the grounds. 4WD slaloming
          past gravestones, rapidly closing on the taxi...

                         CONTINUED:
          Closed gates ahead. No choice. Martin puts his foot down.
          SMASHES through the gates. Flying hinge SLAMS the windshield
          -- glass instantly spidering opaque...
          Martin driving blind. Careens against the embankment,
          WHIPLASHES up, spin on its axis. Rolling...
          over the edge of the embankment, TUMBLING over and over.
          SLAMS DOWN right way up, axles crumpling. QUIET. Steaming
          HISS of the engine.
          Martin's hands still locked on the wheel. Gina next to him.
          Martin shoves open the door. Clambers out.

          EXT. BERLIN RAIL YARDS - CONTINUOUS

          A maze of tracks and power lines below street level. S-Bahn,
          U-Bahn, high-speed ICE trains, freight... tracks
          disappearing in each direction into tunnels. A sound.
          Martin turns, looks up...
          THE RANGE ROVER, Jones at the wheel... SPOTS THEM. Engine
          GUNS, Range Rover plunges headlong down the embankment...
          Whistling ROAR... as a HIGH SPEED TRAIN hurtles out of the
          one of the tunnels. Martin grabs Gina's hand.

                         MARTIN
          C'mon...!
          Running side-by-side. Train horn BLASTS as they cross right
          in front of it as the Range Rover, cut off, SPINS 90 degrees,
          races down the tracks alongside it.
          Martin and Gina scramble across tracks, towards a tunnel...
          . the Range Rover passes the back of the train. HARD
          right, over the tracks. Too Fast. The car catches air...
          . BELLIES down hard onto the next set of tracks. Front
          tire EXPLODES... . Range Rover SPINS... rear wheels SLAM into
          the track. Another tire BURSTS. Scraping STOP, car
          straddling the rails. Jones shifts into reverse. Rims SPIN
          against metal.

          ACROSS THE TRACKS
          . Martin and Gina sprinting towards the tunnel. Smith
          jumps out of the Range Rover, lines his weapon. BLAM! BLAM!

          INSIDE THE TUNNEL
          Martin and Gina hit the ground, bullets chipping ceramic off
          the walls. Up ahead, illuminated, some utility stairs. Gina
          GASPS air, spent. Martin looks behind them...

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. - SMITH IN SILHOUETTE. COMING IN AFTER THEM.
          Martin GRABS Gina, pulls her after him.

          IN THE RANGE ROVER -- JONES
          Jams shift into 'drive.' Pedal to metal. Four wheel drive
          rims SCREAM on the rails, inches forward. Almost off the
          tracks. A vibration. Jones looks around...

          FREIGHT CARS -- LUMBERING RIGHT FOR HIM...
          Shunted by a rear engine; no way the driver can see him.
          Scrambles for the door. Too late - !
          . FREIGHT TRAIN PLOWS INTO THE RANGE ROVER! Coupling
          smashes through the window. Impales the car, CRUSHING Jones,
          pushing the mangled wreck along the tracks...

          INTO THE TUNNEL
          Range Rover scraping along the wall in a tail of SPARKS.
          Smith dives out of the way. Car wreck and freight cars
          THUNDERING past him...
          .toward Martin and Gina, pelting full-speed... almost on
          them... last second, they DIVE into the alcove... through the
          steel door into the utility access STAIRS.
          Gina doubled, gasping for breath... but they've got to keep
          going. Both staggering up the zig-zag iron steps...

                         SMITH
          Jumps up. Sprints after them. Through the steel door...

          INT. UTILITY STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

          Smith sprinting up to a landing. Another landing. Narrow
          tunnel. Booming ECHOES. Rush of AIR. Smith dashes around a
          corner. Slows...

          INT. 'U-BAHN' STATION - CONTINUOUS

          . breathless. Station JAMMED with SOCCER FANS. The bars
          have let out. Faces painted. Singing, drinking, a swarming
          party. A train just emptying, the mass crowding out.

                         UP AHEAD
          Martin and Gina, squeezed together between laughing faces,
          drunken youth, singing, chanting...

                         CONTINUED:
          . Both of them in this chaotic oasis. Almost peaceful.
          Gina struggling to catch her breath. Relief. Shock. Grief.
          Anger. Martin, looking at her. He knows what she's feeling.
          She meets his eyes a moment, glances back...
          .sees Smith, caught in the crowd, but pushing his way
          towards them.

                         GINA
          Come on...
          They push their way forward through the crush.

          EXT. S-BAHN TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

          The crowd dissipates into the night. Gina takes Martin's
          hands, pulls him along a street of neon club signs, lines of
          youth waiting to get in.
          BEHIND THEM. Smith emerges from the station, tracks them.

          EXT. BERLIN STREET - NIGHT

          Gina hurries them past bars and clubs. They come to a door
          crowded with youths, Middle-Eastern and Balkan.
          Gina pulls Martin to the front. Unfriendly eyes STARE down
          Martin, the huge BOUNCER nods recognition to Gina.

          ON THE STREET
          Smith stops, takes in the many clubs, the various Bouncers
          guarding their doors. Looks down at his boring suit, nods
          defeat. Turns and walks away.

          INT. 'SHINE' NIGHT CLUB- NIGHT

          The club is barely-lit, punctuated by beams of moving light,
          constant music. The bar a glowing oasis. Gina leads Martin
          through. They pass down through old WWII bomb shelter
          construction, through curtains, into...

                         CHILL SPACE
          Even darker, only small glowing lights, candles, neon tubing
          casts shadows. Quiet almost, only the dull 'thud" of the
          bass reaches them.
          He puts a hand on her shoulder... she pushes it off.

                         MARTIN

          . and she LOSES IT. Flies at him, slapping clumsily. Like
          an enraged child. Martin grabbing her... holding her tight.
          Bodies pressed together... as her anger and fear and grief
          dissolve into sobbing...

                         GINA
          His family is in Africa. The
          money will just stop coming...
          they'll never know why...
          . Martin calming her, stroking her head. Her hand finding
          his, gripping it tight, wanting the contact. Martin looking
          down at the face buried in his chest. Feeling versus memory.
          Gina... Liz... Torn.
          A long beat. Her control returning. And her strength. She
          separates from him.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          You saved my life.
          No response. Eyes locked.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          .You never know, what you will
          do, until the time comes, right?
          Martin looks down, unsure. She stays on his face. Looking
          for... Her eyes shift:

          ACROSS THE SPACE
          A young Serbian MANAGER speaks with a female BARTENDER. Both
          cool, young, tough. Gina makes eye contact, heads nod in
          recognition.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Wait here...
          Martin watches her go, speak with them through low light and
          smoke. His gaze wander... into the strobing lights...

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- SUDDEN CUT -- MEMORY FLASH
          .all WHITE. It's snow, drifting down... settling on a
          small idyllic home. Picket fence. Lights glow inside...
          . Suddenly INSIDE. Liz sits on the edge of a bed, glass of
          red wine in her hands. Martin enters the frame, his clothing
          and hands covered in drywall dust.

                         LIZ
          Are you ready... ?
          Liz rubs dust off his face, leans in to kiss him...

          INT. SHINE NIGHT CLUB- NIGHT

          Martin's eyes flick open and the SOUND and LIGHT of the club
          come flooding back in...

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- GINA. UNDRESSING
          Low, moving lights pass across her body, wifebeater
          undershirt and jeans. She unzips the jeans, pulls them down
          long legs, pulls off the wifebeater, no bra...
          . hesitates. Looks back, sees that Martin is watching her.
          Beat. Beat. Lights catch glimpses of her body, her breasts,
          the arch of her back.
          She turns slightly away from him, pushes a pile of borrowed
          clothing towards him. A heavy coat, some jeans.

                         GINA
          .Put these on.
          She pulls a mod shirt on, glances back as he now undresses.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Were you happy?
          He looks up, shirt in his hands. She doesn't waiver.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Your marriage? Was it happy?

                         MARTIN
          .Yes. I think so... I don't
          remember... how it felt exactly.
          She approaches him, leans in so she can see his eyes...

                         GINA
          So why would she do this to you?

                         MARTIN
          .For the same reason I would.
          If I thought it was the only way
          to protect her.
          Gina nods, distant. Martin presses on, difficult.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          I keep having a dream. Liz is in
          the bedroom of our home, although
          it's different somehow. Her
          hair's different... she's
          smiling, about to say something.
          Then it ends. I can remember
          places, details...

          I just can't remember... how I
          felt.
          He stops. Just the low pulsing BEAT from the other room The
          lights revolving over them.
          Gina watching him. Looking back at her. That connection
          again. He looks away.
          She shakes it off, produces a borrowed joint, offers it to
          him. He shakes his head no. She shrugs, sparks it. Inhales
          deeply, eyes close. She leans back.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          You'll need to get out of town.
          There's a man who's helping me.
          He can --

                         GINA
          (seems to ignore him)
          In Bosnia... It was not like you
          probably imagine. It was nice.
          .there were cherry blossoms.

                         (BEAT)
          One day, I was sixteen. My
          sister and my brother came to me
          and said hey let's play hide and
          seek, down by the creek. He had
          ten Marka for whoever won. It
          was amazing, the way he just said
          it...
          Beat. She raises the joint, hits it again. Her eyes open,
          but she's deep in the memory and it's intense.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          .So I went down to this place I
          knew, under the small bridge over
          the creek. And I hid and waited.
          Not really that long... Then I
          went back home, to find my
          brother and collect my money.

                         (BEAT)
          He, and my father and my uncle
          were dead. And so was my mother.
          My sister was alive... for a
          little while.
          She turns her head, eyes blaze straight at Martin.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          It was not enough, to kill us.
          They wanted us to remember, every
          day, for the rest of our lives.

                         MARTIN

          No. No one touched me. But
          now... I'm not going anywhere.
          I'm not running anymore.
          She nestles in under his arm. Closes her eyes. He lets his
          hand gently stroke her hair.

                         MARTIN
          I won't let anything happen to
          you.

                         GINA

                         (SMILES SLEEPY)
          Liar... Say it again.

                         MARTIN
          I'll protect you.
          She opens her eyes again, looks up at him, smiles, on her way
          to sleep.

                         GINA
          .Cool.

          CHILL SPACE - LATER
          Gina sleeps, at peace. Martin leans over the one object he
          has left, his copy of "Horticus." He studies the number
          markings on the flap, working...

          EXT. BERLIN VELODROME - DAY

          Vast windowless cylindrical building on the city's edge.

          INT. BERLIN VELODROME -- DAY

          Cheering CROWD; a sound like THUNDER. A massive indoor
          STADIUM, CYCLISTS racing on a reverberating wood track below
          a suspended lighting rig the size of a spaceship.
          MARTIN at the counter of a busy bar. Jeans, T-shirt, Bomber
          Jacket. Different look, to say the least. Across the bar,
          GINA nurses a coffee. They exchange looks, briefly. A
          familiar grey-skinned figure settles next to him: JURGEN.

                         MARTIN
          Thank you for coming.
          Martin glances around, edgy. Jurgen watches him, glances at
          Gina long enough to let Martin know he's spotted her.

                         JURGEN
          You know, the most dangerous man
          in the world is the man who feels
          that he is drowning. He will
          drag under anyone who tries to
          help him.
          Jurgen sets his newspaper on the bar. A picture and article
          about the murdered nurse. Martin's picture, fuzzy.

                         MARTIN
          (nods, bitter)
          I... I didn't do it.
          Jurgen studies him, hard. Looks back at Gina.

                         JURGEN
          You said you had something.
          Martin feels in his pockets, takes out the copy of
          'Horticus', turns to the numbers on the end papers.

                         MARTIN
          These numbers, are a code. The
          first number refers to the page
          of a given book. The second to a
          specific line on that page. The
          third number to words on that
          line. If I didn't have the exact
          edition of the book, the code
          would be unbreakable.

                         JURGEN
          (nodding, impressed)
          And what do the numbers refer to?

                         MARTIN
          That's where it breaks down --
          the words are the Latin names of
          two plant species... Calochortus
          Albus... and Umbellularia
          Californica. Fairy Lantern...
          and California Bay. Both common
          flowering plants...

                         JURGEN
          Not part of your work? Or
          Professor Bressler's?
          Martin shakes his head. Jurgen grunts. Pencils notes...

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Your thesis. The one you sent
          Bressler. What was the title?

                         JURGEN
          And it was after reading it that
          he invited you here. Correct?

                         MARTIN
          Correct. Yes. Look --

                         JURGEN
          Did you ever know someone called
          Laurence Darnell?
          Martin looks at him quizzically. Shakes his head.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          He was a graduate student at the
          University of Wisconsin. He died
          in an auto accident earlier this
          year. He was doing research very
          similar to yours.
          Jurgen studying him closely. Martin shakes his head.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          What is Professor Bressler's
          relationship with Prince Fahad?

                         MARTIN

                         (SHRUGS)
          Fahad's sponsoring the Forum,
          Bressler's the keynote speaker.

                         JURGEN
          So they're not close?

                         MARTIN
          In a way... they're opposites.
          Bressler wants to end world
          hunger. Open research...
          universal access to all his data
          on crop cultivation...

                         JURGEN
          But Fahad's just a businessman.

                         MARTIN
          They're both progressives. Fahad
          knows we'll need food long after
          oil. New agricultural patents
          are worth billions...

          him... his own people hate him...
          the attempts on his life...

                         MARTIN
          He's got balls, that's for sure.
          Another beat. Jurgen slides the 'Uncle Sam' bookmark card
          from the pages of the 'Horticus'... turns it over, Martin's
          remembered schedule scribbled on the back.

                         JURGEN
          There's a cocktail party, before
          Bressler's speech tonight?

                         MARTIN
          It's in our suite. Champagne and
          hors d'oeuvres for Bressler and a
          few of his guests.

                         JURGEN
          Is Fahad going to be there?

                         MARTIN
          Yes. Bressler invited him...
          Martin trails off. Starting to get there...

                         JURGEN
          Martin Harris... with just a few
          guests, in a confined space with
          Prince Fahad. For some, that
          might be a very good reason to
          want to be you.

                         MARTIN
          Oh, Jesus... You can't --
          Jurgen flips his notebook shut. Gets up.

                         JURGEN
          -- I need a few more hours. You
          need to go somewhere you will not

          IN DEEP FOCUS behind her, Martin B comes out of the bathroom,

          Jurgen hands over a library card. A LIBRARIAN finds his
          request slip, slides two documents across the counter. One
          a printed monograph; the other a photocopy in brads.

          A WHILE LATER -- JURGEN AT A DESK
          He finishes reading the printed monograph. Closes it.
          Looking down at the cover... "The role of Gorytini and
          Thynnidae in Drakea pollination" by Martin Harris, PhD.
          He slides the bound photocopy next to it. "The process of
          Drakea pollination" by Laurence Darnell, University of
          Wisconsin. A long beat. The two titles side-by-side.
          Sudden thought... Jurgen takes something out of his pocket;
          the card that was inside Martin's 'Horticus'. The scribbled
          schedule notations on one side... turns it over: the bowling
          alley's Uncle Sam logo. Jurgen holds closer, studying it.
          His mind clicking...
          . printed German text. A number: 21. And right at the

          Martin and Gina stand amidst a flow of tourists and locals,
          near the entrance to Berlin's equivalent of Central Park and
          its zoo. Across, the Weinhaus Restaurant is a fin-de-siecle
          style brasserie bordering the avenue.

          Why here?

                         MARTIN
          .The zoo. She loves Polar
          Bears. I never knew exactly why.
          Gina nods, looks over to the restaurant. Looks back at
          Martin who hasn't moved. She checks her watch.

                         GINA
          Okay, go. You're going to be

          bordered by green. A labyrinth.

          AT THE PARK'S ENTRANCE
          Gina watches, sunglasses on, as a taxi pulls up and a wiry
          haired man steps out, pays the driver. Lap-top bag over his
          shoulder. BRESSLER.

          FEW MOMENTS LATER
          Another taxi arrives, Liz and Martin B get out.

                         MARTIN
          This shouldn't take long. I just
          need to see what Bressler wants.
          Liz's gaze settles on the painted sign for the zoo.

                         LIZ
          Take your time, I want to see the
          zoo anyway.
          ON LIZ. Memory, or nostalgia, touch her cool face.

                         LIZ (CONT'D)
          I love the Polar Bears...

          INT. WEINHAUS HUTH RESTAURANT - SAME

          The WAITER offers to take Bressler's lap-top bag. Bressler
          politely declines him...
          The waiter nods, leaves. Bressler opens the computer bag,
          checks on the lap-top inside. Zips it back up. Positions
          the bag by his elbow. Smiles to Martin B.

                         BRESSLER
          I thought we might have a table
          for three, in case you still had
          your alter ego with you.

                         MARTIN B
          No, thank God. I assume he's
          safely back in the hospital.

          Well, it's a lesson. You never
          know what people will do. All my
          work used to be on-line, my e-
          mails on an open server. A year
          ago, someone broke into my office
          and stole my computer. I believe
          they were after my research.
          Luckily, I split my data up and
          double encrypt it until I put it
          all together and make it public.
          That's why this stays with me
          until tonight's over...
          Martin B nods, starts to look at his menu...

                         BRESSLER (CONT'D)
          Now what was so important that it
          could not wait until this
          evening?
          ON MARTIN B, REALIZING he's been played. A single BLINK. A
          beat. When he looks up, he's cool.

                         MARTIN B
          I hope you can forgive me. It
          was something you said...

          Liz buys a ticket. Passes beneath the elephant gate.
          Martin starts to move forward... then DOUBLES BACK as Smith
          arrives, hurrying, again checking his phone. He pushes to
          the front of the line, pays his way in, eyes searching.

          No! God NO! You're focusing on
          the science, but this...
          (patting his laptop)
          .this is history. You open the
          research before it's finished,

          I'm sorry, it's my fault.
          Another appointment I forgot.

          It doesn't matter.
          (jumping back in)
          But see you, you say I am too
          cautious. It's an idiot thing to

          Her slim shoulders; her hair tucked into a scarf against the

          Polar Bear swims, inches in front of her.
          LIZ'S FACE. Her eyes, soft. A smile... which fades as she
          senses a presence. Turns. FACES us.

                         MARTIN
          Standing across from her in this protected space. A strange

          Gina steps past the line, confidently joins the group... just
          another parent. Swept through the turnstiles. Behind her,
          Martin B steps up to the ticket window.

          Taking a knife from the counter, Jurgen cuts around the
          bottom of the bag... lifts away a false floor. Reaches
          inside. The contents hidden from us... a shadow of tension
          crosses his face. Then a slow, enigmatic smile.

          82.

                         CONTINUED:

          A LITTLE LATER -- A KETTLE BOILING...
          . the mournful HOWL of its whistle. Jurgen turns off the
          gas. Spoons Nescafe into a mug. Opens a closet, reaches
          over a musty clutter of jars and boxes...
          finds a rusted sugar tin. Inside is a single ancient
          sachet of sweetener. A beat, pensive. He tears it open,
          adds it to the Nescafe. He looks up. Listening for...
          anticipating...
          . the lively KNOCK at his door.

                         THE HALLWAY
          Jurgen opens the door... it's RODNEY COLE, grinning...
          shaking rain from his coat.

                         COLE
          Herr Jurgen?

                         JURGEN
          Dr. Cole... Please, come on in.
          Jurgen ushers him in. Leads them into the living room.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Drink? I've a bottle labelled
          'brandy', which is more than
          likely hair lacquer... or some
          vodka my neighbor gave me after
          it made her husband go blind.

                         COLE

                         (LAUGHING)
          No, thank you...

                         JURGEN
          Maybe some coffee? I'm making
          some for myself.

                         COLE
          I'm good. Thanks.
          Cole looks around the tiny apartment. Sees the framed photos
          on the mantel. Looks closer.

                         COLE (CONT'D)
          You were in the military?

                         JURGEN
          The Stasi. In East Germany.

                         COLE
          Wow, wait till I tell my son. He
          loves all that Cold War stuff.
          Look at that car. What is that?

                         JURGEN
          A 'Zil'. Suspension of a donkey
          cart and smelt like a tannery.
          Vanished as quickly as the Wall.
          Cole studies the other pictures. Notices Martin's Rolex
          beside them. Jurgen pours the kettle into his mug.

                         COLE
          So. This business with Martin.
          A hell of a thing. How did he
          find you?

                         JURGEN
          Quite by chance, as it happens.

                         COLE
          Sounds like he was damn lucky.
          So, what can I do to help?

                         JURGEN
          Come with us to the authorities.
          Help them confirm his identity.

                         COLE
          The authorities? Jesus, it's
          that bad? A guy comes to you
          with a story like that. What
          made you take the case?

                         JURGEN
          Curiosity...

                         COLE
          Curiosity? Is that all?

                         JURGEN
          Professional curiosity. There's
          not much in this world left to
          interest an old spy like me...
          Cole's face tightens... his back still toward Jurgen.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          . a few questions I still think
          over. One in particular. From
          when I worked for the Aufklarung:
          our foreign intelligence wing.
          Cole still hasn't moved. Discreetly slips open a button on
          his jacket. Jurgen cradles his coffee, steam rising.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          There was this rumor. Of a US
          based assassination unit called
          Section 15. Freelance, deniable.
          They'd work for whoever would pay
          -- public sector, private sector.
          Second-to-none in their planning
          and efficiency. They never
          failed. What's more, they were
          invisible. They'd strike, and
          nobody would even know there had
          been foul play. It was only
          rumor, of course...
          Cole turning to face Jurgen. Smile gone. Glint of a gun
          inside his packet. Jurgen looking steadily back at him.
          Takes a deep gulp of coffee.

                         COLE
          You had fifteen minutes after I
          called. Why didn't you run?

                         JURGEN
          Where would I run from Section
          15, Mr. Cole? I can hardly walk.
          The edge of a smile, another large gulp of the coffee.
          Jurgen sets down the cup. He wheezes...

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          Before I could get Chesterfields,
          I smoked sixty machorkas a day.
          Filthy Soviet things. Killed
          more Russians than Stalin. My
          doctors assure me I'll soon be
          joining their list of casualties.
          Cole looking back at him, impassive.

                         COLE
          I want to know how he found you.
          I want every number, every source
          you've contacted on his behalf.

                         JURGEN
          And then what? We shake hands
          and you go away?
          Cole reaches a hand inside his jacket...

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          There's no need for that.
          Beat. Cole's eyes flicker. Jurgen's body tightening... the
          coffee... the empty sachet of sweetener...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         CONTINUED: (3)
          Cole looks at Jurgen. A moment's glimmer of respect. He
          doesn't move. His gaze lingering. Understanding.

                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
          You never think... you'll have
          the courage to use it.

                         COLE
          But we do. The best of us.
          Jurgen coughs again. Suddenly sways. Puts a hand out to
          steady himself. Knocking over the mug of coffee...
          as the cyanide sweeps through him. Trembling hands clasp
          the edge of table. Building force. Shaking. His piercing
          eyes never leaving Cole... through the pain:

                         JURGEN
          Tell me... if he remembers
          everything. What then...?
          No answer. Jurgen's hands slip. He slumps forward, his head
          hammering down onto the table. A final convulsion. Then
          he's still.
          A long beat. Cole buttons his jacket. Slips on some gloves.
          Gently lifts Jurgen's head from the table top, rests it on a
          forearm, as though Jurgen were asleep rather than dead.
          Restoring some dignity to him.
          Cole goes to the mantel, wipes off the one framed photo he
          picked up. Takes Martin's Rolex, drops it into his pocket.
          He turns, casting an expert eye over the apartment... The
          legs of the stove... ever so slightly askew...
          The phone RINGS... RINGS... Cole ignores it, moves forward.

          I./E. "JET EXPRESS" BUS/AUTOBAHN - LATE AFTERNOON
           Martin hits re-dial on his cell. Listens, frustrated. The
           phone RINGING and RINGING. He flips it shut. Gina's eyes
           meet his. A long beat. She looks back out the window.
           Sleeting rain streaks the glass. Endless grey city-scape.
          He tracks a clock: 1:40. Looks back at Gina who senses his
           gaze, keeps hers straight out.

          INT. JURGEN APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON


          COLE -- THE STOVE PULLED AWAY FROM THE WALL
          He finds a section of loose KICK-BOARD. Carefully pries it
          away. Reaches into the hole: The PHOTOGRAPH of Martin and
          Liz, arriving. And Jurgen's NOTEBOOK.

          86.

                         CONTINUED:
          He turns up the gas, feeds the photograph to the flames. As
          he watches it burn, he leafs carefully through the notebook.

          I/E ARRIVALS TERMINAL, TEGEL AIRPORT - LATE AFTERNOON
          Cathedral-like, overcrowded. Inaudible PAs. Carts loaded
          with luggage. Watchful POLICE and SECURITY.
          Martin and Gina, heads down under caps, navigate a surge of
          passengers rushing out of the doors, clutching bags,
          competing for taxis in the pouring rain...
          Martin stops. Deja-vu overload. His fractured memories.
          Past and present merging. The FACES. The SOUNDS...
          An AIRPORT SECURITY Man glances over, concerned. Gina tracks
          the attention, moves into Martin, fake-romantic, her face
          close to his...

          GINA (O.C.}
          Martin. C'mon...
           Gina touching his face. Bringing him back. He glances to a
          clock on the wall: 2:10...

          INT. LOST AND FOUND TEGEL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

          Martin and Gina wait at a counter. Clock reads 2:25. A
          WOMAN returns with a leather briefcase. A name tag on the
          handle. 'Dr. M.A. Harris'. Martin stares at it... reaching
          for memories. The woman checks her computer.

                         WOMAN
          May I see some identification?
          She looks up. Martin's expression distant...

                         GINA
          He doesn't have any. He was in
          an accident, that's why the bag
          was unclaimed...

                         MARTIN
          The combination. For the lock.
          It's 2... 8... 0... 6...
          A beat. The woman and Gina both looking at Martin. The
          woman enters the numbers. The locks pop open. She lifts the
          lid, picks something up. A pause... then her expression
          softens. She turns it toward Martin...

                         THE BRIEFCASE
          Filled with personal effects. Sitting on top a US passport.
          A long beat. Martin's hands unsteady as he opens it...

          87.

                         CONTINUED:
          His photo. And his name... Doctor Martin Harris.

          INT. AIRPORT CAFE -- LATE AFTERNOON

          Noisy and busy. Gina uneasy... watching Martin as he
          carefully examines each item in the case. Everything
          familiar, yet strange. His, but somehow not his.
          a copy of 'Scientific American' magazine, a comb, some
          gum, a Newark Airport parking ticket. His published paper --
          the same edition Jurgen found at the library.
          his leather wallet. Martin studies it. Identical to the
          one Martin B had. Opens it...

          CLOSE -- THE WALLET
          New Hampshire Driver's license. Credit cards. Martin
          fumbles inside a pocket, pulls out...
          . the EXACT SAME PHOTO we saw in Bressler's lab of a
          younger Liz with a younger Martin B in Paris. Except this
          time it's a younger Martin beside Liz-in the photo.

                         MARTIN
          gazing at it. He runs his fingers over its dock-eared
          corners, every bump and crease. Looks up to find Gina
          watching him. A long, awkward pause. She reaches over.
          Takes the photo from him. Studies it.

                         GINA
          Can you remember now... how you
          felt?
          Martin's silence hangs in the noise and activity around them.
          Gina handing back the photo. He stares down at Liz again as
          Gina stands, start to collect her things...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          We shouldn't stay here, it's not
          safe for you...
          Her voice trails off as she looks at Martin, really sees him
          in this moment. He looks up at her, torn, back down at the
          pictures, the relics of his life, his memories, spread out in
          front of him. He glances at the clock: 2:55...
          Gina tracks his gaze... gets it, takes a step back...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Oh, God. I'm an idiot. She's
          meeting you here.
          Martin meets her gaze, open book.

                         MARTIN
          .Yes. I'm sorry. Yes. She's
          my wife. She's in danger. I
          have to --

                         GINA
          (nodding, auto-pilot)
          That's good. I'm happy for you.
          I have to go.

                         MARTIN
          No, wait. I meant what I said.
          We can take care of you. I can
          get you money, arrange --

                         GINA

                         (FIERCE )
          Stop. Be quiet. You've got what
          you wanted. You don't need me
          anymore and in case "we've"
          forgotten, I take care of myself
          very well.
          She starts for the door. Martin getting up...

                         MARTIN
          Gina stops, turns. A beat. Sadness, anger.

                         GINA
          One kiss and suddenly...
          Everything that's happened? To
          Biko? To us? -- I know, she's
          your wife. Like I said, I'm an
          idiot.

                         (BEAT)
          Goodbye, Martin.
          She turns away again. Martin, frozen, watches her go.

          EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME

          Gina keeps walking. Pouring rain... ROAR of traffic. No
          look back. She joins the line waiting for taxis.

          INT. AIRPORT CAFE - SAME

          Martin still sitting there. The photo of him and Liz in
          Paris. Sudden decision, snaps the briefcase shut...

          EXT. AIRPORT TAXI RANK - SAME

          Gina almost at the head of the taxi line. A glance back.
          People... vehicles... no sign of Martin.

          EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME

          Martin out of the doors. Eyes frantically searching for
          Gina. In the distance... he sees her...

          EXT. TAXI RANK, TEGEL AIRPORT - SAME

          Gina at the front of the line. A taxi pulls up. She steals
          a last look back at the terminal...

          TAXI DRIVER (O.S.)

                         (GERMAN: SUBTITLED)
          Hey, lady. You ready...?
          Gina's face suddenly lighting up... she can see Martin!
          Spins back to the TAXI DRIVER...

                         GINA
          Wait. There's another passenger.

          EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL - SAME

          Martin weaving quickly through the crowds toward her... BUMPS
          PAST a man who looks back, his face lighting up...

                         MAN
          Martin. Martin...?
          Martin hesitates, turns. Sees...
          RODNEY COLE. Beaming smile. Martin stares at him,
          bewildered.

                         COLE
          Jesus, Martin, how are you doing?

                         MARTIN
          Rodney? What are you doing here?

                         COLE
          You called me, remember? You
          left a message on my machine.

                         MARTIN
          Yeah... but how did you know --?

          90.

                         CONTINUED:
          Cole suddenly right up close. Presses a rolled newspaper
          into Martin's side. Cold steel of a concealed Qun.

                         COLE
          Stay one step ahead of me. Any
          move, I'll shatter your spine.
          His voice flat with menace. Martin's mouth opening...

                         MARTIN
          What are -- ?

                         COLE
          -- Go...
          Martin glancing round. Cole jerks him back, guiding him
          toward the passenger pick-up zone.

          EXT. TAXI RANK. TEGEL AIRPORT -- SAME

          Gina looking back around. Bemused. Martin vanished again in
          the crowd. Then a sudden stab of alarm...

          GINA'S P.O.V. -- MARTIN... MOVING FAST
          A man she doesn't know carrying his case... headed toward a
          parked commercial van. Driver waiting for them. She
          recognizes him... SMITH. Martin hustled into the back... Van
          door shuts. Engine starts. A VOICE snaps us...

          . BACK TO SCENE -- THE TAXI DRIVER...
          standing in front of Gina -- losing patience.

                         TAXI DRIVER

                         (GERMAN: SUBTITLED)
          Miss. I ain't got all day.
          Mind racing. Beat. Points to a suitcase a few yards away.

                         GINA
          Help me with my bags, please.
          The driver goes to fetch the case. Is stopped by its OWNER.
          Raised voices. Moment's confusion. Then...
          .the SQUEAL of TIRES. The taxi driver spins around to see
          Gina gone and his own taxi pulling away. He YELLS after her,
          furious. But she's off in traffic...

          I/E. VAN/BERLIN CITY MOTORWAY - DUSK
          Smith drives. Deadly silence. Martin motionless. Cole
          opposite him with the gun, impassive.

          91.

                         CONTINUED:
          Interior goes dim as Smith takes a hard right, into an
          ABANDONED PARKING STRUCTURE, taking a ramp, spiraling up.

                         MARTIN'S EYES
          dart between Cole and Smith. Heart racing. Struggling to
          make sense of things. Cole studying him in quiet amazement.
          Shakes his head. Thinking out loud...

                         COLE
          My God... she's right. You're
          completely gone. You really
          think you are Martin Harris.

                         MARTIN
          What the hell Rod! You're my
          oldest friend! You know who I
          am. It's me... it's not that
          other guy. He's not --

                         COLE
          -- Martin Harris? You're right.
          He's not. He's the guy who took
          over for you after you went
          missing.
          Exasperated, Cole leans forward. Spelling it out.

          COLE (CONT'D?
          But you're not Martin Harris
          either. There is no Martin
          Harris.
          Martin staring at him. Blank. Confused. Scared.

                         COLE (CONT'D)
          Martin Harris doesn't exist. You
          invented him. He's your legend.
          A fiction you created. You made
          him up as a cover to get Bressler
          to invite you to the
          conference...

                         MARTIN
          No... That's insane. Liz, she----

                         COLE
          'Liz'...? Your "wife"? How do
          you think she feels about all
          this? You two were a good team,
          then you go and get Norman
          fucking Rockwell on her.

                         MARTIN
          That's not... she...

                         COLE
          -- they aren't real memories.
          Don't you get it? Martin Harris
          is a fabrication... but you've
          one and filled in the caps,
          invented a whole damn life for
          him. They could write a textbook
          about you! Jesus --!
          Martin's face. Spinning. Refusing to believe. The Van
          SCREECHES to a stop, Smith gets out pops the doors. The
          distant sound of the city traffic, a light wind, whistling.

          INT. TAXI CAB - SAME

          Gina, driving through traffic, searching, no sign of the
          van... then her gaze LOCKING ACROSS THE RIVER, four stories
          up on a parking garage: The white van.
          She hauls the wheel over, Taxi sliding through a U-turn.

          EXT. TOP STORY PARKING GARAGE - SAME

          Martin is tossed out onto the asphalt. Picks himself up,
          trying to orient...
          The structure abandoned, broke. No side rails, just pavement
          to the edge. Trash and graffiti everywhere. Desolate.
          Cole approaches, losing it now. Boiling with rage:

                         COLE
          All that studying... planning.
          Hell, you even had us take out
          that kid after we ripped off his
          thesis. A year of prep and you
          try to screw it up... . we do
          everything to bring you back in,
          but you go on trying to screw it
          up. Do you know how much time
          you've wasted? It's Thanksgiving
          for Christ's sake! I should be
          eating turkey with my kids, not
          here cleaning up after some wacko
          who bumps his head and decides
          his cover story's for real.
          Martin's eyes... staring back at him. Crumbling...

                         MARTIN
          But... I... who am I...?
          A pause. Cole shakes his head, pats him on the cheek.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                         COLE
          You. You were my best boy.
          .suddenly Cole SLAMS a fist into Martin's stomach. Martin
          doubles over. Cole WHIPS the gun across his FACE. Kicks him
          AGAIN. Martin on his hands and knees, spits blood. Cole
          glaring down at him. Disgusted.
          Smith covers Martin as Cole moves into the van, empties out a
          junkie's works: dropper with needle, bottle top, cotton
          balls, lighter. Expertly cooks up a fix of brown heroin.
          Draws it into the syringe, glancing back:

                         COLE (CONT'D)
          Look at you now. Nobody. A no-
          one. Just another dead junkie...
          Streak of CONCERN as the sound of tires screeching reaches
          them. Cole looks up in time to see Gina's taxi, rounding the
          ramp, accelerating towards them!
          Smith steps forward, gun raised, firing!

          INT. TAXI CAB - SAME

          Gina DUCKS as bullets pierce the front windscreen. The image
          of Smith, firing, grows large...

          BAM! -- IMPACT!

          EXT. TOP STORY, PARKING GARAGE - SAME

          Taxi catches Smith, carrying into the van, crushing him as
          the two vehicles slide towards the edge...
          Cole is HURLED across the van like a rag-doll, his legs are
          crushed between buckling rows of seats as...
          . The van SLIDES with the TAXI'S IMPACT... front wheels
          pushed off the garage edge... teeters, see-sawing.
          Gina scrambles from the wrecked taxi. Runs toward Martin,
          lying on the ground. Pulls Martin away, arm around him...

                         MARTIN
          Wait! WAIT!
          Martin breaks free, walks unsteady to the rear of the van,
          locks eyes with Cole, trapped, clawing towards the back...
          Martin puts a hand out... and takes his briefcase.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Is it true...?

                         COLE
          Caught, the van TEETERING... Sneers at Martin, starts to
          speak.. Eyes go WIDE as...
          THE VAN... TIPS... FALLING off the edge, Smith's body going
          with it... disappears. A moment of calm silence and then
          CRUNCH! A dull sick crash as the Van hits below.

                         MARTIN
          Stares down at the wreck. Mind spinning... Gina comes up,
          touches his shoulder.

                         GINA
          Martin...
          He turns, MOVES. She chases after him...

          EXT. GRUNERSTRASSE - CONTINUOUS

          Pouring rain. Vehicles hiss over the bridge. Gina catches
          up to Martin. Her voice straining above the traffic:

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Martin! Stop! Martin, what's
          wrong... ? Martin!

                         MARTIN
          . Jurgen... we were going to
          meet... I have to see him.

                         GINA
          We've got to go... leave Berlin.
          We've got to get out of here...!

                         MARTIN
          I have to!
          Martin's face. Blood streaking in the rain. Absolute. A
          long beat. Gina takes a deep breath.

          INT. CAFE ADLER - AFTERNOON

          A cafe looking onto the Kochstrasse, Checkpoint Charlie.
          Rain mists the windows. Mostly empty...
          TWO FIGURES, sitting in the shadows. Martin and Gina. He
          STARES down, lost, shivering -- not from the cold.

                         GINA
          Martin...?

          95.

                         CONTINUED:
          He glances up, lost, looks away. Gina takes his hand in
          hers, presses it to her lips. Holds it. Places it against
          the skin of her neck and collar bone. Stares at him.
          He looks up... the intimacy. From far away:

                         MARTIN
          he told me I'm one of them...
          the things he said... the things
          he said I've done...
          (beat, anguish)
          How can I be that person?

                         GINA
          Listen to me. You're not.
          You're not...
           Martin, looking up at her, lost. His eyes back to the clock
          on the wall: 6.15... Martin closes his eyes. Gina reaches
          out. Quiet. Gentle:

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Martin. He's not coming.
          A long beat. He nods, heavy-hearted. She's right. As they
          stand to go... door JINGLES...

          P.Q.V. -- IN THE DOORWAY
           a FIGURE peering around anxiously .. FRAU BRUNNER --
          Jurgen's neighbor, breathless determination as she hurries
          over. The bowling tote b in her hands.
          She thrusts it at Martin, talking rapidly and urgently in
          German. Gina translates...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          She's sorry she's late. She says
          Jurgen gave it to her. He said
          that you'd know... that Martin
          Harris would know what to do...
          Slowly, almost dazed, Martin takes the bag. Frau Brunner
          looking at him intently, still talking...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Herr Jurgen told her to wish you
          good luck... that it was a
          pleasure knowing Dr. Harris.
          Martin looks at her, nods slowly. A beat. Finally...

                         MARTIN
          Thank you.

          Frau Brunner nods. A pause. Then she turns, bustles away
          out the door, into the rain. Martin looks at Gina. In the
          half light of the cafe window, he unzips the bag...

          MARTIN'S P.O.V. -- INSIDE THE BAG...
          Shoes... towel... shirt... digs down, pushing them aside.
          The floor of the bag neatly cut out. Revealing...
          A hidden compartment. Thick roll of BILLS... Euros, US
          dollars, Swiss francs... and TWO PASSPORTS...
           Canadian. He takes one out, flips it open. An entry stamp:
          'Berlin... August 28th.' Finds the photo page...
          It's him. Martin! But fair-haired, and in horn-rimmed
          glasses. The name... 'Tim Carmichael'... a Canadian citizen.
          The second passport...
          'Rachael Carmichael'. It's Liz... with short, dark hair.
          The Liz from his recurring memory.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          No... No...

          SUDDEN P.O.V. MEMORY FLASH -- HITTING HARD, CLEAR...
          Liz towels short dark hair. Door of a hotel bathroom. Liz
          turning... smiling. Embroidered on the towel... the 'H...
          I...' now visible in detail: 'Hotel Imperial'...

          BACK TO SCENE -- MARTIN RISES FAST
          His chair falling. Gina moves to help, he pushes her away.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          No! Leave me alone.
          He stumbles away, pushing towards the bathroom.

          INT. CAFE BATHROOM - SAME

          Martin lurches in, locks it, goes to the small sink, STARES
          at himself in the mirror.

          No...

          SMASH CUT -- BACK TO MARTIN
          He puts hand out against the memory, covers his reflection.
          His eyes stare back at him all the same...

          SUDDEN SUPER-INTENSE MEMORY FLASH... CLEAREST YET...
          .Liz towelling short, dark hair. She smiles up. Lips
          moving...

                         LIZ
          Are you ready...?
          .and MARTIN ENTERS THE FRAME, hair cut and colored
          differently. There's drywall dust on his hands and clothing.
          As he leans to kiss her, we CONTINUE...
          .INTO THE BATHROOM... to a wall beside the shower... panels
          cut away, exposed plumbing. Something integrated into the
          wall behind the pipes. MOVING CLOSER...
          Semtex plastigue... circuits and wires... diiï¿½ video
          timer connected to a high-tech DETONATOR...

          SMASH CUT -- BACK TO MARTIN
          Shaking his head, knowing. Tears streak, he wipes them away,
          hard. His fingers find his shirt pull it open...
          .STARES at his own body in the mirror. Fingers trace a
          scar across his chest, a healed knife wound. Three small
          raised bumps on his torso: healed bullet wounds.
          He blinks. His breath flows out of him. Surrender.

          INT. CAFE ADLER - MOMENTS LATER

          Gina, uncertain, with the passport... looking at the small
          photograph of 'Tim Carmichael'... notices Martin's paper in
          the case, the one he was reading on the airplane. Pages
          splayed... underlined.
          Cautious... she removes the document. Opens to the end.

          MARTIN (O.S.)
          I made him up... I made him up to
          kill a man I've never met.

          98.

                         CONTINUED:
          Gina STARTS, puts the paper down. Martin is at the table,
          looking down at her. His emotions sick, his gaze rotten.

                         GINA
          The entry stamp in your passport.
          You were in Berlin three months
          ago...
          Martin, like a statue. Voice, dead.

                         MARTIN
          Prince Fahad is going to be
          assassinated today. There's a
          bomb in the suite. I put it
          there.
          A long beat. Gina's eyes meet his, brief, scared. Sudden
          shift. Martin stuffs the cash back in the bag. Grabs her by
          the arm, propels them both outside...

          EXT. KOCHSTRASSE - SAME

          Martin pushes them into the alley next to cafe, jams the bag
          into her arms.

                         MARTIN
          Take this... get out of Berlin.
          Gina shaking her head.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Take it and go! Get as far away
          from me as you can.

                         GINA
          I'm not leaving you! Listen to
          me: Maybe you're not the man who
          went into the water. But you are
          the man I pulled out...
          Martin, staring into his reflection on the wet street...

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          Martin, there's no way you can
          show your face at the hotel.
          Everyone is looking for you. I

                         CAN --
          WHAM! MARTIN LURCHES UP AT GINA! He SLAMS her back against
          the brick wall, his hand around her neck, cutting off her
          air, literally lifting her feet off the ground.

                         MARTIN

                         (THE MONSTER)
          Look at me. Look at me...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CONTINUED:
          Gina SPUTTERS, tries to draw air. Her eyes LOCK on his.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          .Is this what you want? Is
          this the person you still want to
          help.

                         (SQUEEZING TIGHTER)
          You should have let me drown...
          She sputters, eyes start to roll back in her head, losing
          consciousness. Martin RELEASES and she drops in the dirt
          water of the Alley, hands and knees, GASPING for breath.
          Martin stares down at her. He picks up the bag, drops it in
          front of her face...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Pure instinct and adrenaline. Gina grabs the bag, stumbles
          across the street, HORNS BLARE as cars swerve to avoid her...
          And she's gone.

          EXT. BERLIN STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON

          Martin walks... numb. He waits at street corners, crosses
          with lights, moves through the city...

          EXT. MARSHALL BRIDGE - SUNSET

          Martin stands at the broken railing where Gina's taxi plunged
          into the water seven days ago. The tire marks are there.
          The railing is half-repaired, half taped off.
          He stares down into the oily black water, toes near the
          edge... weight shifting... then his knees give. He sits
          hard, his hands moving uselessly, almost on their own.
          Tears flow freely. Sobs RACK his body.

          PULLING WAY BACK -- ACROSS THE STREET
          . to where Gina stands, hidden in shadows. She's followed
          him here. Now frozen, watching him suffer.

          E/I. HOTEL IMPERIAL & CONFERENCE CENTER - NIGHT
          Lit up for the big night. Taxis and limos pulling in. In
          the lobby, beautiful people mingle with the celebrities of
          science. Herr Strauss scans the crowd, watchful.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME

          Two attentive SECURITY GUARDS scan monitors, roll through
          different views of the hotel.
          ON MONITORS: Crowds pass through security on their way into
          the conference room. Outside, a line of Mercedes pulling up.
          Fahad entering the building, surrounded by his entourage of
          security and beautiful women.

          E/I. SERVICE ENTRANCE, HOTEL IMPERIAL - SAME
          The same entrance Martin was led by before. Two BELLHOPS,
          wearing only T-shirts, enjoys smokes in the crisp night air.
          One tosses the butt, reaches for his jacket... it's gone.

                         PASSING INSIDE
          Martin, buttoning the last button of the jacket, moves into
          the hotel. No longer lost. Here to make amends.

          INT. 14TH FLOOR HALLWAY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - SAME

          PRINCE FAHAD, flanked by his entourage, arrives at the door
          to the Eisenhower Suite. Hum of a party from within.
          Security KNOCKS. Beat... Liz opens the door. Radiant.

                         LIZ
          Your highness... we're honored
          you could attend this evening.

                         FAHAD
          (kissing her hand)
          The honor is all mine.
          Liz BEAMS, gestures him into the room filled with a dozen or
          so notable guests. Martin B engrossed in a conversation...

          BRESSLER (O.S.)
          Look, I probably have it
          somewhere... Perhaps my wife --
          BRESSLER, held at the door by Fahad's security, searching his
          pockets for an invitation.

                         BRESSLER (CONT'D)
          I'm late. Very un-German of me.

                         FARAD
          (to his security)
          I don't think the professor needs
          an invitation. He is, after all,
          the reason we are all here.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         CONTINUED:
          Bressler steps in, takes Liz's outstretched hand. He looks
          her up and down. Matter-of-fact.

                         BRESSLER
          Now I can see why somebody would
          pretend to be Martin.
          Liz laughs, her face lighting up... then chillincj as
          Bressler's TWO DAUGHTERS appear behind him, smiling shy.

                         LIZ
          .I didn't realize the girls
          were coming this evening.

                         FAHAD
          But of course. Lily and Laurel
          are the real reason any of us put
          up with Leo at all.
          Fahad bends down and the girls run to him, a familiar face.
          Fahad hoists one up, takes the other by the hand.
          ON LIZ. Hard beat. Looking to Martin B who stares back,
          cool. Liz nods, accepting the casualties. She takes
          Bressler's coat, reaches for his computer bag.

                         LIZ
          Let me take these...
          Bressler hesitates a moment, then lets go...

                         BRESSLER
          Separation anxiety. Just leave
          it there, if you could.
          He gestures to a sideboard in open sight.

                         LIZ
          Of course...

          LIZ -- WITH HIS BAG
          She turns, hangs up his coat. As she does so... her fingers
          slip inside the laptop bag. Slide a tiny Bluetooth
          connection card into the computer's bus port.
          Liz turns away. Smile gone. Moves down the hall towards...

                         BATHROOM
          Same P.O.V. we've seen in Martin's flashes. SMASH CUT...

          INSIDE THE BATHROOM WALL
          The BOMB. Semtex... circuit boards... a TIMER vamped from a
          DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDER. A sleeping monster.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME

          The Security Guard on the monitors squints, watches a
          "Bellhop" moving down a hall. Something about the way he
          moves... ZOOMING in on him.

                         SECURITY GUARD
          (German, subtitled:)
          Where is Herr Strauss...?

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE BEDROOM - SAME

          Liz closes and locks the door. Sits at the desk at another
          laptop, firewire plugged into a Linksys antenna.

          CLOSE -- THE COMPUTER
          Liz's fingers tap the keyboard. The 'desk-top' divides in
          two... files headlined in German; Bressler's computer.
          'Password blank' pops up. First encryption.
          Liz opens a new copy of 'Horticus' to a marked page. Finds
          the words. Types in: 'Calochortus albus'. Another 'password
          blank' flashes up. Second encryption. Liz types:
          'Umbellularia Californica'. Screen blanks, then refreshes.
          Padlock icon gone... Liz quickly drags them across to her
          desktop. Spinning egg-timer symbol. Files transferring...

          INT. 14TH FLOOR, HOTEL IMPERIAL - SAME

          Elevator doors open, letting out a few guests and Martin. An
          arrow indicates "EISENHOWER SUITE."
          He starts to move, clearing a corner, up ahead the entrance
          to the suite... OOOFF! The wind taken out of him as four
          BURLY MEN in suits SCOOP him by his arms...

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - BEDROOM - SAME

          Egg-timer disappears... 'file transfer complete'. Liz shuts
          the laptop. Slips it in a case.
          She picks up the REMOTE CONTROL for the suite's plasma TV.
          Selects 'Menu', thumbs in a ten digit code. Points the
          remote at the wall. Tight pause... Presses 'enter'.

          INSIDE THE BATHROOM WALL -- THE DIGITAL TV TIMER

          SUDDENLY COMES ALIVE, 00:08:00, 00:07:59, 00:07:58...

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - SAME

          Bressler's daughters, shyness gone, play hide--n--seek amidst
          the grown ups. Bressler steps away from Fahad, heads over to
          his computer. Stops as Liz comes out of the bedroom.

          BRESSLER (O.S.)
          Ah, Mrs. Harris...

                         LIZ
          Checking on your baby again?

                         BRESSLER
          I can't help it.

                         LIZ
          Why don't you just wear it? As a
          nerdy accessory? Here, turn
          around.
          Liz picks up the bag. Adjusts the strap... slipping out the
          Bluetooth. Places the bag over Bressler's shoulders.

                          LIZ (CONT'D)
           There. Perfect.

          TIMER COUNTING DOWN: 00:05.12., 00:05:11...

          INT. 14TH FLOOR HALLWAY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - NIGHT

          Elevator doors open on an ELEGANT COUPLE who step forward
          revealing... Gina, at the back at the elevator. She's
          transformed: An elegant designer dress, plunging neckline.
          As she moves forward, toned legs flash from a high slit in
          the dress. She's graceful, beautiful, heads turn...

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME

          Martin is pushed roughly into a chair facing a displeased
          HERR STRAUSS. A GUARD handcuffs his wrist to the chair.

                         MARTIN
          You're not listening! There is a
          bomb, in the Eisenhower Suite. I
          put it there.

                         STRAUSS
          But isn't that the suite 'you'
          are staying in, 'Dr. Harris'...?
          Or wait, you're not Dr. --

                         MARTIN
          I've told you! There's no time
          to explain this...

                         CONTINUED:
          Strauss rises, starts to turn away. Martin's gaze lands on
          one of the VIDEO MONITORS. Eyes lock:
          P.O.V. -- ON THE MONITOR: Gina, beautiful, approaching the
          Eisenhower Suite.

                          MARTIN (CONT'D)

                         (SUDDENLY)
          I can prove it. Pull up your
          lobby recordings from August 27
          of this year.
          Strauss, startled by the ferocity in Martin's voice.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Do it. NOW. Do it or many
          people will die. I'm not lying.
          A beat... Strauss nods to one of his technicians who starts
          to type into a console...

          INT. 14TH FLOOR HALLWAY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - NIGHT

          Gina reaches the door to the suite, stopped by security.

                         SECURITY GUARD
          Invitation?
          She meets the guard's gaze with cool superiority. Her eyes
          flick to Fahad across the room.

                         GINA
          Are you serious...? Why don't
          you ask the Prince?
          The guard hesitates, unsure... it's all she needs. She moves
          by him, into the room.

          INT. EISNENHOWER SUITE - SAME

          Gina quickly takes in the suite. Far away, Bressler and
          Fahad, engrossed in conversation. One of Bressler's
          daughters, LILY, peeking out from under a table. At the bar,
          Martin B, drinks in his hands, turning towards her...
          She turns towards a picture window, watches the reflection...

                         MARTIN B
          . makes eye contact with Liz across the room, she heads
          towards the back. He begins to follow... hesitates...
          He looks back, to the picture windows. Empty now.

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

          Martin, sweating, nervous, eyes flicking to the monitors as
          the technician brings up the reception video, starts fast-
          forwarding through footage. Images go by, almost too fast...

                         STRAUSS
          .What exactly are you hoping to
          find?
          Martin ignores him, his eyes TRACKING.

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

          Fahad finishes a joke. Laughter. Martin B still scanning
          the room... Gives up, turns to meet Liz already there with
          their computer case and a sportsbag. She hands him the
          sportsbag, they wordlessly leave through the rear door...

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Unseen by anyone, a monitor shows Liz and Martin B, entering
          an emergency stairwell, hurrying. Martin's eyes scan...

                         MARTIN
          There! Stop!
          The technician freezes the image: A dapper couple, checking
          in. He wears a sportsjacket, light-haired, horn-rimmed
          glasses. She's got short dark hair.
          Martin points. Strauss leans in, sensing it.

          INT. EISNENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

          Gina approaches Bressler and Prince Fahad, intense, urgent.
          Fahad's SECURITY reads her expression, GRABS her arm.

                         GINA

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Sir! Your highness! You're in
          danger here. There is a bomb in
          this room!
          Bressler and the Prince look over, confused, interested...
          . and Fahad's Security ACTS. A gun lined on Gina, pushing
          her back. Two men grab the Prince, pushing back other
          guests, hustle him toward the suite's emergency exit,.

          Fahad in the middle, looking back as he's swept out, captive
          to his own security...

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

          The image ROLLS FORWARD, slowly: The man at the counter
          kisses his wife's hair, glances upwards... It's MARTIN.

                         MARTIN

                         (QUIET)
          Do you see...?
          Beat. Beat. And then MOTION on the monitors: The Prince
          and his detail, rushing down a corridor. Strauss tracks...

                         STRAUSS
          (German, subtitled:)
          Sound an alarm. Evacuate the
          hotel.
          (to 2 of his men)
          You and-you, you're with me.
          We'll meet the Prince at the
          loading docks.
          (to a Guard)
          You, take him downstairs.
          Strauss and his men flood out. The guard pulls keys, starts
          to uncuff Martin from his chair.

          INT. EMERGENCY STAIRCASE - SAME

          Martin B and Liz stop in their tracks. Doors opening ABOVE.
          Sound of panicked guests pouring onto the stairs.
          . Liz's face. Ice cold. Processing. Deciding. Hands
          Martin B the computer, takes the sportsbag from him.

                         LIZ
          Stop the timer. I'll finish it.
          Martin B nods, takes the stairs back up two at a time,
          shouldering his way past the folk streaming downward...

          TIMER COUNTING DOWN: 00:2:05., 00:02:04...

          INT. EISNENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

          ALARMS BLARE! Lights flash. Guests press out. A German
          voice comes over speakers, advising people to leave...
          Gina moves towards the exit, turns to see Bressler standing
          in the middle of the room, one daughter in his arms,
          frantically searching for the second.

                         GINA
          Professor! Over here!
          Gina at the table she saw Lily at before, lifts the
          tablecloth to find a frightened little girl staring back.

                         GINA (CONT'D)
          It's okay, come on...
          The girl, convinced, swept into Gina's arms. She and
          Bressler head for the door, each carrying a child.

          INT. MEZZANINE FLOOR - SAME

          Confusion, alarm. People doubling back down the stairs.
          Automated evacuation ANNOUNCEMENTS...

          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME

          Guard begins to cuff one of Martin's arms. Martin faces the
          monitors, SMILES as he sees Fahad's people meet up with
          Strauss at the loading dock, hustle Fahad into a Limousine...
          ANOTHER MONITOR: Martin B, rushing back upstairs.
          Martin watches... interested... eyes track... narrow.
          ANOTHER MONITOR: Gina and Bressler, running into a corridor
          with the two girls. Martin smiles a little, relieved...

                         MARTIN
          Lily, Laurel...
          The smile... dying. Realization...

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Bressler's daughters... Lily.
          Laurel... Calochortus albus...
          Umbellularia Californica...
          Flowers... Passwords...
          He SCANS the many monitors, LOCKS onto: Liz, moving down a
          corridor, purposeful.

                         MARTIN (CONT'D)
          Fahad was never the target. It's
          Bressler! You have to tell
          Strauss! They're after Bressler!

          The guard shoves him against the console, starts to cuff his
          other arm. Martin LURCHES back, both of them tumbling over.
          Martin scrambles for the door...

          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

          Martin stumbles out into a crush of panicked stragglers,
          ducks down, lost in the press. Moments after, the guard
          appears at the door, speaking into his radio...

          INT. EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

          Martin B rushes into the room. Stops. Like Pompeii: a party
          abandoned. Furniture upended. Guests. All gone.
          Urgently searching for the remote. Down on his hands and
          knees. Looks at his watch. Pales...

          INTO THE BATHROOM -- MARTIN B
          . KICKS at the wall. No good. RIPS the heavy cistern lid
          off the top of the toilet. SMASHES it against the plaster.
          Dents... dust... beginning to give...

          INT. LOBBY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - CONTINUOUS

          Gina and Bressler come out onto the floor with the girls,
          heading to the bottleneck at the exits...

                         BEYOND THEM
          LIZ, moving purposefully towards the group, closing, her hand
          in the unzipped top of the sportsbag slung over her shoulder.
          Glimpse of an oiled-black Uzi machine pistol.

          FAR ACROSS THE LOBBY
          The other direction. Martin appears, handcuff dangling from
          one wrist. He SCANS frantic through the bottlenecked crowds.
          SEES Gina and Bressler! Martin starts forward, ducks back as
          Strauss re-enters, commanding his security.

                         BEHIND THEM
          Liz closes, tracking, finger flicks off Uzi's safety.

                         MARTIN

          Gina hears his voice, can't find him through the crowds as
          next to her Bressler comforts his daughters as BEHIND THEM
          Liz moves closer, closer...
          . Suddenly seeing Martin. A decision, sudden SHIFT. Liz
          passes, brushing Gina lightly as she goes.
          GINA, registering the touch, looks up at the woman walking
          away from her now recognizing Martin, pressing through the
          crowd towards her. Gina's face lighting up!
          MARTIN, pushes by a group of people, closing towards Gina and
          suddenly Liz is in his arms, grasping him, romantic...

                         LIZ

                         (LOUD)
          Oh thank God you're here!
          Martin stares at her in horror as she beams up at him. One
          hand caressing his cheek...
          .her other hand pressing a knife against his chest.

                         GINA
          Seeing Martin and Liz, embracing. Confused. Alarmed. Hurt.

          LIZ AND MARTIN
          Liz still hugging him tight, whispering hard, her free hand
          sliding something metallic into his pocket.

                         LIZ (CONT'D)
          Hello, Martin. I just placed a
          gun in your jacket pocket. One
          bullet. There's really only one
          person, one right way to kill
          Bressler now, isn't there? The
          crazy man whose been stalking
          him, the crazy man who pretended
          to be Martin Harris...

                         MARTIN
          No...

                         LIZ
          Oh, and after you've shot him,
          point the gun at the Police.

                         MARTIN
          I won't do it...

                         LIZ
          God you're weak. The 'Martin' I
          knew wouldn't have been able to
          go on living like you are.

          Her eyes duck, purposeful, he tracks her gaze. Sees the Uzi
          in the sportsbag...

                         LIZ (CONT'D)
          I'll kill them all. Bressler,
          the girls... your new girlfriend,
          and whoever tries to stop me.
          Look at it this way: I'm giving
          you a chance to save most of
          them. You can be the hero...
          A kiss, sexy. Gina in the background, taking a step back...

          Ooops, bet you wish you could
          explain that. Time's up, Martin.
          Go finish what you came to Berlin
          for in the first place.
          On Martin. Caught. No play. He turns, walks...

          timer. 00:00:14, 00:00:13...
          Jams his hand into the hole. Trying to force it past the
          narrow opening. Desperately feeling for the controls.

          INT. LOBBY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - CONTINUOUS

          Martin, on a suicide mission. Walks in a daze towards Gina,
          Bressler beyond. His hand moves into his pocket.

          Martin and Gina, locked, staring. Her face a million
          questions... No answers. Martin shakes his head, turns away
          from her, towards Bressler, his hand coming out of his pocket
          with the gun... In Martin's face: horror, deadly
          conviction... Time SLOOOWS. Sound AMPLIFIES...

          STRAUSS AND HIS MEN
          .Seeing the gun. Shouting! Weapons being drawn!

          shot. No choice. Finger on the trigger...

          Martin B stands, dusts off his coat, starts to walk out of

          "beep." He looks down, REACTS to: The remote control...
          under his foot.

          VISION RACKS TO THE BOMB: 00:00:02., 00:00:01...

          Fuck...

          KABOOM!!! WHITE OUT BLAST
          as the bomb DETONATES. Martin B atomized. Sheets of

          KA-BOOM! The blast ROCKS the room. People tumble,

          LIZ dives aside as a column SLAMS down near her. SPRINKLERS
          burst on. Water rains down. Main lights black out... beat,

          Food-laden serving carts, cook-tops, pots and pans, knives.
          Falling plaster and debris... deserted.
          Liz walks through, brisk, angry. Dress torn, a cut across
          her forehead. She stops at a disposal chute, disposes of the
          sportsbag. Reaches high under her dress, comes out with a
          knife, starts to toss it as well...
          .She STOPS. Looks up, into the distorted mirror of the
          stainless steel surface in front of her.

                         LIZ
          .Hello, Martin.
          REVOLVING... to find Martin there. Bleeding, hurt, covered
          is debris, but holding the gun on her in unsteady hands.

                         LIZ (CONT'D)
          Be careful, that might go off.
          She turns to face him. Hair slicked, clothes drenched.
          Stunning despite everything

                         LIZ (CONT'D)
          Five years as a team... and you
          end it like this.
          Her hand almost casually moves back, the knife still seated
          in her palm. Martin tracks it, steadies the gun.

                         MARTIN
          Don't. Keep your hands where I
          can see them. Please...
          GROANING from the hotel structure. Plaster and cables fall,
          SPARK across the floor. Martin FLINCHES, tries to keep
          steady. Liz is steady, cool. Laughs a little.

                         LIZ
          You know, working with you... it
          almost wasn't work. We were so
          good... You, were so good. At
          the job. At other things...
          She smiles a little, warming.

                         LIZ (CONT'D)

          Let go of the knife, Liz.

                         LIZ
          'Liz?'... Don't you want to know
          y real name? Don't you still
          want... me?
          She leans forward, just a breath. Warmth radiating, Martin
          stepping back...

                         MARTIN
          Please, just stop, Liz...
          Her face, reading him. His fear, his uncertainty... She
          smiles, just a little... Liz throws the knife! Martin FIRES
          as the blade sinks into him, sending him reeling back onto
          the floor.

                         MARTIN
          His hand going to the knife sunk in his shoulder, SCREAMING
          in agony as he rips it out, looking up at...

                         LIZ
          A soft distance in her face. A small hole in her chest, just
          below her beautiful collar bone. Her eyes find him, focus,
          smile...

                         LIZ
          You'll never know. You'll never
          know who you are...
          A long beat. We're not sure when exactly the life goes out
          of her eyes. Finally, Martin pulls himself forward. Gently
          closes her eyelids.

          EXT. HOTEL IMPERIAL - NIGHT

          Police keeping people back. FIRE TRUCKS everywhere, jets of
          water fighting back the flames. A collective GASP...
          as the bomb-damaged corner of the hotel starts to FOLD
          INWARD in a spray of dust and smoke.

                         GINA
          moves through the crowd, anxiously searching the stream of
          people still pouring from the building...
          She JUMPS as a hand takes her arm. Turns her. Martin. she
          stumbles back, hands raised against him. Fear, betrayal,
          love... Him standing there, empty, bleeding...

          Gut instinct wins. She takes a step towards him, he pulls

          Hotel survivors... Bressler: shaken, oblivious that he's the

SCRIPT DATE 5/25/94


1 -BLACK

     The lonely sound of a buoy bell in the distance. Water
     slapping against a smooth, flat surface in rhythm. The
     creaking of wood.

     Off in the very far distance, one can make out the sound of
     sirens.

     SUDDENLY, a single match ignites and invades the darkness. It
     quivers for a moment. A dimly lit hand brings the rest of the
     pack to the match. A plume of yellow-white flame flares and
     illuminates the battered face of DEAN KEATON, age forty. His
     salty-gray hair is wet and matted. His face drips with water
     or sweat. A large cut runs the length of his face from the
     corner of his eye to his chin. It bleeds freely. An un-lit
     cigarette hangs in the corner of his mouth.

     In the half-light we can make out that he is on the deck of a
     large boat. A yacht, perhaps, or a small freighter. He sits
     with his back against the front bulkhead of the wheel house.
     His legs are twisted at odd, almost impossible angles. He
     looks down.

     A thin trail of liquid runs past his feet and off into the
     darkness. Keaton lights the cigarette on the burning pack of
     matches before throwing them into the liquid.

     The liquid IGNITES with a poof.

     The flame runs up the stream, gaining in speed and intensity.
     It begins to ripple and rumble as it runs down the deck
     towards the stern.                                                       

2     EXT. BOAT - NIGHT - STERN                                             2'

     A stack of oil drums rests on the stern. They are stacked on
     a palette with ropes at each corner that attach it to a huge
     crane on the dock. One of the barrels has been punctured at
     it's base. Gasoline trickles freely from the hole.

     The flame is racing now towards the barrels. Keaton smiles
     weakly to himself.

     The flame is within a few yards of the barrels when another
     stream of liquid splashes onto the gas. The flame fizzles out
     pitifully with a hiss.

     Two feet straddle the flame. A stream of urine flows onto the
     deck from between them.

                                            BLUE 06/01/94

                                                               2.

The sound of a fly zipping. Follow the feet as they move over
to where Keaton rests at the wheel house.

CRANE UP to the waist of the unknown man. He pulls a pack of
cigarettes out of one pocket and a strange antique lighter
from the other. It is gold, with a clasp that folds down over
the flint. The man flicks up the clasp with his thumb and
strikes it with his index finger. It is a fluid motion,

somewhat showy.
Keaton looks up at the man. A look of realization crosses his
face. It is followed by frustration, anger, and finally
resignation.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           How are you, Keaton?

                             KEATON
           I'd have to say my spine was broken,
           Keyser.

He spits the name out like it was poison.

The man puts the lighter back in his pocket and reaches under
his jacket. He produces a stainless .38 revolver.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           Ready?

                             KEATON
           What time is it?

The hand with the gun turns over, turning the gold watch on
its wrist upward.
The sound of sirens is closer now. Headed this way.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           Twelve thirty.

Keaton grimaces bitterly and nods. He turns his head away and
takes another drag.
The hand with the gun waits long enough for Keaton to enjoy  
his last drag before pulling the trigger.

GUNSHOT

The sound of Keaton's body slumping onto the deck.

                                          YELLOW 06/11/94


                                                             3.

MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DECK. Below is the stream of gasoline
still flowing freely.

The sound of the gasoline igniting. The flame runs in front
of us towards the barrels, finally leaping up in a circle
around the drums, burning the wood of the pallet and licking
the spouting stream as it pours from the hole.

MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DOCK, away from the boat.

The pier to which the boat is moored is littered with DEAD
BODIES. Twenty or more men have been shot to pieces and lie
scattered everywhere in what can only be the aftermath of a
fierce fire-fight.

A BARGE COMES INTO VIEW.                                             

On the deck of the barge is a tangle of cables and girders.          
The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon           
beneath its base.                                                    

MOVE INTO THE DARKNESS.

Sirens are close now. Almost here. The sound of fire raging
out of control.

SIRENS BLARING. TIRES SQUEALING. CAR DOORS OPENING. FEET
POUNDING THE PAVEMENT.

MOVE FURTHER, SLOWER, INTO THE DARKNESS

Voices yelling. New light flickering in the surrounding
darkness.

SUDDENLY, AN EXPLOSION.

Then silence. TOTAL BLACKNESS.

We hear the voice of ROGER "VERBAL" KINT, whom we will soon
meet.

                         VERBAL (V.O.)
           New York. - six weeks ago. A truck loaded
           with stripped gun parts got jacked
           outside of Queens. The driver didn't see
           anybody, but somebody fucked up. He heard
           a voice. Sometimes, that's all you need.

3     INT. DARK APARTMENT - DAY - NEW YORK - SIX WEEKS PRIOR TO
      PRESENT DAY

      The black explodes with the opening of a door into a dark
      room. Outside, the hall is filled with blinding white light.
      Shadows in the shapes of men flood into the room. We can make
      out men in hoods with flashlights. They are laden with
      weapons.

                                   VOICES
                 POLICE. SEARCH WARRANT. DON'T MOVE.

      It is a blur of violent action and sound.'Beams of
      flashlights cut the darkness in all directions.

      FINALLY:

      A dozen flashlights land on one man. He lies naked in bed,
      Merging from a deep sleep. He squints at the flood of
      blinding white light, more annoyed than frightened. He nearly
      laughs at the sound of countless guns cocking. He is
      McMANUS. Age twenty-eight.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                 Mr. McManus?

                                  McMANUS
                 Yeah.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                 Police. We have a warrant for

      Two dozen black gloved hands grab him and yank him out of
      bed.

      An old paint mixer vibrates furiously.
      TODD HOCKNEY, a dark, portly man in his thirties is working
      on an old Fire-bird.

      Hockney withdraws a filthy towel and wipes grease and sweat
      from his forehead.

S     EXT. STREET - NEW YORK - DAY

      FRED FENSTER, a tall, thin man in his thirties strolls
      casually down the street. He is dressed conspicuously in a
      loud suit and tie with shoes that have no hope of matching.
      He smokes a cigarette and chews gum at the same time.

      He happens to glance over his shoulder and notice a brown
      Ford sedan with four men in it cruising along the curb. He
      picks up his step a little. The Ford keeps up.

      He looks ahead at the corner. He tries to look as comfortable
      as he can, checking his watch as though remembering an
      appointment he is late for. The Ford stays right on him.

      SUDDENLY, he bolts. He gets no more than a few yards before
      cars pour out of every conceivable nook and cranny. Brakes
      are squealing, radios squawking, guns cocking. Fenster is
      surrounded instantly. He stops short and flaps his hands on
      his thighs in defeat.

6     INT. MONDINO'S RESTAURANT - DAY

      An attractive man and woman walk quickly through the front of
      a small New York cafe. They are charged with nervous, excited
      energy.

The man is DEAN KEATON, a well dressed, sturdy looking man in
his forties with slightly graying hair. He looks much better
than he did in the opening scene. The woman with him is EDIE
FINNERAN, age thirty-three, poised and attractive - Easily
the calmer of the two.

     They come to a staircase at the back of the restaurant
     leading down to a dark room. Edie takes Keaton's arm and
     stops him.

                                  EDIE
                Let me look at you.

     Keaton is uncomfortable in his suit, or perhaps the
     situation. Still, he smiles with genuine warmth.

     Edie straightens his tie and picks microscopic imperfections
     from his lapel.

                              EDIE (CONT'D)
                Now remember, this is another kind of
                business. They don't earn your respect.
                You owe it to them. Don't stare them down
                but don't look away either. Confidence.
                They are fools not to trust you. That's
                the attitude.

                                 KEATON
                I'm having a stroke.

                                   EDIE
                You've come far. You're a good man. I
                love you.

     Keaton blinks then stammers, looking for a response.
     PAUSE

                Live with it.

     She kisses him and runs down the steps with Keaton close
     behind. Keaton playfully grabs her ass and she nearly
     stumbles down the stairs.

7     INT. RESTAURANT - DOWNSTAIRS

     They come to the bottom of the steps giggling and jabbing
     each other. Once off the stairs they instantly transform as
     though hit with cold air. They assume a cool, professional
     exterior and walk two feet apart. One would look at them and
     see only two business associates here to ply their trade.

     They walk across the dimly lit dining room to a table in the
     far corner where two men are already waiting. The first is
     MR. FORTIER, age thirty-five, the other is MR. RENAULT, age  

     sixty. Both men are impeccably dressed with a distinguished
     air. They stand and smile.

     They shake hands. Keaton takes Fortier's hand next.

                 Monsieur Fortier. So nice to finally meet

     Everyone sits at the table. All faces are smiling.
     LOW ANGLE: UNDER TABLE
     Edie's hand reaches out and finds Keaton's leg. Her hand runs
     high up his inner thigh and squeezes firmly.

     Her face is absolutely calm, giving no hint of what her hand
     is doing. Keaton smiles and clears his throat.

                                 FORTIER
                Edie brought us your proposal and I'll be                  


                honest. We're very impressed. A bit                       
                skeptical, I must admit, but impressed.                    


                                 KEATON
                Skeptical.
                                 RENAULT
                We find the concept brilliant, but New
                York is difficult for new restaurants.
                How can we be certain that our money will                  
                be returned in the long run?
     Keaton looks at Edie and smiles confidently.
                                 KEATON
                It's simple gentlemen, design

                versatility. A restaurant that can change                  
                with taste without losing the overall

                aesthetic. Our atmosphere won't be
                painted on the walls.

                                 FORTIER
                This was the part of the proposal that
                intrigued us, but I'm not sure I follow.                   


                                 KEATON
                Let's say for example -

                              VOICE (O.S.)
                This I had to see myself.

     Keaton looks up. He sees David Kujan. Behind him are the very
     serious looking guys in suits.

     Keaton is not happy to see them.

                                 KEATON
                Dave. I'm in a meeting.

                                  KUJAN
                Time for another one.

                                   KEATON
                 This is my attorney, Edie Finneran.

                        KEATON (cont'd)
           This is Mr. Renault and Mr. Fortier.
           Everyone, this is David Kujan.

                             KUJAN
           Special Agent Kujan. U.S. Customs.
                 (Gestures to men behind him)
           These gentlemen are with the New York
           police department. You look great,
           Keaton. Better than I would have thought.

                            RENAULT
           Is there a problem, Mr. Keaton?

                             KUJAN
           The small matter of a stolen truck-load
           of guns that wound up on a boat to
           Ireland last night.

Renault and Fortier's confusion is giving way to suspicion.

                            FORTIER
           Mr. Keaton?

                             KEATON
           If you will excuse us for a moment,
           gentlemen.

                             KUJAN
           We need to ask you some questions
           downtown. You'll be quite awhile.

Renault starts to get up.

                            RENAULT
           We should leave you to discuss whatever
           this is.

                            KEATON
           Please. Sit.

Keaton stands up and throws a wad of money on the table to
cover the check. He looks at Edie. She moves to stand, but he
sits her back down with a hand on her shoulder.

                            KEATON
           Enjoy the meal.
                           (To Edie)
           I'LL call you.

Kujan takes him by the arm, but Keaton yanks away.

      He looks out over the dozens of other faces in the
      restaurant. Everyone is looking at him with some level of
      surprise. If Keaton is humiliated by the whole affair, he
      hides it well.

11    INT. LOCK-UP HALLWAY - NIGHT                                        11'

      A police officer steps into the frame and opens the steel
      door.

      FOLLOW A PAIR OF FEET as they shuffle across the cement
      floor. The shoes are shabby and worn, as are the wrinkled
      pants that hang too low and loose at the cuffs. The right
      foot is turned slightly inward and falls with a hard limp. It
      is clear that the knee does not extend fully.

      The sound of a steel door opening. The bottom corner of a
      steel cage comes into view. Another set of feet falls into
      step with the first. Another steel door and another set of
      feet. Another door, another and another. Five pairs of feet
      walk single file down the hall.

      The lame feet are in the front of the line. They come to
      another steel door, this one solid and covered with dents and
      rivets.

      CRANE UP TO REVEAL:

      ROGER KINT, VERBAL to his few friends. He has a deeply lined
      face, making his thirty-odd years a good guess at best. From
      his twisted left hand, we can see that he suffers from a
      slight but not debilitating palsy. Behind him are Dean
      Keaton, Fred Fenster, McManus and Todd Hockney.                      t

      Verbal steps through the door, followed by the rest.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                It didn't make sense that I be there. I
                mean these guys were hard-core hijackers,
                but there I was. At that point, I wasn't
                scared, f knew I hadn't done anything
                they could do me for. Besides, it was
                fun. I got to make like I was notorious.

12    INT. LINE-UP ROOM                                                   12

      The five men are ushered into the room in front of a white
      wall painted with horizontal blue stripes. Each has a number
      at either end to denote the height of the man in front of it.
      Between these lines are thinner blue lines to tell the
      specific height in inches.

                                               SCRIPT DATE 5/25/94

                                                                11.

Bright lights shine on all of them. They squint, eyes
adjusting.

Keaton leans forward a bit and looks at the men in line with
him. He shares a look of familiarity with Fenster and then
McManus. Hockney smiles at all of them.

                            McMANUS
                          (To Keaton)
           Where you been, man?

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           SHUT UP IN THERE. Alright, you all know
           the drill. When your number is called,
           step forward and repeat the phrase you've
           been given. Understand?

The men all nod.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           Number one. Step forward.

Hockney takes a step forward. He looks directly into a mirror
on the other side of the room. It is three feet square and we
can make out faint light behind it. It is a two-way. He
speaks in a complete dead-pan.

                            HOCKNEY
           Hand-me-the-keys, you-fucking-cock-
           sucker.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           Number two. Step forward.

McManus steps up and makes a gun with his thumb and
forefinger. He mocks criminal intensity, pointing at the
mirror. He camps up his line.

                            McMANUS
           Give me the keys, you motherfucking,
           cocksucking pile of shit, or I'll rip off
           your

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           KNOCK IT OFF. Get back in line.

McManus steps back.

The rest of the men do their bit as Verbal speaks.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                It was bullshit. The whole rap was a
                setup. Everything is the cops' fault. You
                don't put guys like that in a room
                together. Who knows what can happen?

     McManus sits in a chair in front of a white wall. He smiles
     at someone off-screen.

                guys, huh? I mean you know and I know
                this is a load of shit, but at least I
                don't have a captain with his dick in

                Do you work for a broad? That would
                have to be the worst.

                Still, I guess dignity is a small
                pries to pay for medical and a
                pension. A small pension, mind you,
                but a pension nonetheless.                                

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                They drilled us all night. Somebody was
                pissed about that truck getting knocked
                off and the cops had nothing. They were
                hoping somebody would slip. Give them
                something to go on. They knew we wouldn't
                fight it because they knew how to lean on
                us. They'd been doing it forever. Our
                rights went right out the window. It was
                a violation. I mean disgraceful.

           Fenster always worked with McManus. He
           was a real tight-ass, but when it came to
           the job, he was right on. Smart guy. A

                            FENSTER
           You guys got nothing on me. Where's your
           probable cause?

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           You're a known hijacker. You're sweating
           like a guilty motherfucker. That's my
           p.c. Save us the time. Tell us where the
           truck is.

Fenster knocks on the table.


                            FENSTER
           HELLO? Can you hear me in the back? P.C.

He looks under his chair.

                       FENSTER (CONT'D)
           Where is it? I'm lookin'. It's not
           happening. What's going on with that? I
           want

     Hockney's turn in the chair. He laughs it all off.

                                  HOCKNEY
                 - my lawyer. I'll have your badge,
                 cocksucker.

     OVERLAPPED:  


                            HOCKNEY (CONT'D)
                 I know you. You don't think I know
                 you're on the take. This whole fucking
                 precinct is dirty. You don't have a
                 fucking leg to stand on.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                 Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with
                 explosives. Mean as a snake when it
                 mattered .

                              VOICE (O.S.)
                 You think so, tough guy? I can put you in
                 Queens the day of the hijacking.

                                  HOCKNEY
                 I live in Queens. What the fuck is this?
                 You come into my store and lock me up in
                 front of my customers. What the hell is
                 wrong with this country? Are you guys
                 gonna charge me or what?

                              VOICE (O.S.)
                 You know what happens if you do another
                 turn in the joint?

                                  HOCKNEY
                 I'll fuck your father in the shower.
                 Charge me, dick-head.

     Now Keaton sits in the chair, cool and indifferent.
                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                 Keaton was the real prize for them, for
                 obvious reasons.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                 I'll charge you when I'm ready.

                with what?

                           	    VOICE (O.S.)
                You know damn well, dead-man.

                                KEATON
                Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did
                you ever think to ask me? I've been

                             KEATON (cont'd)
                walking around with the same face, same
                name - I'm a businessman, fellas.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                What's that? The restaurant business? Not
                anymore From now on you're in the
                getting-fucked-by-us business . I'm gonna
                make you famous, cocksucker.

     Keaton shows just a flicker of contempt. The threat has hit
     home.

                                  KEATON
                Like I said. It was all your mistake.
                Charge me with it and I'll beat it. Let's
                get back to the truck.

     A FIST flies into the frame and connects with Keaton's jaw.
     His head snaps back, blood flowing freely from his mouth.

17   DELETED                                                              17

     Keaton is brought in to a holding where he joins Fenster,
     Hockney, Verbal and McManus. He sits in a corner and keeps to
     himself.

     Fenster is in mid-tirade.

                                  FENSTER
                Somebody should do something. What is
                this shit - getting hauled in every five                   
                minutes? Okay, so I did a little time,                    
                does that mean I get railed every time a
                truck finds its way off the planet?

     McManus is silently staring at Keaton, who sits on a bench,
     looking away.

                                  HOCKNEY
                These guys got no probable cause.

           You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well
           screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right.
           You do some time, they never let you go.
           Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a
           criminal.

                            HOCKNEY
           You are a criminal.

                            FENSTER
           Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying
           to make a point.

                            KEATON
           Then make it. Christ, you're making me
           tired all over.

McManus looks at Keaton.


                            McMANUS
           I heard you were dead, Keaton.                              

                            KEATON
           You heard right.

                            HOCKNEY
           The word I got is you hung up your spurs,
           man. What's that all  about?

                            McMANUS  
           What's this?

                            HOCKNEY
           Rumor has it, Keaton's gone straight -
           cleaning house. I hear he's tapping Edie
           Finneran.

                            McMANUS  
           Who?  

                            HOCKNEY
           She's a heavy-weight criminal lawyer from
           uptown. Big-time connected. She could
           erase Dillinger's record if she tried. I
           hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.
                          (To Keaton)
           Is it true?


                            McMANUS
        What about it, Keaton? You a lawyer's 
        wife. What sort of "retainer" you giving
        her?

Keaton shoots McManus a fiery glare.
                            FENSTER
           I'd say you've gotten on his main and
           central nerve, McManus.

                            KEATON
           Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him
           quiet .

                            McMANUS  
           You're clean, Keaton? Say it ain't so.
           Was it you that hit that truck?

                            FENSTER  
           Forget him. It's not important. I was
           trying to make a point.

                            KEATON
                      (Ignoring McManus)
           This whole thing was a shakedown.

                            McMANUS
           What makes you say that?

                            KEATON
           How many times have you been in a line-
           up? It's always you and four dummies. The                  
           P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head
           half the time. No way they'd line five
           felons in the same row. No way. And what
           the hell is a voice line-.up? A public
           defender could get you off of that.

                            FENSTER
           So why the hell was I hauled in and
           cavity searched tonight?

                            KEATON
           It was the Feds. A truck load of guns
           gets snagged, Customs comes down on
           N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up
           with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's
           politics - nothing you can do.

                            FENSTER
           I had a guy's fingers in my asshole
           tonight.

         HOCKNEY
        Is it Friday already?

                            FENSTER
           Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So
           who did it? Own up.

                            KEATON
           I don't want to know.

                            McMANUS  
           Nobody asked you, workin'-man.

                            HOCKNEY
           Fuck who did it. What I want to know is,
           who's the gimp?

ALL EYES suddenly turn on Verbal. He has been quietly
listening the whole time without uttering a word.

                             KEATON
           He's alright.

                            HOCKNEY
           How do I know that? How about it,
           pretzel-man? What's your story?

                            KEATON
           His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you
           guys knew him.

                            McMANUS
           Verbal?

                            VERBAL
           Roger really. People say I talk too much.

                            HOCKNEY
           Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.

                            KEATON
           We've met once or twice. Last time was
           in...

                             VERBAL
           County. I was in for fraud.

                            KEATON
           You were waiting for a line-up then, too.
           What happened with that?

                            VERBAL
        I walked. Ninety days, suspended.

                             HOCKNEY
            So you did it?


                             VERBAL
            To your mother's ass.

 Verbal looks away from Hockney, awaiting a violent response.
 Everyone slowly starts to laugh. Hockney looks as if he is
 about to boil in his own skin.

                              KEATON
                          (To Hockney)
            Let it go.

 Verbal smiles at Keaton appreciatively.

 McManus stands and walks to the toilet in the corner of
 the cell. He starts taking a leak;

                              McMANUS
            Look, we've all been put out by this, I
            figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage
            a little dignity. Now Fenster and I got
            wind of a possible job -

                              KEATON
            Why don't you just calm down'

                             HOCKNEY
            What do you care what he says?

                             McMANUS
           Yeah, I'm just talking here, and Hockney
           seems to want to hear me out. I know
           Fenster is with me -
                           (To Verbal)
           How about you, guy?

McManus finishes pissing.


                            VERBAL
           I'm interested, sure.


                             McMANUS
           There, so you see, I'm going to exercise
           my right to free assembly.

McManus taps the bars of his cell and the others LAUGH.

                              KEATON

You're missing the point.

                 No, you're missing the point. Shut up. I
                 don't want to hear anything you have to
                 say. I don't want to know about your
                 "job". Just don't let me hear you. I want

                                  McMANUS
                 Dean Keaton, gone the high road. What is
                 the world coming to?

     McManus and Keaton stare at one another for a long and tense
     moment. Finally McManus turns to the others.

                             McMANUS (CONT'D)
                 Forget him then.
                               (Whispering)
                 Now I can't talk about this here in any
                 detail, but listen up...

     Everyone but Keaton gravitates toward McManus's cell as he
     begins to speak in low, hushed tones.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                 And that was how it began. The five of us
                 brought in on a trumped-up charge to be
                 leaned on by half-wits. What the cops
                 never figured out, and what I know now,
                 was that these men would never break,
                 never lie down, never bend over for
                 anybody. .. Anybody.

19    EXT. PIER - DAY - SAN PEDRO - PRESENT DAY                          19
     It is morning in the aftermath of the opening scene.
     Harsh sunlight shines on a line of body bags on the dock.

     Police swarm everywhere, photographers are taking pictures of
     the scene while a team of men in rolled up sleeves and
     plastic gloves pick at the remains.

     Two men on a fire boat operate a water cannon, dousing the
     smoldering remains of a burned-out ships hull.

     Watching this from the edge of the pier is a man in a dark
     suit. He is SPECIAL AGENT JACK BAER of the F.B.I. He is tall
     and fit, in his late thirties. He gazes out over the water
     thoughtfully.

A UNIFORM COP trots up to him.
                              COP
           Who are you?


Baer holds up his badge without looking at the man.

                              BAER
           Agent Jack Baer, F.B.I. How many dead?

Before the cop can answer, Baer turns and walks along the
line of body bags.

                              COP
           Fifteen so far. We're still pulling some
           bodies out of the water.

Baer eyes the corpses on the dock, burned beyond recognition.

                              COP
           Looking for anyone in particular?

Baer looks at the cop for the first time, unamused.

                              BAER
           f don't want any of the bodies taken away
           until I've had a chance to go over this,
           understood?

                              COP
           I have to clear the scene. I've got word
           direct from the Chief

Baer lights a cigarette, only half listening.

                              BAER
                         (Unimpressed)
           Yes, the chief. Spooky stuff. Any
           survivors?

           Two. There's a guy in county hospital,
           but he's in a coma. The D.A. has the
           other guy - A cripple - from New York I
           think. Listen, the Chief said -

                              BAER
           Excuse me.

Baer walks away from the cop, ignoring him completely. He
wanders through the carnage on the pier.

     A half mile out from the pier.

     The sea is choppy, stirred by the wind. An object floats into
     view a few feet away, bobbing in the water.

     It is A DEAD BODY - a man, face down, wearing a CHECKERED
     BATHROBE. He drifts quietly toward the open ocean.

21    INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY - LOS ANGELES PRESENT                      2: 

     Verbal Kint sits in a chair in front of a microphone attached
     to a tape recorder, his brow beaded with sweat.

     On the wall behind him is the seal of the STATE OF CALIFORNIA

     He is cleaner, better kept, in a well-cut suit and neatly
     trimmed hair. He looks older than he did in New York - worn
     down.

     A flurry of voices banter off screen. Verbal's eyes follow
     the voices back and forth.

                May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your
                political power as much as I respect it.
                I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many
                faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't
                care. The embarrassment he helped cause

           Then prosecute. I will be very impressed
           to see if the District Attorney manages
           to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous
           counts of murder against one man with
           cerebral palsy. I would think a man with
           your job would agree with these alleged

     David Kujan is walking quickly beside SERGEANT RABIN, a dark
     and weathered looking man in his late thirties. They move up
     a staircase into the heart of police headquarters.

                What do you mean I can't see him?

                The D.A. came down here last night ready
                to arraign before they even moved him to
                county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five
                minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking
                like he'd been bitch-slapped by the
                boogey man. They took his statement and
                cut him a deal.

                                  KUJAN
                Did they charge him with anything?

                What'the fuck is that?

     Rabin motions for Kujan to lower his voice. He points out
     that they are walking through a bullpen filled with desks
     where a number of other police are working within earshot.

                                  RABIN
                I give the D.A. credit for getting that
                much to stick. This whole thing has
                turned political. The Mayor was here -
                the chief - the Governor called this

Rabin comes to an office door with his name on it. He opens
it and lets Kujan in before following.

     Rabin's office can only be described as a disaster area. The        
     desk is cluttered with weeks, perhaps months or even years of       
     paperwork that could never conceivably be sorted out.               

     Above his desk is a bulletin board. It is a breathtaking
     catastrophe of papers, wanted posters, rap-sheets, memos and +
     post-its. This is in the neighborhood of decades. Rabin is a
     man with a system so cryptic, so far beyond the comprehension       
     of others, he himself is most likely baffled by it.

                He regained consciousness less than an
                hour ago. He spoke - not English - then
                he lapsed.

                Hungarian?

                 I don't

                                   BAER
                 It was Hungarian. Most of them were
                 Hungarians. Any fluent Hungarians on your
                 staff?

                                  RIDGLY
                 We have a Turkish audiologist.

     Ridgly opens a door and Baer barrels through.

     Baer comes to an abrupt halt at the foot of a bed surrounded
     by a massive tangle of medical equipment. In the center of it
     all is the as yet unnamed ARKOSH KOVASH, mid-thirties. His
     body is nearly mummified in bandages and plaster from waist
     to chin.


     BOLD IS OVERLAPPED:

                 There's a chance.

     Baer walks over to Rovash and kneels down on the bed beside
     him.

     He looks closely at his battered and scalded face. He listens
     to him far a moment. Kovash goes on incessantly.

                                  KOVASH
                 <<Find someone who understands me,

Baer pulls a cellular phone out of his jacket and dials.

           Call hospital security and put a man on

Ridgly runs out of the room. Kovash babbles louder and
louder, trying to get Baer's attention. Baer sticks a finger
in one ear to block him out and hear the phone.

                            PLUMBER
           Is he dangerous?

                             BAER
           Yes.

Someone picks up on the other end of the phone.

                         BAER (CONT'D)
           Joel, it's Baer. I'm down at L.A. county.
           The guy they pulled out of the harbor is
           ARKOSH Kovash... Yes, I'm sure... No,
           he's all fucked up... What? I can't hear
           you.
                          (To Arkosh)
           Shut up, Hugo, I'm on the phone.
                         (Into Phone)
           Yes... No... Not until I put someone on
           him. Listen, I need you to send me
           someone who can speak Hungarian. He's
           awake and talking like a Thai hooker...
           How should I know? Get me someone who can
           talk to him -

Baer is suddenly distracted by something Kovash has said. In
the middle of a long string of unintelligible dialect, he has
spouted two words that have gotten Baer's attention.

He turns and looks down at the tattered man in the bed.
Kovash realizes Baer is listening and says the two words
again.

                             KOVASH
           Keyser - Soze.                                               

                              BAER
           What?

He waves his hand, gesturing for Kovash to say it again.

                            KOVASH
           Keyser - Soze.

                              BAER

      Rabin walks out of a small room. Behind him, we catch a
      glimpse of a workroom with a bench covered with wires.

      Kujan comes out a moment later, gently fixing his tie.

      Rabin opens the door to his office and Kujan enters. Rabin 
      follows, looking up and down the hall before closing the door
      behind them.

      As the door closes we can just make out the back of Verbal's
      head. He is seated in Rabin's office, smoking a cigarette.

                                   VERBAL
                 I told the D.A. everything I know.

28    INT. WORKSHOP

     Rabin stands over LOUIS, a messy looking technician at his
     workbench in a room full of electronic equipment. He adjusts
     several dials on a receiver until the voices of Kujan and
     Verbal come clearly through a tinny speaker on the wall.
     Rabin reaches over for a nearby pot of coffee.

                               KUJAN (VOICE)
                 I know you liked Keaton I know you think
                 he was a good man.

                 He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.

                 good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let
                 him go legit.

                                   KUJAN
                 Keaton was a piece of shit.

 He taps a finger on the stack of paper that Kujan brought in.
 Kujan picks it up and thumbs through it.

                              KUJAN
            According to your statement you are a
            short-con operator. Run of the mill
            seams. Everything you do, you learned
            from somebody else.

                              VERBAL
            That's been suppressed. Anything in there
            is inadmissible.

                              KUJAN
            Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total

            Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm
            looking at six whole months hard time.

                              KUJAN
                           (smiling)
            You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer,

            You know Ruby is in Attica? 

                       VERBAL
           He didn't have my lawyer.

                              KUJAN
           I know Ruby. He's very big on respect.
           Likes me very much.

Verbal sees this getting to something. His smiles fades.

                        KUJAN (CONT'D)
           Now I know your testimony was sealed.
           Ruby is well connected. He still has
           people running errands for him. What do
           you think he'd say if he found out you
           dropped his name to the D.A.?

                             VERBAL
           There's nothing in there about Ruby.

                             KUJAN
           I'11 be sure to mention that to him.

Verbal is not smiling anymore. He stares at Kujan with utter
contempt, knowing he is being shafted.

                         KUJAN (CONT'D)
           The first thing I learned on the job,
           know what it was? How to spot a murderer.
           Let's say you arrest three guys for the
           same killing. Put them all in jail
           overnight. The next morning, whoever is
           sleeping is your man. If you're guilty,
           you know you're caught, you get some rest
           - let your guard down, you follow?

                            VERBAL
           No.

                             KUJAN
           I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter
           than you. I'11 find out what I want to
           know and I'11 get it from you whether you
           like it or not.

                            VERBAL
           I'm not a rat.

Kujan puts his hand on the transcript of Verbal's confession.
Rabin walks in with a cup of coffee. Verbal takes it with his
good hand and sips it with a relish.

                         VERBAL (CONT'D)
           Ahhh. Back when I was picking beans in
           Guatemala we used to make fresh coffee.
           Right off the trees I mean. That was
           good. This is shit, but hey...

                             RAB IN
           Can we get started again?

                             KUJAN
           Now what happened after the line-up?

Verbal sneers at Kujan, unable to change the subject.

     Keaton stops at the top of the front steps of the police
     station and lights a cigarette. Edie comes out behind him,
     fuming mad.

                                 KEATON
                Just forget about it.

     He looks across the street and sees Fenster and McManus
     talking by a newsstand. McManus is thumbing through
     magazines.

                                   EDIE
                Absolutely not.

     Keaton looks to his right and sees Hockney trying to hail a
     cab.

                              EDIE (CONT'D)
                I'11 have this thing in front of a grand

                Edie, please. I don't want to hear this
                right now. What did Renault and Fortier

                Goddamnit.

                                   EDIE
                They just said they wanted time.

                                   KEATON
                Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me
                a little more, that's what. No matter how
                well you cover my tracks now, they'll

                              EDIE
           Give me some credit. I got you this far,
           let's go to the grand jury. This is never
           going to stop if we -

                             KEATON
           No. It's never going to stop, period. It
           won't take more than a week before every
           investor in this city is walking away
           from us. It's finished. I'm finished.

Just then, Verbal bumps into him on his way out the door. He
excuses himself and hobbles down the steps, oblivious to who
he has bumped into as he tries to navigate the stairs.

                              EDIE
           Don't give up on me now, Dean.

                            KEATON
           They'll never stop.

                             EDIE
           I love you.

                             KEATON
                          (To himself)
           They ruined me tonight.

                              EDIE
           Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?

Verbal gets to the sidewalk and stops. He turns, realizing it
is Keaton on the steps.

                         EDIE (CONT'D)
           Let's just go to my place. We'll worry
           about this tomorrow.

Keaton and Verbal look at one another for a moment. Keaton
then looks over to the newsstand and sees Fenster looking at
him.

                            KEATON
           Huh?

McManus notices Fenster and glances up from his magazine to
see what he is looking at.                                             +

                              EDIE
           Come home with me, please. Dean?

      Keaton looks at Hockney who has one foot in a cab. He is
      looking at Fenster and McManus who are looking at Keaton.
      This makes Hockney look up at Keaton as well.

      SUDDENLY, Edie tunes in to what is going on. She notices the
      others on the street. She reaches over and takes Keaton by
      the arm, pulling gently. She glares at the others.

                                   EDIE
                Come home, Dean.

                                  KEATON
                                (Distant)
                Alright.

      Verbal looks at everyone else from where he stands on the
      street. Fenster, McManus and Hockney all look at him and then
      at each other. It is a strange moment of unspoken
      understanding.

      All eyes finally turn to Keaton, high on the front steps of
      the police station as he walks away with Edie.

31    INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                                   31

      Verbal stands in front of an apartment door. He hesitates for
      a long moment before he knocks.

      After a moment, the door opens and Keaton stands on the other
      side of it. He is wearing a bathrobe and smoking a cigarette.

      He looks at Verbal without any expression whatsoever.

                                  KEATON
                What are you doing here'! How did you find
                me?


                                  VERBAL
                I just asked one of the detectives
                downtown. He seemed pretty happy to tell

                me.
      Keaton curses under his breath and motions for Verbal to come
      in.
                                                                            32
32    INT. EDIE'S APARTMENT


      Verbal walks in and sits down on the couch, watching Keaton
      cautiously. He looks around the large apartment, beautifully
      furnished and decorated.

                                               SCRIPT DATE 5/25/94

Edie walks into the room in a man's button-down shirt and
sweat pants.

                             EDIE
           Dean, who was at the

She stops when she sees Verbal. Verbal stands and smiles
nervously.

                            VERBAL
           How do you do?

                             KEATON
           Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran.
           Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at

                              EDIE
                             (Cold)
           I know who he is.

                             VERBAL
           I hope I didn't disturb you.

                             EDIE
           I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you
           something to drink?

                             VERBAL
           A glass of water would be nice.

Edie shoots a look at Keaton on her way out of the room.
Keaton tries to hush his voice despite his anger.

                             KEATON
           What the hell do you want?

                             VERBAL
           I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -

                             KEATON
           I did you a favor by standing up for you
           last night, but don't think we're
           friends. I'm sorry, but I have other
           things -

                             VERBAL
           They're gonna do a job. Three million
           dollars, maybe more.

Keaton is speechless. Verbal sits on the couch again.

                        VERBAL (CONT'D)
           They sent me to offer you a cut. We could
           use a fifth man - a driver - That's all
           you'll do.

Edie walks in with a glass of ice water and hands it to
Verbal.

                       VERBAL (CONT'D)
           Thank you.

Verbal drinks slowly. Edie stands over him, her face blank.
It is an awkward moment. She deliberately makes Verbal
uncomfortable.

LONG PAUSE - FINALLY:


                              EDIE
           So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?

                            VERBAL
           Umm ...

                              EDIE
           A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something
           more creative?

                            KEATON
           That's enough, Edie.

                              EDIE
                             (Angry)
           I don't know what you came here for, but
           we won't have any part of it.

                            KEATON
           Edie, please.

Keaton takes Edie by the arm and tries to guide her toward
the other room. She pulls away, anger turning to rage.

                              EDIE
           I've spent the last year of my life
           putting his back together again - I won't
           have you come in here and - What makes
           you think - GET OUT. GET OUT OF m HOME.
           HOW DARE YOU COME HERE?

Keaton is pulling her now. She yanks her arm away and shoves
him.

                             EDIE
           Don't touch me. Just don't,

She turns and walks out of the room. Somewhere in the back of
the apartment, a door slams.

Keaton turns and glares at Verbal. Verbal cringes.

                            KEATON
           Get out.

                            VERBAL
           If you'll just let me -

SUDDENLY, KEATON LUNGES. He grabs Verbal by the lapels and
lifts him off the couch, moving him effortlessly across the
room and slamming him into the wall next to the front door.
He opens it.

                       VERBAL (CONT'D)
           Don't hurt me.

                             KEATON
                           (Seething)
           Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill
           you.

Keaton starts to shove Verbal out the door.


                             VERBAL
                           (Quickly)

Keaton freezes. LONG PAUSE.

           They - That's bullshit. They don't
           operate anymore.

                             VERBAL
           McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth

                            KEATON
           What fence? Who?

                             VERBAL
           Some guy in California. His name is
           Redfoot.

                            KEATON
           Never heard of him.

Keaton moves to throw Verbal out. Verbal grabs Keaton and
holds tight.

                            VERBAL
           You have to come.

                             KEATON
           What's with you? What do you care whether
           I come or not?


                             VERBAL
           They - They don't know me. You do. They
           won't take me unless you go. Look at me.
           I need this.

                            KEATON
           Tough break.

                             VERBAL
           Don't tell me you don't need this. Is
           this your place?

Keaton is unable to answer.


                        VERBAL (CONT'D)
           They're never going to stop with us, you
           know that. This way we hit the cops where
           it hurts and get well in the mean time.

Keaton lets Verbal go and steps back, thinking.

                        VERBAL (CONT'D)
           As clean as you could ever get, they'll
           never let you go now.

           I'm not knocking you. You look like
           you've got a good little seam going with
           this lawyer -

WHAM. Keaton punches Verbal in the stomach and drops him to
one knee. Verbal coughs and tries to find his breath.

                             KEATON
           You watch your mouth.

                             VERBAL

           Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing?
           That's cool.

Keaton reaches for Verbal. Verbal flinches. Keaton gently
helps him up and guides him to the couch. They bath sit.

Keaton reaches for a pack of cigarettes and lights one for
each of them.

                            KEATON
           I apologize.

Verbal takes one and has a few drags, catching his breath and
rubbing his stomach in pain.

FINALLY:

                            VERBAL
           I was out of line.

                             KEATON
           You okay?

           I'11 be alright.

                             KEATON

           Forget it.
                             (Beat)
           I'11 probably shit blood tonight.

Keaton laughs. Verbal thinks about it for a moment and laughs
with him.

Keaton's laughter trails off. He thinks for a moment.

                 New York's finest Taxi Service was not
                 your normal taxi service. It was a ring
                 of corrupt cops in the N.Y.P.D. that ran
                 a high-profit racket, driving smugglers
                 and drug dealers all over the city. For a
                 few hundred dollars a mile, you got your
                 own black and white and a police escort.
                 They even had their own business cards.

     OSCAR WHITEHEAD, a tall gray-haired man in his fifties comes
     out of the international terminal in a white linen suit. He
     holds a large suitcase in his right hand.

                After a while, somebody started asking
                questions and the taxi service shut down.
                Ever since then, Internal Affairs had
                been waiting to catch them in the act.

     Oscar stands on the curb long enough to light a cigarette.
     After a moment, a POLICE CRUISER pulls up to him. He opens
     the back door and gets in.

                And that was how we started. McManus came

                killed - but Keaton - Keaton put on the
                finishing touch. A little "Fuck you" from
                the five of us to the N.Y.P.D.

     The car drives out of the airport. A VAN follows at a                
     distance.

34    INT. POLICE CAR                                                      34

     SERGEANT JIM STRAUSZ, a meaty, imposing looking man in his
     forties drives the car. Beside him is a thin, greasy looking
     PATROLMAN, STEVE RIZZI. They are two drivers for New York's
     Finest Taxi Service.

                                  RIZZI
                How was the flight?

     Oscar hands Rizzi a thick envelope.

                                   OSCAR
                Will that get me to the Pierre?

     Rizzi counts the stack of hundred dollar bills in the
     envelope .

                                  RIZZI
                That'll get you to Cape God.

     The two men laugh. Strausz watches the road, expressionless.
35 EXT. HIGHWAY                                                            35
     The cruiser heads towards the heart of Manhattan.

      The police car makes its way down a wide, abandoned street. A
      WHITE MINIVAN pulls out behind it and heads the same way.

37 INT. POLICE CAR
                                                                            37

      Strausz looks in the rear-view mirror. The white minivan is
      flashing his high-beams.

                                  STRAUSZ
                 What the

                                   RIZZI
                 LOOK OUT.

      Strausz looks in front of him. A green minivan swerves in
      front of them from out of nowhere. Strausz slams on the
      brakes and skids to a halt. The white minivan rams them from
      behind.

      Strausz and Rizzi are stunned for a moment as two more vans
      screech up on either side of the cruiser, boxing it in with
      only a few inches between them.

      The cruiser is surrounded on all sides.

      SUDDENLY, SHOTGUN BARRELS come through the open windows. They
      come to rest, one on Strausz's left temple one on Rizzi's
      right. RIZZI looks out of the corner of his eye.

      He sees the driver of the van next to him holding the shotgun
      with one hand. A stocking is over the driver's head.

      Strausz looks straight ahead. The minivan in front of them is
      missing a back window. Another man with a stocking on his
      head aims a sub-machine gun at them from inside.

      By the twisted right hand holding the front of the gun, we
      know it is Verbal.

      Strausz and Rizzi raise their hands without being asked.

38    EXT. STREET                                                           38

      The driver of the white van gets out with a gallon jug in one
      hand and a sledge hammer in the other.

      Moving like lightning, he jumps onto the roof of the police
      car

     'He stands on the front of the roof and swings the hammer
     down.

     SMASH

     The hammer punches three huge holes in the windshield and
     finally caves it in. Strausz and Rizzi are covered with
     pebbles of broken glass. Whitehead clutches his bag in the
     back seat. He trembles in terror.

     The man standing on the roof doubles over and sticks a gun in
     Strausz's face. His face hangs upside down and looks gruesome
     - covered from the mouth up in a stocking. By the voice, we
     know it is McManus.

                                  McManus
                 GIVE ME THE SHIT.

                                  STRAUSZ
                 Give it up.

     Oscar hands the suitcase up front and Strausz passes it to
     McManus.

40 INT. FRONT VAN

     Through the front windshield of the front van we see Keaton
     at the wheel. Verbal is behind him leaning out the back
     window.

     Beneath Keaton's stocking mask we see he is trembling and
     sweating - sickened by what he is doing.

     He glances up at the rear-view mirror and looks at the scene
     outside. He looks down at the floor in shame, shaking his
     head.

41 INT. POLICE CAR                                                       41

                                  McMANUS
                 The money.

     Strausz looks at Rizzi.

                             McMAMJS (CONT'D)
                 THE MONEY. LET'S HAVE IT.

     Rizzi hands the money through the remains of the windshield.

      McManus takes the money and stuffs it in his jacket. He steps
      back and takes the cap off of the gallon jug. He quickly
      pours some kind of liquid all over the roof of the car.

                                  STRAUSZ
                 Do you know who I am?

      A hand reaches into the driver's side window and rips
      Strausz's badge off of his shirt.

      Strausz dares to turn his head right at the shotgun pointing
      at him through the window. On the other end is a masked and
      smiling Todd Hockney.

                                  HOCKNEY
                 We db now, Jerk-off.

      McManus lights a pack of matches and drops them on the roof
      of the car as he jumps off. THE LIQUID IGNITES, the roof of
      the car is instantly in flames.

      Strausz and Rizzi attempt to bail out, but the vans are too
      close for them to open the doors.

      The vans pull away.
      Strausz and Rizzi escape from the car.
      Oscar is trapped inside, SCREAMING.
      Strausz and Rizzi stop, each expecting the other to go let
      Oscar out.

42    EXT. STREET - LATER                                                  42

      The scene is swarming with fresh police cars. Strausz and
      Rizzi are fielding questions from a dozen other cops.

      Photographers are everywhere.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                 The papers got Keaton's call that day and                  
                 were on the scene before the cops were.
                 Strausz and Rizzi were indicted three
                 days later. Within a few weeks, fifty
                 more cops went down with them. It was
                 beautiful. Everybody got it right in the
                 ass, from the chief on down.

     Hockney, Fenster, McManus and Verbal are all laughing in a
     secluded garage. They are still in their black clothes from
     the robbery. Hockney is throwing everyone a can of beer.

     Keaton sits off by himself. He watches the others, unable to
     join in the festivities.

     The others sit around a cheap card table. It is covered with
     emeralds. Dozens of them. Everyone is in awe.

                                 McManus
                There's more than I thought.

                                 HOCKNEY
                When does the fence come?

                                 McMANUS
                Redfoot? He never comes to see me. I have
                to go see him.

                                 VERBAL
                In California?

                                 McMANUS
                Yeah. It'll take a few days. Me and
                Fenster

                                 HOCKNEY
                Hold the fuckin' phone. You and Fenster?
                No, no, no.

                                 McMANUS
                Guys, come on.

                                 HOCKNEY
                I'm sure you can understand my
                hesitation.

                                 FENSTER
                Then who goes?

                                 HOCKNEY
                We all go. How about it, Keaton?

     All eyes turn to Keaton. He comes out of his trance.

                                 KEATON
                We need to lay low for a while.

                                 McMANUS
                Fine with me.

     PAUSE

     Everyone looks at each other, their moment of distrust
     blowing over. All eyes drift back to the emeralds on the
     table.

     Hockney begins to snicker, then McManus, then Fenster. Verbal
     joins in at last.

     McManus grabs Verbal and hugs him, shaking him violently.

                            McMANUS (CONT'D)
                My boy with the plan.

     SUDDENLY, everyone yells and pours beer over Verbal's head.
     He laughs as he is drenched in white foam, nearly choking as
     the others chant his name.

     Keaton watches from across the room, trying to smile in vain.

     Keaton and Verbal sit side by side on a sofa. A sign on the
     door behind them reads: MONTGOMERY and LaGUARDIA - ATTORNEYS

     Keaton stands and paces across the waiting room. He comes to
     a set of glass doors and looks through them.

Keaton realizes he is standing on a balcony overlooking a
library below.                                                        

He sees Edie working in the library with an old woman. The
two women talk for a moment.                                          

SUDDENLY, Keaton turns with a start. Verbal is standing
behind him.

      Edie is smiling and laughing with the old woman.                   
      Keaton's face is marked with guilt and anguish.
      Keaton turns and walks out of the waiting room. Verbal takes        
      one last glance at Edie and turns back to Keaton.                   

                                                                           46

      Edie seems to sense something behind her. She turns and looks
      through the glass doors and up into the waiting room.

      NOTHING IS THERE. She goes back to chatting with the old
      woman.

          before they could testify. When they                      t
          finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  +
          five years in Sing Sing. He killed three                   
          prisoners inside - one with a knife in                     
          the tailbone while he strangled him to                    
          death. Of course I can't prove this but I                  
          can't prove the best part either.

          Dean Keaton was dead. Did you know that?                  r
          He died in a fire two years ago during an
          investigation into the murder of a                         
          witness who was going to testify against                   
          him. Two people saw Keaton enter a
          warehouse he owned just before it went

          up. They said he had gone in to check a                   +
          leaking gas main. It blew up and took all
          of Dean Keaton with it. Within three
          months of the explosion, the two
          witnesses were dead, one killed himself
          in his car and the other fell down an
          open elevator shaft.

                Six weeks ago I get an anonymous call
                telling me I can find Keaton eating at
                Mondino's with his lawyer, and there he
                is. Now because he never profited from
                his alleged death and because someone
                else was convicted for the murder we
                tried to pin on Keaton, we had to let him

                go.

           I don't think you do. But you say you saw
           Keaton die. I think you're covering his
           ass and he's still out there somewhere. I
           think he was behind that whole circus in
           the harbor. My bet is he's using you
           because you're stupid and you think he's
           your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be
           it. I want to make sure he's dead before

     All five guys stand in a group. It is utterly quiet.
     An old but well kept Cadillac creeps into the lot from the
     far end and idles up to them. The windows are tinted too much
     to see in. The car passes within a few feet of them and
     drives on.

     A moment later, a chrome and leather monster of a Harley
     Davidson pulls into the lot. The rider is dressed in an
     almost comical array of leather, silver and suede.

     He waves to the Caddy as it parks a few yards from Keaton and
     the others. It sits quietly, almost menacing.

     As he gets closer, we can see he is wearing one black boot
     and one red. Keaton is still looking at them when the bike
     pulls up to them and stops.

     REDFOOT and McManus shake hands.

                                 REDFOOT
                How've you been?

                                 McMANUS
                Good. You?

                                 REDFOOT
                Alright. How's it going, Fenster?

                                 FENSTER
                Getting by.

                            REDFOOT
           You got it?

McManus holds up a briefcase.

Redfoot takes it and gets off the bike. He walks over to the
Caddy. The door of the Caddy opens. Redfoot hands the case to
Someone inside that we cannot see. The door closes.

                             KEATON
                          (Whispering)
           Snazzy dresser this guy.

A moment later, the door of the Caddy opens again. Someone
hands Redfoot a different briefcase and he walks back over to
McManus.

He hands him the case.

McManus hands the case back to Hockney. Hockney opens it,
revealing the stacks of money inside.

                            REDFOOT
           You must be Keaton.

                             McMANUS
           Jesus, I'm sorry. Redfoot, this is Dean
           Keaton, that's Todd Hockney, and that's
           Verbal Kint.

                             REDFOOT
                          (To Verbal)
           The man with the plan.

Verbal smiles.

                       REDFOOT (CONT'D)
           Are you guys interested in more work?

McManus moves to answer, but Keaton cuts him off.

                             KEATON
           We're on vacation.

                             REDFOOT
           I've got a ton of work and no good
           people.

                            McMANUS
           What's the job?

Keaton shoots McManus a foul look. McManus pretends not to
notice.

                             REDFOOT
           A jeweler out of Texas named Saul. He
           rents a suite at a hotel downtown and
           does free appraisals. Buys whatever he
           can. Word is he moves with a lot of cash.
           I'11 take the merchandise, you keep the
           green.

                            HOCKNEY
           Security?

                            REDFOOT
           Two bodyguards. Pretty good.

                             McMANUS
           Give us time to check it out?

                            REDFOOT
           I'd expect nothing less.

                            McMANUS
           We'll call you.

                            REDFOOT
           Take your time. Enjoy L.A.

                             KEATON
           A friend of mine in New York tells me you
           knew Spook Hollis.

                             REDFOOT
           I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah,
           he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of
           dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got
           shivved.

                            KEATON
           I shivved him.

Now McManus is shooting the angry look at Keaton.

                        KEATON (CONT'D)
           Better you hear it from me now than
           somebody else later.

                            REDFOOT
           Business or personal?

                            KEATON
           A little of both.

                            REDFOOT
           Ain't it a crime? Call if you're
           interested.

Redfoot fires up his bike and takes off with the Caddy close
behind.

                            McMANUS
                          (To Keaton)
           What's your fucking problem?

                            KEATON
           One job, that was the deal.

                            McMANUS
           Take it as it comes, brother.

                            KEATON
           This is bullshit.

McManus laughs and walks away. Fenster and Hockney follow.
Verbal turns to Keaton.
                            VERBAL
           What is it Keaton?

                            KEATON
                            (Distant)
           Something - I don't know.
                       (Shaking himself)
           I ever tell you about the restaurant I
           wanted to open?

Keaton walks off. Verbal follows him in confusion.

                         VERBAL (V.O.)
           L.A., was good for about two hours. We
           were from New York. There's no place to
           eat after one; you can't get a pizza that
           doesn't taste like a fried fruit-bat, and
           the broads don't want to know you if you
           don't look like a broad. Within a few
           days the last of us was ready to go back
           to N.Y., but Keaton wouldn't have it, so
           he really didn't have a choice. We went
           to work.

56   INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

     McManus walks along a line of cars. He comes across a black
     Mercedes and stops. He looks down at the license plate and
     walks over to the next car, a green Honda. He pulls a slim-
     jim out of his jacket and pops the lock an the Honda. He
     reaches in and opens the hood. He walks around and sticks his
     head in the engine.

57   INT. VAN                                                             57

     Verbal sits behind the wheel. Keaton is beside him. Hockney
     and Fenster are in the back. They all watch McManus from
     where they are parked a few dozen yards away.

58   INT. PARKING GARAGE                                                  58
     DING-DING
     The elevator bell sounds at the far end of the garage. The
     doors open. Two men in ill-fitting suits get out and look
     around cautiously. The first is TUCCI, a big bellied, white
     haired menace. The other is HIGHAM, lean and bad skinned.
     They are bodyguards and give it away by their every careful
     move.

     They turn back to the elevator and motion to someone inside.

     Out walks SAUL BERG, a slightly overweight man in his forties
     with an open collar silk shirt and a thick gold chain on his
     hairy chest. He carries a LARGE ALUMINUM BRIEFCASE.

     He lets his guards do the worrying. He walks straight to his
     car.
     Saul passes McManus under the hood of the Honda. He takes out
     his keys and pushes a button on his key chain. The Mercedes
     beeps three times and tells Saul his alarm is off.

     Tucci keeps an eye on McManus. Higham watches Saul.

     McManus pretends to tinker with the car's engine. He has put  
     a pistol just inside the grill and keeps it within reach.

     The van on the other side of the garage starts and pulls out
     of the spot. It cruises over toward the Mercedes.

     Tucci sees the van. He and Higham are suddenly busy trying to
     keep track. They hear laughing behind them and turn around.

                                           YELLOW 06/11/94


                                                              64.

FENSTER and HOCKNEY are walking towards them. They are
sporting mustaches and sunglasses in addition to matching
suits, each with loud plaid sport coats, decades out of
style. Saul glances at Tucci and Higham.

                            HIGHAM
           Just get in the car Saul.

Under the hood of the Honda and out of sight, McManus pulls
on a black ski mask.

The van gets closer.

                             HOCKNEY
           I get out of the car, and man if the
           thing wasn't wrecked. And I see this
           broad in the back seat with nothing on.

Saul gets in the car quickly but calmly as Fenster and
Hockney laugh and talk louder. They look drunk - The desired
effect.

                       HOCKNEY (CONT'D)
           I'm laughing so hard I can't breathe -

Tucci and Higham try to take it all in stride. Saul's reverse
lights come on and he begins to back out of the spot.

                       HOCKNEY (CONT'D)
           ...And the fat guy comes out of the car
           with his pants on backwards and says -

SUDDENLY, the van revs and screeches to a halt behind Saul's
Mercedes, blocking him in. Hockney and Fenster drop the drunk
act and snap to. They both pull out guns and start screaming.

                       HOCKNEY (CONT'D)
           DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.

                            FENSTER
           RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.

McManus comes up from under the hood.                                  

Tucci and Higham throw their hands in the air. Hockney and
Fenster grab them and reach into their belts to get their
guns .

Keaton jumps out of the van and runs up to Saul's car, his
face covered in a ski mask. He yanks on the door handle but
it is locked. Saul sits in terror behind the wheel. Keaton
pulls out a pistol and smashes the window with it.

                                           YELLOW 06/11/94

                             KEATON
            Give me the case.


Saul reaches over for the case. Keaton trains the gun on him.

SUDDENLY, Saul comes up with a pistol and points it at
Keaton. Keaton sidesteps and grabs his wrist. The gun goes
off into the fender of the Honda.

Hockney and Fenster both look over at the sound of the gun.

Tucci and Higham seize the opportunity. Tucci grabs Hockney,
Higham grabs Fenster. The four men grapple for the guns.

Fenster's gun falls to the floor. McManus picks it up. He
trains a pistol on each bodyguard and takes a breath. They
are some ten feet apart and moving erratically. Hockney and
Fenster constantly fall in the line of fire.

McManus walks around the four men, keeping a pistol trained
on each of the guards. Finally he comes to an angle where
they are all in front of him. One guard is a few feet away,
the other is ten feet past him.

McMANUS' P.O.V.

The closer of the two moves in and out of the sights of the
pistol in McManus' right hand, the one farther away does the
same with the left.

Verbal gets out of the van and moves towards them to help.
BOOM
Both of McManus' guns go off like one shot. Tucci and Higham
collapse, each with a bullet in his head


PAUSE

The only sound is Saul grappling with Keaton for the gun. His
arm is halfway out the window. His elbow rests in the door
frame.

Keaton cannot get the gun out of his hand. Finally, he pushes
down with all his weight. Saul's elbow breaks backwards on
the door frame. He screams in agony. The gun falls from his
hand.

      All five of the men look at each other for an impossibly long
      moment. The confusion is only aggravated by Saul's screaming.

      SLOWLY, Keaton raises his pistol and aims it at Saul. His
      hand trembles, his eyes squint to near slits. His finger
      tenses and slacks off over and over again on the trigger.

      BOOM

      VERBAL SHOOTS SAUL. Keaton looks at him in surprise. Verbal
      trembles more than he does.

      The garage is silent.

                                 HOCKNEY
                What the hell?

                                 McManus
                Bad day. Fuck it.

      DING-DING


      The elevator light comes on. All five men look.

                                 KEATON
                Move.

      Keaton reaches into the car and grabs Saul's case. Everyone
      else piles into the van. Keaton gets in as Verbal is driving
      for the exit.

59    INT. VAN                                                             59

      The mood in the van is grim. Everyone is silent. Keaton pops
      the clasps on the case and opens it.

                                 KEATON
                Son of a bitch.

      Everyone looks in the case. It is filled with cash on one
      side. The other side is filled with clear plastic bags of
      WHITE POWDER.

60    EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                             60

      Keaton and the others stand in silhouette in front of the
      lights of an oncoming car in the distance. We can make out
      McManus loading a gun.                                                 +

           What does it look like? I'm going to kill
           him.

                             KEATON
           We did it your way. Now I'11 deal with

                            KEATON
           I'm going to deal with him.

The car, Redfoot's escort Caddy, is now in front of them.
The horn lets out three short blasts.

Redfoot comes around from behind the Caddy on his motorcycle.
He gets off the bike, trying to hide a faint smile.
McManus throws Saul's case on the ground in front of him.

                             McMANUS
           What the fuck is this, Redfoot?

           Some Limey. He's a middle-man for
           somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.

                            KEATON
           We want to meet him.

                            REDFOOT
           He wants to meet you. He called last
           night and asked me to set it up. What do
           I tell him'

                            KEATON
           Tell him we'll meet.

                            McMANUS
           If you're lying, Redfoot...

                            REDFOOT
           McManus, you're a real bad-ass, but get
           off my tip.

McManus lunges for Redfoot.

The Caddy doors instantly pop open and rifle barrels come
into view from within.

Fenster and Hockney draw guns and aim at the Caddy.
Keaton and Verbal grab McManus and hold him back.
Redfoot gets on his Harley, smiling defiantly.
                       REDFOOT (CONT'D)
           Real shame about Saul getting whacked.
           Lot's of cops looking for the guys that
           did it. I'm sure They'll get around to
           asking me.

                                  VERBAL
                 Right.

                                   KUJAN
                 And why leave this out when you talked to
                 the D.A.?

     A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
     Rabin sticks his head in.
                                   RAB IN
                 Someone to see you, Agent Kujan.

     Kujan steps out into the hall, shutting the door behind him.

62    INT. OUTSIDE RABIN'S OFFICE                                     62

     Kujan smiles instantly, recognizing the man standing with
     Rabin.  


                                   KUJAN
                 Jack. What are you doing here?

                                   BAER
                 I've been looking all over for you. You
                 still after the coke that walked out of
                 that blood bath in the harbor?

                                   KUJAN
                 Yeah.

                                   BAER
                 You can stop looking. There was no coke.
                 I've been in L.A. county with a guy they

                             BAER (cont'd)
               pulled out of a drainpipe in San Pedro
               yesterday after the shoot-out. He came to                 +
               this morning and started talking. He was
               part of a Hungarian mob there to do a
               deal with a bunch of goats from
               Argentina. He says it was definitely not
               a dope deal.

                                  KUJAN
               There was ninety-one million -

                                  BAER
               We know, but our man says no way on the
               dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole
               bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the
               next' day. They had no time to negotiate
               that kind of product and no means to move
               it.

                                 KUJAN
               What was the money for?

                                  BAER
               He didn't know. No one doing the deal
               knew except a few key people. This guy
               says they were real hush about it.
               Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.

                                 KUJAN
               I don't get it.

                                   BAER
               They tell me you got the cripple from New
               York in there. He mention Keyser Soze

                                 KUJAN
               Who ?

                                  BAER
               Bear with me here...

                                                                            63
63 INT. RABIN'S OFFICE - LATER


     BOOM - The door bursts open.

                                 KUJAN
               Who is Keyser Soze

     Verbal looks up in shock. He drops his cigarette and trembles
     at the mere mention of the name.

64 INT. HOLLYWOOD ATHLETIC CLUB - DAY - TWO WEEKS PRIOR              64'
     Keaton stands while the rest sit and listen.
                                  KEATON
                So I need to know if anyone can think of
                anybody. Somebody with power. Enough to
                possibly track us from New York.

                                  McMANUS
                Look. We've been over it for an hour now.
                I say we pack up and run. Let's go back
                to New York. At least get out of L.A.

     SUDDENLY, The sound of a man clearing his throat.
     Everyone turns to the door behind them.
     MR. KOBAYASHI a tall, slim, well groomed man stands in the
     hall. He has a briefcase in his hand. He smiles politely.


                                KOBAYASHI
                Mr. Keaton?

     Keaton stands back and lets him in. Kobayashi looks them
     over.

                           KOBAYASHI (CONT'D)
                I am Mr. Kobayashi. I've been asked by my
                employer to bring a proposal to you
                gentlemen. That must be Mr. Hockney. I
                recognize Mr. Fenster from his mug shot,
                as well as Mr. McManus.
                               (To Verbal)
                I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint.
                I believe you were the one who disposed
                of Saul. My employer sends his gratitude.
                A most unexpected benefit.

     Everyone looks at one another in shock that he would know
     this.

                                 KEATON
                What can we do for you?

                                            BLUE 06/01/94

                                                                72.

                           KOBAYASHI
           My employer requires your services. One
           job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I
           don't expect all of you to live, but
           those who do will have ninety-one million
           dollars to divide any way they see fit.

                            KEATON
           Who's your boss?

                           KOBAYASHI
           My employer wishes to remain anonymous.

                             KEATON
           Don't jerk me off. We all know what this
           is. You don't work with me if I work with
           you without knowing who I'm working for.
           Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?

                           KOBAYASHI
           I work for Keyser Sate.                                   

A strange look crosses Keaton's face. Skepticism, mockery and
just a hint of fear. Hockney, McManus and Fenster all share
similar looks.

                            KEATON
           What is this?

                             VERBAL
           Who's Keyser Soze?                                        

                           KOBAYASHI
           I am sure you've heard a number of tall
           tales, myths and legends about Mr. Soze                   
           I can assure you gentlemen, most of them
           are true.


                             VERBAL
           Who's Keyser Soze?                                        

                           KOBAYASHI
           Judging by the sudden change in mood, I
           am sure the rest of your associates can
           tell you, Mr. Kint. I have come with an
           offer directly from Mr. Soze. An order                   
           actually.

                             KEATON
           An order.

                           KOBAYASHI
           In nineteen-eighty one, Mr. Keaton, you
           participated in the hijacking of a truck
           in Buffalo, New York. The cargo was raw
           steel. Steel that belonged to Mr. Soze
           and was destined for Pakistan to be used
           in a Nuclear reactor. A very profitable
           violation of U.N. Regulations. You had no
           way of knowing this, because the man
           shipping the steel was working for Mr.
           Sate without his knowledge.                               +
                             (Beat)
           Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus hijacked a
           twin-prop cargo flight earlier this year
           out of Newark airport. The plane was
           carrying platinum and gold wiring. Also
           set for Pakistan.

Kobayashi turns and points at Hockney.

                      KOBAYASHI (CONT'D)
           Two months ago, Mr. Hockney stole a truck
           carrying gun parts through Queens -

Everyone looks at Hockney. He smiles shyly. It occurs to them
all that he robbed the truck for which they were all arrested
in the first place.

                      KOBAYASHI (CONT'D)
           - guns allegedly set to be destroyed by
           the state of New York. They were to be
           "lost" in a weigh station and routed to
           Belfast. Again, Mr. Sate using pawns who                   
           had no knowledge.
                      (turning to Verbal)
           Which brings us to Mr. Kint.

Verbal crumbles under his stare.

                      KOBAYASHI (CONT'D)
           Nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze less                      
           than intelligent couriers was taken in a
           complicated confidence seam by a cripple.
           He was relieved of sixty-two thousand
           dollars. Now
                        (To all of them)
           - It has taken us some time to find you.
           Our intention was to approach you after
           your apprehension in New York.

           You set up the line-up.

                            KOBAYASHI
           Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were                   
           not to be released until I came to see
           you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms.
           Finneran, was a bit too effective in
           expediting his release. Holding the rest
           of you became a moot point.

                            KEATON
           What about Redfoot?

                            KOBAYASHI
           Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t
           works with the same people for very long,
           and they never know who they're working
           for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no
           people.

                            FENSTER
           So why tell us?

                           KOBAYASHI
           Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze.                    
           That you did not know you stole from him
           is the only reason you are still alive,
           but he feels you owe him. You will repay
           your debt.
           
                            HOCKNEY
           Who is this guy? How do we know you work
           for Soze


                           KOBAYASHI
           I don't think that is relevant, Mr.
           Hockney. The five of you are responsible
           for the murder of Saul Berg and his
           bodyguards. Mr. Redfoot can attest to
           your involvement, and we can see to it
           that he will. He is not of your
           "superior" breed.

                            MCMANUS
           This is a load of shit.

                           KOBAYASHI
           The offer is this, gentlemen. Mr. Soze's
           primary interest, as I am sure you all
           know, is narcotics. He's been - competing
           shall we say, with a group of

                       KOBAYASHI (cont'd)
           Argentinians for several years. Competing
           with Mr. Soze has taken its toll. These
           Argentinians are negotiating the sale of
           ninety-one million dollars in cocaine in
           three days time. Needless to say, this
           purchase will revitalize the diminishing
           strength of their organization. Mr. Soze
           wants you to stop the deal. If you
           choose, you may wait until the buy.
           Whatever money changes hands is yours.
           The transaction will take place on a boat
           in San Pedro. Mr. Soze wants you to get
           to the boat and destroy the cocaine on
           board. Then you are free of your
           obligation to Mr. Soze.

                             KEATON
           Give me one good reason why I shouldn't
           kill you right now.

Kobayashi smiles and puts his briefcase on the table in front
of him.

                          KOBAYASHI
           A gift from Mr. Soze gentlemen.

He turns and walks out of the room.

Keaton walks over to the case and opens it. He reaches in and
pulls out five thick manila envelopes, each marked in bold
black letters. "KEATON", "McMANUS", "HOCKNEY", "FENSTER" and
"KINT"

Keaton pulls out the files, revealing a map underneath.

Keaton hands each man his file. He opens his first. He pulls
out a thick stack of papers and thumbs through them.

                             KEATON
           Jesus Christ. Open them.

All of the men open their files. Inside are mug shots of each
man in his respective file as well as a printout of his
criminal record. But there is more.

                            HOCKNEY
           They know everything.

                             McMANUS

           done since I was eighteen.

           They fucking know everything.

Keaton pulls out a large black and white photograph of
himself and his lawyer EDIE FINNERAN. They are laughing arm
in arm by a fountain in New York. He hides the photo from the
others.

                            KEATON
           This is not right.

                            FENSTER
           I don't know. Who was that guy that used
           to talk about Soze in New York?

           Yeah. He said he did jobs for him.
           Indirect stuff. Always five times more

     Kujan leans into Verbal's face. He hangs on his every word.
                                  VERBAL
                He is supposed to be Turkish. Some say                   r
                his father was German. Nobody believed he                 
                was real. Nobody ever saw him or knew                     
                anybody that ever worked directly for                     
                him, but to hear Kobayashi tell it,                       
                anybody could have worked for Soze. You                  
                never knew. That was his power. The                       
                greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was                  
                convincing the world he didn't exist. One                  
                story the guys told me - the story I                      
                believe - was from his days in Turkey.                    
                There was a petty gang of Hungarians that                 
                wanted their own mob. They realized that                  
                to be in power you didn't need guns or                    
                money or even numbers. You just needed                   +
                the will to do what the other guy                         
                wouldn't. After a while they come to                      
                power, and then they come after Soze He                   
                was small time then, just running dope,

     Three of the Hungarians come bursting into Keyser Soze's            +
     home. They grab his five children and round them up in the
     front room. One of the men grabs his wife and back-hands her
     across the face.

                They come to his home in the afternoon
                looking for his business. They find his
                wife and kids in the house and decide to
                wait for Sate.

68    INT. SOZE'S HOME - LATER                                            68'

     The front door opens and in walks Keyser Sate. We are never         t
     allowed to see his face.

     Sate's wife lies in the corner, beaten and bruised. Her dress
     is tattered to shreds. She cannot look up at her husband.

     The three Hungarians stand to greet him. Two hold guns in
     their hands. The third holds a straight razor. He grabs
     Soze youngest boy and holds the razor to his throat.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                He comes home to his wife raped and his
                children screaming. The Hungarians knew
                Soze was tough. Not to be trifled with.                   
                So they let him know they meant business.

     The Hungarian smiles. Soze's wife SCREAMS IN HORROR.                
     The Hungarian holds up a BLOOD SOAKED RAZOR.
     SUDDENLY, he grabs another child. A little girl no older than
     six.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                They tell Soze they want his territory -                  
                all his business. Soze looks over the                    +
                faces of his family... Then he showed
                these men of will what will really was.

     SUDDENLY, Soze pulls out a pistol and shoots the two men with  
     guns. He turns and aims at the third man holding his child.

     The man threatens to cut the child's throat, slicing just
     enough to draw blood.

     SOZE FIRES.

     The stunned Hungarian watches the child fall from his arms.

     Sate turns the pistol on the next child, then the next and  
     the next. He kills his children one by one in front of the
     Hungarian.

                             VERBAL (V.O.)
                He tells him he would rather' see his
                family dead than live another day after
                this.

    SOZE walks over to his wife, crying and beaten on the floor
    and holds up her head. She gives him the strangest look. One
    of trust perhaps, saturated with fear and humiliation.

    He puts the gun between her eyes and fires.

                             VERBAL (V.O.)
                He lets the last Hungarian go, and he
                goes running. He waits until his wife and
                kids are in the ground and he goes after
                the rest of the mob. He kills their kids,
                he kills their wives, he kills their
                parents and their parents' friends.

    A dark and looming figure of a man walks in front of a wall
    of fire - a black shadow blurred by waves of heat.

                             VERBAL (V.O.)
                He burns down the houses they live in and
                the stores they work in, he kills people
                that owe them money. And like that he was
                gone. Underground. No one has ever seen
                him again. He becomes a myth, a spook
                story that criminals tell their kids at
                night. If you rat on your pop, Keyser
                Sate will get you. And nobody really ever
                believes.

                from Justice. He has a file on Sate in

                years. A lot of guys equate him to that

                On the street? A few times. Outside
                stuff. Somebody was working for a guy who
                was working for a guy who got money
                through Keyser Soze. That kind of shit.
                Could be an old badge. A hex sign to keep
                people from fucking with you back when a

                of the hospital on d fried drumstick to

                I came clean. I told it like it happened
                on the boat. So what if I left out how I
                got there? It's got so many holes in it,
                the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty
                out my ass. So you got what you wanted
                out of me. Big fucking deal.

                 Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to
                 call him - knows where I am right now.
                 He's got the front burner under' your ass
                 to let me go so he can scoop me up ten
                 minutes later. Immunity was just to deal
                 with you assholes. I got a whole new
                 problem when I post bail.

                                  KUJAN
                 So why play into his hands? We can
                 protect you.

                 Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far.
                 Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if
                 I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same
                 fuckers that rounded us up and sank us
                 into this mess are telling me They'll
                 bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can
                 catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like
                 that comes this close to getting fingered
                 and sticks his head out? If he comes up
                 for anything, it will be to get rid of
                 me.
                                  (beat)
                 After that, my guess is you'll never hear
                 from him again.

     pokes at it. He notes the checkered pattern of the fabric
     entwined with the twisted mess. It is the bloated carcass of
     THE MAN IN THE CHECKERED BATHROBE. BRANDO pokes it's eye
     with the fishing pole. It pops.

                                  VERBAL
                That was how I ended up in a barber shop                   
                quartet in Skokie, Illinois.

                                  KUJAN
                This is totally irrelevant.

                                  VERBAL
                Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been
                nailed in Illinois for running a three
                card monte in between sets, I never would
                have took off for New York. I never
                would have met Keaton, see. That barber
                shop quartet was the reason for
                everything.

                                  KUJAN
                Can we just get back to Kobayashi?

                                  VERBAL
                The quartet is part of the bit about
                Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file,
                along with every other thing I had done
                since high school, see? Aliases, middle-
                men. They knew me better than I did.
                They knew all of us.

      Kujan looks at his watch.

                                  KUJAN
                You're stalling, Verbal.

                                 VERBAL
                Give a guy a break, huh?

                                  KUJAN
                What happened?

      Verbal slumps a bit. He realizes his stalling tactic has
      failed.
                                   VERBAL
                We woke up the next morning and Fenster
                was gone. He couldn't handle the idea of
                slumming for SOZE. He left a note wishing
                us good luck and took a chunk of the
                money we'd scraped together.

                McManus was furious. He was talking about
                tracking him down and ripping his heart
                out and all sorts of shit. That night we
                got the call.

                                  KUJAN
                What call?

                                  VERBAL
                Kobayashi told us where we could find
                Fenster.

     Keaton looks out over the ocean and smokes a cigarette.
                                  KEATON
                What do you want to do with him?

     McManus kneels in the sand. Hockney and Verbal stand behind
     him, staring at something in front of them.

     It is the body of Fred Fenster, literally peppered with
     bullet holes. McManus stares at him, fighting any flicker of
     emotion.

                                  McMAMJS
                I worked five years with Fenster. More
                jobs, more money than I can count.

                                 KEATON
                I'm sorry, McManus.

                No time.

     McManus springs to his feet and points a pistol at Keaton.
     Keaton turns to face him and raises his head. McManus might
     as well be pointing a feather-duster.

                                  McMANUS
                YOU WILL FIND TIME. You're not the only

     Everyone digs in the sand on the deserted beach with their
     hands. They are up to their waists in the hole they have
     scooped out. Fenster's body is a few feet away.

                This is nuts.

                                 McMANUS
                Dig.

                                 HOCKNEY
                This is fucking dry sand, man. When he
                rots, the surfers'll smell him from a
                hundred yards out.

                                 McMANUS
                DIG, YOU FUCKER.

     Hockney can see that McManus has truly gone over the edge for
     now. Keaton gives him a look that says don't argue.

                                 HOCKNEY
                Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find
                him.

                I can run. I got no problem with that.

                                 KEATON
                They don't seem to have a problem with it
                either.

                IT'S NOT PAYBACK. I don't answer to you.                   +
                It's precaution. You want payback? You
                want to run? I don't care. I'm going to
                finish this thing. Not for Fenster, not
                for anybody else, but
                for me. This Kobayashi cocksucker isn't
                going to stand over me.

                All of you can go to hell.


     Keaton turns and digs furiously with both hands. Hockney
     takes a moment and slowly starts to do the same.

     The four men dig for Fenster. The first to find some rest.

     Redfoot's Harley rests on the roof of the Caddy in a mangled
     heap. The body of the Caddy is riddled with bullet holes.

     Redfoot's dead body has been shoved head-first through a hole
     in the windshield up to his waist, recognizable only by the
     trademark red boot.

     a newspaper.

     We see a wire running from Hockney's ear to his collar.

     Keaton, McManus and Verbal stand by the six elevators on the
     fortieth floor. They are all wearing khaki overalls and tool
     belts with walkie-talkies. They look like servicemen.


     All of the elevators have been propped open and stranded.

     McManus moves into one of the elevators. As the doors close         i

                             KEATON
           Neither do we.

                             McMANUS
           You got Fenster, you may get more, but
           you won't get us all. Not before one of
           us gets to you.

                           KOBAYASHI
           I believe you, Mr. McManus. I quite
           sincerely do. You would not have been
           chosen if you were not so capable, but I
           cannot make this decision. Whatever you
           can threaten me with is... ludicrous in
           comparison to what will be done to me if

                                                 BLUE 06/01/94

                                 McMANUS
                Just so you know. I'm the guy. I'm the
                one that's gonna get through to you.

                               KOBAYASHI
                I am sorry, Mr. McManus.
                               (To Keaton)
                f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton.
                Mr. Soze is very real and very                             +
                determined.

                                 KEATON
                We'll see.

     McManus holds a pistol to Kobayashi's chin. The lawyer's cool
     eyes never falter'.

                                 KOBAYASHI
                Before you do me in, you will let me
                finish my business with Ms. Finneran
                first, won't you?

     SUDDENLY, Keaton grabs McManus' hand and pulls the gun away
     before he can shoot.

                                 KEATON
                What did you say?

                                 KOBAYASHI
                Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my
                office for an extradition deposition. I
                requested she be put on the case
                personally. She flew out yesterday.

     Everyone looks at Keaton.

                           KOBAYASHI (CONT'D)
                No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.

                                 KEATON
                You're lying.

                                KOBAYASHI
                Am I?
                                                                            92
92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR


     Everyone follows Kobayashi quietly down a dimly lit, oak-
     lined hallway. Verbal holds a small pistol discreetly in the
     small of Kobayashi's back.

     They come to a glass office foyer. Kobayashi gestures and
     everyone looks through the glass into the lobby beyond.

     EDIE FINNERAN is talking casually with the receptionist.
     
93    INT. LOBBY                                                            93
     Edie glances toward the men in the hall.
     Keaton turns quickly on his heels, facing the others. From
     where Edie stands, it looks as though Kobayashi is talking to
     a group of harmless maintenance men.

     They see A LARGE MAN dressed very much like the two dead
     bodies left in the hall downstairs. The man notices Kobayashi
     and the others. He stands and stares menacingly.

                                KOBAYASHI
                Ms. Finneran's escort in Los Angeles.
                Never leaves her for a moment. I thought
                you'd like to know she was in good hands.

     Keaton's mind races for an alternative. He can find none.
     Verbal lowers his gun without being told.
                           KOBAYASHI (CONT'D)
                Get your rest, Gentlemen. The boat will
                be ready for you on Friday. If I see you
                or your friends before then, or fail to
                check in every half hour with that
                unpleasant looking man in there, Ms.
                Finneran will find herself the victim of
                a gruesome violation before she dies. As
                will your father, Mr. Hockney. and your
                Uncle Randall in Arizona, Mr. Kint. I
                might only castrate Mr. McManus' nephew,
                David. Do I make myself clear?

     All of the men surround Kobayashi, aching to kill him.

                                KOBAYASHI
                I'11 take care of the dead men
                downstairs. We'll add them to the cost of
                Mr. Fenster. Now if you'll excuse me.

     Kobayashi walks into the office. Edie turns to greet him.
     Keaton slowly turns and watches as they shake hands and talk.
     Kobayashi says something they cannot hear and Edie laughs,
     her back to the window.

     Kobayashi smiles over her shoulder at Keaton.
     All the while, the bodyguard watches Keaton. He nods politely
     before Keaton and the others leave. Verbal watches for a
     moment more and follows.

94    EXT. HILLSIDE ROAD - DAY                                            94'

     Keaton, Verbal, Hockney and McManus sit in a rented sedan
     overlooking San Pedro harbor.

     Another file from Kobayashi's briefcase is laid out on the
     dashboard. This has a map and a good fifty pages of                  
     information in it.

                                  KEATON
                It's a logistical nightmare. Close
                quarters, no advance layout, ten men,
                maybe twenty.

                                 HOCKNEY
                Can we stealth these guys?

                                  KEATON
                Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be
                ready - which brings me to sunny spot
                number two. Even if one of us gets
                through and jacks the boat, we get
                nothing.

                                  McMANUS
                And if we wait for the money?

                                  KEATON
                Ten more men at least. In my opinion, it
                can't be done. Anyone who walks into this
                won't come out alive.

                                  McMANUS
                I'm for waiting for the money.

                                 HOCKNEY
                Me too.

                                  VERBAL
                Did you hear what he just said?

                                  HOCKNEY
                If I'm going in, I want a stake.

                                  McMANUS
                 So do I.

      Verbal is shocked by what he is hearing. He looks at Keaton
      as if to ask him for his decision.

      Keaton's cold stare is all the answer Verbal needs. He slumps
      in his seat, resigned to the others.

                                  VERBAL
                 I just can't believe we're just gonna
                 walk into certain death.

      PAUSE
      They all suddenly realize the weight of their situation.
      FINALLY:
                                  McMANUS
                 News said it's raining in New York.

      No one knows quite how to respond.

95    EXT, PIER - SAN PEDRO - NIGHT                                       95

      A large boat, sleek and yacht-like, but without finesse. This
      is a boat for business - heavy and fast. It is moored to the
      pier.

      A large crane hoists a pallet of fuel drums from the dock. It
      swings slowly over the boat. A man on the dock yells in
      Spanish to the crane operator.

      Behind an old and weathered boat in dry-dock, Keaton and
      Verbal watch the boat from the shadows.

                                  VERBAL
                 What-are they speaking?

                                  KEATON
                 Russian, I think. I don't know.

                Knock it off.

      DOLLY OVER TO REVEAL:


      McManus climbing up the side of the boathouse.

      CONTINUE PAST HIM TO REVEAL:                                        r


      A large boat. A very large boat.

      Hockney maneuvers through a mesh of twisted steel, arriving
      at a vantage point near the stern of the large boat.                 

      HOCKNEY'S P.O.V.                                                     

      A black van pulls up and parks near the crane. Four men in
      suits get out. One remains with the van and the other three          
      walk toward the boat.                                                

      On the boat, five men come up from below deck. They are tense        
      and cautious around the men in suits. Someone speaks in
      Spanish and someone else in Russian. It takes a moment before
      anyone speaks the same tongue. They settle on French for both
      negotiators.

      Hockney sits in the van. He handles a large shoulder bag            +
      stuffed with plastique. He tests a timer on top.                     

      He picks up a walkie-talkie.

      McManus is positioning himself on the roof of the boathouse.         
      He stops and grabs his radio.

                 I want you to find Edie. Both of you find

                 Everything. She knows people. She'll know
                 what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my

                 Just do what I tell you.

     Keaton turns and takes a few steps. He stops and looks back,
     his face marked with guilt and agony.

                             KEATON (CONT'D)
                 Tell her I... Tell her I tried.

     Keaton leaves before Verbal can respond. He walks down a ramp  
     toward the boat.

     He is no more than a few yards out of the shadows before the  
     first man sees him.

102   EXT. DOCK                                                        102'

     One of the men in suits starts to yell to the others. Men
     pull out guns and try to look as cool as they can.

     Keaton walks right into the face of all of these men,
     undaunted. His hands are in his pockets.

     Above him, in the darkness, McManus pokes his head out and

     spies Keaton. He pulls his head back and sticks out the
     barrel of the rifle.

     Keaton comes to a stop about twenty feet from fifteen men all
     together.

     McManus stares through the scope of his rifle at the scene.
     The cross-hairs breeze past Keaton and find a target. A man
     in a suit.

                 Pow.

     He moves to another and then another, picking up speed and
     mock-shooting the men. He is steady and quick. It is clear he
     could take all fifteen in a few seconds.

                             McMANUS (CONT'D)
                 Pow-pow-pow-pow-pow-pow . Oswald was a

     The men shout questions at Keaton in a number of languages.

     A few men standing on the dock near the stern of the large
     boat, move towards the commotion.

     Hockney bails out and runs quickly and quietly through the
     shadows, bringing the bomb with him.

     McManus still wanders with his scope.
                                  McMANUS
                 Old McDonald had a farm, ee-aye, ee-aye,
                 oh. And on this farm he shot some guys.

     Finally two men walk right towards Keaton. The rest train
     guns on him. They reach for his arms, pointing their guns
     right at him.

     At the far end of the dock, Hockney throws his bomb onto the
     stern of the large boat.

     IT EXPLODES                                                          
     The men surrounding Keaton, are distracted.
     Keaton pulls a pistol out of each pocket and shoots the two
     men closest to him.

     The men from the boat and the men in suits try to peg Keaton,
     but McManus' sniping has them running.

     crane in motion.,,

     McManus runs across the roof of the boathouse and jumps down
     to the pier. He arrives at a thick mooring cable and climbs
     across to the boat.                                                 i

     Keaton climbs up onto a small lifeboat hanging from the side         
     of the larger boat. From this he climbs aboard the large             
     boat.

      Hockney is firing in all directions.
      SUDDENLY, he realizes no one is left on the dock.

      PAUSE  

      FINALLY, he turns and runs back for the van parked on the
      pier above. He finds a ramp leading from the dock to the
      pier.  

      At the van, he finds the one man who has stayed behind to
      protect it.                                 I                       i

      The man hears Hockney coming and raises his gun. Hockney runs       i
      straight at him, screaming frantically.                             i

                                  HOCKNEY

      He shoots the man point blank in the face and runs over his
      body as it falls.

      He gets to the back door of the van and yanks it open.

      The inside is stacked with large wooden crates.

      Hockney, suddenly oblivious to the sound of gunfire, opens
      one of the crates and looks inside.

      IT IS FILLED WITH MONEY. Cash and negotiable bonds of all
      kinds.

      He smiles.
      BOOM
      BLOOD sprays all over the money. Hockney looks at it,
      puzzled.

      Hockney raises a blood-soaked hand from his belly.                   
      He turns and stares in horror.

     McManus runs like a wild man across the deck, heading for the
     hatch .

     He shoots in all directions as though he has eyes in the back
     of his head. He sees Keaton climbing onto the deck of the
     boat.

     for the other side of the boathouse.

     The crane continues to swing.
     A single bullet hits one of the barrels on the suspended
     pellet.

     Gasoline pours out through the bullet-hole.

     Keaton finds the hatch and goes below, shooting a man on his
     way up the stairs. McManus jumps on board and runs down
     behind him.

     He looks around frantically, frozen in terror.                       
     It is quiet, except for the sounds of screaming, far off in
     the bowels of the boat and the hum of the crane.

                burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys

                His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty
                smuggler out of Argentina. He was
                arrested in New York last year for
                trafficking. He escaped to California and
                got picked up in Long Beach. They were
                setting up his extradition when he
                escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran
                was called in to advise the proceedings.

                for a finale?

124  INT. BOAT - NIGHT - ONE WEEK PRIOR                               124

     Keaton is weaving through tight, low-ceiling corridors,
     looking in every cabin, working his way towards the bottom of
     the boat.

     ELSEWHERE IN THE BOAT, McManus is tearing though the
     corridors, seemingly less interested in securing the cargo as
     he is in killing everyone on board.

     He screams like a lunatic, shooting everything in his path,
     killing some men with his bare hands, shooting others,
     stabbing others still with a knife he has brought along.

                                                                      125
125  INT. CORRIDOR


     JAIME, one of the men from the boat, is half-pushing, half-
     helping a thin and sweaty looking MAN IN A CHECKERED BATHROBE
     towards a cabin at the end of the hall.

     The man in the robe is trembling. He seems stricken with
     fear.

                He's here. I saw him on deck.

     Jaime pushes him inside the cabin and shuts the door.

     A stereo playing softly in the room mixes with the man's
     panicked breathing.

     The man in the robe screams through the closed door, his
     voice echoing off of the metal bulkheads.

                               MAN IN ROBE

     Jaime stands outside the door of the cabin and turns to face
     down the hall. Off in some other part of the boat, he can
     hear McManus wailing like a banshee and the ever-less
     frequent sound of gunshots.

     Keaton has come to the four-foot-high door to the hold. The
     door is open slightly. Keaton finds this strange. He pushes
     the door open and steps inside. The hold is empty.

     He hears a noise behind him. He wheels around to fire. He
     sees McManus in the door. His face is covered with blood.

                                 McMANUS

                I heard somebody screaming his nuts off.
                He said Keyser Soze was on the boat.                        

                                 KEATON

     McManus rubs some of the blood off with his sleeve.

                There's no coke.

     McManus looks around the hold as though he'll see four and a
     half tons of dope in some corner where Keaton might have
     missed it.

     The two men look at one another. There is a long, pregnant
     silence.

                                  McMANUS
                Let's get the fuck out of here.

     Keaton and McManus step out of the hold, walking slowly and
     cautiously back from where they came. They hear the sounds of
     footsteps running on the deck above and the occasional
     hollered sentence in Spanish.

                I can't remember which way.

                                 McMANUS
                Right -

     BOOM - BOOM

     Gunshots fill the hallway from behind them. They do not stop
     to turn around. Keaton goes left, McManus goes right. They
     run in opposite directions with the sound of gunfire right
     behind them.

128 INT. HALLWAY - CABIN                                                128
     Jaime squints and cocks his head.

      SOMEONE IS COMING. He raises a pistol and crouches by the
      door.

129   INT. CABIN                                                         129

      The man in the bathrobe sits on the foot of the bed watching
      the door. He hears the sounds of fighting somewhere not too
      far away.

      He crawls over the bed and squeezes between it and the
      bulkhead. Only the top of his head is visible. He starts to
      cry.

      BOOM - BOOM - Two shots just outside in the hall.

      SUDDENLY, the door bursts open. Jaime collapses in a heap on
      the floor, a bullet hole in his eye.

      A FIGURE LOOMS IN THE DOOR

      The man in the bathrobe looks up at the figure. We cannot see
      him.

                               MAN IN ROBE
                I told them nothing.

      BOOM


      The man in the robe falls dead.
130   EXT. DECK - MOMENTS LATER                                          130
      The boat is quiet now. Keaton walks out onto the deck.
      He looks out over the pier and sees Verbal standing in the
      middle of the carnage, frozen. Their eyes meet. Keaton waves
      at him as if to shoe him away.

131   EXT. PIER - TOP OF RAMP                                            131

      Verbal hesitates and finally moves towards the van with the
      money. He looks back over his shoulder and sees Keaton.
      Keaton sees him looking and waves again, hurrying him along.  

      Verbal turns away and focuses on the van.


                                                                         132
132   EXT. DECK


      Keaton hears a noise behind him. He swings around and points
      his gun at McManus again. He puts the gun down.

                                                YELLOW 06/11/94

      McManus smiles. He walks slowly across the deck towards
      Keaton. Something is not right about him.

                                  McMANUS
                 Strangest thing...

      He slumps to the deck. Keaton rushes over to him. He kneels
      down and sees a pipe sticking out of the back of McManus's
      neck.

133   EXT. PIER                                                            133'

      Verbal approaches the van, stepping over Hockney's body. He
      closes the back doors of the van.         ,                          

      He looks to his left at the huge loading crane. He glances
      upward along the giant' arm as it swings steadily on.

      Somewhere, off in the distance, the sound of SIRENS can be
      heard.

134   EXT. DECK                                                            134

      Keaton kneels by McManus, trembling with rage. After a moment
      he stands, looking down at McManus' dead body.

135   EXT. PIER                                                            135

      SUDDENLY, Verbal realizes something. He turns and goes to
      call out a warning to Keaton. He is too late.

136   EXT. DECK                                                            136
      Keaton never sees the crane coming.
      WHAM

      The pellet of barrels hits him square in the back and sends
      him flying into the wheel house of the boat.

      Keaton is still for a moment. Finally, he tries to get up,
      but finds he cannot move his legs.                                   

137   EXT. PIER                                                            137

      Verbal runs down the ramp as fast as he can. He comes to a           
      rope ladder hanging down the side of the boat.                      +

      SUDDENLY, he stops dead in his tracks, looking up at the
      boat.

>From where he stands, he can just make out the figure of a
TAU, THIN MAN walking along the edge of the deck. He moves
quietly and calmly in the shadows towards the crane, looking
out of place in his expensive suit.

     Something about this man terrifies him.

                And that's when you say in your statement
                that you saw...

     Kujan picks up his copy of Verbal's statement to the D.A.

                              KUJAN (CONT'D)
                A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.

                                 VERBAL
                Wait a minute.

                                  KUJAN
                            (Looking at watch)
                I don't have a minute. Are you saying it
                was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you
                didn't know who it was.

     Verbal is drowning in Kujan's interrogation. He looks dazed.


                                  VERBAL
                I - there had to be dope there.

                             KUJAN
           Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling.
           You know what I'm getting at.

                            VERBAL
           I don't.

                             KUJAN
           YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT.
           THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T
           KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL
           KEATON .

For the first time, Verbal stands and tries to move away from
Kujan, but Kujan stays in his face, backing him into a
corner. Verbal shields himself with his hands and shuts his

eyes.

                        KUJAN (CONT'D)
           TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW
           EVERYTHING .

                             VERBAL
           I don't know what you're talking about.

                             KUJAN
           YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING
           TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.

Verbal looks into Kujan's eyes with genuine terror. Kujan's
face is red, his body trembles. His locomotive breathing is
the only sound in the room.

                             VERBAL
           I don't understand what you're saying. I
           saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.

                             KUJAN
           Then why didn't you help him?

                             VERBAL
           I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure
           it was Keyser Soze at that point. I                        
           couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to
           him.

                             KUJAN
           But Keaton...

                             VERBAL
           It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean                    
           the Devil himself. How do you shoot the
           Devil in the back?

     Verbal holds up a shaking, twisted hand.

                What if you miss?

140  EXT. BARGE - NIGHT - ONE WEEK PRIOR                               140'

     Verbal is hiding in the tangle of girders and cables on the
     barge.

     VERBAL'S P.O.V.


     Keaton's body is completely obscured.
     The man in a suit strides across the deck over to Keaton,
     stopping to relieve himself on a small fire on the deck.
     He walks up and stands over Keaton. The two men exchange
     words and the man in the suit pulls out a pistol. He points
     it at Keaton.

     RED AND BLUE LIGHTS FLASH BEHIND VERBAL

     Verbal turns. He can just make out police cars coming in the
     distance.

     BANG

     Verbal hears a shot from the deck of the boat. He turns in
     time to see the man in the suit running across the deck
     toward the gangway.

     Verbal can barely see the man from where he is now. The man
     in the suit is covered by shadows and the poor angle from the
     barge. Verbal strains to see but he cannot.

     The man in the suit stops long enough to pull out a lighter.
     He turns and walks back across the deck and out of sight.
     A moment later flames leap up from on the deck.
     The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon at
     its base.                                                            

     MOVE INTO THE DARKNESS.                                              

     Sirens are close now. Almost here. The sound of fire raging
     out of control.

     SIRENS BLARING. TIRES SQUEALING. CAR DOORS OPENING. FEET             
     POUNDING THE PAVEMENT.

                                  KUJAN
                Arturo Marquez. Ever hear of him?

                                 VERBAL
                Wha- No.

                                  KUJAN
                He was a stool pigeon for the Justice
                Department. He swore out a statement to
                Federal Marshals that he had seen and
                could positively identify one Keyser Soze
                and had intimate knowledge of his
                business, including, but not exclusive
                to, drug trafficking and murder.

                                 VERBAL
                I never heard of him.

                                  KUJAN
                His own people were selling him to a gang
                of Hungarians. Most likely the same
                Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out
                back in Turkey. The money wasn't there
                for dope. The Hungarians were going to
                buy the one guy that could finger Soze
                for them.

                                  VERBAL
                I said I never heard of him.


                                  KUJAN
                But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his
                extradition advisor. She knew who he was
                and what he knew.

                                 VERBAL
                I don't

                                  KUJAN
                There were no drugs on that boat. It was
                a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the
                one man that could finger Keyser Soze so                  
                Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he
                knew he could march into certain death.

                                  VERBAL
                But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t
                us to kill someone?

                             KUJAN
           I'm saying Keaton did.

Verbal cannot grasp this. He squints, trying to understand.

                        KUJAN (CONT'D)
           Verbal, he left you behind for a reason.
           If you all knew Soze could find you
           anywhere, why was he ready to send you
           off with the money when he could have
           used you to take the boat?

                            VERBAL
           He wanted me to live.

                             KUJAN
           Why did he want you to live? A one-time                     
           dirty cop without a loyalty in the world
           finds it in his heart to save a worthless
           rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'

                            VERBAL
           Edie.

                             KUJAN
           I don't buy that reform story for a
           minute. And even if I did, I certainly
           don't believe he would send you to
           protect her. So why?

                            VERBAL
           Because he was my friend.

                             KUJAN
           No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton
           didn't have friends. He saved you because
           he wanted it that way. It was his will.

Verbal grinds to a mental halt, trying to grasp the
implication .

SUDDENLY:

                            VERBAL
           No...

                             KUJAN
           Keaton was Keyser Soze

                            VERBAL

                             KUJAN
           The kind of guy who could wrangle the
           wills of men like Hockney and McManus.
           The kind of man who could engineer a
           police line-up from all his years of
           contacts in N.Y.P.D.

Verbal stands on wobbly legs, shaking with anger.

                            VERBAL
           NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

                             KUJAN
           THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED
           EDIE FINNERAN.

A strange look crosses Verbal's face. Shock perhaps, or
revelation.

                        KUJAN (CONT'D)
           They found her yesterday in a hotel in
           Pennsylvania. Shot twice in the head.

It starts to sink in with Verbal. His eyes swell.

           He used all of you to get him on that
           boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had
           to pull the trigger himself to make sure
           he got his man. The one man that could
           identify him.

           He left you to stay behind and tell us he
           was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did
           you? You had to hide when the first
           police cars showed up. You heard the
           shot, just before the fire but you didn't
           see him die.

           were close. You said it yourself. Where
           is the political pressure coming from?
           Why are you being protected? It's Keaton
           making sure you tell us what you're

           McMANUS? I'm a cripple. I'm stupid. Why
           me?

Verbal hears the weight of his words and falls back in his
chair, Kujan looks at him with some pity,; but he is too far

in to stop.

                             KUJAN
           Because you're a cripple, Verbal. Because
           you're stupid. Because you were weaker
           than them. Because you couldn't see far
           enough into him to know the truth.

Verbal is crying now. He shakes his head, eyes closed.

                         KUJAN (CONT'D)
           If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is
           true, then it won't matter. It was his
           idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York,
           wasn't it? Tell me the truth.

           It was all Keaton. We followed him from
           the beginning.

Kujan smiles with triumphant satisfaction.

                         VERBAL (CONT'D)

           even a good thief. But I thought the one
           thing I could be good at was a keeping my
           mouth shut - keeping the code. I didn't
           want to tell you for my dignity, that's
           all, and you robbed me, Agent Kujan. You
           robbed me.

Kujan pulls the microphone out from under his tie and puts it +
on the desk. Verbal actually manages to snort a laugh, but
only briefly, overcome by an apparent wave of nausea.

                             KUJAN
           You're not safe on your own.

           Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal.                    
           It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a
           shield. Like you said, a spook story, but
           I know Keaton - and someone out there is
           pulling strings for you. Stay here and
           let us protect you.

           tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than
           it is to buy a cop.

           Where are you going to go, Verbal? You
           gonna run? Turn states evidence. You
           might never see trial. If somebody wants
           to get you, you know They'll get you out

     Verbal stands, mustering his shattered dignity and walks
     towards the door. Rabin opens it for him from outside.

     For once Kujan cannot bring himself to look at Verbal.
     Verbal turns to the door, stopping to look Rabin in the eye.
                            VERBAL (CONT'D)

     him.

142  INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                142

     Daniel Metzheiser comes out of Arkosh Kovash's room with a
     single sheet of 15x20 inch paper in his hand. He inspects the
     sketch with great interest. He folds the edges of the paper
     back to make it smaller.

143  INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION ROOM                                       143

     Metzheiser walks behind the reception desk without asking the
     nurse for permission and helps himself to the fax machine.

144  INT. DEPOT - LATER                                                 144

     Verbal is downstairs in the depot of the police station
     picking up his personal belongings.

     A FAT, WHITE-HAIRED COP is checking off the items as he takes
     them out of the tray in which they are kept.

                One watch: gold. One cigarette lighter:

                cigarettes.

     Verbal collects his personal items and shuffles on his lame
     leg toward the exit.

     Jack Baer stands by a fax machine. A green light comes on
     next to a digital display.

     The display reads: RECEIVING

     Kujan stares solemnly at the bulletin board, drinking from
     Rabin's coffee cup. Rabin sits at the desk, sifting through
     the mound of gapers as though considering organizing them
     once and for all.

                                  RAB IN

                Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive
                he'll never come up again.

                Man, you're a fucking slob.

     Kujan is not listening. He has been staring at the bulletin
     board, lost in thought, his unfocused eyes drifting across
     the mess of papers, not looking at anything at all.

147  EXT. STREET                                                         147

     Verbal steps out into the sunlight, putting on a pair of
     cheap sunglasses. He looks up and down the crowded street.
     People on their way to and from lunch, no doubt.

     Cars choke the street in front of the police department as
     they wait for pedestrians to clear the way.

148  INT. DISPATCHER'S OFFICE                                    - 148

     A single sheet of paper comes out of the fax machine, face
     down.

     Kujan still stares at the bulletin board.

     SUDDENLY, Kujan's face changes. He leans in closer to the
     bulletin board and squints his eyes. His face changes again.

     First a look of puzzlement, then confusion - finally
     realization.

     The coffee cup tumbles from his hand. It hits the floor with
     the SMASH of cheap porcelain. Coffee splatters everywhere.

     Rabin snaps out of his droning and looks up in surprise.

     KUJAN'S P.O.V.

     Kujan is staring not at what is on the bulletin board, but at
     the bulletin board itself.

     His eyes follow the aluminum frame, mounted firmly to the
     wall. One might note it's sturdy construction and it's
     convenient size. Big enough to hold a lifetime of forgotten
     and disregarded notes and facts. Years of police trivia that
     has been hung and forgotten with the intention of finding a
     use for it all someday. One might want such a bulletin board
     for one's self. One would look to see who makes such a               
     bulletin board.
     Kujan's eyes are locked on a metal plate bearing the
     manufacturer's name.

      It reads: QUARTET - SKOKIE, ILLINOIS
      Kujan's eyes flash all' over the bulletin board. He finds a
      picture of Rabin in the far corner. He stands beside a scale
      in fishing gear. He proudly holds a hand out to his freshly
      caught marlin. His eyes skim quickly over and stop on an
      eight and a half by eleven inch fax sheet of what must be a
      THREE HUNDRED POUND BLACK MAN. Kujan glazes over his name, it
      is irrelevant. His aliases stand out.

      Slavin, BRICKS, Shank, REDFOOT, Thee, Rooster...

      KUJAN'S EYES WIDEN with sudden realization. He runs for the
      door.

      His foot crushes the broken pieces of Rabin's coffee cup. The
      cup that hovered over Verbal's head for two hours.

      Kujan is in too much of a hurry to notice the two words
      printed on the jagged piece that had been the bottom of the
      cheap mug.

      Kujan is sprinting wildly down the hall for the stairs.

      Verbal looks behind him and sees ANOTHER COP standing just          
      inside the doorway, lighting a cigarette. The cop notices
      Verbal and watches him in the way that cops look at people
      they cannot place in the category of idiot citizen, or stupid
      criminal.

      Verbal smiles politely, meekly at the cop and walks down the
      steps into the moving throng.

      Kujan runs up to the desk where Verbal had only moments
      before picked up his belongings. Rabin is right behind him, a
      look of absolute confusion on his face.

                                   KUJAN

     The cog gestures towards the door.

     Kujan runs outside looking around frantically.

     Verbal limps his way carefully across the sidewalk, avoiding
     people as best as he can.

     He looks over his shoulder, getting farther away from the
     police station. He can see Rabin and the cop on the steps,
     looking around with strange, lost expressions on their faces.

     He does not notice the car creeping along the curb beside
     him.

     LOW ANGLE on the feet of dozens of people.
     Verbal's feet emerge from the crowd on the far side. They
     hobble along the curb.

     SUDDENLY, the right foot seems to relax a little, the inward
     angle straightens itself out in a few paces and the limp
     ceases as though the leg has grown another inch.

     CRANE UP VERBAL'S BODY

     Verbal's hands are rummaging around in his pockets. The good
     left hand comes up with a pack of cigarettes, the bad right
     hand comes up with a lighter. The right hand flexes with all

           clasp on the antique lighter with the thumb, striking the
           flint with the index finger. It is a fluid motion, somewhat
           showy.

           Verbal lights a cigarette and smiles to himself. He turns and
           sees the car running alongside.

           Jack Beer pulls the sheet out of the fax machine and turns it
           over, revealing the composite sketch of Keyser SOZE.                  

           Though crude and distorted, one cannot help but notice how
           much it leaks like VERBAL KINT.

           The car stops. The driver gets out.
           IT IS KOBAYASHI, or the man we have come to know as such. He
           smiles to Verbal. Verbal steps off of the curb, returning the
           smile as he opens the passenger door and gets in.

           The man called Kobayashi gets in the driver's seat and pulls
           away .
           A moment later, Agent David Kujan of U.S. Customs wanders
           into the frame, looking around much in the way a child would
           when lost at the circus. He takes no notice of the car
           pulling out into traffic, blending in with the rest of the
           cars filled with people on their way back to work.

SCRIPT DATE 5/25/94


1 -BLACK

     The lonely sound of a buoy bell in the distance. Water
     slapping against a smooth, flat surface in rhythm. The
     creaking of wood.

     Off in the very far distance, one can make out the sound of
     sirens.

     SUDDENLY, a single match ignites and invades the darkness. It
     quivers for a moment. A dimly lit hand brings the rest of the
     pack to the match. A plume of yellow-white flame flares and
     illuminates the battered face of DEAN KEATON, age forty. His
     salty-gray hair is wet and matted. His face drips with water
     or sweat. A large cut runs the length of his face from the
     corner of his eye to his chin. It bleeds freely. An un-lit
     cigarette hangs in the corner of his mouth.

     In the half-light we can make out that he is on the deck of a
     large boat. A yacht, perhaps, or a small freighter. He sits
     with his back against the front bulkhead of the wheel house.
     His legs are twisted at odd, almost impossible angles. He
     looks down.

     A thin trail of liquid runs past his feet and off into the
     darkness. Keaton lights the cigarette on the burning pack of
     matches before throwing them into the liquid.

     The liquid IGNITES with a poof.

     The flame runs up the stream, gaining in speed and intensity.
     It begins to ripple and rumble as it runs down the deck
     towards the stern.                                                       

2     EXT. BOAT - NIGHT - STERN                                             2'

     A stack of oil drums rests on the stern. They are stacked on
     a palette with ropes at each corner that attach it to a huge
     crane on the dock. One of the barrels has been punctured at
     it's base. Gasoline trickles freely from the hole.

     The flame is racing now towards the barrels. Keaton smiles
     weakly to himself.

     The flame is within a few yards of the barrels when another
     stream of liquid splashes onto the gas. The flame fizzles out
     pitifully with a hiss.

     Two feet straddle the flame. A stream of urine flows onto the
     deck from between them.

                                            BLUE 06/01/94

                                                               2.

The sound of a fly zipping. Follow the feet as they move over
to where Keaton rests at the wheel house.

CRANE UP to the waist of the unknown man. He pulls a pack of
cigarettes out of one pocket and a strange antique lighter
from the other. It is gold, with a clasp that folds down over
the flint. The man flicks up the clasp with his thumb and
strikes it with his index finger. It is a fluid motion,

somewhat showy.
Keaton looks up at the man. A look of realization crosses his
face. It is followed by frustration, anger, and finally
resignation.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           How are you, Keaton?

                             KEATON
           I'd have to say my spine was broken,
           Keyser.

He spits the name out like it was poison.

The man puts the lighter back in his pocket and reaches under
his jacket. He produces a stainless .38 revolver.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           Ready?

                             KEATON
           What time is it?

The hand with the gun turns over, turning the gold watch on
its wrist upward.
The sound of sirens is closer now. Headed this way.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           Twelve thirty.

Keaton grimaces bitterly and nods. He turns his head away and
takes another drag.
The hand with the gun waits long enough for Keaton to enjoy  
his last drag before pulling the trigger.

GUNSHOT

The sound of Keaton's body slumping onto the deck.

                                                             3.

MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DECK. Below is the stream of gasoline
still flowing freely.

The sound of the gasoline igniting. The flame runs in front
of us towards the barrels, finally leaping up in a circle
around the drums, burning the wood of the pallet and licking
the spouting stream as it pours from the hole.

MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DOCK, away from the boat.

The pier to which the boat is moored is littered with DEAD
BODIES. Twenty or more men have been shot to pieces and lie
scattered everywhere in what can only be the aftermath of a
fierce fire-fight.

A BARGE COMES INTO VIEW.                                             

On the deck of the barge is a tangle of cables and girders.          
The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon           
beneath its base.                                                    

MOVE INTO THE DARKNESS.

Sirens are close now. Almost here. The sound of fire raging
out of control.

SIRENS BLARING. TIRES SQUEALING. CAR DOORS OPENING. FEET
POUNDING THE PAVEMENT.

MOVE FURTHER, SLOWER, INTO THE DARKNESS

Voices yelling. New light flickering in the surrounding
darkness.

SUDDENLY, AN EXPLOSION.

Then silence. TOTAL BLACKNESS.

We hear the voice of ROGER "VERBAL" KINT, whom we will soon
meet.

                         VERBAL (V.O.)
           New York. - six weeks ago. A truck loaded
           with stripped gun parts got jacked
           outside of Queens. The driver didn't see
           anybody, but somebody fucked up. He heard
           a voice. Sometimes, that's all you need.

3     INT. DARK APARTMENT - DAY - NEW YORK - SIX WEEKS PRIOR TO
      PRESENT DAY

      The black explodes with the opening of a door into a dark
      room. Outside, the hall is filled with blinding white light.
      Shadows in the shapes of men flood into the room. We can make
      out men in hoods with flashlights. They are laden with
      weapons.

      It is a blur of violent action and sound.'Beams of
      flashlights cut the darkness in all directions.

      FINALLY:

      A dozen flashlights land on one man. He lies naked in bed,
      Merging from a deep sleep. He squints at the flood of
      blinding white light, more annoyed than frightened. He nearly
      laughs at the sound of countless guns cocking. He is
      McMANUS. Age twenty-eight.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                 Mr. McManus?

                                  McMANUS

      bed.

      An old paint mixer vibrates furiously.
      TODD HOCKNEY, a dark, portly man in his thirties is working
      on an old Fire-bird.

S     EXT. STREET - NEW YORK - DAY

      FRED FENSTER, a tall, thin man in his thirties strolls
      casually down the street. He is dressed conspicuously in a
      loud suit and tie with shoes that have no hope of matching.
      He smokes a cigarette and chews gum at the same time.

      He happens to glance over his shoulder and notice a brown
      Ford sedan with four men in it cruising along the curb. He
      picks up his step a little. The Ford keeps up.

      He looks ahead at the corner. He tries to look as comfortable
      as he can, checking his watch as though remembering an
      appointment he is late for. The Ford stays right on him.

      SUDDENLY, he bolts. He gets no more than a few yards before
      cars pour out of every conceivable nook and cranny. Brakes
      are squealing, radios squawking, guns cocking. Fenster is
      surrounded instantly. He stops short and flaps his hands on
      his thighs in defeat.

6     INT. MONDINO'S RESTAURANT - DAY

      An attractive man and woman walk quickly through the front of
      a small New York cafe. They are charged with nervous, excited
      energy.

The man is DEAN KEATON, a well dressed, sturdy looking man in
his forties with slightly graying hair. He looks much better
than he did in the opening scene. The woman with him is EDIE
FINNERAN, age thirty-three, poised and attractive - Easily
the calmer of the two.

     They come to a staircase at the back of the restaurant
     leading down to a dark room. Edie takes Keaton's arm and
     stops him.

                                  EDIE
                Let me look at you.

     Keaton is uncomfortable in his suit, or perhaps the
     situation. Still, he smiles with genuine warmth.

     Edie straightens his tie and picks microscopic imperfections
     from his lapel.

                              EDIE (CONT'D)
                Now remember, this is another kind of
                business. They don't earn your respect.
                You owe it to them. Don't stare them down
                but don't look away either. Confidence.
                They are fools not to trust you. That's
                the attitude.

                                 KEATON
                I'm having a stroke.

                                   EDIE
                You've come far. You're a good man. I
                love you.

     Keaton blinks then stammers, looking for a response.
     PAUSE

                Live with it.

     She kisses him and runs down the steps with Keaton close
     behind. Keaton playfully grabs her ass and she nearly
     stumbles down the stairs.

7     INT. RESTAURANT - DOWNSTAIRS

     They come to the bottom of the steps giggling and jabbing
     each other. Once off the stairs they instantly transform as
     though hit with cold air. They assume a cool, professional
     exterior and walk two feet apart. One would look at them and
     see only two business associates here to ply their trade.

     They walk across the dimly lit dining room to a table in the
     far corner where two men are already waiting. The first is
     MR. FORTIER, age thirty-five, the other is MR. RENAULT, age  

     sixty. Both men are impeccably dressed with a distinguished
     air. They stand and smile.

                 Monsieur Fortier. So nice to finally meet

     Everyone sits at the table. All faces are smiling.
     LOW ANGLE: UNDER TABLE
     Edie's hand reaches out and finds Keaton's leg. Her hand runs
     high up his inner thigh and squeezes firmly.

     Her face is absolutely calm, giving no hint of what her hand
     is doing. Keaton smiles and clears his throat.

                Edie brought us your proposal and I'll be                  


                honest. We're very impressed. A bit                       
                skeptical, I must admit, but impressed.

                Skeptical.
                                 RENAULT
                We find the concept brilliant, but New

                How can we be certain that our money will                  
                be returned in the long run?
     Keaton looks at Edie and smiles confidently.
                                 KEATON
                It's simple gentlemen, design

                versatility. A restaurant that can change                  
                with taste without losing the overall

                aesthetic. Our atmosphere won't be

                This was the part of the proposal that
                intrigued us, but I'm not sure I follow.

                Let's say for example -

                This I had to see myself.

     Keaton looks up. He sees David Kujan. Behind him are the very
     serious looking guys in suits.

     Keaton is not happy to see them.

                                 KEATON
                Dave. I'm in a meeting.

                                  KUJAN
                Time for another one.

                                   KEATON
                 This is my attorney, Edie Finneran.

                        KEATON (cont'd)
           This is Mr. Renault and Mr. Fortier.
           Everyone, this is David Kujan.

                             KUJAN
           Special Agent Kujan. U.S. Customs.
                 (Gestures to men behind him)
           These gentlemen are with the New York
           police department. You look great,
           Keaton. Better than I would have thought.

                            RENAULT
           Is there a problem, Mr. Keaton?

                             KUJAN
           The small matter of a stolen truck-load
           of guns that wound up on a boat to
           Ireland last night.

Renault and Fortier's confusion is giving way to suspicion.

                            FORTIER
           Mr. Keaton?

                             KEATON
           If you will excuse us for a moment,
           gentlemen.

                             KUJAN
           We need to ask you some questions
           downtown. You'll be quite awhile.

Renault starts to get up.

                            RENAULT
           We should leave you to discuss whatever
           this is.

                            KEATON
           Please. Sit.

Keaton stands up and throws a wad of money on the table to
cover the check. He looks at Edie. She moves to stand, but he
sits her back down with a hand on her shoulder.

                            KEATON
           Enjoy the meal.
                           (To Edie)
           I'LL call you.

Kujan takes him by the arm, but Keaton yanks away.

      He looks out over the dozens of other faces in the
      restaurant. Everyone is looking at him with some level of
      surprise. If Keaton is humiliated by the whole affair, he
      hides it well.

11    INT. LOCK-UP HALLWAY - NIGHT                                        11'

      A police officer steps into the frame and opens the steel
      door.

      FOLLOW A PAIR OF FEET as they shuffle across the cement
      floor. The shoes are shabby and worn, as are the wrinkled
      pants that hang too low and loose at the cuffs. The right
      foot is turned slightly inward and falls with a hard limp. It
      is clear that the knee does not extend fully.

      The sound of a steel door opening. The bottom corner of a
      steel cage comes into view. Another set of feet falls into
      step with the first. Another steel door and another set of
      feet. Another door, another and another. Five pairs of feet
      walk single file down the hall.

      The lame feet are in the front of the line. They come to
      another steel door, this one solid and covered with dents and
      rivets.

      CRANE UP TO REVEAL:

      ROGER KINT, VERBAL to his few friends. He has a deeply lined
      face, making his thirty-odd years a good guess at best. From
      his twisted left hand, we can see that he suffers from a
      slight but not debilitating palsy. Behind him are Dean
      Keaton, Fred Fenster, McManus and Todd Hockney.                      t

      Verbal steps through the door, followed by the rest.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                It didn't make sense that I be there. I
                mean these guys were hard-core hijackers,
                but there I was. At that point, I wasn't
                scared, f knew I hadn't done anything
                they could do me for. Besides, it was
                fun. I got to make like I was notorious.

12    INT. LINE-UP ROOM                                                   12

      The five men are ushered into the room in front of a white
      wall painted with horizontal blue stripes. Each has a number
      at either end to denote the height of the man in front of it.
      Between these lines are thinner blue lines to tell the
      specific height in inches.

Bright lights shine on all of them. They squint, eyes
adjusting.

Keaton leans forward a bit and looks at the men in line with
him. He shares a look of familiarity with Fenster and then
McManus. Hockney smiles at all of them.

                            McMANUS
                          (To Keaton)
           Where you been, man?

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           SHUT UP IN THERE. Alright, you all know
           the drill. When your number is called,
           step forward and repeat the phrase you've
           been given. Understand?

The men all nod.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           Number one. Step forward.

Hockney takes a step forward. He looks directly into a mirror
on the other side of the room. It is three feet square and we
can make out faint light behind it. It is a two-way. He
speaks in a complete dead-pan.

                            HOCKNEY
           Hand-me-the-keys, you-fucking-cock-
           sucker.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           Number two. Step forward.

McManus steps up and makes a gun with his thumb and
forefinger. He mocks criminal intensity, pointing at the
mirror. He camps up his line.

                            McMANUS
           Give me the keys, you motherfucking,
           cocksucking pile of shit, or I'll rip off
           your

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           KNOCK IT OFF. Get back in line.

McManus steps back.

The rest of the men do their bit as Verbal speaks.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                It was bullshit. The whole rap was a
                setup. Everything is the cops' fault. You
                don't put guys like that in a room
                together. Who knows what can happen?

     McManus sits in a chair in front of a white wall. He smiles
     at someone off-screen.

                pension. A small pension, mind you,

                off and the cops had nothing. They were
                hoping somebody would slip. Give them
                something to go on. They knew we wouldn't
                fight it because they knew how to lean on
                us. They'd been doing it forever. Our
                rights went right out the window. It was
                a violation. I mean disgraceful.

                            HOCKNEY (CONT'D)
                 I know you. You don't think I know
                 you're on the take. This whole fucking
                 precinct is dirty. You don't have a
                 fucking leg to stand on.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                 Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with
                 explosives. Mean as a snake when it
                 mattered .

                              VOICE (O.S.)
                 You think so, tough guy? I can put you in
                 Queens the day of the hijacking.

                                  HOCKNEY
                 I live in Queens. What the fuck is this?
                 You come into my store and lock me up in
                 front of my customers. What the hell is
                 wrong with this country? Are you guys
                 gonna charge me or what?

                              VOICE (O.S.)
                 You know what happens if you do another
                 turn in the joint?

                                  HOCKNEY
                 I'll fuck your father in the shower.
                 Charge me, dick-head.

     Now Keaton sits in the chair, cool and indifferent.
                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                 Keaton was the real prize for them, for
                 obvious reasons.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                 I'll charge you when I'm ready.

                You know damn well, dead-man.

                                KEATON
                Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did
                you ever think to ask me? I've been

                             KEATON (cont'd)
                walking around with the same face, same
                name - I'm a businessman, fellas.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                What's that? The restaurant business? Not
                anymore From now on you're in the
                getting-fucked-by-us business . I'm gonna
                make you famous, cocksucker.

     Keaton shows just a flicker of contempt. The threat has hit
     home.

                                  KEATON
                Like I said. It was all your mistake.
                Charge me with it and I'll beat it. Let's
                get back to the truck.

     A FIST flies into the frame and connects with Keaton's jaw.
     His head snaps back, blood flowing freely from his mouth.

     Keaton is brought in to a holding where he joins Fenster,
     Hockney, Verbal and McManus. He sits in a corner and keeps to
     himself.

     Fenster is in mid-tirade.

                                  FENSTER
                Somebody should do something. What is
                this shit - getting hauled in every five                   
                minutes? Okay, so I did a little time,                    
                does that mean I get railed every time a
                truck finds its way off the planet?

     McManus is silently staring at Keaton, who sits on a bench,
     looking away.

                                  HOCKNEY
                These guys got no probable cause.

           screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right.
           You do some time, they never let you go.
           Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a
           criminal.

                            HOCKNEY
           You are a criminal.

                            FENSTER
           Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying
           to make a point.

                            KEATON
           Then make it. Christ, you're making me
           tired all over.

McManus looks at Keaton.


                            McMANUS
           I heard you were dead, Keaton.                              

                            KEATON
           You heard right.

                            HOCKNEY
           The word I got is you hung up your spurs,
           man. What's that all  about?

                            McMANUS  
           What's this?

                            HOCKNEY
           Rumor has it, Keaton's gone straight -
           cleaning house. I hear he's tapping Edie
           Finneran.

                            McMANUS  
           Who?  

                            HOCKNEY
           She's a heavy-weight criminal lawyer from
           uptown. Big-time connected. She could
           erase Dillinger's record if she tried. I
           hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.
                          (To Keaton)
           Is it true?


                            McMANUS
        What about it, Keaton? You a lawyer's 
        wife. What sort of "retainer" you giving
        her?

Keaton shoots McManus a fiery glare.
                            FENSTER
           I'd say you've gotten on his main and
           central nerve, McManus.

                            KEATON
           Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him
           quiet .

                            McMANUS  
           You're clean, Keaton? Say it ain't so.
           Was it you that hit that truck?

                            FENSTER  
           Forget him. It's not important. I was
           trying to make a point.

                            KEATON
                      (Ignoring McManus)
           This whole thing was a shakedown.

                            McMANUS
           What makes you say that?

                            KEATON
           How many times have you been in a line-
           up? It's always you and four dummies. The                  
           P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head
           half the time. No way they'd line five
           felons in the same row. No way. And what
           the hell is a voice line-.up? A public
           defender could get you off of that.

                            FENSTER
           So why the hell was I hauled in and
           cavity searched tonight?

                            KEATON
           It was the Feds. A truck load of guns
           gets snagged, Customs comes down on
           N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up
           with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's
           politics - nothing you can do.

                            FENSTER
           I had a guy's fingers in my asshole
           tonight.

         HOCKNEY

                            FENSTER
           Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So
           who did it? Own up.

                            KEATON
           I don't want to know.

                            McMANUS  
           Nobody asked you, workin'-man.

                            HOCKNEY
           Fuck who did it. What I want to know is,
           who's the gimp?

ALL EYES suddenly turn on Verbal. He has been quietly
listening the whole time without uttering a word.

                             KEATON
           He's alright.

                            HOCKNEY
           How do I know that? How about it,
           pretzel-man? What's your story?

                            KEATON
           His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you
           guys knew him.

                            McMANUS
           Verbal?

                            VERBAL
           Roger really. People say I talk too much.

                            HOCKNEY
           Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.

                            KEATON
           We've met once or twice. Last time was
           in...

                             VERBAL
           County. I was in for fraud.

                            KEATON
           You were waiting for a line-up then, too.
           What happened with that?

                            VERBAL
        I walked. Ninety days, suspended.

                             HOCKNEY
            So you did it?


                             VERBAL
            To your mother's ass.

 Verbal looks away from Hockney, awaiting a violent response.
 Everyone slowly starts to laugh. Hockney looks as if he is
 about to boil in his own skin.

                              KEATON
                          (To Hockney)
            Let it go.

 Verbal smiles at Keaton appreciatively.

 McManus stands and walks to the toilet in the corner of
 the cell. He starts taking a leak;

                              McMANUS
            Look, we've all been put out by this, I
            figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage
            a little dignity. Now Fenster and I got
            wind of a possible job -

                              KEATON
            Why don't you just calm down'

                             HOCKNEY
            What do you care what he says?

                             McMANUS
           Yeah, I'm just talking here, and Hockney
           seems to want to hear me out. I know
           Fenster is with me -
                           (To Verbal)
           How about you, guy?

McManus finishes pissing.


                            VERBAL
           I'm interested, sure.


                             McMANUS
           There, so you see, I'm going to exercise
           my right to free assembly.

McManus taps the bars of his cell and the others LAUGH.

                              KEATON

                 Dean Keaton, gone the high road. What is
                 the world coming to?

     McManus and Keaton stare at one another for a long and tense
     moment. Finally McManus turns to the others.

                             McMANUS (CONT'D)
                 Forget him then.

                 Now I can't talk about this here in any
                 detail, but listen up...

     Everyone but Keaton gravitates toward McManus's cell as he
     begins to speak in low, hushed tones.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                 And that was how it began. The five of us
                 brought in on a trumped-up charge to be
                 leaned on by half-wits. What the cops
                 never figured out, and what I know now,
                 was that these men would never break,
                 never lie down, never bend over for
                 anybody. .. Anybody.

19    EXT. PIER - DAY - SAN PEDRO - PRESENT DAY                          19
     It is morning in the aftermath of the opening scene.
     Harsh sunlight shines on a line of body bags on the dock.

     Police swarm everywhere, photographers are taking pictures of
     the scene while a team of men in rolled up sleeves and
     plastic gloves pick at the remains.

     Two men on a fire boat operate a water cannon, dousing the
     smoldering remains of a burned-out ships hull.

     Watching this from the edge of the pier is a man in a dark
     suit. He is SPECIAL AGENT JACK BAER of the F.B.I. He is tall
     and fit, in his late thirties. He gazes out over the water
     thoughtfully.

A UNIFORM COP trots up to him.
                              COP
           Who are you?


Baer holds up his badge without looking at the man.

                              BAER
           Agent Jack Baer, F.B.I. How many dead?

Before the cop can answer, Baer turns and walks along the
line of body bags.

                              COP
           Fifteen so far. We're still pulling some
           bodies out of the water.

Baer eyes the corpses on the dock, burned beyond recognition.

                              COP
           Looking for anyone in particular?

Baer looks at the cop for the first time, unamused.

                              BAER
           f don't want any of the bodies taken away
           until I've had a chance to go over this,
           understood?

                              COP
           I have to clear the scene. I've got word
           direct from the Chief

Baer lights a cigarette, only half listening.

                              BAER
                         (Unimpressed)
           Yes, the chief. Spooky stuff. Any
           survivors?

                              COP
           Two. There's a guy in county hospital,
           but he's in a coma. The D.A. has the
           other guy - A cripple - from New York I
           think. Listen, the Chief said -

                              BAER
           Excuse me.

Baer walks away from the cop, ignoring him completely. He
wanders through the carnage on the pier.

     A half mile out from the pier.

     The sea is choppy, stirred by the wind. An object floats into
     view a few feet away, bobbing in the water.

     It is A DEAD BODY - a man, face down, wearing a CHECKERED
     BATHROBE. He drifts quietly toward the open ocean.

21    INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY - LOS ANGELES PRESENT                      2: 

     Verbal Kint sits in a chair in front of a microphone attached
     to a tape recorder, his brow beaded with sweat.

     On the wall behind him is the seal of the STATE OF CALIFORNIA

     He is cleaner, better kept, in a well-cut suit and neatly
     trimmed hair. He looks older than he did in New York - worn
     down.

     A flurry of voices banter off screen. Verbal's eyes follow
     the voices back and forth.

                May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your
                political power as much as I respect it.
                I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many
                faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't
                care. The embarrassment he helped cause

           Then prosecute. I will be very impressed
           to see if the District Attorney manages
           to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous
           counts of murder against one man with
           cerebral palsy. I would think a man with
           your job would agree with these alleged

           One would think the counsel is veiling a

     David Kujan is walking quickly beside SERGEANT RABIN, a dark
     and weathered looking man in his late thirties. They move up
     a staircase into the heart of police headquarters.

                                  KUJAN
                What do you mean I can't see him?

                                  RAB IN
                The D.A. came down here last night ready
                to arraign before they even moved him to
                county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five
                minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking
                like he'd been bitch-slapped by the
                boogey man. They took his statement and
                cut him a deal.

                                  KUJAN
                Did they charge him with anything?

                What'the fuck is that?

     Rabin motions for Kujan to lower his voice. He points out
     that they are walking through a bullpen filled with desks
     where a number of other police are working within earshot.

                                  RABIN
                I give the D.A. credit for getting that
                much to stick. This whole thing has
                turned political. The Mayor was here -
                the chief - the Governor called this

                             KUJAN
           I want to see him.

Rabin comes to an office door with his name on it. He opens
it and lets Kujan in before following.

                Dave, please.                                            

     Rabin's office can only be described as a disaster area. The        
     desk is cluttered with weeks, perhaps months or even years of       
     paperwork that could never conceivably be sorted out.               

     Above his desk is a bulletin board. It is a breathtaking
     catastrophe of papers, wanted posters, rap-sheets, memos and +
     post-its. This is in the neighborhood of decades. Rabin is a
     man with a system so cryptic, so far beyond the comprehension       
     of others, he himself is most likely baffled by it.

                won't talk to you. He's paranoid about

     all is the as yet unnamed ARKOSH KOVASH, mid-thirties. His
     body is nearly mummified in bandages and plaster from waist
     to chin.


     BOLD IS OVERLAPPED:                                                


                                  KOVASH                                s
                 <<Are you the police? I need the
                 police. He'll find out I'm here and                      
                 he'll kill me. I need the police. I
                 will tell them anything they want to
                 know. Please, I am going to be

                                   BAER
                 will he die?

                                  PLUMBER
                 There's a chance.

     Baer walks over to Rovash and kneels down on the bed beside
     him.

     He looks closely at his battered and scalded face. He listens
     to him far a moment. Kovash goes on incessantly.

                                  KOVASH
                 <<Find someone who understands me,
                 you idiot, I'm going to be killed,                     
                 You'll all be killed if he has to do
                 it. Help me, God. They're all stupid.
                 Get someone who understands me or
                 we're all going to die.>>

Baer pulls a cellular phone out of his jacket and dials.
                             BAER
           Call hospital security and put a man on
           the door until the police get here.

                            KOVASH
           <<Why are you just standing there,
           you idiot? I'm not speaking English
           am I? Wouldn't it make sense to find
           someone who could talk to me so you
           could find the person that set me on

           understand that? Keyser Soze. The

                                                                31.

Ridgly runs out of the room. Kovash babbles louder and
louder, trying to get Baer's attention. Baer sticks a finger
in one ear to block him out and hear the phone.

                            PLUMBER
           Is he dangerous?

                             BAER
           Yes.

Someone picks up on the other end of the phone.

                         BAER (CONT'D)
           Joel, it's Baer. I'm down at L.A. county.
           The guy they pulled out of the harbor is
           ARKOSH Kovash... Yes, I'm sure... No,
           he's all fucked up... What? I can't hear
           you.
                          (To Arkosh)
           Shut up, Hugo, I'm on the phone.
                         (Into Phone)
           Yes... No... Not until I put someone on
           him. Listen, I need you to send me
           someone who can speak Hungarian. He's
           awake and talking like a Thai hooker...
           How should I know? Get me someone who can
           talk to him -

Baer is suddenly distracted by something Kovash has said. In
the middle of a long string of unintelligible dialect, he has
spouted two words that have gotten Baer's attention.

He turns and looks down at the tattered man in the bed.
Kovash realizes Baer is listening and says the two words
again.

                             KOVASH
           Keyser - Soze.                                               

                              BAER
           What?

He waves his hand, gesturing for Kovash to say it again.

                            KOVASH
           Keyser - Soze.

                              BAER
           No shit?

           Joel, call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice

2     INT. HALLWAY - POLICE STATION                                       26

      Rabin walks out of a small room. Behind him, we catch a
      glimpse of a workroom with a bench covered with wires.

      Kujan comes out a moment later, gently fixing his tie.

      Rabin opens the door to his office and Kujan enters. Rabin 
      follows, looking up and down the hall before closing the door
      behind them.

      As the door closes we can just make out the back of Verbal's
      head. He is seated in Rabin's office, smoking a cigarette.

      Kujan and Rabin sit down across from Verbal.

                               (Exasperated)
                 Verbal, you know we're trying to help
                 you.

                                   VERBAL
                 Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want
                 to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I
                 would have liked to have been a Fed
                 myself but my C.P. was -

                                   KUJAN
                 Verbal, I know you know something. I know
                 you're not telling us everything.

                                   VERBAL
                 I told the D.A. everything I know.

                                                                            28
28    INT. WORKSHOP

     Rabin stands over LOUIS, a messy looking technician at his
     workbench in a room full of electronic equipment. He adjusts
     several dials on a receiver until the voices of Kujan and
     Verbal come clearly through a tinny speaker on the wall.
     Rabin reaches over for a nearby pot of coffee.

                               KUJAN (VOICE)
                 I know you liked Keaton I know you think
                 he was a good man.

                              VERBAL (VOICE)
                 I know he was good.

                              KUJAN (VOICE)
                 He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.

                                  VERBAL
                 Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a
                 good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let
                 him go legit.

                                   KUJAN
                 Keaton was a piece of shit.


                                  VERBAL
                 You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent

                             VERBAL
            It's right here.


 He taps a finger on the stack of paper that Kujan brought in.
 Kujan picks it up and thumbs through it.

                              KUJAN
            According to your statement you are a
            short-con operator. Run of the mill
            seams. Everything you do, you learned
            from somebody else.

                              VERBAL
            That's been suppressed. Anything in there
            is inadmissible.

                              KUJAN
            Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total
            immunity .

                              VERBAL
                           (laughing)
            Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm
            looking at six whole months hard time.

                              KUJAN
                           (smiling)
            You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer,
            Verbal?

                             VERBAL
            You know a religious guy named John Paul?

                              KUJAN
            You know Ruby is in Attica? 

                       VERBAL
           He didn't have my lawyer.

                              KUJAN
           I know Ruby. He's very big on respect.
           Likes me very much.

Verbal sees this getting to something. His smiles fades.

                        KUJAN (CONT'D)
           Now I know your testimony was sealed.
           Ruby is well connected. He still has
           people running errands for him. What do
           you think he'd say if he found out you
           dropped his name to the D.A.?

                             VERBAL
           There's nothing in there about Ruby.

                             KUJAN
           I'11 be sure to mention that to him.

Verbal is not smiling anymore. He stares at Kujan with utter
contempt, knowing he is being shafted.

                         KUJAN (CONT'D)
           The first thing I learned on the job,
           know what it was? How to spot a murderer.
           Let's say you arrest three guys for the
           same killing. Put them all in jail
           overnight. The next morning, whoever is
           sleeping is your man. If you're guilty,
           you know you're caught, you get some rest
           - let your guard down, you follow?

                            VERBAL
           No.

                             KUJAN
           I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter
           than you. I'11 find out what I want to
           know and I'11 get it from you whether you
           like it or not.

                            VERBAL
           I'm not a rat.

Kujan puts his hand on the transcript of Verbal's confession.
Rabin walks in with a cup of coffee. Verbal takes it with his
good hand and sips it with a relish.

                         VERBAL (CONT'D)
           Ahhh. Back when I was picking beans in
           Guatemala we used to make fresh coffee.
           Right off the trees I mean. That was
           good. This is shit, but hey...

                             RAB IN
           Can we get started again?

                             KUJAN
           Now what happened after the line-up?

Verbal sneers at Kujan, unable to change the subject.

30    EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT - NEW YORK - SIX WEEKS PRIOR         30

     Keaton stops at the top of the front steps of the police
     station and lights a cigarette. Edie comes out behind him,
     fuming mad.

                                   EDIE
                ...and the desk Sergeant is actually
                trying to tell me he can't release you?
                Can you believe that? You weren't even
                charged. New York police - Jesus. I want
                to take pictures of your face to bring to
                the D.A. first thing in the morning.

                                 KEATON
                Just forget about it.

     He looks across the street and sees Fenster and McManus
     talking by a newsstand. McManus is thumbing through
     magazines.

                                   EDIE
                Absolutely not.

     Keaton looks to his right and sees Hockney trying to hail a
     cab.

                              EDIE (CONT'D)
                I'11 have this thing in front of a grand
                jury by Monday.

                                  KEATON
                Edie, please. I don't want to hear this
                right now. What did Renault and Fortier                    
                say?

                                   EDIE
                They want more time to think about
                investing.

                                  KEATON
                Goddamnit.

                                   EDIE
                They just said they wanted time.

                                   KEATON
                Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me
                a little more, that's what. No matter how
                well you cover my tracks now, they'll
                find out who I am.

                              EDIE
           Give me some credit. I got you this far,
           let's go to the grand jury. This is never
           going to stop if we -

                             KEATON
           No. It's never going to stop, period. It
           won't take more than a week before every
           investor in this city is walking away
           from us. It's finished. I'm finished.

Just then, Verbal bumps into him on his way out the door. He
excuses himself and hobbles down the steps, oblivious to who
he has bumped into as he tries to navigate the stairs.

                              EDIE
           Don't give up on me now, Dean.

                            KEATON
           They'll never stop.

                             EDIE
           I love you.

                             KEATON
                          (To himself)
           They ruined me tonight.

                              EDIE
           Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?

Verbal gets to the sidewalk and stops. He turns, realizing it
is Keaton on the steps.

                         EDIE (CONT'D)
           Let's just go to my place. We'll worry
           about this tomorrow.

Keaton and Verbal look at one another for a moment. Keaton
then looks over to the newsstand and sees Fenster looking at
him.

                            KEATON
           Huh?

McManus notices Fenster and glances up from his magazine to
see what he is looking at.                                             +

                              EDIE
           Come home with me, please. Dean?

      Keaton looks at Hockney who has one foot in a cab. He is
      looking at Fenster and McManus who are looking at Keaton.
      This makes Hockney look up at Keaton as well.

      SUDDENLY, Edie tunes in to what is going on. She notices the
      others on the street. She reaches over and takes Keaton by
      the arm, pulling gently. She glares at the others.

                                   EDIE
                Come home, Dean.

                                  KEATON
                                (Distant)
                Alright.

      Verbal looks at everyone else from where he stands on the
      street. Fenster, McManus and Hockney all look at him and then
      at each other. It is a strange moment of unspoken
      understanding.

      All eyes finally turn to Keaton, high on the front steps of
      the police station as he walks away with Edie.

31    INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                                   31

      Verbal stands in front of an apartment door. He hesitates for
      a long moment before he knocks.

      After a moment, the door opens and Keaton stands on the other
      side of it. He is wearing a bathrobe and smoking a cigarette.

      He looks at Verbal without any expression whatsoever.

                                  KEATON
                What are you doing here'! How did you find
                me?


                                  VERBAL
                I just asked one of the detectives
                downtown. He seemed pretty happy to tell

                me.
      Keaton curses under his breath and motions for Verbal to come
      in.
                                                                            32
32    INT. EDIE'S APARTMENT


      Verbal walks in and sits down on the couch, watching Keaton
      cautiously. He looks around the large apartment, beautifully
      furnished and decorated.

Edie walks into the room in a man's button-down shirt and
sweat pants.

                             EDIE
           Dean, who was at the

She stops when she sees Verbal. Verbal stands and smiles
nervously.

                            VERBAL
           How do you do?

                             KEATON
           Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran.
           Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at

                              EDIE
                             (Cold)
           I know who he is.

                             VERBAL
           I hope I didn't disturb you.

                             EDIE
           I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you
           something to drink?

                             VERBAL
           A glass of water would be nice.

Edie shoots a look at Keaton on her way out of the room.
Keaton tries to hush his voice despite his anger.

                             KEATON
           What the hell do you want?

                             VERBAL
           I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -

                             KEATON
           I did you a favor by standing up for you
           last night, but don't think we're
           friends. I'm sorry, but I have other
           things -

                             VERBAL
           They're gonna do a job. Three million
           dollars, maybe more.

Keaton is speechless. Verbal sits on the couch again.

                        VERBAL (CONT'D)
           They sent me to offer you a cut. We could
           use a fifth man - a driver - That's all
           you'll do.

Edie walks in with a glass of ice water and hands it to
Verbal.

                       VERBAL (CONT'D)
           Thank you.

Verbal drinks slowly. Edie stands over him, her face blank.
It is an awkward moment. She deliberately makes Verbal
uncomfortable.

LONG PAUSE - FINALLY:


                              EDIE
           So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?

                            VERBAL
           Umm ...

                              EDIE
           A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something
           more creative?

                            KEATON
           That's enough, Edie.

                              EDIE
                             (Angry)
           I don't know what you came here for, but
           we won't have any part of it.

                            KEATON
           Edie, please.

Keaton takes Edie by the arm and tries to guide her toward
the other room. She pulls away, anger turning to rage.

                              EDIE
           I've spent the last year of my life
           putting his back together again - I won't
           have you come in here and - What makes
           you think - GET OUT. GET OUT OF m HOME.
           HOW DARE YOU COME HERE?

Keaton is pulling her now. She yanks her arm away and shoves
him.

                             EDIE
           Don't touch me. Just don't,

She turns and walks out of the room. Somewhere in the back of
the apartment, a door slams.

Keaton turns and glares at Verbal. Verbal cringes.

                            KEATON
           Get out.

                            VERBAL
           If you'll just let me -

SUDDENLY, KEATON LUNGES. He grabs Verbal by the lapels and
lifts him off the couch, moving him effortlessly across the
room and slamming him into the wall next to the front door.
He opens it.

                       VERBAL (CONT'D)
           Don't hurt me.

                             KEATON
                           (Seething)
           Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill
           you.

Keaton starts to shove Verbal out the door.


                             VERBAL
                           (Quickly)
           They're going to hit the Taxi Service.

Keaton freezes. LONG PAUSE.

           New York's Finest Taxi Service.


                             KEATON
           They - That's bullshit. They don't
           operate anymore.

                             VERBAL
           McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth
           Precinct. They're coming out for one job
           - Thursday. They're picking up a guy
           smuggling emeralds out of South America.
           Fenster and McManus have a fence set to

                            KEATON
           What fence? Who?

                             VERBAL
           Some guy in California. His name is
           Redfoot.

                            KEATON
           Never heard of him.

Keaton moves to throw Verbal out. Verbal grabs Keaton and
holds tight.

                            VERBAL
           You have to come.

                             KEATON
           What's with you? What do you care whether
           I come or not?


                             VERBAL
           They - They don't know me. You do. They
           won't take me unless you go. Look at me.
           I need this.

                            KEATON
           Tough break.

                             VERBAL
           Don't tell me you don't need this. Is
           this your place?

Keaton is unable to answer.


                        VERBAL (CONT'D)
           They're never going to stop with us, you
           know that. This way we hit the cops where
           it hurts and get well in the mean time.

Keaton lets Verbal go and steps back, thinking.

                        VERBAL (CONT'D)
           As clean as you could ever get, they'll
           never let you go now.

           I'm not knocking you. You look like
           you've got a good little seam going with
           this lawyer -

WHAM. Keaton punches Verbal in the stomach and drops him to
one knee. Verbal coughs and tries to find his breath.

                             KEATON
           You watch your mouth.

                             VERBAL

           Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing?
           That's cool.

Keaton reaches for Verbal. Verbal flinches. Keaton gently
helps him up and guides him to the couch. They bath sit.

Keaton reaches for a pack of cigarettes and lights one for
each of them.

                            KEATON
           I apologize.

Verbal takes one and has a few drags, catching his breath and
rubbing his stomach in pain.

FINALLY:

                            VERBAL
           I was out of line.

                             KEATON
           You okay?

                            VERBAL
           I'11 be alright.

                             KEATON

           Forget it.
                             (Beat)
           I'11 probably shit blood tonight.

Keaton laughs. Verbal thinks about it for a moment and laughs
with him.

Keaton's laughter trails off. He thinks for a moment.

                                           but like I said,

                 New York's finest Taxi Service was not
                 your normal taxi service. It was a ring
                 of corrupt cops in the N.Y.P.D. that ran
                 a high-profit racket, driving smugglers
                 and drug dealers all over the city. For a
                 few hundred dollars a mile, you got your
                 own black and white and a police escort.
                 They even had their own business cards.

     OSCAR WHITEHEAD, a tall gray-haired man in his fifties comes
     out of the international terminal in a white linen suit. He
     holds a large suitcase in his right hand.

                After a while, somebody started asking
                questions and the taxi service shut down.
                Ever since then, Internal Affairs had
                been waiting to catch them in the act.

     Oscar stands on the curb long enough to light a cigarette.
     After a moment, a POLICE CRUISER pulls up to him. He opens
     the back door and gets in.

                And that was how we started. McManus came
                to us with the job; Fenster got the vans;

                through with how to do it so no one got

     SERGEANT JIM STRAUSZ, a meaty, imposing looking man in his

     PATROLMAN, STEVE RIZZI. They are two drivers for New York's

                How was the flight?

     Oscar hands Rizzi a thick envelope.

     Rizzi counts the stack of hundred dollar bills in the

      The police car makes its way down a wide, abandoned street. A
      WHITE MINIVAN pulls out behind it and heads the same way.

37 INT. POLICE CAR
                                                                            37

      Strausz looks in the rear-view mirror. The white minivan is
      flashing his high-beams.

                                  STRAUSZ
                 What the

                                   RIZZI
                 LOOK OUT.

      Strausz looks in front of him. A green minivan swerves in
      front of them from out of nowhere. Strausz slams on the
      brakes and skids to a halt. The white minivan rams them from
      behind.

      Strausz and Rizzi are stunned for a moment as two more vans
      screech up on either side of the cruiser, boxing it in with
      only a few inches between them.

      The cruiser is surrounded on all sides.

      SUDDENLY, SHOTGUN BARRELS come through the open windows. They
      come to rest, one on Strausz's left temple one on Rizzi's
      right. RIZZI looks out of the corner of his eye.

      He sees the driver of the van next to him holding the shotgun
      with one hand. A stocking is over the driver's head.

      Strausz looks straight ahead. The minivan in front of them is
      missing a back window. Another man with a stocking on his
      head aims a sub-machine gun at them from inside.

      By the twisted right hand holding the front of the gun, we
      know it is Verbal.

      Strausz and Rizzi raise their hands without being asked.

38    EXT. STREET                                                           38

      The driver of the white van gets out with a gallon jug in one
      hand and a sledge hammer in the other.

      Moving like lightning, he jumps onto the roof of the police
      car

     'He stands on the front of the roof and swings the hammer
     down.

     SMASH

     The hammer punches three huge holes in the windshield and
     finally caves it in. Strausz and Rizzi are covered with
     pebbles of broken glass. Whitehead clutches his bag in the
     back seat. He trembles in terror.

     The man standing on the roof doubles over and sticks a gun in
     Strausz's face. His face hangs upside down and looks gruesome
     - covered from the mouth up in a stocking. By the voice, we
     know it is McManus.

                                  McManus
                 GIVE ME THE SHIT.

                                  STRAUSZ
                 Give it up.

     Oscar hands the suitcase up front and Strausz passes it to
     McManus.

40 INT. FRONT VAN

     Through the front windshield of the front van we see Keaton
     at the wheel. Verbal is behind him leaning out the back
     window.

     Beneath Keaton's stocking mask we see he is trembling and
     sweating - sickened by what he is doing.

     He glances up at the rear-view mirror and looks at the scene
     outside. He looks down at the floor in shame, shaking his
     head.

41 INT. POLICE CAR                                                       41

                 The money.

     Strausz looks at Rizzi.

                             McMAMJS (CONT'D)
                 THE MONEY. LET'S HAVE IT.

     Rizzi hands the money through the remains of the windshield.

      McManus takes the money and stuffs it in his jacket. He steps
      back and takes the cap off of the gallon jug. He quickly
      pours some kind of liquid all over the roof of the car.

                                  STRAUSZ
                 Do you know who I am?

      A hand reaches into the driver's side window and rips
      Strausz's badge off of his shirt.

      Strausz dares to turn his head right at the shotgun pointing
      at him through the window. On the other end is a masked and
      smiling Todd Hockney.

                                  HOCKNEY
                 We db now, Jerk-off.

      McManus lights a pack of matches and drops them on the roof
      of the car as he jumps off. THE LIQUID IGNITES, the roof of
      the car is instantly in flames.

      Strausz and Rizzi attempt to bail out, but the vans are too
      close for them to open the doors.

      The vans pull away.
      Strausz and Rizzi escape from the car.
      Oscar is trapped inside, SCREAMING.
      Strausz and Rizzi stop, each expecting the other to go let
      Oscar out.

42    EXT. STREET - LATER                                                  42

      The scene is swarming with fresh police cars. Strausz and
      Rizzi are fielding questions from a dozen other cops.

      Photographers are everywhere.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                 The papers got Keaton's call that day and                  
                 were on the scene before the cops were.
                 Strausz and Rizzi were indicted three
                 days later. Within a few weeks, fifty
                 more cops went down with them. It was
                 beautiful. Everybody got it right in the
                 ass, from the chief on down.

     Hockney, Fenster, McManus and Verbal are all laughing in a
     secluded garage. They are still in their black clothes from
     the robbery. Hockney is throwing everyone a can of beer.

     Keaton sits off by himself. He watches the others, unable to
     join in the festivities.

     The others sit around a cheap card table. It is covered with
     emeralds. Dozens of them. Everyone is in awe.

                                 McManus
                There's more than I thought.

                                 HOCKNEY
                When does the fence come?

                                 McMANUS
                Redfoot? He never comes to see me. I have
                to go see him.

                                 McMANUS

                                 HOCKNEY
                Hold the fuckin' phone. You and Fenster?
                No, no, no.

                                 McMANUS
                Guys, come on.

                                 HOCKNEY
                I'm sure you can understand my
                hesitation.

                                 FENSTER
                Then who goes?

                                 HOCKNEY
                We all go. How about it, Keaton?

     All eyes turn to Keaton. He comes out of his trance.

                                 KEATON
                We need to lay low for a while.

                                 McMANUS
                Fine with me.

     PAUSE

     Everyone looks at each other, their moment of distrust
     blowing over. All eyes drift back to the emeralds on the
     table.

     Hockney begins to snicker, then McManus, then Fenster. Verbal
     joins in at last.

     McManus grabs Verbal and hugs him, shaking him violently.

                            McMANUS (CONT'D)
                My boy with the plan.

     SUDDENLY, everyone yells and pours beer over Verbal's head.
     He laughs as he is drenched in white foam, nearly choking as
     the others chant his name.

     Keaton watches from across the room, trying to smile in vain.

     Keaton and Verbal sit side by side on a sofa. A sign on the
     door behind them reads: MONTGOMERY and LaGUARDIA - ATTORNEYS

     Keaton stands and paces across the waiting room. He comes to
     a set of glass doors and looks through them.

Keaton realizes he is standing on a balcony overlooking a
library below.                                                        

He sees Edie working in the library with an old woman. The
two women talk for a moment.                                          

SUDDENLY, Keaton turns with a start. Verbal is standing
behind him.

      Edie is smiling and laughing with the old woman.                   
      Keaton's face is marked with guilt and anguish.
      Keaton turns and walks out of the waiting room. Verbal takes        
      one last glance at Edie and turns back to Keaton.                   

                                                                           46

      Edie seems to sense something behind her. She turns and looks

      NOTHING IS THERE. She goes back to chatting with the old
      woman.

          Keaton. I've been investigating him for                    
          three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    +
          blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on                   
          three counts of murder before he was                       
          kicked off the force, so don't sell me

          You got him wrong.

                            KUJAN
          Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 +
          of seven times when he was on the force.                  +
          In every case, witnesses either reversed                  +
          their testimony to the grand jury or died                 +
          before they could testify. When they                      t
          finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  +
          five years in Sing Sing. He killed three                   
          prisoners inside - one with a knife in                     
          the tailbone while he strangled him to                    
          death. Of course I can't prove this but I                  
          can't prove the best part either.

          Dean Keaton was dead. Did you know that?                  r
          He died in a fire two years ago during an

          witness who was going to testify against                   
          him. Two people saw Keaton enter a
          warehouse he owned just before it went

          up. They said he had gone in to check a                   +
          leaking gas main. It blew up and took all
          of Dean Keaton with it. Within three
          months of the explosion, the two
          witnesses were dead, one killed himself
          in his car and the other fell down an

                Six weeks ago I get an anonymous call
                telling me I can find Keaton eating at
                Mondino's with his lawyer, and there he
                is. Now because he never profited from
                his alleged death and because someone
                else was convicted for the murder we
                tried to pin on Keaton, we had to let him

                go.

           I don't think you do. But you say you saw
           Keaton die. I think you're covering his
           ass and he's still out there somewhere. I
           think he was behind that whole circus in
           the harbor. My bet is he's using you
           because you're stupid and you think he's
           your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be
           it. I want to make sure he's dead before

                a cowhide full of thumbtacks.

     All five guys stand in a group. It is utterly quiet.
     An old but well kept Cadillac creeps into the lot from the
     far end and idles up to them. The windows are tinted too much
     to see in. The car passes within a few feet of them and
     drives on.

     A moment later, a chrome and leather monster of a Harley
     Davidson pulls into the lot. The rider is dressed in an
     almost comical array of leather, silver and suede.

     He waves to the Caddy as it parks a few yards from Keaton and
     the others. It sits quietly, almost menacing.

     As he gets closer, we can see he is wearing one black boot
     and one red. Keaton is still looking at them when the bike
     pulls up to them and stops.

     REDFOOT and McManus shake hands.

                                 REDFOOT

McManus holds up a briefcase.

Redfoot takes it and gets off the bike. He walks over to the
Caddy. The door of the Caddy opens. Redfoot hands the case to
Someone inside that we cannot see. The door closes.

A moment later, the door of the Caddy opens again. Someone

McManus.

He hands him the case.

McManus hands the case back to Hockney. Hockney opens it,
revealing the stacks of money inside.

                             McMANUS
           Jesus, I'm sorry. Redfoot, this is Dean
           Keaton, that's Todd Hockney, and that's
           Verbal Kint.

                             REDFOOT
                          (To Verbal)
           The man with the plan.

Verbal smiles.

                       REDFOOT (CONT'D)
           Are you guys interested in more work?

McManus moves to answer, but Keaton cuts him off.

                             KEATON
           We're on vacation.

                             REDFOOT
           I've got a ton of work and no good
           people.

                            McMANUS
           What's the job?

Keaton shoots McManus a foul look. McManus pretends not to
notice.

                             REDFOOT
           A jeweler out of Texas named Saul. He
           rents a suite at a hotel downtown and
           does free appraisals. Buys whatever he
           can. Word is he moves with a lot of cash.
           I'11 take the merchandise, you keep the
           green.

                            HOCKNEY
           Security?

                            REDFOOT
           Two bodyguards. Pretty good.

                             McMANUS
           Give us time to check it out?

                            REDFOOT
           I'd expect nothing less.

                            McMANUS
           We'll call you.

                            REDFOOT
           Take your time. Enjoy L.A.

                             KEATON
           A friend of mine in New York tells me you
           knew Spook Hollis.

                             REDFOOT
           I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah,
           he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of
           dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got
           shivved.

                            KEATON
           I shivved him.

Now McManus is shooting the angry look at Keaton.

                        KEATON (CONT'D)
           Better you hear it from me now than
           somebody else later.

                            REDFOOT
           Business or personal?

                            KEATON
           A little of both.

                            REDFOOT
           Ain't it a crime? Call if you're
           interested.

Redfoot fires up his bike and takes off with the Caddy close
behind.

                            McMANUS
                          (To Keaton)
           What's your fucking problem?

                            KEATON
           One job, that was the deal.

                            McMANUS
           Take it as it comes, brother.

                            KEATON
           This is bullshit.

McManus laughs and walks away. Fenster and Hockney follow.
Verbal turns to Keaton.
                            VERBAL
           What is it Keaton?

                            KEATON
                            (Distant)
           Something - I don't know.
                       (Shaking himself)
           I ever tell you about the restaurant I
           wanted to open?

Keaton walks off. Verbal follows him in confusion.

                         VERBAL (V.O.)
           L.A., was good for about two hours. We
           were from New York. There's no place to
           eat after one; you can't get a pizza that
           doesn't taste like a fried fruit-bat, and
           the broads don't want to know you if you
           don't look like a broad. Within a few
           days the last of us was ready to go back
           to N.Y., but Keaton wouldn't have it, so
           he really didn't have a choice. We went
           to work.

56   INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

     McManus walks along a line of cars. He comes across a black
     Mercedes and stops. He looks down at the license plate and
     walks over to the next car, a green Honda. He pulls a slim-
     jim out of his jacket and pops the lock an the Honda. He
     reaches in and opens the hood. He walks around and sticks his
     head in the engine.

57   INT. VAN                                                             57

     Verbal sits behind the wheel. Keaton is beside him. Hockney
     and Fenster are in the back. They all watch McManus from
     where they are parked a few dozen yards away.

58   INT. PARKING GARAGE                                                  58
     DING-DING
     The elevator bell sounds at the far end of the garage. The
     doors open. Two men in ill-fitting suits get out and look
     around cautiously. The first is TUCCI, a big bellied, white
     haired menace. The other is HIGHAM, lean and bad skinned.
     They are bodyguards and give it away by their every careful
     move.

     They turn back to the elevator and motion to someone inside.

     Out walks SAUL BERG, a slightly overweight man in his forties
     with an open collar silk shirt and a thick gold chain on his
     hairy chest. He carries a LARGE ALUMINUM BRIEFCASE.

     He lets his guards do the worrying. He walks straight to his
     car.
     Saul passes McManus under the hood of the Honda. He takes out
     his keys and pushes a button on his key chain. The Mercedes
     beeps three times and tells Saul his alarm is off.

     Tucci keeps an eye on McManus. Higham watches Saul.

     McManus pretends to tinker with the car's engine. He has put  
     a pistol just inside the grill and keeps it within reach.

     The van on the other side of the garage starts and pulls out
     of the spot. It cruises over toward the Mercedes.

     Tucci sees the van. He and Higham are suddenly busy trying to
     keep track. They hear laughing behind them and turn around.

                                           YELLOW 06/11/94


                                                              64.

FENSTER and HOCKNEY are walking towards them. They are
sporting mustaches and sunglasses in addition to matching
suits, each with loud plaid sport coats, decades out of
style. Saul glances at Tucci and Higham.

                            HIGHAM
           Just get in the car Saul.

Under the hood of the Honda and out of sight, McManus pulls
on a black ski mask.

The van gets closer.

                             HOCKNEY
           I get out of the car, and man if the
           thing wasn't wrecked. And I see this
           broad in the back seat with nothing on.

Saul gets in the car quickly but calmly as Fenster and
Hockney laugh and talk louder. They look drunk - The desired
effect.

                       HOCKNEY (CONT'D)
           I'm laughing so hard I can't breathe -

Tucci and Higham try to take it all in stride. Saul's reverse
lights come on and he begins to back out of the spot.

                       HOCKNEY (CONT'D)
           ...And the fat guy comes out of the car
           with his pants on backwards and says -

SUDDENLY, the van revs and screeches to a halt behind Saul's
Mercedes, blocking him in. Hockney and Fenster drop the drunk
act and snap to. They both pull out guns and start screaming.

                       HOCKNEY (CONT'D)
           DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.

                            FENSTER
           RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.

McManus comes up from under the hood.                                  

Tucci and Higham throw their hands in the air. Hockney and
Fenster grab them and reach into their belts to get their
guns .

Keaton jumps out of the van and runs up to Saul's car, his
face covered in a ski mask. He yanks on the door handle but
it is locked. Saul sits in terror behind the wheel. Keaton
pulls out a pistol and smashes the window with it.

                                           YELLOW 06/11/94


                                                              65.

                             KEATON
            Give me the case.


Saul reaches over for the case. Keaton trains the gun on him.

SUDDENLY, Saul comes up with a pistol and points it at
Keaton. Keaton sidesteps and grabs his wrist. The gun goes
off into the fender of the Honda.

Hockney and Fenster both look over at the sound of the gun.

Tucci and Higham seize the opportunity. Tucci grabs Hockney,
Higham grabs Fenster. The four men grapple for the guns.

Fenster's gun falls to the floor. McManus picks it up. He
trains a pistol on each bodyguard and takes a breath. They
are some ten feet apart and moving erratically. Hockney and
Fenster constantly fall in the line of fire.

McManus walks around the four men, keeping a pistol trained
on each of the guards. Finally he comes to an angle where
they are all in front of him. One guard is a few feet away,
the other is ten feet past him.

McMANUS' P.O.V.

The closer of the two moves in and out of the sights of the
pistol in McManus' right hand, the one farther away does the
same with the left.

Verbal gets out of the van and moves towards them to help.
BOOM
Both of McManus' guns go off like one shot. Tucci and Higham
collapse, each with a bullet in his head


PAUSE

The only sound is Saul grappling with Keaton for the gun. His
arm is halfway out the window. His elbow rests in the door
frame.

Keaton cannot get the gun out of his hand. Finally, he pushes
down with all his weight. Saul's elbow breaks backwards on
the door frame. He screams in agony. The gun falls from his
hand.

      All five of the men look at each other for an impossibly long
      moment. The confusion is only aggravated by Saul's screaming.

      SLOWLY, Keaton raises his pistol and aims it at Saul. His
      hand trembles, his eyes squint to near slits. His finger
      tenses and slacks off over and over again on the trigger.

      BOOM

      VERBAL SHOOTS SAUL. Keaton looks at him in surprise. Verbal
      trembles more than he does.

      The garage is silent.

                                 HOCKNEY
                What the hell?

                                 McManus
                Bad day. Fuck it.

      DING-DING


      The elevator light comes on. All five men look.

                                 KEATON
                Move.

      Keaton reaches into the car and grabs Saul's case. Everyone
      else piles into the van. Keaton gets in as Verbal is driving
      for the exit.

59    INT. VAN                                                             59

      The mood in the van is grim. Everyone is silent. Keaton pops
      the clasps on the case and opens it.

                                 KEATON
                Son of a bitch.

      Everyone looks in the case. It is filled with cash on one
      side. The other side is filled with clear plastic bags of
      WHITE POWDER.

60    EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                             60

      Keaton and the others stand in silhouette in front of the
      lights of an oncoming car in the distance. We can make out
      McManus loading a gun.                                                 +

                             McMANUS
           What does it look like? I'm going to kill
           him.

                             KEATON
           We did it your way. Now I'11 deal with
           him.

                            MCMANUS

                            KEATON
           I'm going to deal with him.

The car, Redfoot's escort Caddy, is now in front of them.
The horn lets out three short blasts.

Redfoot comes around from behind the Caddy on his motorcycle.
He gets off the bike, trying to hide a faint smile.
McManus throws Saul's case on the ground in front of him.

                             McMANUS
           What the fuck is this, Redfoot?

                            REDFOOT

                            REDFOOT
           The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.

                            KEATON
           Who is he?

                            REDFOOT
           Some Limey. He's a middle-man for
           somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.

                            KEATON
           We want to meet him.

                            REDFOOT
           He wants to meet you. He called last
           night and asked me to set it up. What do
           I tell him'

                            KEATON
           Tell him we'll meet.

                            McMANUS
           If you're lying, Redfoot...

                            REDFOOT
           McManus, you're a real bad-ass, but get
           off my tip.

McManus lunges for Redfoot.

The Caddy doors instantly pop open and rifle barrels come
into view from within.

Fenster and Hockney draw guns and aim at the Caddy.
Keaton and Verbal grab McManus and hold him back.
Redfoot gets on his Harley, smiling defiantly.
                       REDFOOT (CONT'D)
           Real shame about Saul getting whacked.
           Lot's of cops looking for the guys that
           did it. I'm sure They'll get around to
           asking me.

     out of sight before following.

               yesterday after the shoot-out. He came to                 +
               this morning and started talking. He was
               part of a Hungarian mob there to do a
               deal with a bunch of goats from
               Argentina. He says it was definitely not
               a dope deal.

               We know, but our man says no way on the

               bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the
               next' day. They had no time to negotiate
               that kind of product and no means to move
               it.

                                 KUJAN
               What was the money for?

                                  BAER
               He didn't know. No one doing the deal
               knew except a few key people. This guy
               says they were real hush about it.
               Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.

     SUDDENLY, The sound of a man clearing his throat.
     Everyone turns to the door behind them.
     MR. KOBAYASHI a tall, slim, well groomed man stands in the

                Mr. Keaton?

     Keaton stands back and lets him in. Kobayashi looks them
     over.

                           KOBAYASHI (CONT'D)
                I am Mr. Kobayashi. I've been asked by my
                employer to bring a proposal to you
                gentlemen. That must be Mr. Hockney. I
                recognize Mr. Fenster from his mug shot,

                of Saul. My employer sends his gratitude.
                A most unexpected benefit.

     Everyone looks at one another in shock that he would know
     this.

                           KOBAYASHI
           My employer requires your services. One
           job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I
           don't expect all of you to live, but
           those who do will have ninety-one million

           My employer wishes to remain anonymous.

                             KEATON
           Don't jerk me off. We all know what this
           is. You don't work with me if I work with
           you without knowing who I'm working for.
           Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?

                           KOBAYASHI
           I work for Keyser Sate.                                   

A strange look crosses Keaton's face. Skepticism, mockery and
just a hint of fear. Hockney, McManus and Fenster all share
similar looks.

           I am sure you've heard a number of tall
           tales, myths and legends about Mr. Soze

           In nineteen-eighty one, Mr. Keaton, you
           participated in the hijacking of a truck
           in Buffalo, New York. The cargo was raw
           steel. Steel that belonged to Mr. Soze
           and was destined for Pakistan to be used
           in a Nuclear reactor. A very profitable
           violation of U.N. Regulations. You had no
           way of knowing this, because the man
           shipping the steel was working for Mr.
           Sate without his knowledge.                               +
                             (Beat)
           Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus hijacked a
           twin-prop cargo flight earlier this year
           out of Newark airport. The plane was
           carrying platinum and gold wiring. Also
           set for Pakistan.

           Two months ago, Mr. Hockney stole a truck

in the first place.

           Belfast. Again, Mr. Sate using pawns who                   
           had no knowledge.

           Nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze less

           complicated confidence seam by a cripple.

           Our intention was to approach you after

           You set up the line-up.

                            KOBAYASHI
           Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were                   
           not to be released until I came to see
           you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms.
           Finneran, was a bit too effective in
           expediting his release. Holding the rest
           of you became a moot point.

                            KEATON
           What about Redfoot?

                            KOBAYASHI
           Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t
           works with the same people for very long,
           and they never know who they're working
           for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no
           people.

                            FENSTER
           So why tell us?

                           KOBAYASHI
           Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze.                    
           That you did not know you stole from him
           is the only reason you are still alive,
           but he feels you owe him. You will repay
           your debt.

           for Soze


                           KOBAYASHI
           I don't think that is relevant, Mr.
           Hockney. The five of you are responsible
           for the murder of Saul Berg and his
           bodyguards. Mr. Redfoot can attest to
           your involvement, and we can see to it
           that he will. He is not of your
           "superior" breed.

           Argentinians for several years. Competing
           with Mr. Soze has taken its toll. These
           Argentinians are negotiating the sale of
           ninety-one million dollars in cocaine in
           three days time. Needless to say, this
           purchase will revitalize the diminishing
           strength of their organization. Mr. Soze
           wants you to stop the deal. If you
           choose, you may wait until the buy.
           Whatever money changes hands is yours.
           The transaction will take place on a boat
           in San Pedro. Mr. Soze wants you to get
           to the boat and destroy the cocaine on
           board. Then you are free of your
           obligation to Mr. Soze.

           Give me one good reason why I shouldn't
           kill you right now.

Kobayashi smiles and puts his briefcase on the table in front
of him.

           A gift from Mr. Soze gentlemen.

He turns and walks out of the room.

Keaton walks over to the case and opens it. He reaches in and
pulls out five thick manila envelopes, each marked in bold
black letters. "KEATON", "McMANUS", "HOCKNEY", "FENSTER" and
"KINT"

Keaton pulls out the files, revealing a map underneath.

Keaton hands each man his file. He opens his first. He pulls

Keaton pulls out a large black and white photograph of
himself and his lawyer EDIE FINNERAN. They are laughing arm
in arm by a fountain in New York. He hides the photo from the
others.

                He is supposed to be Turkish. Some say                   r
                his father was German. Nobody believed he                 
                was real. Nobody ever saw him or knew                     
                anybody that ever worked directly for                     
                him, but to hear Kobayashi tell it,                       
                anybody could have worked for Soze. You                  
                never knew. That was his power. The                       
                greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was                  
                convincing the world he didn't exist. One                  
                story the guys told me - the story I                      
                believe - was from his days in Turkey.                    
                There was a petty gang of Hungarians that                 
                wanted their own mob. They realized that                  
                to be in power you didn't need guns or                    
                money or even numbers. You just needed                   +
                the will to do what the other guy                         
                wouldn't. After a while they come to                      
                power, and then they come after Soze He                   
                was small time then, just running dope,                   
                they say...

     Three of the Hungarians come bursting into Keyser Soze's            +
     home. They grab his five children and round them up in the
     front room. One of the men grabs his wife and back-hands her
     across the face.

                looking for his business. They find his

                wait for Sate.

68    INT. SOZE'S HOME - LATER                                            68'

     The front door opens and in walks Keyser Sate. We are never         t
     allowed to see his face.

     Sate's wife lies in the corner, beaten and bruised. Her dress
     is tattered to shreds. She cannot look up at her husband.

     The three Hungarians stand to greet him. Two hold guns in
     their hands. The third holds a straight razor. He grabs
     Soze youngest boy and holds the razor to his throat.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                He comes home to his wife raped and his
                children screaming. The Hungarians knew
                Soze was tough. Not to be trifled with.                   
                So they let him know they meant business.

     The Hungarian smiles. Soze's wife SCREAMS IN HORROR.                
     The Hungarian holds up a BLOOD SOAKED RAZOR.
     SUDDENLY, he grabs another child. A little girl no older than
     six.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                They tell Soze they want his territory -                  
                all his business. Soze looks over the                    +
                faces of his family... Then he showed
                these men of will what will really was.

     SUDDENLY, Soze pulls out a pistol and shoots the two men with  
     guns. He turns and aims at the third man holding his child.

     The man threatens to cut the child's throat, slicing just
     enough to draw blood.

     SOZE FIRES.

     The stunned Hungarian watches the child fall from his arms.

     Sate turns the pistol on the next child, then the next and  
     the next. He kills his children one by one in front of the
     Hungarian.

                             VERBAL (V.O.)
                He tells him he would rather' see his
                family dead than live another day after
                this.

    SOZE walks over to his wife, crying and beaten on the floor
    and holds up her head. She gives him the strangest look. One
    of trust perhaps, saturated with fear and humiliation.

    He puts the gun between her eyes and fires.

                             VERBAL (V.O.)
                He lets the last Hungarian go, and he
                goes running. He waits until his wife and
                kids are in the ground and he goes after
                the rest of the mob. He kills their kids,
                he kills their wives, he kills their
                parents and their parents' friends.

    A dark and looming figure of a man walks in front of a wall
    of fire - a black shadow blurred by waves of heat.

                             VERBAL (V.O.)
                He burns down the houses they live in and
                the stores they work in, he kills people
                that owe them money. And like that he was
                gone. Underground. No one has ever seen
                him again. He becomes a myth, a spook
                story that criminals tell their kids at
                night. If you rat on your pop, Keyser
                Sate will get you. And nobody really ever
                believes.

                years. A lot of guys equate him to that

                was working for a guy who got money
                through Keyser Soze. That kind of shit.
                Could be an old badge. A hex sign to keep
                people from fucking with you back when a

                I came clean. I told it like it happened
                on the boat. So what if I left out how I
                got there? It's got so many holes in it,
                the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty

                 Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to
                 call him - knows where I am right now.
                 He's got the front burner under' your ass
                 to let me go so he can scoop me up ten
                 minutes later. Immunity was just to deal
                 with you assholes. I got a whole new
                 problem when I post bail.

                                  KUJAN
                 So why play into his hands? We can
                 protect you.

                 Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far.
                 Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if
                 I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same
                 fuckers that rounded us up and sank us
                 into this mess are telling me They'll
                 bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can
                 catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like
                 that comes this close to getting fingered
                 and sticks his head out? If he comes up
                 for anything, it will be to get rid of
                 me.
                                  (beat)
                 After that, my guess is you'll never hear
                 from him again.

                have took off for New York. I never
                would have met Keaton, see. That barber
                shop quartet was the reason for
                everything.

                                  KUJAN
                Can we just get back to Kobayashi?

                                  VERBAL
                The quartet is part of the bit about
                Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file,
                along with every other thing I had done
                since high school, see? Aliases, middle-
                men. They knew me better than I did.
                They knew all of us.

      Kujan looks at his watch.

                                  KUJAN
                You're stalling, Verbal.

                                 VERBAL
                Give a guy a break, huh?

                                  KUJAN
                What happened?

      Verbal slumps a bit. He realizes his stalling tactic has
      failed.
                                   VERBAL
                We woke up the next morning and Fenster
                was gone. He couldn't handle the idea of
                slumming for SOZE. He left a note wishing
                us good luck and took a chunk of the
                money we'd scraped together.

                McManus was furious. He was talking about
                tracking him down and ripping his heart
                out and all sorts of shit. That night we
                got the call.

                What call?

                                  VERBAL
                Kobayashi told us where we could find
                Fenster.

76 EXT. BEACH - NIGHT - TWO WEEKS PRIOR                               76
     Keaton looks out over the ocean and smokes a cigarette.
                                  KEATON
                What do you want to do with him?

     McManus kneels in the sand. Hockney and Verbal stand behind
     him, staring at something in front of them.

     It is the body of Fred Fenster, literally peppered with
     bullet holes. McManus stares at him, fighting any flicker of
     emotion.

                                  McMAMJS
                I worked five years with Fenster. More
                jobs, more money than I can count.

                                 KEATON
                I'm sorry, McManus.

                                 McMANUS
                I want to bury him.

                                  KEATON
                No time.

     McManus springs to his feet and points a pistol at Keaton.
     Keaton turns to face him and raises his head. McManus might
     as well be pointing a feather-duster.

                                  McMANUS
                YOU WILL FIND TIME. You're not the only

     Everyone digs in the sand on the deserted beach with their
     hands. They are up to their waists in the hole they have
     scooped out. Fenster's body is a few feet away.

                                 HOCKNEY
                This is nuts.

                                 McMANUS
                Dig.

                                 HOCKNEY
                This is fucking dry sand, man. When he
                rots, the surfers'll smell him from a
                hundred yards out.

                                 McMANUS
                DIG, YOU FUCKER.

     Hockney can see that McManus has truly gone over the edge for
     now. Keaton gives him a look that says don't argue.

                                 HOCKNEY
                Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find
                him.

                                 KEATON
                Dig.

                I can run. I got no problem with that.

                                 KEATON
                They don't seem to have a problem with it
                either.

                                 McMANUS
                Nobody runs.

                                 HOCKNEY

                It's payback.

                                  KEATON
                IT'S NOT PAYBACK. I don't answer to you.                   +
                It's precaution. You want payback? You
                want to run? I don't care. I'm going to
                finish this thing. Not for Fenster, not
                for anybody else, but
                for me. This Kobayashi cocksucker isn't
                going to stand over me.
                                   (Beat)
                All of you can go to hell.


     Keaton turns and digs furiously with both hands. Hockney
     takes a moment and slowly starts to do the same.

     The four men dig for Fenster. The first to find some rest.

                I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't
                have it. It was too far-fetched for him.
                Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To
                a cop, the explanation is never that
                complicated. It's always simple. There's

                their minds on whacking Kobayashi.

79   EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT - TWO WEEKS PRIOR                         79

     Redfoot's Harley rests on the roof of the Caddy in a mangled
     heap. The body of the Caddy is riddled with bullet holes.

     Redfoot's dead body has been shoved head-first through a hole
     in the windshield up to his waist, recognizable only by the
     trademark red boot.

     Kobayashi walks through the front door of a plush office

     tower followed by two bodyguards. He heads toward the
     elevator, failing to notice Hockney a few feet away, reading
     a newspaper.

     We see a wire running from Hockney's ear to his collar.

81   INT. HALLWAY - FORTIETH FLOOR


     Keaton, McManus and Verbal stand by the six elevators on the
     fortieth floor. They are all wearing khaki overalls and tool
     belts with walkie-talkies. They look like servicemen.


     All of the elevators have been propped open and stranded.

     McManus moves into one of the elevators. As the doors close         i
     behind him, he scrambles for the ceiling hatch.

      drop to the floor, DEAD.
      Kobayashi looks up with surprising calm into McManus' barrel.

                Mr. Soze is very real and very                             +
                determined.

                                 KEATON
                We'll see.

     McManus holds a pistol to Kobayashi's chin. The lawyer's cool
     eyes never falter'.

                                 KOBAYASHI
                Before you do me in, you will let me
                finish my business with Ms. Finneran
                first, won't you?

     SUDDENLY, Keaton grabs McManus' hand and pulls the gun away
     before he can shoot.

                                 KEATON
                What did you say?

                                 KOBAYASHI
                Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my
                office for an extradition deposition. I
                requested she be put on the case
                personally. She flew out yesterday.

     Everyone looks at Keaton.

                           KOBAYASHI (CONT'D)
                No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.

                                 KEATON
                You're lying.

                                KOBAYASHI
                Am I?
                                                                            92
92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR


     Everyone follows Kobayashi quietly down a dimly lit, oak-
     lined hallway. Verbal holds a small pistol discreetly in the
     small of Kobayashi's back.

     They come to a glass office foyer. Kobayashi gestures and
     everyone looks through the glass into the lobby beyond.

     EDIE FINNERAN is talking casually with the receptionist.
     
93    INT. LOBBY                                                            93
     Edie glances toward the men in the hall.
     Keaton turns quickly on his heels, facing the others. From
     where Edie stands, it looks as though Kobayashi is talking to
     a group of harmless maintenance men.

     They see A LARGE MAN dressed very much like the two dead
     bodies left in the hall downstairs. The man notices Kobayashi
     and the others. He stands and stares menacingly.

                                KOBAYASHI
                Ms. Finneran's escort in Los Angeles.
                Never leaves her for a moment. I thought
                you'd like to know she was in good hands.

     Keaton's mind races for an alternative. He can find none.
     Verbal lowers his gun without being told.
                           KOBAYASHI (CONT'D)
                Get your rest, Gentlemen. The boat will
                be ready for you on Friday. If I see you
                or your friends before then, or fail to
                check in every half hour with that
                unpleasant looking man in there, Ms.
                Finneran will find herself the victim of
                a gruesome violation before she dies. As
                will your father, Mr. Hockney. and your
                Uncle Randall in Arizona, Mr. Kint. I
                might only castrate Mr. McManus' nephew,
                David. Do I make myself clear?

     All of the men surround Kobayashi, aching to kill him.

                                KOBAYASHI
                I'11 take care of the dead men
                downstairs. We'll add them to the cost of
                Mr. Fenster. Now if you'll excuse me.

     Kobayashi walks into the office. Edie turns to greet him.
     Keaton slowly turns and watches as they shake hands and talk.
     Kobayashi says something they cannot hear and Edie laughs,
     her back to the window.

     Kobayashi smiles over her shoulder at Keaton.
     All the while, the bodyguard watches Keaton. He nods politely
     before Keaton and the others leave. Verbal watches for a
     moment more and follows.

94    EXT. HILLSIDE ROAD - DAY                                            94'

     Keaton, Verbal, Hockney and McManus sit in a rented sedan
     overlooking San Pedro harbor.

     Another file from Kobayashi's briefcase is laid out on the
     dashboard. This has a map and a good fifty pages of                  
     information in it.

                                  KEATON
                It's a logistical nightmare. Close
                quarters, no advance layout, ten men,
                maybe twenty.

                                 HOCKNEY
                Can we stealth these guys?

                                  KEATON
                Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be
                ready - which brings me to sunny spot
                number two. Even if one of us gets
                through and jacks the boat, we get
                nothing.

                                  McMANUS
                And if we wait for the money?

                                  KEATON
                Ten more men at least. In my opinion, it
                can't be done. Anyone who walks into this
                won't come out alive.

                                  McMANUS
                I'm for waiting for the money.

                                 HOCKNEY
                Me too.

                                  VERBAL
                Did you hear what he just said?

                                  HOCKNEY
                If I'm going in, I want a stake.

                                  McMANUS
                 So do I.

      Verbal is shocked by what he is hearing. He looks at Keaton
      as if to ask him for his decision.

      Keaton's cold stare is all the answer Verbal needs. He slumps
      in his seat, resigned to the others.

                                  VERBAL
                 I just can't believe we're just gonna
                 walk into certain death.

      PAUSE
      They all suddenly realize the weight of their situation.
      FINALLY:
                                  McMANUS
                 News said it's raining in New York.

      No one knows quite how to respond.

95    EXT, PIER - SAN PEDRO - NIGHT                                       95

      A large boat, sleek and yacht-like, but without finesse. This
      is a boat for business - heavy and fast. It is moored to the
      pier.

      A large crane hoists a pallet of fuel drums from the dock. It
      swings slowly over the boat. A man on the dock yells in
      Spanish to the crane operator.

      Behind an old and weathered boat in dry-dock, Keaton and
      Verbal watch the boat from the shadows.

                                  VERBAL
                 What-are they speaking?

                                  KEATON
                 Russian, I think. I don't know.

                Knock it off.

      A large boat. A very large boat.

      Hockney maneuvers through a mesh of twisted steel, arriving
      at a vantage point near the stern of the large boat.                 

      HOCKNEY'S P.O.V.                                                     

      A black van pulls up and parks near the crane. Four men in
      suits get out. One remains with the van and the other three          
      walk toward the boat.                                                

      On the boat, five men come up from below deck. They are tense        
      and cautious around the men in suits. Someone speaks in
      Spanish and someone else in Russian. It takes a moment before
      anyone speaks the same tongue. They settle on French for both
      negotiators.

      Hockney sits in the van. He handles a large shoulder bag            +
      stuffed with plastique. He tests a timer on top.                     

      He picks up a walkie-talkie.

      McManus is positioning himself on the roof of the boathouse.         
      He stops and grabs his radio.

     Keaton turns and takes a few steps. He stops and looks back,
     his face marked with guilt and agony.

                             KEATON (CONT'D)
                 Tell her I... Tell her I tried.

     Keaton leaves before Verbal can respond. He walks down a ramp  
     toward the boat.

     He is no more than a few yards out of the shadows before the  
     first man sees him.

102   EXT. DOCK                                                        102'

     One of the men in suits starts to yell to the others. Men
     pull out guns and try to look as cool as they can.

     Keaton walks right into the face of all of these men,
     undaunted. His hands are in his pockets.

     Above him, in the darkness, McManus pokes his head out and

     spies Keaton. He pulls his head back and sticks out the
     barrel of the rifle.

     Keaton comes to a stop about twenty feet from fifteen men all
     together.

     McManus stares through the scope of his rifle at the scene.
     The cross-hairs breeze past Keaton and find a target. A man
     in a suit.

                                  McMANUS
                 Pow.

     He moves to another and then another, picking up speed and
     mock-shooting the men. He is steady and quick. It is clear he
     could take all fifteen in a few seconds.

                             McMANUS (CONT'D)
                 Pow-pow-pow-pow-pow-pow . Oswald was a

     The men shout questions at Keaton in a number of languages.

     A few men standing on the dock near the stern of the large
     boat, move towards the commotion.

     Hockney bails out and runs quickly and quietly through the
     shadows, bringing the bomb with him.

     Finally two men walk right towards Keaton. The rest train
     guns on him. They reach for his arms, pointing their guns
     right at him.

     At the far end of the dock, Hockney throws his bomb onto the
     stern of the large boat.

     IT EXPLODES                                                          
     The men surrounding Keaton, are distracted.
     Keaton pulls a pistol out of each pocket and shoots the two
     men closest to him.

     The men from the boat and the men in suits try to peg Keaton,
     but McManus' sniping has them running.

     The crane operator opens the door to bails out, leaving the
     crane in motion.,,

     McManus runs across the roof of the boathouse and jumps down
     to the pier. He arrives at a thick mooring cable and climbs
     across to the boat.                                                 i

     Keaton climbs up onto a small lifeboat hanging from the side         
     of the larger boat. From this he climbs aboard the large             
     boat.

      Hockney is firing in all directions.
      SUDDENLY, he realizes no one is left on the dock.

      PAUSE  

      FINALLY, he turns and runs back for the van parked on the
      pier above. He finds a ramp leading from the dock to the
      pier.  

      At the van, he finds the one man who has stayed behind to
      protect it.                                 I                       i

      The man hears Hockney coming and raises his gun. Hockney runs       i
      straight at him, screaming frantically.                             i

                                  HOCKNEY

      He shoots the man point blank in the face and runs over his
      body as it falls.

      He gets to the back door of the van and yanks it open.

      The inside is stacked with large wooden crates.

      Hockney, suddenly oblivious to the sound of gunfire, opens
      one of the crates and looks inside.

      IT IS FILLED WITH MONEY. Cash and negotiable bonds of all
      kinds.

      He smiles.
      BOOM
      BLOOD sprays all over the money. Hockney looks at it,
      puzzled.

      Hockney raises a blood-soaked hand from his belly.                   
      He turns and stares in horror.

     McManus runs like a wild man across the deck, heading for the
     hatch .

     He shoots in all directions as though he has eyes in the back
     of his head. He sees Keaton climbing onto the deck of the
     boat.

     Verbal is wrestling with what to do. He finally makes a break
     for the other side of the boathouse.

     The crane continues to swing.
     A single bullet hits one of the barrels on the suspended
     pellet.

     Gasoline pours out through the bullet-hole.

     Keaton finds the hatch and goes below, shooting a man on his
     way up the stairs. McManus jumps on board and runs down
     behind him.

     Verbal arrives at the top of the ramp leading from the dock

     He turns and sees Hockney's dead body next to the van.               
     He looks around frantically, frozen in terror.                       
     It is quiet, except for the sounds of screaming, far off in
     the bowels of the boat and the hum of the crane.

     A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.

     thick manila folder. Kujan thumbs through it.

                this morning. Thrown clear when the boat                  
                burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys                   
                from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +

                His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty
                smuggler out of Argentina. He was
                arrested in New York last year for
                trafficking. He escaped to California and
                got picked up in Long Beach. They were
                setting up his extradition when he
                escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran
                was called in to advise the proceedings.

                Arturo was strongly opposed 'to going back

                close to fifty guys. Guess who he names
                for a finale?

     Kujan finds one sheet and notices a paragraph is highlighted.

                There was no dope on that boat.

124  INT. BOAT - NIGHT - ONE WEEK PRIOR                               124

     Keaton is weaving through tight, low-ceiling corridors,
     looking in every cabin, working his way towards the bottom of
     the boat.

     ELSEWHERE IN THE BOAT, McManus is tearing though the
     corridors, seemingly less interested in securing the cargo as
     he is in killing everyone on board.

     He screams like a lunatic, shooting everything in his path,
     killing some men with his bare hands, shooting others,
     stabbing others still with a knife he has brought along.

                                                                      125
125  INT. CORRIDOR


     JAIME, one of the men from the boat, is half-pushing, half-
     helping a thin and sweaty looking MAN IN A CHECKERED BATHROBE
     towards a cabin at the end of the hall.

     The man in the robe is trembling. He seems stricken with
     fear.

                He's here. I saw him on deck.

     Jaime pushes him inside the cabin and shuts the door.

     A stereo playing softly in the room mixes with the man's
     panicked breathing.

     The man in the robe screams through the closed door, his
     voice echoing off of the metal bulkheads.

                               MAN IN ROBE
                                 (CONT'D)
                I'M TELLING YOU IT'S KEYSER SOZE.                           

     Jaime stands outside the door of the cabin and turns to face
     down the hall. Off in some other part of the boat, he can
     hear McManus wailing like a banshee and the ever-less
     frequent sound of gunshots.

126   INT. HOLD                                                            126

     Keaton has come to the four-foot-high door to the hold. The
     door is open slightly. Keaton finds this strange. He pushes
     the door open and steps inside. The hold is empty.

     He hears a noise behind him. He wheels around to fire. He
     sees McManus in the door. His face is covered with blood.

                                 McMANUS
                Did you hear what I heard?

                                 McMANUS
                I heard somebody screaming his nuts off.
                He said Keyser Soze was on the boat.                        

                                 KEATON
                Are you alright?

     McManus rubs some of the blood off with his sleeve.

                There's no coke.

     McManus looks around the hold as though he'll see four and a
     half tons of dope in some corner where Keaton might have
     missed it.

     The two men look at one another. There is a long, pregnant
     silence.

                                  McMANUS
                Let's get the fuck out of here.

     Keaton and McManus step out of the hold, walking slowly and
     cautiously back from where they came. They hear the sounds of
     footsteps running on the deck above and the occasional
     hollered sentence in Spanish.

                                  KEATON

     They come to a corner. They can go left or right.

                I can't remember which way.

                Right -

     BOOM - BOOM

     Gunshots fill the hallway from behind them. They do not stop
     to turn around. Keaton goes left, McManus goes right. They
     run in opposite directions with the sound of gunfire right
     behind them.

      The man in the bathrobe sits on the foot of the bed watching
      the door. He hears the sounds of fighting somewhere not too
      far away.

      He crawls over the bed and squeezes between it and the
      bulkhead. Only the top of his head is visible. He starts to
      cry.

      BOOM - BOOM - Two shots just outside in the hall.

      SUDDENLY, the door bursts open. Jaime collapses in a heap on
      the floor, a bullet hole in his eye.

      A FIGURE LOOMS IN THE DOOR

      The man in the bathrobe looks up at the figure. We cannot see
      him.

                               MAN IN ROBE
                I told them nothing.

      BOOM


      The man in the robe falls dead.
130   EXT. DECK - MOMENTS LATER                                          130
      The boat is quiet now. Keaton walks out onto the deck.
      He looks out over the pier and sees Verbal standing in the
      middle of the carnage, frozen. Their eyes meet. Keaton waves
      at him as if to shoe him away.

131   EXT. PIER - TOP OF RAMP                                            131

      Verbal hesitates and finally moves towards the van with the
      money. He looks back over his shoulder and sees Keaton.
      Keaton sees him looking and waves again, hurrying him along.  

      Verbal turns away and focuses on the van.


                                                                         132
132   EXT. DECK


      Keaton hears a noise behind him. He swings around and points
      his gun at McManus again. He puts the gun down.

      McManus smiles. He walks slowly across the deck towards
      Keaton. Something is not right about him.

                                  McMANUS
                 Strangest thing...

      He slumps to the deck. Keaton rushes over to him. He kneels
      down and sees a pipe sticking out of the back of McManus's
      neck.

133   EXT. PIER                                                            133'

      Verbal approaches the van, stepping over Hockney's body. He
      closes the back doors of the van.         ,                          

      He looks to his left at the huge loading crane. He glances
      upward along the giant' arm as it swings steadily on.

      Somewhere, off in the distance, the sound of SIRENS can be
      heard.

134   EXT. DECK                                                            134

      Keaton kneels by McManus, trembling with rage. After a moment
      he stands, looking down at McManus' dead body.

135   EXT. PIER                                                            135

      SUDDENLY, Verbal realizes something. He turns and goes to
      call out a warning to Keaton. He is too late.

136   EXT. DECK                                                            136
      Keaton never sees the crane coming.
      WHAM

      The pellet of barrels hits him square in the back and sends
      him flying into the wheel house of the boat.

      Keaton is still for a moment. Finally, he tries to get up,
      but finds he cannot move his legs.                                   

137   EXT. PIER                                                            137

      Verbal runs down the ramp as fast as he can. He comes to a           
      rope ladder hanging down the side of the boat.                      +

      SUDDENLY, he stops dead in his tracks, looking up at the
      boat.

>From where he stands, he can just make out the figure of a
TAU, THIN MAN walking along the edge of the deck. He moves
quietly and calmly in the shadows towards the crane, looking
out of place in his expensive suit.

                And that's when you say in your statement
                that you saw...

     Kujan picks up his copy of Verbal's statement to the D.A.

                              KUJAN (CONT'D)
                A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.

                                 VERBAL
                Wait a minute.

                                  KUJAN
                            (Looking at watch)
                I don't have a minute. Are you saying it
                was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you
                didn't know who it was.

     Verbal is drowning in Kujan's interrogation. He looks dazed.


                                  VERBAL
                I - there had to be dope there.

                             KUJAN
           Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling.
           You know what I'm getting at.

                            VERBAL
           I don't.

                             KUJAN
           YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT.
           THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T
           KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL
           KEATON .

For the first time, Verbal stands and tries to move away from
Kujan, but Kujan stays in his face, backing him into a
corner. Verbal shields himself with his hands and shuts his

eyes.

                        KUJAN (CONT'D)
           TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW
           EVERYTHING .

                             VERBAL
           I don't know what you're talking about.

                             KUJAN
           YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING
           TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.

Verbal looks into Kujan's eyes with genuine terror. Kujan's
face is red, his body trembles. His locomotive breathing is
the only sound in the room.

                             VERBAL
           I don't understand what you're saying. I
           saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.

                             KUJAN
           Then why didn't you help him?

                             VERBAL
           I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure
           it was Keyser Soze at that point. I                        
           couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to
           him.

                             KUJAN
           But Keaton...

                             VERBAL
           It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean                    
           the Devil himself. How do you shoot the
           Devil in the back?

140  EXT. BARGE - NIGHT - ONE WEEK PRIOR                               140'

     Verbal is hiding in the tangle of girders and cables on the
     barge.

     VERBAL'S P.O.V.


     Keaton's body is completely obscured.
     The man in a suit strides across the deck over to Keaton,
     stopping to relieve himself on a small fire on the deck.
     He walks up and stands over Keaton. The two men exchange
     words and the man in the suit pulls out a pistol. He points
     it at Keaton.

     RED AND BLUE LIGHTS FLASH BEHIND VERBAL

     Verbal turns. He can just make out police cars coming in the
     distance.

     BANG

     Verbal hears a shot from the deck of the boat. He turns in
     time to see the man in the suit running across the deck
     toward the gangway.

     Verbal can barely see the man from where he is now. The man
     in the suit is covered by shadows and the poor angle from the
     barge. Verbal strains to see but he cannot.

     The man in the suit stops long enough to pull out a lighter.
     He turns and walks back across the deck and out of sight.
     A moment later flames leap up from on the deck.
     The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon at
     its base.                                                            

     MOVE INTO THE DARKNESS.                                              

     Sirens are close now. Almost here. The sound of fire raging
     out of control.

                Arturo Marquez. Ever hear of him?

                                 VERBAL
                Wha- No.

                                  KUJAN
                He was a stool pigeon for the Justice
                Department. He swore out a statement to
                Federal Marshals that he had seen and
                could positively identify one Keyser Soze
                and had intimate knowledge of his
                business, including, but not exclusive
                to, drug trafficking and murder.

                                 VERBAL
                I never heard of him.

                                  KUJAN
                His own people were selling him to a gang
                of Hungarians. Most likely the same
                Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out
                back in Turkey. The money wasn't there
                for dope. The Hungarians were going to
                buy the one guy that could finger Soze
                for them.

                                  VERBAL
                I said I never heard of him.


                                  KUJAN
                But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his
                extradition advisor. She knew who he was
                and what he knew.

                                 VERBAL

                                  KUJAN
                There were no drugs on that boat. It was
                a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the
                one man that could finger Keyser Soze so                  
                Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he
                knew he could march into certain death.

                                  VERBAL
                But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t
                us to kill someone?

           I'm saying Keaton did.

Verbal cannot grasp this. He squints, trying to understand.

                        KUJAN (CONT'D)
           Verbal, he left you behind for a reason.
           If you all knew Soze could find you
           anywhere, why was he ready to send you
           off with the money when he could have
           used you to take the boat?

                            VERBAL
           He wanted me to live.

                             KUJAN
           Why did he want you to live? A one-time                     
           dirty cop without a loyalty in the world
           finds it in his heart to save a worthless
           rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'

                            VERBAL
           Edie.

                             KUJAN
           I don't buy that reform story for a
           minute. And even if I did, I certainly
           don't believe he would send you to
           protect her. So why?

                            VERBAL
           Because he was my friend.

                             KUJAN
           No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton
           didn't have friends. He saved you because
           he wanted it that way. It was his will.

Verbal grinds to a mental halt, trying to grasp the
implication .

SUDDENLY:

                            VERBAL

           He used all of you to get him on that
           boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had
           to pull the trigger himself to make sure
           he got his man. The one man that could
           identify him.

           were close. You said it yourself. Where
           is the political pressure coming from?
           Why are you being protected? It's Keaton
           making sure you tell us what you're
           supposed to. Immunity is your reward.


                             VERBAL
           BUT WHY ME? WHY NOT HOCKNEY OR FENSTER OR
           McMANUS? I'm a cripple. I'm stupid. Why
           me?

Verbal hears the weight of his words and falls back in his
chair, Kujan looks at him with some pity,; but he is too far

in to stop.

                             KUJAN
           Because you're a cripple, Verbal. Because
           you're stupid. Because you were weaker
           than them. Because you couldn't see far
           enough into him to know the truth.

Verbal is crying now. He shakes his head, eyes closed.

                         KUJAN (CONT'D)
           If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is
           true, then it won't matter. It was his
           idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York,
           wasn't it? Tell me the truth.

                             VERBAL
                           (Sobbing)
           It was all Keaton. We followed him from
           the beginning.

Kujan smiles with triumphant satisfaction.

                         VERBAL (CONT'D)
           I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe
           he's dead. Christ

           Why lie about everything else, then?

                             VERBAL
           You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to
           know you'll never be good? Not good like
           you. You got good all fucked around. I
           mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I
           was never going to be good at anything
           'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't

           even a good thief. But I thought the one
           thing I could be good at was a keeping my
           mouth shut - keeping the code. I didn't
           want to tell you for my dignity, that's
           all, and you robbed me, Agent Kujan. You
           robbed me.

Kujan pulls the microphone out from under his tie and puts it +
on the desk. Verbal actually manages to snort a laugh, but
only briefly, overcome by an apparent wave of nausea.

                             KUJAN
           You're not safe on your own.

                            VERBAL
           You think he's..?

                             KUJAN
           Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal.                    
           It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a
           shield. Like you said, a spook story, but
           I know Keaton - and someone out there is
           pulling strings for you. Stay here and
           let us protect you.

                             VERBAL
           I'm not bait. No way. I post today.

           I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's
           tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than
           it is to buy a cop.

                             KUJAN
           Where are you going to go, Verbal? You
           gonna run? Turn states evidence. You
           might never see trial. If somebody wants
           to get you, you know They'll get you out
           there.

                             VERBAL
           Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan.
           You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep
           my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11
           keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by
           getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And

                They'll probably hear it from you.

     Verbal stands, mustering his shattered dignity and walks
     towards the door. Rabin opens it for him from outside.

     For once Kujan cannot bring himself to look at Verbal.
     Verbal turns to the door, stopping to look Rabin in the eye.
                            VERBAL (CONT'D)
                Fuckin' cops.

     He steps out of the room and into the hall. Rabin follows
     him.

142  INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                142

     Daniel Metzheiser comes out of Arkosh Kovash's room with a
     single sheet of 15x20 inch paper in his hand. He inspects the
     sketch with great interest. He folds the edges of the paper
     back to make it smaller.

143  INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION ROOM                                       143

     Metzheiser walks behind the reception desk without asking the
     nurse for permission and helps himself to the fax machine.

144  INT. DEPOT - LATER                                                 144

     Verbal is downstairs in the depot of the police station
     picking up his personal belongings.

     A FAT, WHITE-HAIRED COP is checking off the items as he takes
     them out of the tray in which they are kept.

                                    COP
                One watch: gold. One cigarette lighter:
                gold. One wallet: brown. One pack of                       
                cigarettes.

     Verbal collects his personal items and shuffles on his lame
     leg toward the exit.

145 INT. DISPATCHER'S OFFICE                                            145

     Jack Baer stands by a fax machine. A green light comes on
     next to a digital display.

     The display reads: RECEIVING

     Kujan stares solemnly at the bulletin board, drinking from
     Rabin's coffee cup. Rabin sits at the desk, sifting through
     the mound of gapers as though considering organizing them
     once and for all.

                                  RAB IN
                You still don't know shit.

                Which is shit.

                No matter. He'll have to know how close
                we came.

                                  RAB IN
                Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive
                he'll never come up again.

                                  KUJAN

                Nothing. Something I - forget it.

     Kujan shakes his head. He gestures to the desk.

                             KUJAN (CONT'D)
                Man, you're a fucking slob.

     Rabin regards the mess of his office.

                Yeah. It's got it's own system though. It

                now that's a horror show...                               

     Kujan is not listening. He has been staring at the bulletin
     board, lost in thought, his unfocused eyes drifting across
     the mess of papers, not looking at anything at all.

147  EXT. STREET                                                         147

     Verbal steps out into the sunlight, putting on a pair of
     cheap sunglasses. He looks up and down the crowded street.
     People on their way to and from lunch, no doubt.

     Cars choke the street in front of the police department as
     they wait for pedestrians to clear the way.

148  INT. DISPATCHER'S OFFICE                                    - 148

     A single sheet of paper comes out of the fax machine, face
     down.

     Kujan still stares at the bulletin board.

     SUDDENLY, Kujan's face changes. He leans in closer to the
     bulletin board and squints his eyes. His face changes again.

     First a look of puzzlement, then confusion - finally
     realization.

     The coffee cup tumbles from his hand. It hits the floor with
     the SMASH of cheap porcelain. Coffee splatters everywhere.

     Rabin snaps out of his droning and looks up in surprise.

     KUJAN'S P.O.V.

     Kujan is staring not at what is on the bulletin board, but at
     the bulletin board itself.

     His eyes follow the aluminum frame, mounted firmly to the
     wall. One might note it's sturdy construction and it's
     convenient size. Big enough to hold a lifetime of forgotten
     and disregarded notes and facts. Years of police trivia that
     has been hung and forgotten with the intention of finding a
     use for it all someday. One might want such a bulletin board
     for one's self. One would look to see who makes such a               
     bulletin board.
     Kujan's eyes are locked on a metal plate bearing the
     manufacturer's name.

      It reads: QUARTET - SKOKIE, ILLINOIS
      Kujan's eyes flash all' over the bulletin board. He finds a
      picture of Rabin in the far corner. He stands beside a scale
      in fishing gear. He proudly holds a hand out to his freshly
      caught marlin. His eyes skim quickly over and stop on an
      eight and a half by eleven inch fax sheet of what must be a
      THREE HUNDRED POUND BLACK MAN. Kujan glazes over his name, it
      is irrelevant. His aliases stand out.

      Slavin, BRICKS, Shank, REDFOOT, Thee, Rooster...

      KUJAN'S EYES WIDEN with sudden realization. He runs for the
      door.

      His foot crushes the broken pieces of Rabin's coffee cup. The
      cup that hovered over Verbal's head for two hours.

      Kujan is in too much of a hurry to notice the two words
      printed on the jagged piece that had been the bottom of the
      cheap mug.

                           KOBAYASHI PORCELAIN.

      Kujan is sprinting wildly down the hall for the stairs.

      Verbal looks behind him and sees ANOTHER COP standing just          
      inside the doorway, lighting a cigarette. The cop notices
      Verbal and watches him in the way that cops look at people
      they cannot place in the category of idiot citizen, or stupid
      criminal.

      Verbal smiles politely, meekly at the cop and walks down the
      steps into the moving throng.

      Kujan runs up to the desk where Verbal had only moments
      before picked up his belongings. Rabin is right behind him, a
      look of absolute confusion on his face.

                                   KUJAN

     The cog gestures towards the door.

     Kujan runs outside looking around frantically.

     Verbal limps his way carefully across the sidewalk, avoiding
     people as best as he can.

     He looks over his shoulder, getting farther away from the
     police station. He can see Rabin and the cop on the steps,
     looking around with strange, lost expressions on their faces.

     He does not notice the car creeping along the curb beside
     him.

     The driver's hands tap the wheel patiently. His eyes follow

     LOW ANGLE on the feet of dozens of people.
     Verbal's feet emerge from the crowd on the far side. They
     hobble along the curb.

     SUDDENLY, the right foot seems to relax a little, the inward
     angle straightens itself out in a few paces and the limp
     ceases as though the leg has grown another inch.

     CRANE UP VERBAL'S BODY

     Verbal's hands are rummaging around in his pockets. The good
     left hand comes up with a pack of cigarettes, the bad right
     hand comes up with a lighter. The right hand flexes with all

           of the grace and coordination of a sculptor's, flicking the
           clasp on the antique lighter with the thumb, striking the
           flint with the index finger. It is a fluid motion, somewhat
           showy.

           Verbal lights a cigarette and smiles to himself. He turns and
           sees the car running alongside.

           Jack Beer pulls the sheet out of the fax machine and turns it
           over, revealing the composite sketch of Keyser SOZE.                  

           Though crude and distorted, one cannot help but notice how
           much it leaks like VERBAL KINT.

           The car stops. The driver gets out.
           IT IS KOBAYASHI, or the man we have come to know as such. He
           smiles to Verbal. Verbal steps off of the curb, returning the
           smile as he opens the passenger door and gets in.

           The man called Kobayashi gets in the driver's seat and pulls
           away .
           A moment later, Agent David Kujan of U.S. Customs wanders
           into the frame, looking around much in the way a child would
           when lost at the circus. He takes no notice of the car
           pulling out into traffic, blending in with the rest of the
           cars filled with people on their way back to work.

          ON BLACK
          We hear a whooshing sound, getting louder.

          A BLINK OF AN IMAGE
          New York City from a perspective of flight, not an
          airplane, a swooping diving shot. Back to black.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE
          Abre los ojos... open your eyes...
          open your eyes...

          INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

          DAVID AAMES, JR., 32, swings out of bed and sits on the
          corner of his mattress. it's a chilly New York City
          morning. Early sunlight glows around the corner's of his
          curtains.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE
          open your eyes...
          He reaches behind him to shut off a slim voice-activated
          clock-radio. He rises, a comforter draped around his
          shoulders, and heads to the bathroom.

          INT. DAVID'S BATHROOM - MORNING

          David regards himself in the mirror of a beautifully-tiled
          and well-appointed bathroom. in his thirties now, his
          looks have only deepened and improved. He brushes his
          teeth. He spots a gray hair, and holding tweezers, seizes
          and plucks it.

          INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - MORNING

          David puts on a shirt. Checks his wallet for money. His
          bedroom is elegant and spare.

          INT. DAVID'S NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT - MORNING

          He slips down the stairs into the expansive living area of
          this deeply-textured apartment. A stunning, inherited book
          collection lines the walls.

          INT./EXT. NEW YORK CITY GARAGE BELOW APARTMENT/STREETS -


          MORNING
          David starts up his dark green sports car, and roars onto
          the New York City streets.

          EXT. NEW YORK SIDE STREETS u- MORNING
          David travels the side-streets to work. He senses a
          growing weirdness. The streets are empty. He looks at. his
          watch. It's        8:12.  He continues anxiously. Runs a red
          light. Music rises.

          EXT. TIMES SQUARE -- MORNING

          The most recognized piece of real-estate in the world is
          silent. It is as if the world's biggest parade has just
          left, taking everybody with it. David pulls over
          haphazardly. He exits the car, leaving it in the middle of
          the street. He begins to walk, faster now, as music rises.
          All the electricity is on. There is absolutely nobody in
          sight. David begins to run, searching for humanity. The
          billboards - electronic and still - all sell easy solutions
          to his loneliness. He pulls up short., stopping and crying
          out in anguish. There is no one left in the world.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE
          Open your eyes... open your eyes,
          David...

          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

          David hangs out of bed, his mouth in an open silent scream.
          Covers his face with both hands.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE
          . open your eyes...
          He reaches behind to shut off the same clock-radio, and its
          voice.  He makes a relieved agonized sound into the
          pillow. Gets up, sees a pizza box... a container of
          soup... a remote control on the floor. We hear an incisive
          voice with a comforting lilt - a man we'll meet later.

          A MAN'S VOICE
          Well, I suppose the empty street
          meant loneliness.

          DAVID'S VOICE
          You're a shrink. You've got to do
          better than that.

          A MAN'S VOICE
          I'm a doctor. Let's not
          stereotype each other. Not all
          rich kids are soul-less, and not
          all psychologists care about
          dreams. The question is how you

          

          

          

          

          3
          got here, and why you've been
          charged.

          DAVID'S VOICE
          What do you want to know? I was
          about to turn 33. I ran three
          magazines, and a world-wide
          publishing house. On most days I
          actually fooled myself into
          believing it would last forever.

          INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

          David checks himself in the mirror. Seizes and plucks that
          same gray hair.

          DAVID'S VOICE
          Isn't that what being young is
          about? Believing secretly that
          you would be the one person, in
          the history of man, who would live
          forever?

          INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

          David enters, reaching for his wallet, repeating the
          morning ritual. A figure stirs in the bed behind him. She
          leans upward, wearing David's college basketball tank for a
          pajama-top. She's warm and wicked, a mildly reformed party
          girl, the kind of girl first-novels are written about. She
          is JULIANNA GIANNI,25.

          JULIANNA
          Where you going so early?

          DAVID
          (slightly self-conscious)
          Hey, don't record any more
          messages on my alarm--clock, okay?

          JULIANNA
          Why not?

          DAVID
          I'll think we're married or
          something.

          JULIANNA
          Don't you ever say that word. Or
          I'll never come over here and
          bring you chicken soup and fuck
          your brains out again.

          DAVID  (O.S.)
          (exiting, from other
          room)
          How's your cold?

          JULIANNA
          Still there. How's yours?

          DAVID  (U.S..)
          I guess you took my mind off it.
          She pulls a pink pill-box purse from the nightstand,
          withdraws a multi-colored phone.

          JULIANNA
          Reyna, it's Julianna. I missed my
          audition.
          (dramatic, like Bette Davis)
          I lost my head. Listen, I have to
          go.
          (whispers)
          I'm with David.

          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

          David in his steel-and-linoleum bachelor kitchen. Julie
          swings into view. Her blouse is unbuttoned two buttons
          too many, down to mid-chest. She gives him a kiss on the
          cheek and lingers. David grabs a racquetball bag, talks to
          the next. room.

          DAVID
          Help yourself to whatever you
          want. Set the alarm, Maria will
          clean up. Lock up when you go.
          And... you are the greatest.

          JULIANNA
          Bye "honey!"

          DAVID
          Bye "honey!" I'll call you later.

          JULIANNA
          When? When?

          DAVID
          Soon!
          They have a comfortable, healthy, mutually satisfying,
          gloriously superficial relationship.

          

          

          

          

          5

          INT./EXT. NEW YORK CITY GARAGE/STREETS - DAY

          David is about to enter the green sports car, then thinks
          better of it. He fires up a knock-around beater car from
          his collection. He drives into the street which is,
          comfortingly, now full of people. We hear R.E.M.'s "All
          The Right Friends."

          EXT. NEW YORK SIDE-STREETS - DAY

          David drives the crowded streets.        It all seems more
          poignant today. Life is good again.

          EXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

          David pulls up to a lower-end apartment, checks his watch.
          Enter the hung-over BRIAN SHELBY,        30ish. In a world of
          acquaintances, Brian is a true friend.   He has all the
          qualities of Abe Lincoln and, much to his chagrin, the
          looks too. He hops in the car with racquetball bag.

          DAVID
          Did you reserve the court?

          BRIAN
          Easy. I can't handle heavy
          conversation at this ungodly hour.

          DAVID
          I'm sorry to do this early. I
          gotta be done by 10.
          Car phone rings. David checks Caller ID - it's his office.
          He clicks on.

          ASSISTANT VOICE   (RACHEL)
          You're not going to make the 8:45,
          are you?

          DAVID
          How did you find me?

          RACHEL'S VOICE
          David Aames, you have to check the
          colors of the letters for the new
          issue of Rise.

          DAVID
          What are the colors?

          RACHEL'S VOICE
          Yellow-and-red... or the
          traditional white.

          

          

          

          

          6

          DAVID
          Let, me think about it.

          RACHEL'S VOICE
          David, please. Don't be late for
          the ten o'clock with the board.

          DAVID
          Okay, but. don't tell anybody where
          I am I don't care if God calls.
          I'm very busy.

          BRIAN
          Can't you just get rid of that
          board?

          DAVID
          The Seven Dwarves? No.

          BRIAN
          Those people drive you nuts.

          DAVID
          And that was the desire of my
          father, who hired them.

          BRIAN
          (suspicious pause)
          You fucked Julie Gianni again,
          didn't you?
          David takes off driving.

          INT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY - DRIVING


          BRIAN
          I know someone was there when I
          called. You had that tone.
          (imitates nasal phone
          voice)
          Oh, no man, I've got a cold. I'm
          hanging in tonight.

          DAVID
          (shaky defense)
          I had a cold. I was alone.

          BRIAN
          Fine. You can do whatever you
          want with your life -

          DAVID
          Thanks.

          

          

          

          

          7

          BRIAN
          -- but one day you'll know what
          love truly is. It's the sour and
          the sweet. And I know sour which
          allows me to appreciate the sweet.

          DAVID
          Julie Gi.anni is a friend.
          Sometimes we sleep together.
          Brian howls in pain, like a hurt dog.

          DAVID
          What --

          BRIAN
          My dream girl... Julie Gianni...
          is your... fuck buddy.
          Brian emits another pained howl. David reaches over to
          change the music.

          DAVID
          What do you want to listen to?

          BRIAN
          Slow down, man.

          DAVID
          What have we got here - Barcelona,
          Looper... Radiohead?
          Brian freezes at what he sees.

          BRIAN
          Look out! Look out!
          David turns and sees he's hurtling into the back of a car
          stopped just in front of him. Clenching he hits the
          brakes, narrowly avoiding a high-speech collision. And
          then... to his right... another car comes hurtling toward
          him... and stops within an inch of deadly impact.           There
          is an awful moment, as the second car blares on the horn.
          Traffic continues, but the lingering feeling of dread and
          confusion is still in the air.

          BRIAN
          Fuck!

          DAVID
          (annoyed)
          We almost died.

          

          

          

          

          8

          BRIAN
          I know. My own death was right
          there in front of me, and you know
          what happened? Your life flashed
          before my eyes.

          DAVID
          How was it?

          BRIAN
          Almost worth dying for.
          Pedestrians continue walking around the honking tangled
          mass of the near-.accident.

          EXT. AAMES PUBLICATIONS - DAY

          David meets Peter Brown and RACHEL, his second assistant,
          at. the front of the well-appointed headquarters of Aames
          Publications. Aames hops out of car and heads into the
          building.

          INT. AAMES PUBLICATIONS - DAY

          David Aames Jr. turns down the corridor of Rise Magazine, a
          male youth-culture-style magazine. Rachel gives him daily
          tabloid reports, continues with the essentials.

          RACHEL
          The art department needs a
          decision on the colors. Yellow-
          and- red, or white? And the
          board is pissed you're late.

          DAVID
          You changed your hair.
          David taps on the window of the art department, in panic
          over several cover mock-ups. He gives a presidential
          thumbs-up, moves on. They look at each other, trying to
          decipher if the thumbs-up was a decision.

          ART EDITOR
          Did he mean the yellow-and-red or
          the white?
          David passes a holdover from the old days, older
          Receptionist       (BEATRICE) who speaks uncomfortably and
          gruffly into a headset. She gives David a knowing look -
          late again.

          RACHEL
          They're all waiting for you. And
          David - opinions are expected.

          A MAN'S VOICE
          Do you dream about the Board,
          David? The Seven Dwarves, as you
          call them?
          David walks into the office. Framed original photos from
          album covers co-mingle with a splash of cultured art and
          books. Seven very-interested and very-alert looking Older
          Executives wait.

          DAVID (V.0.)
          Sneezy, Bashful, Sleepy, Happy,
          Doc, Dopey, and of course, Grumpy.

          GRUMPY
          (skeptical)
          How was Aspen?

          DAVID
          (playful, mock drama)
          Good. Now I want answers, and I
          want them now.
          (pause)
          How's it going?
          He gestures charmingly, easily, and bows with apology over
          his lateness. All are happy to see him. Sort of.

          DAVID'S VOICE
          They still look at me like I was
          still eleven years old.

          FLASHBACK
          David at          11, blithely skateboarding the hallways. He
          passes Beatrice, who turns to an editor.

          The light from a small line of chicken-wired windows cuts
          through the blackness. In the shadows of this dank room,
          we hear his voice but we do not see him. It is the
          smaller, slightly muffled tone of David Aames. In the
          shadows, he wears a mask.

          MCCABE
          You're scared of your dreams,
          aren't you?

          Portrait of CURTIS McCABE, 52.            Doctor of Psychiatry,
          prison division. He's far too wily to spend the currency
          of his brilliance just yet. It's too early in their
          relationship. He stands tall, leaning on a steel desk,
          polishing his glasses with end of his coat.

          DAVID
          It's a nightmare either way.

          MCCABE
          Is that how do you explain what's
          happened to you?

          DAVID
          What --

          MCCABE
          What happened to your face?

          DAVID
          I'm not talking to you anymore.

          MCCABE
          And you don't want to show me your
          face.

          DAVID
          No.

          David - the part where we parry
          and joust, and get to know each
          other bit-by-bit... we're going to
          have to skip it. You've been
          charged with murder. In four
          weeks, a judge will determine your
          fate based on what I write. You
          will talk to me --

          DAVID
          There is no murder! It didn't
          happen! I don't have to talk to
          anybody!
          A Contentious Prison Guard (AARON) swings his feet down and
          gets up from watching a 17-inch television on a stool. He
          exits into the bigger room to quiet down David Aames.

          You want me to help -

          DAVID
          Get the fuck away from me.

          AARON
          Take it easy, sunshine.

          DAVID
          Get the fuck away from me.

          AARON
          Take it easy, Face. Your whole
          story is full of holes!
          With great power, McCabe advances on the guard. His
          presence, when he turns on the switches, is considerable.

          MCCABE.
          Stop! Please leave. Right now.
          I'll take responsibility.

          AARON
          (whispering, exiting)
          I'm gonna get you, Daddy's boy
          little freak.

          DAVID
          My parents are dead, you fuck!

          MCCABE
          Enough!
          The Contentious Guard leaves.

          MCCABE
          Is it true?

          DAVID
          (sing-song)
          Good cop... bad cop.

          MCCABE
          That you're a Daddy's boy?

          DAVID
          (in darkness, by rote)
          Primer on David Aames, Senior. My
          father was not built for the 21st
          Century. He never ate at

          

          

          

          

          12
          McDonald's, not once, and never
          watched television. Yet his
          biggest magazine is still TV
          Digest. He and my mother threw
          the grandest parties of the
          literary world. He ballooned,
          jumped from planes, sought
          adventure... His autobiography is
          the manual for every cutthroat
          publisher in New York. It's
          called Defending the Kingdom.

          MCCABE
          I've read it. Page  127.           "David
          Junior was a delight as a child."
          Did I miss something here? Is
          that all he wrote about you?

          DAVID
          I don't think he ever got over the
          fact that I was terrified of
          heights. And when he and my
          mother were run over by a drunken
          teenager on New Year's Eve, ten
          years ago...
          David Aames moves closer to the light. We see a strange
          bland expression of his mask, at first other--worldly... and
          then more clearly.

          DAVID
          he left the keys to the
          Kingdom to me...    51% control,   49%
          going to a group of seven board
          members who all thought they were
          first in line.

          MCCABE
          And you believe the Board, the
          Seven Dwarves, put you here to
          take control of your company.

          DAVID
          What do you care?

          MCCABE
          We're just talking. And tonight's
          Wednesday night, and I go to Black
          Angus for dinner with my daughters
          on Wednesday nights, so I'll have
          to leave soon. You understand
          that our time is limited, don't
          you?

          

          

          

          

          13

          DAVID
          If I talk, you'll just think I'm
          crazy.
          McCabe gathers his things.

          MCCABE
          With all the respect I can offer a
          man wearing a latex mask and
          spouting conspiracy theories,
          David, trust me - you've crossed
          that bridge.

          DAVID
          Fine. Enjoy your dinner.
          Somehow the lilt in McCabe's voice draws him closer.

          MCCABE
          There are five basic emotions in
          life. Tell me. what emotion
          gripped... him... before he
          entered that cell? Was it Guilt?
          Shadows. There is no answer, just a rustling and a growing
          sense of anticipation in the darkness.

          MCCABE
          Hate? Shame?
          Shadows. Still no answer.

          MCCABE
          Revenge...
          McCabe now shows the invisible skill with which he has
          brought his client to the precipice. And now, with one
          word, he invites David Aames to look over.

          MCCABE
          Love?
          In the darkness, a rustling and the slight turn of a head.

          MCCABE
          I'm completely on the wrong track,
          aren't I?

          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT/BACK ROOM OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT

          From the darkened back room, David Aames appears with ice,
          and re-enters his party.

          DAVID
          Who needs ice?
          Aames moves swirls is more like it - through into his
          party, which is nicely underway. Upscale. Modern. Part
          literary crowd. Part fashion crowd.       He's great in a
          crowd. Surrounded by people, David Aames comes alive.

          DAVID MOVES THROUGH PARTY
          catching the attention of a model.        (LYNETTE)

          LYNETTE
          David! Happy Birthday.

          DAVID
          Jesus, you have the greatest taste
          in shoes I've ever seen. Bar
          none. Anywhere.
          A Woman Caterer in Whites    (EMMA) slips by with a knowing
          smile.

          EMMA THE CATERER
          The old place sure looks more
          crowded with people in it.

          DAVID
          Emma, do you know Lynette?

          EMMA THE CATERER
          No, but I shudder to think what. we
          might have in common.
          David notices that Brian Shelby has arrived with a guest, a
          Woman who struggles with a package and a very large coat.
          On first glance, she's just another girl. On second
          glance, she's a killer. He notes her oddly funny behavior.
          She removes the coat to reveal a very simple natural
          beauty. She is SOFIA SERRANO, a 27 year-old city girl with
          a barely containable life-force. Enter PETER BROWN,
          David's male assistant with surreptitious headset. He
          gestures to a stereo appliance set up in David's living
          room.

          PETER BROWN
          The Living Stereo system is online
          and looking great. it's an

          

          

          

          

          15
          amazing prototype. They'd love an
          article on it if you like it...
          David nods, still focused on Sofia. Suddenly, he finds he
          can't take his eyes off her.

          PETER BROWN
          and happy birthday, sir.

          ANGLE ON FRONT ENTRANCE
          as David arrives to greet Brian and his guest.

          BRIAN
          Hey man. Happy birthday and all
          the usual shit people say to each
          other. How you doing?

          DAVID
          Livin' the dream, baby. Livin'
          the dream.
          The two friends hug. David shares a quick glance with
          Brian's date, who still burdened with coat.

          BRIAN
          (to Sofia, as in 'meet the
          notorious...')
          Meet David Aames.

          DAVID
          (can't help but flirt)
          And to what do I owe this
          pleasure, the pleasure of --

          SOFIA
          (playful)
          -- the pleasure of Sofia. Serrano.

          BRIAN
          We met today at the library, if
          you can believe that --

          SOFIA
          I'm sorry about my coat. It's too
          big for your closet.

          BRIAN
          - we were both pretending to be
          intellectuals.

          DAVID
          No no, I think it's amazing. I
          love your coat.

          

          

          

          

          16

          SOFIA
          I overdressed. I mean I
          underdressed.

          BRIAN
          I'll just continue like you're
          both actually listening to me.

          SOFIA
          (to David)
          Do you have another room to put it
          in?

          BRIAN
          (invisible, re: their chemistry)
          I have ceased to exist.

          DAVID
          Well, Madison Square Garden is
          nearby, it might fit there.

          SOFIA
          (shoves David playfully,
          as in touche)
          Happy Birthday.
          Her upbeat physicality is intoxicating. Sofia hands David
          her present.

          BRIAN
          We picked it out together.
          Neither look at Brian. Brian takes a breath. He's been
          here before.

          DAVID
          Thank you.

          BRIAN
          We picked it out together. We...

          SOFIA
          Welcome.

          BRIAN
          Stop flirting and open it.

          DAVID
          Okay.

          BRIAN
          Let's get a drink.

          

          

          

          

          17

          SOFIA
          Okay.

          DAVID
          I'll leave this upstairs.
          David exits. They are left to consider his personal
          charisma.

          ANGLE ON A HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY CONNECTED TO STEREO
          An odd and disarmingly beautiful display of Coltrane
          performing "My Favorite Things" in David's living room.
          Sofia passes a hand through Coltrane's image, admires it.

          ON DAVID
          David is approached by THOMAS TIPP, a Brit, and an
          Associate board-member at Aames Publications. Tipp is ten
          years older than David, and he is the rarest of birds. A
          sentimental lawyer. And at the moment he's a bit drunk.

          DAVID
          Hey Tommy.
          David moves to address him so he can still track Sofia.

          TIPP
          Hey.  Listen to me. Don't blow
          me off. I'm all packed, I'm going
          back to London and I understand.
          You put me up for that other
          attorney's job, so you didn't have
          to fire me. A classy move, and
          your father would have done the
          same ---

          DAVID
          It's okay, Tommy --

          TIPP
          I became incompetent. Is there
          anything more unbecoming than an
          aging mascot? I cared about your
          father. I lived and breathed for
          him. But these guys, the board,
          they think you're stupid.  A
          corporate hazard, a rogue.
          But the word "stupid" is what David heard loudest of all.
          Nearby, we see a Woman Partner          (one of the Seven Dwarves)
          taking a quick look at David.

          

          

          

          

          18

          TIPP
          But they're going to find a way to
          get you out. They're lined up for
          your office -
          David scans the room. Beneath the good cheer, he sees the
          other layer. Lying. Disloyalty. All part of the
          institution he enjoys forgetting exists. Each word bashes
          his soul.

          TIPP
          -- your job. Your life. Your
          position. They are working day
          and night. to cheat you out of your
          51% vote. And they are going to
          sell this tradition, this
          tradition of words, so they can
          eat at a better cafeteria. And
          what they don't know is this -
          (gestures grandly to
          books that surround
          them)
          - people will read again.
          David's gaze falls upon Sofia, who is looking directly at
          him. And for one blinding moment, something passes between
          them. She looks away. He feels saved.

          DAVID
          (interrupting with
          finality)
          I got it.

          TIPP
          They even have a nickname for you
          behind your back.
          David smiles faintly. Understandingly.   Tipp kisses him
          on the cheek, boldly and drunkenly. He feels like a hero
          to himself.

          TIPP
          Citizen Dildo.
          David flinches, just a little.

          TIPP
          Now you've got great instincts.
          But I say this with complete love.
          Claim your life... Learn to be an
          Asshole... Don't be         -

          

          

          

          

          19

          DAVID
          (extracting himself)
          Two's enough -

          TIPP
          Don ' t be-
          (immediately)
          Okay. Forgive me. I still
          believe in this family. Even if
          it's only you.
          David continues tracking Sofia as he slips over to Peter
          Brown.

          DAVID
          Get Tipp out of here, drive him
          home, and in the morning tell him
          he's re-hired with a 50% raise.
          Set up a meeting with the other
          attorneys. I'm going to be in
          early tomorrow --
          (a look from Peter Brown)
          -- earlier than usual.

          INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          David enters, shuts the door and sets Sofia's present down.
          A party dress is on his bed.

          JULIANNA
          Hello handsome.
          He turns to see Julie Gianni in the bathroom doorway,
          wrapped in a comforter.

          JULIANNA
          I've come to wish you happy
          birthday.

          DAVID
          I didn't invite you, Julie.

          JULIANNA
          Yeah, that was a little weird -

          DAVID
          But that's how it works with
          parties. You have to be invited.

          JULIANNA
          I'm mad at you, you dick. We made
          love four times the other night.

          

          

          

          

          20

          DAVID
          Is that good?

          JULIANNA
          Two is good. Three is very good.
          But four -

          DAVID
          (fishing for a
          compliment)
          Four is pretty good?

          JULIANNA
          No, four is... four is... just
          hold me.

          DAVID
          Four is what?

          JULIANNA
          Hold me, and then I'll leave, and
          you can go talk to that cute
          brunette.

          DAVID
          Four is what?

          JULIANNA
          I don't want to meet your fancy
          friends. I knew 'em all back when
          I was fancy too.
          He holds her. They talk in between friendly kisses.

          DAVID
          Four is what?
          She pulls away, and talks plainly to him.

          JULIANNA
          She looks like a moth, David.

          DAVID
          A moth?

          JULIANNA
          Sometimes I worry about one of
          these clever girls in a big silly
          coat who'll play you in just the
          right way, and I'll lose my
          friend. And there'll be no more
          chicken soup parties for you and
          me.

          

          

          

          

          21
          She kisses him again. David very gently, and skillfully
          resists. She gets the message.

          JULIANNA
          When will you call me? And don't
          say soon. I hate it when you say
          "soon."

          INT. PARTY -- NIGHT

          Sofia eyes a framed smashed guitar handsomely mounted in a
          glass display case.

          SOFIA
          So this is what's become of rock
          and roll. A smashed guitar behind
          a glass case displayed on some
          rich guy's wall.

          DAVID
          It was a gift, actually.
          She turns and sees it's David, engaging smile in place.
          She jumps slightly.

          SOFIA
          (apologetic)
          I like it.
          She turns and walks away, David following close behind.

          DAVID
          Whoa, whoa, whoa.

          SOFIA
          - how did you get all this stuff,
          this apartment, this life -
          David is looking just over her shoulder. She turns to see
          an almost disturbingly large portrait of David Aames, Sr.
          She turns back.

          SOFIA
          I see.

          DAVID
          How about if you help me? Unless
          I'm horning in here.

          SOFIA
          You are, but the food's good.

          

          

          

          

          22

          DAVID
          (playful, like a spy)
          See, I've got a little problem.
          I've got a stalker.

          SOFIA
          It doesn't. sound life-threatening.
          Someone passes, bumping her slightly, into him.

          DAVID
          I need a cover. I need for you to
          pretend we're having a
          scintillating conversation. And
          you're wildly entertained. I know
          it's tough.

          SOFIA
          I'll improvise    -

          DAVID
          She's right across the room and
          she's burning a hole in my back
          right now, isn't she?

          SOFIA
          Red dress, strappy shoes?

          DAVID
          Yes_

          SOFIA
          (beat, jarred)
          -- wow, she's really staring at
          you.

          DAVID
          Shit.

          SOFIA
          And she seems to be growing...
          less happy.

          DAVID
          Hmm.

          SOFIA
          I think she's the saddest girl to
          ever hold a martini.
          Julie Gianni sits on the steps watching. The girl, and the
          dress, looked much happier in the bedroom. Julie rises and
          begins to move.

          

          

          

          

          23

          ON BRIAN
          Brian holds a drink, attempts to crash a conversation
          between two models. His debonair act is shaky.

          INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE   -- NIGHT

          David and Sofia race up the stairs. Bad kids having fun.

          SOFIA
          You have another apartment?

          DAVID
          Sort of a day office. Come on -
          They arrive at the door to a smaller upstairs apartment.

          SOFIA
          I'm not going in there.

          DAVID
          Well I am. Goodnight.
          He enters and shuts the door. Frustrated, she stands for    a
          moment, listening to the music streaming from the
          downstairs apartment. We watch her private moment as she
          decides to leave him, turns, feels the emotional pull,
          dances back and knocks sharply three times.

          SOFIA
          I hear her coming.

          DAVID (0.5.)
          Really?

          SOFIA
          No.
          David pulls her inside. Shuts the door behind them.

          INT. PARTY - NIGHT

          Julianna and Brian, both looking for David, discover each
          other.

          INT. HOME APARTMENT/OFFICE - NIGHT

          Artwork on the walls. Sofia is drawn to a powerful
          Monet... and it is not a copy.

          DAVID
          We're safe.      And I've got nothing
          to drink...

          

          

          

          

          24

          SOFIA
          Who did these paintings?

          DAVID
          This is Joni Mitchell. This one
          is Monet. And this one is done by
          me.
          (as a tour guide)
          It is a snowboard.

          SOFIA
          Well, two of them are geniuses.
          (laughs)

          DAVID
          (off the Monet)
          It's the real thing. His
          paintbrush painted that vanilla
          sky. His canvas. It. was my
          mother's.

          INT. PARTY - NIGHT

          Julianna and Brian hold their private conversation by a
          piano. They are bonded, almost mesmerized by their mutual
          fascination for David.

          INT. DAVID'S OTHER APARTMENT -- NIGHT

          David and Sofia laugh.

          DAVID
          You know what I think? You're
          either a very good actress or you
          really do sort of like me.

          SOFIA
          I am an actress.

          DAVID
          There's probably not too much you
          aren't great at.

          SOFIA
          Are you about to compliment, my
          phone voice?

          DAVID
          It's pretty good, you know -

          SOFIA
          Oh, I'd only disappoint, you. See
          - I'm not. qualified. I can spell.

          

          

          

          

          25

          DAVID
          I'm surprised you're available.

          SOFIA
          I'm surprised you're surprised.

          DAVID
          I can't keep this banter going.

          SOFIA
          Me neither.
          Beat. They drop the act. A powerful, awkward moment... and
          the door opens.

          BRIAN
          I caught you.

          SOFIA
          Brian! Come in here!

          DAVID
          What's going on --

          BRIAN
          Your friends are fun and I'm
          drunk.

          DAVID
          (cheerful)
          Julie Gianni is stalking me.

          SOFIA
          She looked dangerous.

          BRIAN
          Nobody stalks me. So I drink.

          DAVID
          Well, we're out of drinks up here.

          BRIAN
          Here, finish my Jack and Coke.
          He messily tries to hand his drink to David, but spills it
          embarrassingly. All his cool is gone, and what's left are
          his friends covering for him, cleaning up.

          DAVID
          These stupid glasses        -

          BRIAN
          No, it's the stupid guy holding
          it.

          

          

          

          

          26

          SOFIA
          (embarrassed)
          Don't worry. I'll get. us all
          something. Jacks and Cokes?
          She exits, leaving the two friends.

          BRIAN
          I better hit it. I drank too much
          and I didn't fucking eat.

          DAVID
          Don't be stupid. The party's just
          starting.

          BRIAN
          (moving away)
          For you it is.

          DAVID
          You can't go. You're my guest of
          honor.

          BRIAN
          Fuck you, David. You're paying me
          to write my novel, so you own me.

          DAVID
          I don't own you. You're
          brilliant, you're good-looking,
          you're handsome.

          BRIAN
          But why'd you have to hit on
          Sofia?

          DAVID
          No one's hitting on Sofia.

          BRIAN
          Fine. Whatever you say.               I'm
          crazy, I'm blind.

          DAVID
          No, you're not blind. You're just
          drinking Jack Daniels. And when
          you drink Jack, you start. in with
          that Frank Sinatra, "She Shot. Me
          Down," gimme a cigarette, King of
          Sad thing...

          BRIAN
          That. I do. Gimme a cigarette.

          

          

          

          

          27

          DAVID
          I'll find one.

          BRIAN
          But wait. You're rich and women
          love you and I'm from Ohio and I'm
          drunk. Can I tell you the truth?

          DAVID
          Everyone does.

          BRIAN
          I dig her.        And I've never said
          this to you before, about any
          girl. But she could be... could
          be could be could be... the girl
          of my fuckin dreams.

          DAVID
          You're not from Ohio.

          BRIAN
          I know.

          BRIAN
          But if she fucks tip our friendship
          - she can go to hell. I won't
          allow it!         We are bros.

          DAVID
          I feel the same way.

          BRIAN
          (wishes he believed it)
          Sure you do.
          Brianprepares to leave, as Sofia returns with   drinks.

          SOFIA
          Where you going?

          BRIAN
          I am Frank. And Frank must go.

          SOFIA
          Huh?

          BRIAN
          I good you bid evening.
          Sofialooks at her watch, and the situation.

          SOFIA
          Hang on, I'll go with you.

          

          

          

          

          28

          BRIAN
          Stay, baby.

          DAVID
          I'll give you a lift home later.

          SOFIA
          No, I have to work tomorrow.

          BRIAN
          You're in great. hands.
          (beat, realizing it's
          over)
          I'm just humoring myself that my
          opinion matters.
          Brian looks at the two of them. Life is telling him, and
          he knows it's time to go. Portrait of a man who will not
          get what. he wants. David notes the poetry in his friend.

          BRIAN
          (leans in close to David)
          You will never know the exquisite
          pain of the guy who goes home
          alone. Because without. the
          bitter, baby, the sweet ain't as
          sweet. Have a good time.
          He exits like a champ, a glorious sad-sack, with a hand
          flourish.

          DAVID
          The Sweet and Sour speech again.

          INT. PARTY

          Julie Gianni dances, her eyes closed, her hand around a
          strange man's neck.

          EXT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT __ NIGHT

          They stand nervously out in front of her apartment. In the
          distance, rain.

          DAVID
          A lot of people are scared of
          heights. It's not the heights
          that bother me, it's the impact
          that terrifies me.
          (off her look)
          I won't stay long.
          She laughs. It was never his decision to make.

          

          

          

          

          29

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          She switches the light on in an artfully messy city girl
          apartment. A life is lived here, a bed on the back-room
          floor, a bag of trash on the counter, lamp is askew. She
          makes no attempt to clean it up. He soaks in the details,
          including some miniature dolls that occupy her kitchen and
          shelves.

          SOFIA
          Hey Paulo!
          A large goofy dog comes running at her, and then proceeds
          to slather David with love too.

          DAVID
          I'm glad he protects you. This is
          a lethal canine.

          SOFIA
          (from other room)
          I love living here. And I refuse
          to clean up!

          DAVID
          No problem.

          SOFIA
          I've got to work around the clock
          to keep this place.
          David eases the dog away as he examines the oddly exquisite
          dolls. He grabs a look at her in the other room. A bit of
          leg between boot and skirt.  As he admires the dolls:

          DAVID
          So you're really a dancer, huh?

          SOFIA
          For     14     years.   But I don't dance
          like you dance.
          She laughs to herself, steals a look at him. Turns away.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT


          SOFIA
          Do you want something to drink?

          DAVID
          Sure.
          David looks at her refrigerator. A note reads: Call Dad!
          An odd epiphany occurs as he sees the collage of photos

          

          

          

          

          30
          that represent a hard-working, hard-earned, committed and
          passionate life.
          Shot moves across the photos. A young girl living a young
          girl's hard-working and happy life. Group photos of co-
          workers. A few from a vacation. A whole new cast of
          characters, all committed, and they all look inviting to
          him. And one gloriously random photo of her in Cabo San
          Lucas, raising a toast with friends.

          DAVID
          I like your life.

          SOFIA
          Well, it's mine and you can't have
          it.
          David examines a humorously embarrassing vacation photo of
          a sloshed Sofia, a guy's arm reaching for her breast.
          Dedication reads: To Sergio! Marry me!

          DAVID
          I do not want to know the story
          behind this photo. Who's Sergio?

          SOFIA
          It's a nickname.

          DAVID
          Your nickname is Sergio?

          SOFIA
          It's a long story, and we don't
          know each other.

          DAVID
          So many secrets.

          SOFIA
          That's because I'm really an arms
          dealer.

          DAVID
          I've never known an arms dealer.

          SOFIA
          You do now. What about you?
          What's your nickname?
          David freezes. And then decides what the hell - to tell
          the truth.

          DAVID
          Citizen Dildo.

          

          

          

          

          31

          SOFIA
          You're not staying over.

          DAVID
          (still stung over
          nickname)
          Never run a company. Stay an
          artist. Stay an arms dealer.

          SOFIA
          Oh please. Somehow, I can't play
          the violin for you.
          (beat)
          Although. It must be hard
          controlling all those people's
          lives. Everyone at that party is
          connected to you for survival in
          some way, it seems.
          David looks at her, mentally assessing her level of guile.

          SOFIA
          Ever been married?

          DAVID
          No. Ever accept any of your
          12,000 proposals?

          SOFIA
          (playful, self-
          deprecating)
          12,008.No.

          DAVID
          And you moved to New York. To
          dance and paint and act and deal
          arms.

          SOFIA
          Right.
          (going through CDs)
          Do you want to hear Jeff
          Buckley... or Vikki Carr?

          DAVID
          Jeff Buckley... or Vikki Carr?
          Both - simultaneously.
          He continues looking. Flashes of the photos on her
          refrigerator.

          SOFIA
          Everyone said "don't go to New
          York." But I just think good

          

          

          

          

          32
          things will happen if you're a
          good person with a good attitude.
          Doncha think?
          He regards her.  He's a little restless, and a lot
          enchanted. Is she for real?

          SOFIA
          You think I'm naive.
          He decides she's for real. He turns back to the photos on
          her fridge.

          DAVID
          No. I really don't.

          DAVID (V.0.)
          I dug her completely. Somehow, I
          had found the last semi-guileless
          girl in New York City.

          SOFIA
          I have to get to sleep.
          Truthfully -- I'm also working
          mornings as a dental assistant.

          DAVID
          (to himself)
          Boy, am I going to the wrong
          dentist.

          MCCABE(V.0.)
          And you didn't immediately want to
          sleep with her?

          DAVID (V.0.)
          Well you know - I'm a pleasure
          delayer.

          MCCABE (V.O.)
          (interested in his
          romantic style)
          How does that work?

          DAVID (V.0.)
          (toying with the shrink)
          Pleasure delaying... you don't
          know? You keep the relationship
          casual until the absolute breaking
          point.And then, one night, or
          afternoon, or morning... it could
          be months from now... oh, you know
          how it works -

          

          

          

          

          33
          His vision moves across the bright blue sky of one of
          Sofia's photos. A single crimson cloud.

          INT. PSYCHIATRIC UNIT CELL -, DAY         -- THE NEXT


          WEEK/INTERROGATION # 2
          David sits with the mask, facing McCabe. McCabe is hanging
          on every word.

          MCCABE
          - actually no I don't. I've been
          married for twenty-two years.

          DAVID
          Ah, you've got dinner with your
          daughters.

          MCCABE
          That's right. I do.

          DAVID
          Back then I had intricate systems
          with women you wouldn't believe.

          MCCABE
          Like... what...

          DAVID
          Hey Doc. Don't get all melancholy
          over the thirty seconds you were
          single a long time ago.

          MCCABE
          That's what you think I'm doing?

          DAVID
          Yes.

          MCCABE
          Well, you may have a point.
          Let's continue. Time is not our
          friend.

          INT. AARON'S CUBLICLE/PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - DAY

          Aaron watches David, a 17-inch television on a stool to his
          right. Again, strangely, it is "To Kill A Mockingbird"
          that he's watching. We hear audio from the movie through
          the glass.

          INT. LIVING ROOM NIGHT

          David with artist's notebook in hand. Across the table,
          Sofia holds the other notebook.

          

          

          

          

          34

          DAVID
          Just our shortcomings. That's all
          we're allowed to draw.

          SOFIA
          (confidently)
          I've never drawn such a true
          likeness before.

          DAVID
          Mine's finished.

          SOFIA
          Already? Hang on. Okay - done.
          Sofia offers her drawing. It's a caricature of a good-
          looking guy surrounded by money, cars and very thin girls.
          He snatches it, studies it, and what he sees hurts him in
          surprising ways.

          DAVID
          (embarrassed laugh)
          Jesus. That's how you see me?

          SOFIA
          Maybe I didn't add enough money --

          DAVID
          No. It's wonderful. It's
          something you'd see on the wall of
          a steak-house in hell, but it's
          wonderful. Sign it.
          Sofia's face falls a bit. She sees she's hurt him. She
          takes the drawing and signs it, a little guilty.

          SOFIA
          Let's see yours.

          DAVID
          No.
          She grabs it. Its a rich portrait, filled with detail,
          humor and style. She is rocked by its elegance.

          SOFIA
          Wow. I feel bad.
          (regarding it carefully)
          You said to draw a caricature.

          DAVID
          I know. I couldn't. I saw you
          like that.

          

          

          

          

          35

          SOFIA
          Well, it's very good.

          DAVID
          I'll sell it to you.

          SOFIA
          You monster. How much for?

          DAVID
          One kiss.
          She smiles. Something is developing between them.

          DAVID
          That smile is gonna be the end of
          me.

          SOFIA
          (serious)
          And what happens when your friend
          calls you tomorrow?

          DAVID
          He only met you a few hours before
          me. He would do the same.

          SOFIA
          I see that friendship is important
          to you.

          DAVID
          It is. But as his best friend, I
          also know that he's trying to
          finish a novel about inadequacy
          and rejection. So the longer I
          stay, the better it is for his
          career.
          Sofia smiles, shakes her head. And yawns.

          SOFIA
          Your career is one I'd worry
          about.
          David looks down. She's hit a nerve.

          SOFIA
          I'm sorry -

          DAVID
          No, no. You're more right then
          you even know. I used to be one
          of those guys who was just

          

          

          

          

          36
          snowboarding through his life,
          with no focus whatsoever.

          SOFIA
          When did you change?

          DAVID
          (pause, confesses)
          About five minutes ago.

          SOFIA
          (direct, slightly
          whimsical)
          Every passing minute is another
          chance to turn it all around.
          David shakes his head a little. Her words strike right to
          the heart of him.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER

          Sofia is asleep on the sofa. Clothes still on.               David
          gently strokes her hair.    Television in b.g. It's one of
          those late-night infomercials, and it's ridiculously
          compelling. The perfect thing to bond over on a great,
          lingering date.

          INTERVIEWER ON T.V.
          And to those who think that you're
          a charlatan?

          OLDER MAN ON T.V.
          I understand. The perception of a
          head frozen somewhere waiting for
          reanimation - it sounds like
          science fiction.

          SOFIA
          What are you watching?

          DAVID
          It's the greatest show... it's
          called "Sofia."
          Sofia looks at him and smiles. They look back to the
          television.

          ON TV INFOMERCIAL
          A charming looking older-man discusses eternal life with a
          television interviewer.

          

          

          

          

          37

          SOFIA
          (off t.v.)
          I've seen this thirty times.

          DAVID
          We did a story on this guy. He
          owns half of Arizona.

          SOFIA
          Is he a fraud?

          DAVID
          How would you ever know?

          SOFIA
          Good point.

          INTERVIEWER ON T.V.
          Can you unfreeze a human life?

          OLDER MAN ON T.V.
          Take the case of Benny the dog.
          Benny is a dog who was frozen for
          three months, and thawed out to
          live a normal life.

          SOFIA
          Oh, well that's comforting. It's
          safe for Benny. I'm in!
          David moves closer to her.

          SOFIA
          We better watch out.
          They regard each other, and David gets up off the sofa.
          It's true. The promise is too great to not savor it, and
          walk away for now. Thrill remains in the air.

          SOFIA
          Where are you going?

          DAVID
          I left my number on your fridge.
          He makes a courtly bow and turns. She feels the loss of
          his company.

          SOFIA
          Come here, I want to tell you a
          secret.
          He pauses a moment, and turns. In this instant, a fleeting
          instant, it's the oddest thing. He can see their entire

          

          

          

          

          38
          life together. He returns to her. Tentatively, she grabs
          a quick sweet kiss on his mouth. He stays for an extra
          moment, kissing just her upper lip, leaving no doubt as to
          the potential of their future. And then... very close she
          says:

          SOFIA
          I meant that to be your forehead.
          David stands. He looks around the small apartment.

          DAVID
          Thank you for the inspiration. I
          will now attempt to run my
          company, showing compassion for
          the seething throng of my partners
          who root quietly for me to fail.
          She looks at him, quite aware of his personal and business
          crossroads. Silently, she roots for him like crazy.

          DAVID
          For things you don't even know -
          thank you. I'm going to go to
          work. I have a company to run.

          SOFIA
          Pleasure delayer.
          He is still somewhat stunned by the evening, and the girl.
          He actually wants to run his company.

          EXT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

          David slips out onto the street. It's shabbier than the
          alluring night-time version. He'd never notice, or care...
          because David is a man with a brand new buzz.                The city is
          his. Everything good and great suddenly feels inevitable.
          Life feels like a great pop song. Behind him, a car with
          its lights still on starts and advances alongside.           Behind
          the wheel is Julianna Gianni.

          JULIANNA
          David Aames.
          David leans on his car, turns and shakes his head.

          DAVID
          Julie Gianni.     You're following
          me.

          JULIANNA
          only a little.    I wanted to
          finish what we were talking about.

          

          

          

          

          39

          DAVID
          And _-

          JUL IANNA
          How'd it work out with our Moth
          Girl? Did she turn into a
          butterfly for you?

          DAVID
          Yes she did.

          JULIANNA
          But I can see from your walk that
          you didn't sleep with her.
          David turns.

          JULIANNA
          Let me see if I can guess. You
          haven't slept with her because...
          it's more fun when you can draw it
          out. Sex just isn't as good if
          the woman hasn't told all her
          friends she'd never sleep with
          you.

          DAVID
          You're right on the money, Julie.

          JULIANNA
          She must be exhausted from trying
          to be witty for you all night
          long.

          DAVID
          Hey, Julie.

          JUL IANNA
          Sorry. You're just never there
          for your friends until they've
          already given up on you.

          DAVID
          I'm not blowing you off! I just
          want to be alone for a little bit.
          Trust me - I have a lot of things
          I gotta take care of. If we're
          friends, which we are, you'll
          understand.

          JULIANNA
          (simple, honest)
          I'm sorry I got weird. I missed
          an audition and I just felt bad

          

          

          

          

          40
          you didn't invite me to your
          party.
          It zings him. David turns, considers her.

          JULIANNA
          Do you want to make it up to me?
          I won't tell a soul.
          Slowly, he is drawn to her. His old self rallies one last
          time. He gets in the car.

          INT. JULIANNA'S CAR -- EARLY MORNING

          The streets are empty. She plays a CD of a romantic sweet
          pop track with a feeble vocal.

          JULIANNA
          Would you do a story about me if I
          made a CD?

          DAVID
          Sure I would -

          JULIANNA
          Do you like my music?

          DAVID
          (winning, truthful)
          It's vivid.

          JULIANNA
          If I weren't me, I would buy a CD
          by me.

          DAVID
          Well, you know, if you can reach
          one person.
          Julianna is a little hurt, hides it well.

          JULIANNA
          What is happiness to you, David?

          DAVID
          (considering)
          what is happiness?

          JULIANNA
          For me, this is happiness. Being
          with you.
          David doesn't look at her. She speeds up, slowly.

          

          

          

          

          41

          JU.LIANNA
          One thing bothers me. Why did you
          tell Brian I was your fuck-buddy?

          DAVID
          I didn't tell him that. I didn't
          say that.

          JULIANNA
          When did you stop caring?

          DAVID
          (watching the road)
          About what --

          JULIANNA
          About the consequences of the
          promises you made.

          DAVID
          Promises         - I thought we had an
          understanding.

          JULIANNA
          Do you know how hard it is to
          pretend to be your "buddy?" I
          love you, David. You fucked me
          four times in one night. You have
          been inside me and I have
          swallowed your come. That means
          something.

          DAVID
          Julie...

          JULIANNA
          Four times, David! That means
          something. Four times.
          He grabs at the wheel. She won't let go, and speeds up.

          DAVID
          stop the car!
          She picks at things on the dashboard, as she talks with a
          manic energy.

          JULIANNA
          Twenty-four hours a day I live
          with the aching possibility that
          you might call me to do something.

          

          

          

          

          42

          DAVID
          (caring, almost. pleading)
          Take me to your house. We'll talk
          this out. I want to see where you
          live. I want you to stop the car,
          Julie. I want you to stop the
          car!

          JULIANNA
          Don't you know, David? Every time
          you sleep with someone... your
          body makes a promise whether you
          do or not?

          PROFILE OF DAVID AAMES JR.
          who turns slowly to face her. All he sees are haunted
          blue eyes. He knows at the very least, there will be a
          crash. She guns the accelerator.         He is paralyzed, unable
          to alter his fate.

          JULIANNA
          Tell me something, David. Do you
          believe in God?
          Sweet pop music swells. She bursts the barrier of the
          winding road, and the car sails into an embankment of a
          road below. All sound disappears, as we hear a new kind of
          music. Ethereal, almost wondrous. This music continues.

          TO BLACK

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - HALL OF TREES - DAY - DREAM

          David walks the hall of trees. It's the gentle seductive
          whoosh of a new day, the way the world sounds when you're
          in love. Vibrant. Alive. Ironically rich in the beauty
          we all take for granted when we're not in love. He looks
          impossibly drawn forward to Sofia, who stands waiting to
          meet him.

          SOFIA
          Hello.
          He steals a kiss. They both feel like they're getting away
          with something.

          DAVID
          You're amazing. Hello.

          SOFIA
          Did you get to work alright?

          

          

          

          

          43

          DAVID
          Yeah, well, actually... I had a
          horrible dream.

          SOFIA
          You dreamed you'd never see me
          again.

          DAVID
          I left your house. I went to the
          car, and my friend the stalker had
          been following me.

          SOFIA
          Julie.

          DAVID
          Yes. She followed me down the
          street. She wanted to talk, and I
          had that buzz... from you and me,
          and I think my mind was on that
          terrible drawing of me... and, you
          know, I got inside. And she drove
          me off a bridge and committed
          suicide with me in the car.

          SOFIA
          I thought you were going straight
          to work.

          DAVID
          But I survive! I survive with my
          arm and my face reconstructed.
          And what's worse I couldn't wake
          up.

          SOFIA
          (shushing)

          My dreams are a cruel joke. They
          taunt me. Even in my dreams, I'm
          an idiot who knows he's about to
          wake up to reality. If I could
          only avoid sleep, but I can't.

          The alarm clock goes off.   A hand shuts it off. He looks
          at a model plane by the side of the bed.

          DAVID  (V.0.)
          I try to tell myself what to
          dream. I try to dream that I'm
          flying, something freeing. It

          in the mirror. But today, viewed over his shoulder, we see
          that the mirror is now a wooden cabinet.

          DAVID  (V.0.)
          Here's what you remember from a

          the house. Music continues.

          MCCABE (V.0.)

          DAVID  (V.0.)
          What really happened? What,
          didn't you read the file? I was
          out for three-and--a-half weeks.
          My face and arm were shattered.
          My jaw was broken in four places.
          No surgery could be performed
          because of the coma. You can't
          feel the darkness, or the
          numbness, you can't even feel.

          being watched. Shot continues parallel to her. She stops,
          sees someone she knows. A truck with several panes of
          glass passes by and stops in traffic. Her image blurs
          behind the glass, but visible to us in the window is David
          Acmes. His healing face is dotted with stubble. He wears
          a wool hat. He looks noble, an assembled victim, a modern
          miracle. He looks like many things. But he no longer
          looks like David Aames. The truck moves through frame.

          INT. HOSPITAL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          A dashing-looking surgeon dripping with confidence, DR.
          POMERANZ, talks with David.

          DR. POMERANZ
          The cranial structure was based on
          thirty pins fastened by small
          panels and bits of bone from the
          mandible... and it seems the
          cartilage grafts have maintained
          your cheek structure.
          Unfortunately, because you were in
          a coma, immediate plastic surgery
          was impossible.

          DAVID  (V.0.)
          Doctors. Their power is in
          jargon. So you study up...

          DAVID
          Is that the procedure for all
          Bilateral Periorbital Hematomas in
          a LeFort III fracture of a
          comatose patient?

          DR. POMERANZ
          (pleasantly surprised)
          In a LeFort III   - absolutely. The
          potential for sub-cranial brain
          damage was too great.

          DAVID  (V.0.)
          . you do your best.
          David consults a list he's made.

          DAVID
          And beyond the cheek grafts, Dr.
          Pomeranz is, are the pins fastened

          ready for another operation.

          ANGLE SHIFTS TO REVEAL
          three other doctors in the room listening.

          DR. POMERANZ
          Yes, we are working on processes.
          But it... you're specifically not
          at the stage where we can
          experiment --

          DAVID
          Experiment. Use me.

          DR. POMERANZ
          The headaches will go away -

          DAVID
          These are more than headaches.
          This is like a steel plate slicing
          through my every thought.

          DR. POMERANZ
          We're not cowboys. We can't, just
          wing it.

          DAVID
          Because I can't think straight
          most of the time.

          DR. POMERANZ
          We can increase your medication.

          DAVID
          Yes. Medication.

          DR. POMERANZ
          And there are things we'll
          continue to investigate. But
          there are so many others who've
          not been able to benefit
          aesthetically from plastic surgery
          as you have --

          DAVID
          This isn't about vanity, Dr.
          Pomeranz!
          (keeping rage bottled)
          This isn't about vanity. This is
          about functioning in the world.

          

          

          

          

          49
          It is my job to be out there
          functioning. I've got the money,
          and I'll pay any amount. Invent
          something. Play jazz. You say
          you're the best face man in New
          York City. Fucking prove it.

          OTHER DOCTOR
          We could do something about your
          arm --

          DAVID
          Fuck my arm!
          Dr. Pomeranz looks over to a young assistant.

          DR. POMERANZ
          Nobody here takes your feelings
          for granted. We did prepare
          something for you, based on the
          preliminary examination.

          DAVID
          Tell me. Bring it on.

          DR. POMERANZ
          It's sometimes useful in the early
          stages of rejection. It's a
          facial prosthetic. It was two
          weeks in the making.
          The assistant opens a black-leather bound box. In it is
          the mask - molded from David's own face, locked into a
          pleasant, bland expression.

          DAVID
          A facial prosthetic.

          DR. POMERANZ
          The aesthetic replacement does
          work. Emotionally, and actually.

          OTHER DOCTOR
          (helpfully)
          And the plastic in the aesthetic
          shield also filters out abusive
          rays, and assists in the
          regeneration of cells.

          DAVID
          So it's an aesthetic regenerative
          shield.

          

          

          

          

          50

          DR. POMERANZ
          That's correct. Exactly.

          THIRD DOCTOR
          And the ergonomics of the plate-
          barrier allows it to reflexively
          interact with the movements of
          your own face.

          DAVID
          I see --

          DR. POMERANZ
          It's a helpful unit.

          DAVID
          Good. Because for a minute there
          I thought we were talking about a
          fucking mask!

          DR. POMERANZ
          (beat)
          It's only a mask if you treat it
          that way.

          DAVID
          No it's great. This completely
          takes care of Halloween. But what
          about the other 364         days of the
          year?

          Sofia dances at the end of a long day. A few others leave
          for the day, trying not to stare at David. Sofia is there
          alone. For a moment, we share her solitude. She practices
          ballet, twisting and turning and landing in frame, looking
          just past camera. She freezes. She catches sight of
          David, undisguised. And she begins dancing again. Harder.
          Does she even recognize him? He moves closer, attempting
          an easy-going persona. We hear nothing but the sound of
          his heart pounding, in odd counter-rhythm to her dancing.
          Finally she stops.

          DAVID
          You won't believe this... but this
          is me smiling.
          She laughs a little at his strange new humor, keeps a brave
          front.

          SOFIA
          It's been a long time. I tried to
          see you but your people wouldn't

          David's mirror is restored. He studies himself. Raises
          his arm higher than he has been able to. In the next room
          we hear Conan O'Brien welcoming:

          the most excitable dog in town. In fact, he seems rather
          spacey.

          I have so many questions. To
          start off, tell us all just what

          (off the dog's
          complacency)
          He is thawed out, right?
          Laughter on the t.v. Riding the buzz of what he's
          watching, David dials.

          DAVID
          Hey listen, it's David. I'm back
          in your life. I saw you earlier
          tonight. I was just watching our
          old friend Benny the Dog on... on
          Conan... and I thought of you.
          (laughs)
          Whatever. I loved seeing you
          today. So I'll see you soon.
          You're a great dancer!
          He hangs up and feels instantly mortified. He looks at the
          phone in his hand.

          TO BLACK

          INT. CLUB - NIGHT

          David moves into the thick of a high-energy neighborhood
          dance club. He wears a facial prosthetic. In the
          darkness, he doesn't stick out, not much. He spots Sofia
          and Brian, chatting, waiting for him. The sight of the two
          together recalls happier times. Sofia is dressed down.
          Brian, on the other hand, has never looked better. His
          clothes are nicer. He wears them with confidence. David
          has practiced an opening joke, clapping his hands together.
          He will be trying too hard, all night long.
          They regard him in the mask.

          SOFIA
          (a little too big)
          Hi!

          BRIAN
          (equally big)
          Hey.

          DAVID
          What are you drinking?

          SOFIA
          Nothing.

          

          

          

          

          55

          BRIAN
          I am in the mood for cheap sugary
          overpriced rum-and-cokes. You
          want one?

          DAVID
          (spreads arms)
          Is there any other kind?

          BRIAN
          I'll go get us some         -

          SOFIA
          Where's the bathroom?

          BRIAN
          Behind... over by the place next
          to the door by the chick... I
          mean, girl who looks like Bjork.
          She leaves. David turns to Brian immediately.

          DAVID
          You look good, man. How's your
          book?

          BRIAN
          Take it off.

          DAVID
          I can't. It's a facial shield.
          It's an antiseptic prosthesis to
          stop infections. These fucking
          doctors.

          BRIAN
          (with all love)
          Take off the mask! It's freaking
          me out.

          DAVID
          I can't. It's my face. This is
          my face.

          BRIAN
          Oh no. Trust me. It's a little
          different.

          DAVID
          Hey, if you're embarrassed, just
          go. Nobody asked you to chaperone

          

          

          

          

          56

          BRIAN
          Sofia asked me.

          DAVID
          She didn't want to be alone with
          me?
          (Brian regrets his words)
          That's bullshit. Because I think
          I'm being pretty fucking cool
          about the whole thing.

          BRIAN
          Talk to a shrink!        Or you can
          call me sometime, instead of
          hiding in your apartment. Don't
          take it out on a girl you only met
          once.

          DAVID
          (stung)
          Did she say that? I met her
          "once?" Did she say I met her
          "once?"
          Brian looks away. He's said too much.

          BRIAN
          Cut it out. I miss the old you.
          We all miss the old you. Because
          the new guy is shit.
          David turns away. The perfectly wrong thing to say.

          BRIAN
          Oh. Man. Wait. That came out
          wrong. I love you - period.
          How's your arm, man?
          David shakes his head, moves toward the bar.

          DAVID
          Fuck you, Brian. How about no
          more sympathy? How about if
          that's the deal we make with each
          other? Okay?
          David shakes him off, goes to the bar, and rips off his
          mask. His head thuds from a migraine.

          DAVID
          Gimme a Budweiser and a shot of
          tequila.

          

          

          

          

          57

          BARMAN
          (avoiding eye contact)
          What kind of tequila?

          DAVID
          What did you say to me?

          BARMAN
          (leans closer, still
          looking down)
          I said - What. Kind. Of.
          Tequila.

          DAVID
          Why don't you ask me to my face,
          bitch?
          The barman looks up, expressionless.

          DAVID
          Patron. If you have it.

          ON DAVID - LATER
          watching Sofia and Brian from a distance, talking as
          friends.

          DAVID
          Another shot, another Bud.
          He throws bills on the bar.

          BARMAN
          No. This is on the house.

          DAVID
          Why -

          BARMAN
          (odd compassion)
          It just is. Bitch.
          David looks across the club to see Sofia. A Clubgoer Guy
          whispers something in her ear. She shakes it off. He
          pounds down another shot at the bar, this time with the
          Barman.

          DAVID
          Patron!
          David regards a video monitor behind the bar. Someone's
          camera is fixed on Sofia dancing with Brian, and another
          good-looking Young Man. She playfully shoves the good-
          looking Young Man away, not unlike the move that won David

          

          

          

          

          58
          over lo those many nights ago at her apartment. He pounds
          back another drink.

          INT. CLUB BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Weaving at the urinal, David pees. Squeezes his temples to
          ward off a headache.

          CLUBGOER # 1
          Dude, fix your face!!
          The Clubgoers laugh. David laughs too. Suddenly, he feels
          better.

          INT. CLUB         - NIGHT

          David moves through the crowd, powered by a new sense of
          belonging. The music swirls, and takes him along with it.
          He dances wildly. In the strobing darkness, he is
          anonymous, moving with the group, lost as one. David takes
          the mask and pulls it over his head, backwards. In
          profile, his two faces stare in opposite directions. David
          sees his moment. Sofia is alone near the corner of the
          club. He approaches her.

          DAVID
          Hello again.

          SOFIA
          Hello again.

          DAVID
          Idea. Let's start all over.
          He regards her for a moment, sees her apprehension and
          discomfort.

          DAVID
          How about if you help me? Unless
          I'm horning in here -
          (beat, does her)
          You are. But the food is good.
          He continues, taking a step.

          DAVID
          See, I've got a little problem.
          I've got a stalker.
          (does her)
          It doesn't sound life-threatening.
          (does himself, self-
          deprecating)
          I need a cover. I need for you to
          pretend we're having a

          

          

          

          

          59
          scintillating conversation and
          you're wildly entertained. I know
          it's tough.
          (does her, with head nod)
          I'll improvise.

          SOFIA
          (a touch playful)
          I don't talk like that.

          DAVID
          She's right across the room and
          she's burning a hole in my back
          right now, isn't she?

          SOFIA
          Red dress, strappy shoes?

          DAVID
          That's right!
          Their heads are close together, looking off into the club.
          David doesn't notice that Sofia is having a hard time
          playing along with this game. She is overwhelmed, holding
          it in. David continues.

          DAVID
          I think she' s the saddest girl to
          ever hold a martini.

          SOFIA
          (about to burst)
          David --

          DAVID
          Are you okay?

          SOFIA
          No.

          DAVID
          What's wrong? Is it me?

          SOFIA
          I'll tell you later.

          DAVID
          Come on. Tell me now.
          Something's wrong. Tell me
          everything. Let's talk about it
          right now.

          

          

          

          

          60

          SOFIA
          I'll tell you in another life...
          when we are both cats.
          David looks at her. His eyes flash at her choice of words.
          Perhaps there is hope. Sofia stares at. him, worried about
          his sanity as he goes overboard with his praise of her turn
          of a phrase. Push into close-ups as they struggle to deal
          with the discomfort of this moment.

          DAVID
          I don't believe you just said
          that. That. is the best thing I've
          ever heard. That is hilarious.
          God, that just killed me. The way
          you said that. See - that's what
          I love about you. "I'll tell you
          in another life when we are both
          cats."

          EXT. CLUB STREET - NIGHT

          David, Brian and Sofia walk swiftly down the street in
          silence. David weaves. They are anxious to pretend it was
          a wonderful evening.

          SOFIA
          Well, this is where I leave you.

          BRIAN
          Wait. I'll walk you to your door.

          SOFIA
          No, I live just around the corner.

          BRIAN
          I've got my bike here.

          SOFIA
          I'd rather walk.

          DAVID
          Don't be a drag. Can't you see
          she wants to go on her own?

          BRIAN
          Shut up, you're drunk.

          DAVID
          I may be an idiot, but I'm not
          drunk.

          BRIAN

          

          

          

          

          61

          SOFIA
          Seriously, I don't need you to
          walk me home. Thank you.

          BRIAN
          Okay then. So. We'll call you.

          SOFIA
          (unconvincing)
          Great. We'll go catch a movie or
          something.

          SOFIA
          So. We'll meet up soon.
          The word sounds a lot like goodbye and they both know it.

          DAVID
          We'll meet up soon.
          Sofia turns and runs away.

          DAVID
          (lacking all pride)
          We'll call you again to go out
          with me!

          BRIAN
          We'll call you.
          David and Brian walk on. Brian turns back to see Sofia
          running to the corner.

          BRIAN
          Well, it's been a real blast,
          David. I bid you good evening.

          DAVID
          Where you going?

          BRIAN
          My bike. It's back over there.
          We'll hang soon. Bring your mask
          if you want. I'm getting used to
          it.

          DAVID
          Wait a minute.

          BRIAN
          (stops)
          What?

          

          

          

          

          62

          DAVID
          (shrugs)
          I don't know.

          BRIAN
          You drank a little too much. Call
          me tomorrow if you want.

          DAVID
          Tomorrow I'll wish I was dead.

          BRIAN
          (starts in Sofia's
          direction)
          No you won't. You just need to
          sleep.

          DAVID
          Hey!

          BRIAN
          (Brian's itching to go)
          What!

          DAVID
          What did you say to Julie Gianni
          the night of the accident?

          BRIAN
          What?

          DAVID
          You told her she was a "fuck
          buddy."

          BRIAN
          Never.

          DAVID
          And she was a little more than
          pissed about it.

          BRIAN
          (a little guilty)
          Have you been harboring this shit
          all along? I never talked to her.

          DAVID
          Whatever. I mean - who am I, if I
          can't. be the one who tells you
          you're not ugly? Aw, give me a
          courtesy laugh. Come on!
          Brian shakes his head, starts running.

          

          

          

          

          63

          DAVID
          Brian!! I'm so fucked up. I'm
          just so fucked up!
          Brian stops one last time, irritated, at the far end of the
          street.

          DAVID
          We're best friends! We're bros!
          Brian needs to rid himself of David. He turns and runs in
          the direction of Sofia.
          David feels the deep pangs of rejection. Breathing hard.
          His head hurts. His body hurts.

          DAVID
          Come on, man, we're bros.
          Beat. He sprints down the middle of the street after
          Brian.

          EXT. CLUB STREET/SOFIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          David runs frantically, heartbroken and sobbing.

          HIS MIND
          Brian catches up to Sofia. She turns, relieved. They kiss
          messily, hungrily. Her shoes arch to reach his height.
          David runs the streets, nearing her home. The images are
          tearing his mind apart. He stops and leans against a car,
          unsteady and nauseous. Holding his head in pain, he
          manages to run further.
          David stops on the street outside her apartment. His sobs
          overwhelm him. He drops to the pavement. He passes out,
          mouth agape. The empty street visible in the b.g., his
          hand loosens its grip on the mask.

          FADE TO BLACK

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Open your eyes... open your
          eyes...

          EXT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT -- EARLY MORNING

          David is passed out, the mask is still clutched in his
          hand. A Butterfly crosses frame. A hand enters, resting
          on his shoulder.

          

          

          

          

          64

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          This is a cheap ploy for sympathy.
          David wakes up and looks into the kind face of Julie
          Gianni.

          JULIANNA
          Boo!
          He recoils. His vision sharpens. In the morning shadows,
          with increasing focus, we see that it is actually Sofia.

          DAVID
          No, I'm okay -

          DAVID POV
          Sofia examines him with a look of concern and
          understanding. Everything takes on a clear and sharp
          focus. Behind her is a beautiful vanilla sky.

          SOFIA
          And it worked. Get up.

          DAVID
          Ugh -

          SOFIA
          (helping him up)
          That's right. I agree. Ugh.

          DAVID
          This is a joke.

          SOFIA
          (touches his cheek)
          David. I'm not going to lie to
          you. I liked the way you looked.
          But if you don't pull it together,
          I'll forget the other guy. You
          know that. other guy - YOU?

          DAVID
          (groggy)
          I'm still that guy. I'm still
          that guy.
          Sofia speaks with rapid-fire conviction, as if she might
          change her mind if she thought about it too much.

          SOFIA
          I don't. have a mother-savior bone
          in my body. It's not about that.
          You're coming inside. But if this

          

          

          

          

          65
          turns out to be a big mistake, I
          do have the ability to fall out of
          love with you -
          (snaps fingers)
          - like that.
          She helps him up.

          DAVID
          I am still that guy.

          SOFIA
          Shut up.

          DAVID   (V.0.)
          We created our own world together.
          Us vs. Them -

          DAVID
          Where's Brian?

          SOFIA
          He went with you, didn't he?

          DAVID
          (shaking head at his own
          paranoia)
          I thought you guys hooked up.
          She stops in profile with him. She's astonished at his
          jealousy. Then:

          SOFIA
          (raw truth)
          I wish you hadn't gotten in the
          car with that girl.

          DAVID
          (a long apology is
          coming)
          Sofia... I'm...
          She covers his mouth, nose and face. Only his eyes remain.

          SOFIA
          Your eyes apologized better. Come
          on.
          Portrait of the two, her leading him to the door, the crisp
          glycerine morning overhead.

          

          

          

          

          66

          SOFIA
          Holy God, this is going to change
          my life in a zillion different
          ways... I must be nuts.

          DAVID   (V.0.)
          - and we were quite a pair.   Her
          believing in me. Me believing
          that I deserved it.
          We hear the sound of voices, human voices howling like
          dogs.

          EXT. PRISON - NIGHT

          Prison. Human voices, howling like dogs.

          INT. PRISON HALLWAY -- NIGHT

          David is led down the hallway to his appointment, past many
          door's with thick windows and howling prisoners. Aaron
          pulls him along. They arrive at the Psychiatric Unit..
          McCabe is visible, standing, deep in thought through the
          door.

          INT. PRISON PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - DAY -      (INTERROGATION # 3)

          McCabe holds his drawings, standing. David is seated.

          MCCABE
          I see you haven't been wasting
          your time. Do you ever draw
          anything else?
          All the drawings are of Sofia, drawn in a similar fashion.
          David is a little jumpy, a little amped.
          He moves to the window. The yard is filled with prisoners.

          DAVID
          No.

          MCCABE
          Did you sleep last night.?

          DAVID
          No. I did not sleep.

          MCCABE
          I've got to leave early today, so
          you'll have to be brief. Now.
          What can you tell me about the
          name "Ellie?"

          

          

          

          

          DAVID
          Ellie?

          MCCABE
          Is that a girl you knew? A girl
          you were in love with?

          DAVID
          I've only been in love once.

          MCCABE
          Apparently, you kept repeating it
          last night. You did sleep, David,
          and your advisor said you cried
          out, you had a nightmare.

          DAVID
          Everything is a nightmare --

          MCCABE
          You cried out for "Ellie," David.
          Do you remember what happened?

          DAVID
          No... no...

          MCCABE
          Dig deep, David. Dig deep. You
          cried out for Ellie. What do you
          remember about Ellie? Show me
          your face, David. Help me. Open
          the door.
          David rises and goes to the prison window.
          ANGLE ON McCABE
          In powerful framing, lower shot capturing him powerfully.

          MCCABE
          (digging deeper', aching
          to help)
          It's true you had an accident.
          It's true you were disfigured, but
          not anymore. Do you remember?!
          (with certainty)
          They did fix your face. Take off
          that mask, David. You'll see your
          face is perfect under there.

          DAVID
          I never trusted the Doctors. What
          happened next was surreal. That
          same arrogant bastard, Dr.

          

          

          

          

          68
          Pomeranz, called me and suddenly
          he was my new best friend.

          DR. POMERANZ
          (warmly)
          David! Hey, my brother. I felt.
          really bad about our last
          conversation.

          CLOSE ON DAVID

          DAVID
          He'd discovered a new form of
          reconstructive surgery, with the
          help of a doctor from Berlin.

          ON DOCTOR FROM BERLIN
          who bows to camera.

          DOCTOR FROM BERLIN
          Hello.

          CLOSE ON DAVID - CONTINUED

          DAVID
          The next thing I knew they shot me
          full of drugs I'd never heard of
          and away we went.

          INT. SURGICAL THEATRE -â¢ DAY

          David is wheeled down the hallway on a stretcher. He is
          high on tranquilizers, singing "One of Us." The doctors
          are all smiles.

          DAVID(SINGING)
          what if Gawd was one of
          ussssss... "

          DAVID(V.0.)
          The odds, they said, were one in
          three that the headaches could be
          reduced by 50% and facial tissue
          could be regenerated.

          

          

          

          

          69

          INT. SURGICAL THEATRE - DAY

          David is strapped onto a plank headed for a metallic
          capsule. We hear odd noises and see high--tech details of
          the operation. Laser beams criss-cross his face. Shot
          moves to the video playback of the operation with this
          legend beneath: Capture. An assistant doctor captures
          Polaroid frames.

          DAVID   (V.0.)
          I couldn't tell you what they did.
          It seemed like science fiction to
          me.

          DOCTOR (V.0.)
          He's going to be one good-looking
          guy when I'm done.
          A Polaroid still of David in mid-operation rolls out of the
          print-machine.

          DAVID   (V.0.)
          Obviously, I was suspicious.
          Wouldn't you be?

          INT. PRISON PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - NIGHT -    (INTERROGATION # 3)

          David and McCabe both sit against the wall. McCabe listens
          intently.

          MCCABE
          Suspicious of whom? Of what?

          DAVID
          Once you've been driven off a
          bridge at 80 miles an hour,
          somehow you don't invite happiness
          in without a full body search.

          MCCABE
          Well, at the risk of boring you, I
          can present the alternate
          argument. I once knew a guy who
          was a real loner. And one day he
          woke up at 40, with two daughters
          who lit his life up with purpose.
          Suddenly he goes to endless school
          plays, he gets home at       9:20                  for
          the evening discussion, and he has
          the time of his life. His
          favorite Beatle was once John, and
          now it's Paul.

          

          

          

          

          70

          DAVID
          I always liked... George.

          MCCABE
          It all depends on the individual,
          doesn't it? Tell me. What's
          happiness for you?

          INT. JULIANNA GIANNI'S CAR - DAWN - FLASHBACK


          JULIANNA
          What's happiness to you, David?

          INT. PRISON PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - NIGHT - BACK TO PRESENT


          DAVID
          How about another question -

          MCCABE
          Well, you won't show me your face.
          So back to the time-line. Hurry.
          Let's move through this.

          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - DUSK

          There is tension in the air. David's face is covered in
          high-tech facial plates. He sits at a table near the
          window. Sofia stands.

          SOFIA
          You've got to take the plates off,
          David.

          DAVID
          I don't want to know what's under
          here.

          SOFIA
          It's going to be fine, you'll see.

          DAVID
          I already called Pomeranz and
          switched it to Wednesday.

          SOFIA
          I hope that shrew at the front
          desk gave you shit about it.

          DAVID
          I'll go in the morning. The
          car'll be fixed.
          She advances, takes his face in her hands. She tugs at the
          corner of one of the plates.

          

          

          

          

          71

          SOFIA
          Good, because I know that the
          problem wouldn't be you delaying
          something you were dreading.

          DAVID
          Couldn't be that.

          SOFIA
          Nooooo, it couldn't be that.
          She pulls off one of the plates.

          SOFIA
          I mean, I agree, it's very
          important to have...
          She pulls off another one of the plates. She grows a bit
          emotional.

          SOFIA
          . the right car...
          She pulls off another one of the plates. Tearing slightly.

          SOFIA
          . to take you where you want to
          go...  24   hours a day...
          Quadrant by quadrant, his face is restored to a pale-
          skinned and tender... perfection.

          DAVID
          How bad is it?

          SOFIA
          Well, your ears are in the right
          place. And the rest of it is...
          not too bad at all.
          Tenderly she kisses, and hugs him.

          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT -- DUSK

          Sofia and David make love, looking into each other's eyes.

          SOFIA
          Do you love me? I mean, really
          love me... because if you don't,
          I'll just... have to kill you.

          DAVID
          In my next life I want to come
          back as this mole -

          

          

          

          

          72
          (points out mole between
          her breasts)
          - seriously, this mole. I mean,
          you'll have to wear bikini tops to
          work, or loose-fitting shirts so I
          can breathe, but -

          SOFIA
          I love you. I love you. I love
          you.

          DAVID
          - I could live right there.

          SOFIA
          Is this a dream?

          DAVID
          Oh absolutely.
          She grabs his face, kisses him... a powerful moment, like
          few others in this life.

          EXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAY

          Portrait of the couple together, moving down the middle of
          the street on fresh snow.

          DAVID  (V.0.)
          We talked about the big things,
          the little things, and the big
          things. But in truth, with Sofia,
          it was the in-between times.

          INT. FLORENTINE'S BAR AND GRILL - DAY

          Sofia laughs. A perfect laugh. David admires her, sits
          next to her, holding her hand. Theirs is the unmistakable
          closeness of a couple in the first real throes of a sexual
          relationship. They share a giddy open secret. Across the
          table, we reveal Brian. He's got a tiny high-tech camera.
          Sofia speaks sweetly and passionately to David in Spanish.
          David replies knowingly - "si"           - every few words. It's a
          deep communication. She exits.

          BRIAN
          What, did she say?

          DAVID
          (in love)
          I have no idea.
          Brian shakes his head.

          

          

          

          

          73

          DAVID
          How's things, Brian?

          BRIAN
          Fine.
          David's face is huge in the Brian's viewfinder.

          DAVID
          How's things, Brian?

          BRIAN
          Don't flatter yourself. I'm fine.
          Besides - Sofia is great, but by
          no means one-of--a-kind. She was a
          proximity infatuation.
          Brian, naturally suspicious and somewhat jealous,             spots  a
          writer at a nearby table making notes.

          BRIAN
          (to writer)
          And don't use that, it's mine.
          The writer looks busted.

          DAVID
          Where'd you get the camera?

          BRIAN
          I'm into things... you have no
          idea.

          DAVID
          Well, as long as you're okay.

          BRIAN
          And anyway, we're friends, aren't
          we?

          DAVID
          Always.
          David offers his hand. They shake.

          DAVID'S POV
          David's gaze moves to a 40 year-old man staring at him with
          a bemused smile. A plate of food sits in front of him.
          His eyes suggest a piercing intellect, he looks at David
          with deep familiarity. David can't quite place the face.

          

          

          

          

          74

          BRIAN
          Hey what's up with your face?
          Fuck, there's a seam opening or
          something!

          DAVID
          (mounting horror)
          What - what are you talking about?
          Brian laughs. The spell is broken. Friends again.

          DAVID
          You asshole!

          INT. DAVID'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          David sleeps next to Sofia. He sits up, takes a glass of
          water from the night-stand, admires his girlfriend and
          moves to the bathroom.

          INT. BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT

          He turns on the light, fills the glass with water. Looks
          up into the restored mirror. His face is disfigured. He
          recoils in terror, knocking against a towel rack, sinking
          to the floor and grabbing a look at a shiny surface on the
          lower cabinet.
          Sofia bolts upright. She sees him on the floor across the
          room, sees his face and backs up in the bed, leaning on her
          arm, screaming.

          INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          He awakens suddenly. Sofia is next to him, smiling.

          SOFIA
          Was I snoring?

          DAVID
          (still breathing heavily)
          No, I think it was me. Thirsty,
          that's all.
          She kisses his hand reassuringly.

          SOFIA
          I'm dreaming about you. Mmmmmmm.
          He gets up and goes to the bathroom.

          

          

          

          

          75

          INT. BATHROOM

          Tentatively, he flips the light on. A very relieved David
          regards his restored face. He shuts off the light quickly,
          and fills the glass of water. Splashes some water on his
          face.

          INT. BEDROOM

          David climbs back into bed.

          SOFIA

          DAVID
          (small laugh)
          I could listen to you say "mmmmm"
          for the rest of my life.

          SOFIA
          They kiss. The kiss expands, as he moves to the back of
          her neck. He caresses her body. She kisses his
          fingertips. Her back to him. Tangled in sheets, they ease
          into lovemaking with the perfect fit of two bodies meant
          for each other. He gently grabs a handful of her hair.
          His hand stops.   It's not Sofia's hair. He slowly turns
          her face to his, and we glimpse David over the shoulder of
          the woman who is not Sofia. He leaps out of bed, falling
          to the floor, the sheet tangled around him. He turns on
          the light.
          Julie Gianni hides her face from the light, like a night
          animal caught in the intrusive glare of day.
          When she speaks, it is with Sofia's cadence and accent.

          JULIANNA
          (scared, uncomprehending)
          Baby, what's wrong?
          He gasps for breath, backing away. Totally terrified.
          Paralyzed. In a low voice:

          DAVID
          Where. Is. She.

          JULIANNA
          Who?
          His instinct is to protect his lifeline Sofia - and he
          pounces on her with a manic will to survive.

          

          

          

          

          76
          Julie Gianni looks a little loopy, almost stoned.
          Taunting.

          JULIANNA
          (taunting, sweet)
          I'm Sofia.

          INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

          David dismantles the phone, takes the cord. He ties her
          willing hands to the posts of the bed. She protests oddly,
          like an actress playing a part.

          DAVID
          Now I'm going to make sure that I
          tie this four times. Do you know
          why, Julie? Because four times
          really means something.
          David pulls his pants on, frantically opens the wardrobe
          closet. No Sofia. Goes to the kitchen. No Sofia. Julie
          sobs quietly, sweetly, tied to the bed. She behaves and
          acts like Sofia.

          JULIANNA
          David, don't hurt me.
          David returns and sits across from her on the bed,
          terrified and barely hanging on.

          DAVID
          Okay, I'm freaked out. It worked.
          So just tell me right now - where
          is Sofia?

          JULIANNA
          I am Sofia.

          DAVID
          In one minute I'm going to call
          the police --

          JULIANNA
          (heart breaking)
          Don't do it, honey.

          DAVID
          I knew you'd survived the
          accident.
          She looks at him with tearful eyes.

          JULIANNA
          What. accident?

          

          

          

          

          77

          DAVID
          Whose body was it? Who's the one
          who hired you? The Seven Dwarves?

          JULIANNA
          I haven't had any accident!

          DAVID
          No, of course not. It wasn't an
          accident at all. It was attempted
          murder!

          JULIANNA
          Honey, please.
          He picks up the phone. Dials 911.

          DAVID
          Police Department? I've captured
          an intruder who's entered my home.
          He turns to her. Her eyes are yearning.

          INT. POLICE STATION/INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          The flash of mug shots. We see David sitting, sweating,
          agitated waiting in a Police station holding room.
          Suddenly, the door opens and Thomas Tipp enters, flanked by
          other Detectives.

          TIPP
          Guys, can you give us a minute
          here? Detective Larson...
          Detective Andrews... thank you.
          The room empties, and Tipp approaches David.

          DAVID
          They think that I had something to
          so with this.

          TIPP
          I'm going to handle this exactly
          the way your father would have
          handled this. I've got it solved.

          DAVID
          You've got it solved? Where is
          she?

          TIPP
          She's going to be fine.
          David hugs Tipp.

          

          

          

          

          78

          DAVID
          Thank God you're here, man. I
          love her.

          TIPP
          Yeah... Now, I want you to look
          at these photos and then I'm going
          to destroy them. Sofia's
          testimony is also in here. It
          won't exist. She's not going to
          press charges.

          DAVID
          Press charges against. me?

          TIPP
          David, wake up. As your friend, I
          think you should see what you did
          to Sofia. The press won't get
          hold of this if you get. away
          quickly.
          David leans back in his seat. It's all of them - everybody
          - against him. Tipp opens a file thick with paperwork, two
          computer discs and photos. He displays a photo to David,
          moving it into the light so he sees it clearly.              Julie
          Gianni, battered.

          DAVID
          This is Julie Gianni. That's not
          Sofia. This is Julie Gianni. I
          didn't do that do that to her.
          (beginning to shut down)
          Tommy, someone's setting me up.

          TIPP
          David, the Board and I have taken
          care of everything. They've been
          really great, actually. All of
          this is going to disappear. We're
          all behind you... even the Board.
          David looks at Tipp. It's very clear now. He's one of
          them. David attempts calm.

          TIPP
          (quiet, helpful)
          Get out of here.
          A migraine is thundering in David's head. His world is
          spinning backwards.

          

          

          

          

          79

          INT. POLICE STATION -â¢ NIGHT

          David strides down the hallway. A Man in a crystal blue
          sport coat stands, waiting. As David passes, the Man
          confides a single line - as if smuggling out a valuable
          secret. Voices from other rooms, including a small child
          saying: "Mommy, mommy."

          MAN IN BLUE COAT
          This is a revolution of the mind.

          INT./EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

          Exiting, David is intercepted by a furious Brian.

          BRIAN
          You're in fucking sad shape, man.
          Don't fucking ever hit a girl,
          man. Hit me, but don't fucking
          EVER hit a girl.
          David looks up -- sees a small security camera trained on
          them - pulls Brian out of the station.

          DAVID
          It wasn't Sofia. It was Julie.

          BRIAN
          Oh... it was Julie Gianni. So,
          Sofia was abducted by Julie, and
          now Julie is posing as Sofia.

          DAVID
          Yes.

          BRIAN
          You're in O.J. land, man. Julie
          Gianni is fucking dead!

          DAVID
          I don't know what the cops have
          told you, but let me assure you -
          Julie Gianni is alive alive ALIVE.

          BRIAN
          I didn't talk to the cops. I
          talked to Sofia!

          DAVID
          Where is she?

          BRIAN
          I just dropped Sofia off. And I
          saw everything you did to her.

          

          

          

          

          80

          DAVID
          Let me tell you something - I did
          not do that to her. Look me in
          the eye and tell me that it was
          the same girl you brought to the
          party. Tell me it was your dream
          girl, your "proximity
          infatuation."

          BRIAN
          (raw, finally)
          Yes! And you stole her from me!
          David backs away, as Brian responds bitterly, from his
          heart.

          BRIAN
          The one girl I really wanted, and
          you took her from me. You're
          insane. You're losing it, man.
          David nods powerfully. He now understands. Brian is one
          of them too.

          DAVID
          You have revealed yourself.

          BRIAN
          Oh yeah, I'm with them.

          DAVID
          Where'd you get the coat, Brian?
          Where'd you get the camera? How
          much did they pay you?

          BRIAN
          Listen to me, 'cause it's the last
          time we're ever gonna speak. I
          was your only friend.

          DAVID
          You have revealed yourself to me.

          INT. FLORENTINE'S - NIGHT

          David nurses a drink, still breathing heavily. He's been
          crying. His head aches with this thought - maybe I am
          insane. A man in a classy suit walks towards him, inviting
          himself to sit at the table. His bedside manner is
          impeccable. His smile offers infinite compassion. He was
          the man staring at. him in this same restaurant. He is

          EDMUND VENTURA.

          

          

          

          

          81

          VENTURA
          Problems?

          DAVID
          (takes a sip)
          I'm in no mood to be fucked with.
          So do yourself a favor and le -

          VENTURA
          There's an explanation for all
          this, David.

          DAVID
          Who the fuck are you?

          VENTURA
          You and I know each other. You
          found me on the Internet.
          Silence. David stares at the man.

          DAVID
          What do you want? Why are you
          following me?

          VENTURA
          I'm here to help you. And first
          of all, it's very important that
          you calm down.

          DAVID
          Calm down?

          VENTURA
          You must overcome your fears and
          regain control. Take hold of your
          life again. It's as easy as
          holding that glass. What if I
          told you that you can take control
          of all of this... everything...
          even me...
          David turns to him.

          DAVID
          Look. I'm straight, okay?

          VENTURA
          David, look at these people. It
          seems as though they're chatting
          away, doesn't it? Nothing to do
          with you -

          

          

          

          

          82
          David listens, as he looks at the spirited Saturday night
          crowd, lost in their revelry.

          VENTURA
          -- and yet, they might only be here
          because you wanted them to be.
          You are their God. And not only
          that, you could make them obey
          you... or even destroy you.
          David shakes his head, exhausted and in no mood. He shuts
          his eyes, fights off a headache.

          DAVID
          (cutting him off)
          What I'd like them to do is shut
          up! Especially you!
          Silence. David opens his eyes. They're all staring at
          him. Casually waiting for orders.

          VENTURA
          You see?
          David looks at him with horror, backing away. Receding in
          his vision:

          VENTURA
          You and I signed a contract,
          David.

          INT. PRISON PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - DAY -    (INTERROGATION # 4)

          McCabe is taut, following the thread. His voice calming.

          MCCABE
          Who is the man in the restaurant?
          Who is it?

          DAVID
          I can' t.        --

          MCCABE
          Can you tell the difference
          between dreams and reality?

          DAVID
          Of course. Can you?

          MCCABE
          Think about it. Think with your
          head. You signed a contract, did
          you not.?

          

          

          

          

          83

          RACING THOUGHTS
          A woman walks down the hallway, looking back. Flash   of
          papers signed.

          DAVID
          I signed something.

          MCCABE
          Was the man at the restaurant
          there?
          McCabe's voice becomes infinitely calm and helpful.

          DAVID
          Fuck!

          MCCABE
          Accept your body's resistance.
          Let your head answer.

          DAVID
          Yes.

          MCCABE
          That's right. Who is Ellie?

          DAVID
          I... I don't know what's real.

          MCCABE
          What happened that night, David?
          Somebody died.

          DAVID
          I don't want to remember.

          MCCABE
          Do you understand that you hold
          the keys to this prison?

          DAVID
          It wasn't Sofia.

          MCCABE
          Who was it?

          DAVID
          No.

          MCCABE
          Who was it?

          

          

          

          

          84

          DAVID
          No!

          MCCABE
          You want to let it out, don't you
          David? You're about to tell me.
          Tell me what your heart and soul
          will not allow you to forget.
          David shudders. It's coming.

          MCCABE
          Did you kill Sofia?
          McCabe stands tall, stunned and curious, still pressing to
          pull the nightmare out of him.

          INT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - DAY - FLASHBACK

          The clown figurine on her stove-top falls over as we hear
          the front door kicked in. David enters, slamming the door
          behind him. He looks around what was once the site of such
          happiness. The same details he'd glimpsed long ago are now
          horrifying to him. He looks at a photo on the
          refrigerator. The same note: Call Dad! The exact
          expression, exact photograph he'd seen on his earlier
          visit. Now it is Julie who is in her place.
          He opens her drawer. Just some papers. And then... the
          drawing he'd once done of her. Now featuring Julie. He
          rips up the drawing, and proceeds to destroy the apartment
          until he stops, collecting himself. Takes a breath and...
          Smash. A lamp is broken over his head. Julie Gianni bends
          down to help him. A shard of the lamp-base is still in her
          hand. Julie's whole demeanor is that of a different girl.
          Even her voice is softer, almost exactly the knock-around
          sweetness of Sofia.

          JULIANNA
          I thought you were a vandal.

          DAVID
          (with difficulty)
          Who... are... you?

          JULIANNA
          I'm Sofia.

          DAVID
          You are not Sofia... you're not
          Sofia...

          

          

          

          

          85

          JULIANNA
          I'm Sofia.

          DAVID
          Whatever.
          Julie starts to cry. Battling tears, she offers her heart
          and soul.

          JULIANNA
          David, honey. This will all be
          over soon. We'll be together
          again. You'll forget Julianna and
          I won't be afraid of you. Let me
          get you a cold towel.
          She exits. He struggles to rise. His head is a swirling
          mess. And then:

          ON KITCHEN DOORWAY
          Sofia slowly returns with towel. Her image still blurry.
          David advances, and faints into her arms.

          DAVID
          Sofia?

          SOFIA
          (whispers)
          Yes, David, I'm Sofia. I'm Sofia.
          He accepts it, all of it, whatever it is, just to hold her.
          They kiss, gently, then more powerfully.

          INT. SOFIA'S BEDROOM - DAY

          They make love, emotionally and deeply. Two bodies
          yearning to possess the other. Camera moves across their
          bodies, as David wipes frame to black, as the move
          continues onto her back.

          DAVID
          Where were you...
          Sofia doesn't answer, doesn't want to lose the moment.

          DAVID
          I don't want to know.
          (thrusting)
          Just tell me you love me.
          David keeps his face buried in her shoulder'. He doesn't
          want to look. The passion gives way to a mounting dread,
          as he hears a voice almost like Sofia's.

          

          

          

          

          86

          JULIANNA (O.S.)
          I love you. I'm afraid of how
          powerful this is.
          He continues moving passionately, harder now. Julie
          responds to the overwhelming surge within David. She gives
          over to the waves of dark pleasure, riding him like a
          rocket. from hell. Harder now. Grabbing her hands and
          pulling them high above her head, clamping down with his
          own.
          Julie Gianni cries a deep, guttural sound of passion.
          This is what someone sounds like when they're not faking
          it. And then... slam... a pillow comes down over her face.

          DAVID
          What the fuck is happening?
          Julie begins to react to what is clearly no longer an
          advanced lovemaking session.

          DAVID
          I want to see your face!
          She grabs at the pillow.

          DAVID
          I want to see your face!
          David reaches orgasm, sobbing, recklessly out of control.
          Julie's body stops kicking and settles into silence. He
          loosens the pillow, and is rewarded with one last violent
          attempt at life. Her hand smacks his neck. He's so taut
          it bounces off. She grabs at his face one last time, her
          hand is left with enough power only to caress his face.
          She goes limp. Silence. David's crying turns to a
          whimper. He looks at the pillow over Julie's head. He's
          confused, a puddle of jagged adrenaline. He doesn't want
          to remove the pillow for fear of who could be underneath.
          He rises up, his elbow across her lifeless chest. With
          true horror, he knows he has to move his hand, but his hand
          will reveal who he's just killed.

          ON HER TORSO
          as his arm moves inexorably away from her chest. Quarter-
          inch by quarter-inch he inches it downward, across the top
          of her breasts... dreading the inevitable, not seeing it,
          and then... there it is. The mole between her breasts.

          INT. HALLWAY STAIRS - DAY

          David exits hurriedly, past some tenants, down the stairs.
          He looks up at his own reflection in the hallway mirror.

          

          

          

          

          87
          He looks horribly disfigured. We hear the sound of
          breathing, encased in a mask.

          INT. PRISON PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - NIGHT -  (INTERROGATION # 4)

          McCabe sits across from David. McCabe looks away, haunted
          by the admission of guilt.

          DAVID
          I did it, didn't I? I don't...
          feel... like I killed someone. I
          feel like...

          MCCABE
          David, who...

          DAVID
          I'm in a dream...

          MCCABE
          . was the man at the restaurant?
          David shakes his head.

          MCCABE
          (pained)
          Sometimes the mind behaves as if
          it were in a dream. Faces change,
          people become other people. The
          subconscious is a powerful thing.
          You treated Julie carelessly,
          didn't you, David? Your feeling
          of responsibility or guilt over
          Julie might have easily turned
          Sofia into Julie.
          (pause)
          Do you know what derangement is?

          DAVID
          I need your help.

          MCCABE
          All I know is, you killed your
          girlfriend and I don't know what's
          in your mind.

          DAVID
          I need your help.

          MCCABE
          I'd work on this case forever if I
          could, but we've run out of time.

          

          

          

          

          88

          DAVID
          What will you plead?

          MCCABE
          Temporary derangement. It's your
          best chance. They won't believe
          me.

          DAVID
          What do you believe?

          MCCABE
          Believe it or not, I care about
          you. You've become like family to
          me. I don't want to give up on
          you.
          David looks at, him oddly. Suddenly, the archetype seems
          very familiar. McCabe continues with the noble concern of
          a towering father figure.

          MCCABE
          (continued)
          But I needed more. I needed an
          answer. I... I even thought there
          was more than a good chance
          someone was playing tricks on you.
          Maybe it was the board. But I
          can't exceed my duties here. I'm
          just a psychologist, and I have to
          leave you.

          DAVID
          Will I see you at the trial?

          MCCABE
          No. I'm just the opening act.
          He exits. David sits at. the table as McCabe and Aaron
          exit. He hears Aaron's television; it's the Life Extension
          Infomercial.

          INT. AARON'S CUBICLE - NIGHT

          Through the glass of the psychiatric unit, we see McCabe
          and Aaron exit. Only Aaron's television, sitting on a
          stool, remains. Push in on the television, which is
          playing the L.E. Infomercial.
          Push in on the reverse. It's David at the window as he
          realizes the true meaning of "Ellie" -- L.E. He bangs on
          the glass, at first slow, then faster, yelling for McCabe.
          The L.E. Infomercial and Benny the Dog are reflected on the
          window.

          

          

          

          

          89

          DAVID
          McCABE!!! McCABE!!! COME BACK!!!

          COME BACK!!!

          INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY

          McCabe hustles down the hallway with David. McCabe stands
          tall, moving forward, like Atticus Finch with Tom Robinson.

          INT. CAR

          McCabe watches David closely. Aaron the Guard turns to
          look at David behind the glass partition that separates
          them. David looks out the window at the world he's missed.

          EXT. PLAZA - DAY

          The police vehicle pulls up in front of a crowded business
          plaza. McCabe exits with David. Always watching his every
          move, his every revelation. David looks upward at the
          towering skyscraper in the center of the plaza, rising high
          into the sky.

          INT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY

          A Building Guard guides them through the lobby. McCabe
          trained on David. A look between the two. A Building
          Guard intercepts them.

          MCCABE
          (to Building Guard)
          Life Extension Corporation,
          please.

          GUARD
          What -

          MCCABE
          (a look to David)
          L.E. We hold a court order.

          DAVID
          I think I've been here before -
          McCabe strides purposefully past the Building Guard. Aaron
          shows the pass, and hustles to keep up.

          INT. SKYSCRAPER-63RD FLOOR/L.E. OUTER OFFICE AND HALLWAY-


          DAY
          The elevator door opens to reveal a very pleasant and
          peaceful environment. Comfortable lounging chairs. On the
          reception station is written - L.E. and underneath it the
          words: Life Extension Corporation. Two more Guards meet

          

          

          

          

          90
          them. McCabe watches David, as Aaron releases him from the
          handcuffs. The group moves together. Senses are
          overwhelming David, as they approach the reception station.

          DAVID
          Her name is Libby.
          A stunning young woman rises and moves to greet them.

          LIBBY
          Good morning. I'm Libby. I'm
          here to assist you.
          Libby stares at David's masked face. It's slightly
          unsettling to her.

          MCCABE
          He's my son. He's very shy.

          LIBBY
          (smiling professionally)
          You're not. with the media or part.
          of any legal consortium, correct?

          MCCABE
          No.

          LIBBY
          Welcome to Life Extension. Have a
          look at our proposal. Please
          follow me.
          She-offers them two bound folders featuring the logo - L.E.
          - and guides them down the hallway, looking back with great
          style, beckoning, just as in David's dream recollections.

          MCCABE
          (to Aaron)
          You can wait out here.

          LIBBY
          You'll be meeting Rebecca
          Dearborn.
          (aside)
          My personal role model.

          ON HALLWAY WALLS
          Containing monitors with video-taped "tour guides."
          Talking heads expressing the convictions of Life Extension.
          Compassionate, expressive people. The bits of their
          testimonials echo phrases from David's own life.

          

          

          

          

          91

          PATIENT #1
          .and I'm not a "true believer"
          by nature. But the older you get,
          the more you see the flow of the
          future, and I made a choice...

          PATIENT #2
          .why not embrace the future? I
          Believe the research - the future
          is in the union of the
          spiritual... and the scientific...
          Annoyed at everything around him, McCabe pulls David
          onward.

          INT. LIFE EXTENSION OFFICE  - DAY

          Aames and McCabe sit and wait in a warm wood-paneled
          office, proposals in hand. A glimpse shows words like Re-
          Evolve and Re-Experience, peppered with colorful photos of
          simple, life-affirming portraits of everyday life. It's
          well-appointed and well-marketed organization.
          McCabe regards David as the victim of a lunatic's scam.
          Injustice fuels McCabe.

          MCCABE
          (continuing, scoffing)
          "Cryonization - a journey of re-
          awakening after the preservation
          of the human body at extremely low
          temperatures."

          DAVID
          They laughed at Jules Verne too.

          MCCABE
          (a little sadly)
          David, you're not-
          Account Liaison REBECCA DEARBORN enters with paperwork.
          She is an electric presence. Efficient, caring and oddly
          compassionate.

          DEARBORN
          Mr. McCabe, how are you? I'm
          Rebecca Dearborn.
          (quick notice of mask)
          Life Extension, or L.E. as we like
          to refer to it, is a glimpse of
          the future... a ticket... not in
          the juvenile sense, but in the
          deeply meaningful sense that can
          only be borne in the human heart.

          

          

          

          

          92
          The DNA codes of the human body
          have been broken. Soon, heart
          ailments, cancer and so much more,
          will be a thing of the past. Very
          simply, your anguish... your
          discontent... even your death is
          no longer necessary in a
          traditional sense. Whatever
          malady that hides behind that
          mask... is temporary.
          She looks directly at David, and it stirs him. McCabe
          studies her, and the operation. He thirsts for clues.
          David flips through the folder - toward the back, a panel
          of photos of storage tanks. Lavishly and warmly
          photographed, just like next year's cars in a magazine.

          DEARBORN
          Within an hour of your passing,
          L.E. will transfer your body to a
          vessel where you will be sealed
          and frozen at     196                   degrees below
          zero. Power outages, earthquakes,
          nothing will effect your
          suspension-hibernation.

          MCCABE
          Did you sign this contract, David?
          David looks down at pamphlet, looks up.

          DAVID
          What's the "Lucid Dream" option?

          DEARBORN
          Good choice. The Lucid Dream is
          Life Extension's newest option.
          For a little extra, we offer the
          cryonic union of science and
          entertainment.

          MCCABE
          (rueful, skeptical)
          "Cryo-tainment. "
          Dearborn spreads apart the paperwork on her desk to reveal
          a thin Video Monitor built into the glass table-top. Aames
          and McCabe peer into the table--top as Dearborn presses
          play.

          DEARBORN
          Some find this presentation
          helpful.

          INTERCUT

          ON MONITOR - THE PRESENTATION
          An appealing presentation begins         -- Man's Life. A generic
          happy-looking Man with graphics floating out of his mouth:
          Re-Emerge ...     . Re-Store                 .Re--Invent...a voice takes over for
          Dearborn. A wonderfully comforting tone is present in the
          narration. Like that of a parent.

          NARRATION
          Portrait of a modern human life.
          American, male.
          (highlighting stage)
          Birth.
          (highlighting another
          stage)
          and Death. Imagine that you
          are suffering from a terminal
          illness. You'd like to be
          cryonized, but you'd rather be
          resurrected to continue your own
          life, as you know it now. L.E.
          offers you the answer. Upon
          resurrection you will continue in
          an ageless state - preserved - but
          living in the "present" with a
          future of your choosing.

          VIDEO MONITOR -- THE PRESENTATION
          Push in on a door that opens to a panel of steel
          compartments. Music and atmosphere are seductive and
          compelling.

          NARRATION (CONT ' D )
          Your death will be wiped from your
          memory. Your life will continue
          as a realistic work of art,
          painted by you, minute-to-minute.
          And you'll live it with the
          romantic abandon of a summer
          day... with the feeling of a great
          movie, or a pop song you always
          loved. With no memory of how it
          all occurred, save for the
          knowledge that everything
          simply... improved. And in any
          instance of discontent, you'll be
          visited by Technical Support.

          Another chapter begins seamlessly,

          A living dream.

          MCCABE
          Your death will be wiped from your
          memory. I guess I missed that one
          in USA Today.
          David sits, reeling from the revelation he may be living a
          Lucid Dream.

          DAVID
          . a dream... What if there was a
          mistake? What if the dream became
          a nightmare?

          DEARBORN
          Of course, your subconscious can
          always play tricks on you. The
          subconscious is a very powerful
          thing -

          SIDE-ANGLE CU MCCABE
          Sits forward. He turns to David with great strength,
          worried for him.

          MCCABE
          Did you sign a contract with these
          people, David?

          DEARBORN
          (continuing)
          -but this is a serious business.
          The Lucid Dream is worth the risk.

          

          

          

          

          95
          And what is any life, if not the
          pursuit of a dream? The dream of
          peace. The dream of achievement.
          The dream of hearing someone
          saying these words, when they
          truly mean them.
          David is deeply moved as he listens. Somewhere, music
          begins to play. It is The Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations."

          DEARBORN
          I love you, David. Te Quiero.
          Roam free, David. Most of us live
          our whole lives with no real
          adventure to call our own. It's
          hard to comprehend-but they
          laughed at Jules Verne too.

          CLOSE FRONTAL SHOT OF DAVID AAMES
          David pulls off his mask. He runs out.

          INT. LIFE EXTENSION CORRIDOR - DAY

          David storms around the corner from Dearborn's office,
          yelling, raving.

          DAVID
          I want to wake up! I want to wake
          up!
          Aaron grabs for him. David wrenches free.

          TECH SUPPORT!
          David runs down the corridor and into the elevator, Aaron
          chasing after him.

          DAVID
          It's a nightmare!
          The doors shut. Music rising.

          INT. EMPTY LOBBY - DAY

          David runs out of the elevator, into the empty lobby. Shot
          cranes up to reveal he is utterly alone, reminiscent of the
          much-earlier Times Square shot.

          INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

          David enters the elevator to see Edmund Ventura, calmly
          waiting.

          VENTURA
          David Aames. I think it's time we
          had a proper re-introduction. I'm
          Edmund Ventura from the oasis

          VENTURA
          Yes, I'm your Tech Support. We
          first met      150   years ago.

          DAVID
          Oh shit. You sold me the Lucid
          Dream.
          Ventura smiles.

          DAVID
          Well, what the hell happened?

          VENTURA
          I tried to warn you in the bar. I
          told you to exercise control, that
          it all depended on your mind. All
          of this, everything is your
          creation. And we're now heading
          toward your true moment, of choice.

          DAVID
          "True moment of choice?"

          VENTURA
          Yes.

          DAVID
          When did the Lucid Dream begin?

          

          

          

          

          97

          VENTURA
          Remember the day of the nightclub?

          DAVID
          (trying to remember)
          Yes.

          EXT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT - FLASHBACK

          David is collapsed on the ground. His mask clutched in his
          hand, passed out. Rhythmic score.

          VENTURA
          (with importance)
          That night, when Sofia left you
          and you fell asleep on the
          pavement, that was the moment you
          chose for the splice...

          DAVID
          (remembers the word)
          The splice?

          FADE OUT ON MASK
          The mask has tumbled out of his hand.

          VENTURA
          Splice. The end of your "real"
          life and the beginning of L.E.'s
          Lucid Dream. A splice of many
          years which passed while you were
          frozen and dreaming.

          FADE UP ON MASK
          A moody day dawns. David's mask is just outside the reach
          of his outstretched hand.

          ON DAVID PASSED OUT ON STREET
          Sofia's hand reaches in, and awakens him. Everything is
          suddenly a little more vivid, a little more super-real.

          SOFIA
          Open your eyes.
          They walk away, down the street, into a beautiful Vanilla
          Sky. Sofia slips her arm around his shoulder, as we've
          seen earlier.

          VENTURA
          From the moment you woke up on
          that street, nothing was "real" in

          

          

          

          

          98
          a traditional sense. Your Lucid
          Dream is monitored by Life
          Extension, and a panel of experts
          who follow your every thought.
          Even at this moment.

          INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

          The scene continues as David Aames rides the elevator. The
          compartment now rises above the first seven floors to
          reveal they are traveling upwards in an exterior elevator.
          Other skyscrapers pass by outside the window.

          VENTURA
          Forgive me. I'm blowing your
          mind.
          David looks down with dread.

          DAVID
          I'm not a big fan of heights.

          VENTURA
          I know.
          (continuing)
          We erased what really happened
          from your memory.

          DAVID
          (reaching to understand)
          ..erased?

          VENTURA
          Replaced by a better life under
          these beautiful Monet-like skies.

          DAVID
          (recognizing pieces)
          My mother's favorite.

          VENTURA
          That's right.. A better life
          because you had Sofia.

          ON SOFIA AND DAVID - FLASHBACK
          walking down the center of the Village Street.

          VENTURA
          And you sculpted your Lucid Dream
          out of the iconography of your
          youth.

          

          

          

          

          99

          A FLASH OF FAMILIAR IMAGES
          from the life and psyche of his youth. Mirrored in David's
          life in moments we've already seen.

          VENTURA
          An album cover that once moved
          you...

          DAVID
          An album cover?

          ON BOB DYLAN AND SUZE ROTOLO
          The cover of "Freewheelin' Bob Dylan." Same pose. Same
          street.

          VENTURA
          a movie you once saw late at
          night that showed you what a
          father could be like...

          ON TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD - MOVIE CLIP
          Atticus Finch sits at the breakfast table with his kids.

          ON CURTIS MCCABE AND DAVID AAMES IN UNIT - FLASHBACK
          The exact pose as McCabe and David talk in one of their
          prison conversations.

          VENTURA
          or what love could be like...

          ON SOFIA LAUGHING AT TABLE OF FLORENTINE'S - FLASHBACK
          Her head held high, laughing.

          ON JEANNE MOREAU - MOVIE CLIP
          laughing in the same way, a moment from "Jules et Jim."

          INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

          The compartment hurtles upwards, rising higher than the
          surrounding buildings.

          VENTURA
          This was a kind woman, an
          individual, more than your equal.
          Ventura nods wistfully. He fell in love with her a little,
          too.

          

          

          

          

          100

          VENTURA
          You barely knew her in real life,
          but. in your Lucid Dream, she was
          your savior.

          ON DAVID - SLIGHT PUSH
          trying to remember, feeling the flashes of truth in brief
          moments. And then a bracing, challenging realization that
          something went wrong.

          DAVID
          What happened in my real life?
          Something happened. What did you
          erase?

          VENTURA
          Do you really want to know?

          HIGH ANGLE SHOT OF DAVID
          almost nauseous

          DAVID
          Tell me everything.

          EXT. NIGHTCLUB STREET - DAY

          Match push in on David rising to his feet. His disfigured
          face thunders with a massive migraine. The exact. shot we
          once saw as David and Sofia walked away together. This
          time, David is alone.

          VENTURA
          The morning after the nightclub,
          you woke up on that street, hung-
          over and along. You got up and
          walked away. You never saw Sofia
          again.

          DAVID
          I didn't kill Sofia.

          VENTURA
          No.

          ON DAVID - IN ELEVATOR
          He can't remember any of this. And then...

          VENTURA
          You battled your board, the Seven
          Dwarves, for control. In the end
          it was Thomas Tipp, your father's

          

          

          

          

          101
          friend, the one whose job you
          saved, who wrenched the company
          back in your control.

          INT. RISE PUBLICATIONS - DAY - FLASHBACK

          David exits the company elevator and returns to Aames
          Publications. Tipp is out in front of the employees and
          staffers who welcome him back.

          DAVID
          (warmly)
          Tommy.
          (vague memories)
          But then... somebody died.

          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT      - NIGHT

          David sits in front of the computer in bad physical shape.

          VENTURA
          You longed for Sofia. You shut
          yourself away for months. You
          were alone. You couldn't take the
          pain anymore. Headaches... you
          could barely function.

          DAVID
          I found you on the Internet. I
          signed the contract with you. And
          then...

          INT. MOTEL --- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK

          Aames takes pills, collapses. Music plays.

          PUSH INTO CLOSE UP ON DAVID IN ELEVATOR

          DAVID
          I remember...
          It comes back to him, powerfully.

          DAVID
          Somebody died. It was me.

          ON DAVID IN BODY BAG -- FLASHBACK
          It's zipped up.

          

          

          

          

          102

          ON CRYONIC TANK -- FLASHBACK
          The plastic-wrapped body of David Aames is slipped into a
          tube, which is clamped shut. A Christmas tree in the
          background, as music continues.

          VENTURA
          And on a day in late December, you
          gave yourself to us. You're now
          in a suspended state.

          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT â¢-- MEMORIAL - DAY

          Friends and family clog the old apartment. Shelby looks
          out into the hallway and sees an old acquaintance.

          VENTURA
          Your friend Brian Shelby threw a
          three-day memorial in your old
          home. He was a true friend.

          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Sofia ventures into David's apartment alone, taking in the
          environment and remembering the best moments of her brief
          encounter with David.

          VENTURA
          You were missed, David.
          She moves into close-up, and we see the wonder and the joy
          of a perfect love, nearly attained. She soaks in the
          beautiful, painful mystery of life.

          VENTURA
          It was Sofia who never fully
          recovered. It was she who somehow
          knew you best. And like you, she
          never forgot that one night where
          real, true love seemed possible.

          FLASHBACK - DAY
          David contemplates getting into the car with Julianna. He
          makes the choice that. will change this, and his next life.

          VENTURA
          Consequences, David. It's the
          little things.

          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT -- DAY

          Sofia exits the shot and we're left with an empty frame.

          

          

          

          

          103

          ON DAVID -- IN ELEVATOR
          David turns from looking out the window of the elevator.

          DAVID
          (tears in eyes)
          The little things. There's
          nothing bigger, is there?

          EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

          David and Ventura exit the elevator onto the rooftop.

          VENTURA
          Your subconscious did create
          problems. Your dream turned into
          a nightmare. The glitch has been
          corrected.

          DAVID
          So all I have to do is imagine
          something? If I wanted McCabe to
          come back, right now -
          McCabe comes flying out of the door.

          MCCABE
          David. Listen to me. These
          people are dangerous. We're in
          trouble. We need to get off this
          roof now.

          MCC DAVID
          Who turns from McCabe to Ventura.
          Ventura leads David away.

          VENTURA
          We're now on "pause". And you're
          about to return to your Lucid
          Dream...

          MCCABE
          "Pause"?

          VENTURA
          (continuing)
          .. with all of the upgrades. You
          won't remember any of this, nor be
          charged for the technical support.
          it is now your moment of choice.
          You can return to your Lucid
          Dream, and live a beautiful life

          

          

          

          

          104
          with Sofia, or whomever you
          wish... or you can choose the
          world out there.
          Ventura gestures to the city beyond, as they come to a
          halt.

          CLOSE ON DAVID

          DAVID
          The world out. there. And you can
          bring me back, just. like Benny the
          Dog.

          CLOSE ON VENTURA
          The client is starting to understand.

          VENTURA
          Yes. Just like Benny the Dog.
          Your face and body can now be
          fixed, of course. But it's very
          different out there now. Your
          finances won't last long. Your
          panel of observers are waiting for
          you to choose.
          Ventura gestures into the camera. He begins walking
          backwards to the roof's ledge.

          VENTURA
          There are no guarantees. But
          remember, even in the future, the
          sweet is never as sweet without
          the sour.
          David sees that Brian Shelby has now joined McCabe on the
          roof. He nods to Brian, who nods back.

          DAVID
          How do I wake up?

          VENTURA
          The decision is yours.
          Ventura glances over the edge.

          DAVID
          And I chose this scenario, didn't

          I?

          

          

          

          

          105

          VENTURA
          (enjoying that he
          understands)
          Yes, to face your last remaining
          fear of heights.

          MCCABE
          David, don't listen to him. You
          were right. This is the Seven
          Dwarves. It's a set up! You
          can't trust him.
          David looks at McCabe with compassion.

          VENTURA
          Don't feel bad, David. This
          winning man is your creation.
          It's in his nature to fight for
          his existence. But he's not real.

          CLOSE ON DAVID
          who looks on with compassion.
          McCabe fights for himself.

          MCCABE
          I'm real. I have two daughters.
          You know that.

          VENTURA
          What are their names?

          MCCABE

          I    - I --

          CLOSE ON DAVID
          who feels for McCabe as the apparition crumbles.

          MCCABE
          Mortality as home entertainment.
          This cannot be the future. Can
          it?
          David regards McCabe. Once dynamic, McCabe now seems
          unsure of his own existence. Slowly, always looking at
          David, he settles into the truth of his very being. With
          great nobility, McCabe shoves his hands into his pockets
          and faces his own destiny... or lack thereof.

          MCCABE
          (quietly)
          Goodbye.

          

          

          

          

          106

          VENTURA
          It's been a brilliant journey of
          self-awakening, and you've simply
          got to ask yourself -- what is
          happiness to you?

          CLOSE PUSH IN ON DAVID AAMES
          His moment of realization.

          DAVID
          I want to live a real life. I
          don't want to dream any longer.

          VENTURA
          Any last wishes?

          DAVID
          Let them out there read my mind.

          VENTURA
          I wish you well, David.
          Music rises as he turns to see Sofia. He moves to her.
          She touches his cheek. His face is restored. They
          embrace.

          DAVID
          Look at us. I'm frozen, and
          you're dead. And I love you.

          SOFIA
          It's a problem.

          DAVID
          I lost you when I got in that car.
          I'm sorry.
          She looks at him, beguiling and understanding.

          DAVID
          But remember what you told me
          once? Every passing minute is
          another chance to turn it all
          around.
          She kisses him.

          SOFIA
          I'll find you again.
          She regards her lost love, taking him in. David treasures
          his last moments with her.
          

          107
          David takes a breath and begins backing to the ledge.

          DAVID
          I'll see you in another life when
          we are both cats.
          David backs up and begins to run. He arrives at the edge,
          looking down at the distance to the ground, stopping
          himself at the precipice.
          He looks back to Sofia one last time, and then leaps out
          into the celestial future. For a fraction of a moment, he
          is suspended in mid-air. And he hurtles to the ground.
          And the ground hurtles to meet him.

          SERIES OF IMAGES
          It is the little things, the random poetic instances of
          David Aames' life that come back to him. Music rises as he
          realizes, finally, his own true poetry and humanity. The
          images topple onto each other with the rhythm of his
          heartbeat. Father. Mother. A casual glance of a
          stranger. All combine to give his life meaning. And then,
          finally, we see the face of the one person who gave him
          purpose in this life... and the next. Sofia.

          TO WHITE:
          The sound of a breath. A gulp of life. Someone's heart is
          beating.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE
          Relax... relax, David... open your
          eyes...
          An eye opens and the pupil darts to the right and left.
          Life again.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE
          open your eyes.

          THE END
