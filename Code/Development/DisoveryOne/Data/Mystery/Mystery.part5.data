THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES

FADE IN:

BRASS PLAQUE - DAY

Engraved on it are the words: COX & CO., Bankers.
Reflected in its shiny surface are double-decker red
buses, and other present-day London traffic.


INT. BANK VAULT - DAY

An iron gate opens, and two bank guards come in. One of
them switches on the lights. On the shelves which line
the walls are dusty strong-boxes, document cases, wrapped
packages, etc. The guards move along the shelves
searching for something.

                        WATSON'S VOICE
           Somewhere in the vaults of a bank in
           London is a tin dispatch box with my name
           on it. It is not to be opened until
           fifty years after my death.

The guards find a battered tin dispatch box with the name
JOHN H. WATSON, M.D., painted on it. They remove it from
the shelf, set it down on a table. The box is tied with
heavy cord, the knots sealed with wax. Strung on the
cord is the key.

                        WATSON'S VOICE
           It contains certain mementos of my long
           association with a man who elevated the
           science of deduction to an art -- the
           world's first, and undoubtedly most
           famous, consulting detective.

While one of the guards dusts the box off, the other cuts
the cord with a pair of scissors. He then inserts the
key in the lock, turns it, raises the lid -- revealing
the dusty contents of the box.

OVER THIS, SUPERIMPOSE THE MAIN TITLE.

The guards now start to remove the objects from the box,
one at a time: -- A daguerreotype of Holmes, standing,
and Watson, seated, in a a stiff studio pose; Holmes'
deerstalker hat, his curved pipe, his magnifying glass;
Watson's stethoscope, Holmes' revolver; a small enamel
sign with the number 221B; a pair of handcuffs;

                                                          2.


a sheet of music paper which is unrolled to disclose a
violin piece composed by Holmes, titled FOR ILSE von H.;
A pocket watch, the back of which is opened to reveal a
photograph of Gabrielle Valladon; a signet ring bearing
the initials S.H. -- under which is concealed a compass;
a worn morocco case -- inside which is an early-model
hypodermic syringe; a crystal ball which, when shaken,
produces a snowstorm - and when the snow settles, we see
a bust of Queen Victoria.

OVER THESE OBJECTS, THE REST OF THE CREDIT TITLES ARE
SUPERIMPOSED.

The last item out of the box   is a thick stack of
manuscript paper, bound with   green ribbon. The guard
undoes the ribbon, dusts off   the top page, as CAMERA
MOVES IN CLOSER.  Written in   ink, in the cursive
penmanship of the period, is   the following paragraph:

          To my heirs:

          In my lifetime, I have recorded some
          sixty cases demonstrating the singular
          gift of my friend Sherlock Holmes --
          dealing with everything from The Hound of
          the Baskervilles to his mysterious
          brother Mycroft and the devilish
          Professor Moriarty. But there were other
          adventures which, for reasons of
          discretion, I have decided to withhold
          from the public until this much later
          date. They involve matters of a delicate
          and sometimes scandalous nature, as will
          shortly become apparent.

OVER THIS, WE HEAR THE VOICE OF DR. WATSON, reading the
text.

                                               DISSOLVE TO:


YORKSHIRE LANDSCAPE - DAY

A passenger train of the late Nineteenth Century is
chugging through the early morning mist.

                       WATSON'S VOICE
          It was August of 1887, and we were
          returning from Yorkshire, where Holmes
          had solved the baffling murder of Colonel
          Abernetty.

                                                         3.




INT. COMPARTMENT - MOVING TRAIN - DAWN

There are but two passengers in the compartment --
sitting by the window, facing each other. In fact they
are dozing. One wears a deerstalker and an Inverness
cape; the other is in a dark overcoat and a black bowler,
a furled umbrella between his legs, a medical bag on the
seat beside him. The rest of their luggage is on the
racks above. They are, of course, SHERLOCK HOLMES and
DR. JOHN H. WATSON. This being 1887, they are thirty-
three and thirty-five respectively.

                          WATSON'S VOICE
             You may recall that he broke the
             murderer's alibi by measuring the depth
             to which the parsley had sunk in the
             butter on a hot day.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. BAKER STREET - DAY

A hansom cab, with Holmes' and Watson's luggage strapped
to the rack on top, is proceeding down the busy street.

                          WATSON'S VOICE
             He was the most brilliant man I have ever
             known -- and I dare say people have
             envied me for sharing that flat with him
             in Baker Street.

The cab draws up   in front of 221B. The front door opens
and MRS. HUDSON,   a plump, motherly woman in her fifties,
wearing an apron,   hurries down the steps. She greets
Holmes and Watson   warmly as they alight.

                          WATSON'S VOICE
             I'll grant you he was stimulating -- but
             he could also be moody, unpredictable,
             egocentric, and more often than not,
             completely infuriating -- as our
             landlady, Mrs. Hudson, can attest --
             bless her kind soul.

The cabbie   starts to unload their luggage. As Holmes,
Watson and   Mrs. Hudson proceed inside, CAMERA TRAVELS UP
THE FACADE   OF THE BUILDING, past the number 221B, to the
bay window   on the second floor.

                                                         4.




INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY

It's all there -- the fireplace, the coal scuttle, the
Persian slipper with the tobacco; the velvet wing chair,
the basket chair with the writing-arm, the couch with the
cushions; the sideboard with the tantalus and the
gasogene; the acid-stained deal-topped table with Holmes'
chemical equipment on it, the dining table, the small
Moorish table; the bookshelves and the violin case; the
gas fixtures and the oil lamps; the dumbwaiter connecting
with the kitchen in the basement; and Holmes' desk, piled
high with papers, clippings, research material, etc.

Holmes is pulling up the window shades. Watson has
removed his hat and coat, and is putting his medical bag
down on the sideboard; the cabbie, having deposited their
luggage, is just leaving.

                       MRS. HUDSON
          I do wish you'd give me a little more
          warning when you come home unexpected.    I
          would have roasted a goose -- and had
          some flowers for you.

                       HOLMES
          My dear Mrs. Hudson -- criminals are as
          unpredictable as head-colds. You never
          quite know when you're going to catch
          one.

He has picked up a dagger, starts opening his mail, which
is on the dining table.

                       MRS. HUDSON
          I'll unpack your bags.

She exits into one of the bedrooms.   Watson has now taken
a magazine out of an envelope.

                       WATSON
          Here's an advance copy of Strand
          Magazine.
                 (shows it to Holmes)
          They've printed 'The Red-Headed League!'

On the cover is a colored illustration from the story,
featuring in obligatory Inverness and deerstalker.

                                            5.



             HOLMES
       (offhand)
Very impressive.

             WATSON
       (leafing through the
        magazine)
Would you like to see how I treated it?

             HOLMES
I can hardly wait. I'm sure I'll find
out all sorts of fascinating things about
the case that I never knew before.

             WATSON
Just what do you mean by that?

             HOLMES
Oh, come now, Watson, you must admit that
you have a tendency to over-romanticize.
You have taken my simple exercises in
logic and embellished them, exaggerated
them...

             WATSON
I deny the accusation.

             HOLMES
You have described me as six-foot-four,
whereas I am barely six-foot-one.

             WATSON
A bit of poetic license.

             HOLMES
       (removing Inverness and
        deerstalker)
You have saddled me with this improbable
costume, which the public now expects me
to wear.

             WATSON
That's not my doing.
       (indicating cover of Strand)
Blame it on the illustrator.

             HOLMES
You've made me out to be a violin
virtuoso. Here --

                                            6.


       (holds out a letter he's been
        reading)
-- a request from the Liverpool Symphony
to appear as soloist in the Mendelssohn
Concerto.

             WATSON
       (excited)
Oh, really?

             HOLMES
The fact is that I could barely hold my
own in the pit orchestra of a second-rate
music hall.

             WATSON
You're much too modest.

             HOLMES
       (busy with the mail)
You have given the reader the distinct
impression that I am a misogynist.
Actually, I don't dislike women -- I
merely distrust them. The twinkle in the
eye and the arsenic in the soup.

             WATSON
It's those little touches that make you
colorful --

             HOLMES
Lurid is more like it. You have painted
me as a hopeless dope addict -- just
because I occasionally take a five per
cent solution of cocaine.

             WATSON
A seven per cent solution.

             HOLMES
Five per cent. Don't you think I'm aware
you've been diluting it behind my back?

             WATSON
As a doctor -- and as your friend -- I
strongly disapprove of this insidious
habit of yours.

                                                      7.



                       HOLMES
          My dear friend -- as well as my dear
          doctor -- I only resort to narcotics when
          I am suffering from acute boredom -- when
          there are no interesting cases to engage
          my mind.
                 (holding out one of the open
                  letters)
          Look at this -- an urgent appeal to find
          six missing midgets.

He tosses the letter down is disgust.

                       WATSON
          Did you say midgets?

He picks up the letter.

                       HOLMES
          Six of them -- the Tumbling Piccolos --
          an acrobatic act with some circus.

                       WATSON
          Disappeared between London and Bristol
          ... Don't you find that intriguing?

                       HOLMES
          Extremely so. You see, they are not only
          midgets -- but also anarchists.

                          WATSON
          Anarchists?

                       HOLMES
                 (nodding)
          By now they have been smuggled to Vienna,
          dressed as little girls in burgundy
          pinafores. They are to greet the Czar of
          all the Russias when he arrives at the
          railway station. They will be carrying
          bouquets of flowers, concealed in each
          bouquet will be a bomb with a lit fuse.

                       WATSON
          You really think so?

                       HOLMES
          Not at all. The circus owner offers me
          five pounds for my services -- that's not
          even a pound a midget.

                                                          8.


          So obviously he is a stingy blighter, and
          the little chaps simply ran off to join
          another circus.

                         WATSON
                   (crestfallen)
          Oh.    And it sounded so promising --

                       HOLMES
          There are no great crimes anymore,
          Watson. The criminal class has lost all
          enterprise and originality. At best they
          commit some bungling villainy, with a
          motive so transparent that even a
          Scotland Yard official can see through
          it.

He has crossed to the desk, suddenly notices something.

                       HOLMES
                 (angrily)
          Mrs. Hudson!
                 (even angrier)
          MRS. HUDSON!

Mrs. Hudson comes hurrying out of the bedroom.

                         MRS. HUDSON
          Yes?    What is it? What have I done now?

                       HOLMES
                 (sternly)
          There is something missing from my desk.

                        MRS. HUDSON
          Missing?

                       HOLMES
          Something very crucial.
                 (picks up a small feather)
          You have been tidying up against my
          explicit orders.

                       MRS. HUDSON
          Oh, I made sure not to disturb anything.

                       HOLMES
          Dust, Mrs. Hudson, is an essential part
          of my filing system. By the thickness of
          it, I can date any document immediately.

                                                       9.



                       MRS. HUDSON
          Some of the dust was this thick.

She demonstrates with her thumb and forefinger.

                       HOLMES
                 (promptly)
          That would be March, 1883.

He blows the feather away.

INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

START on Holmes' foot, operating a bellows. CAMERA PANS
UP to the top of the chemistry table, on which an
elaborate apparatus of brass, glass and rubber tubing has
been set up. Inserted into the ends of the rubber tubes
are half a dozen cigarettes, four cigars of different
shapes and colors, and four pipes, all lit. Activated by
the bellows, they are puffing away like mad, wheezing
loudly and filling the screen with smoke. Seated at the
table is Holmes, in shirt-sleeves. Occasionally he
knocks off an ash onto a glass slide, studies it under a
microscope.

Watson, in a dressing gown, is sitting in the chair with
the writing arm, documenting the latest Holmes adventure
for Strand Magazine. The open mail has now been affixed
to the center of the wooden mantelpiece, with a dagger.

Mrs. Hudson is clearing the dinner dishes from the table,
and loading them onto the shelf of the dumbwaiter. The
accumulation of smoke in the room makes her cough.

                       MRS. HUDSON
          How can you stand this? Why don't you
          let me air the room out?

                       WATSON
          Please, Mrs. Hudson -- he's working on a
          definitive study of tobacco ash.

                       MRS. HUDSON
                 (drily)
          I'm sure there's a crying need for that.

                                                      10.



                       WATSON
          In our endeavors, it is sometimes vital
          to distinguish between, say, the ashes of
          a Macedonian cigarette and a Jamaican
          cigar. Sor far he has classified 140
          different kinds of ashes.

                       MRS. HUDSON
          All of which will end up on my rug.

She is now pulling on the rope which lowers the
dumbwaiter.

                       WATSON
          That'll be enough, Mrs. Hudson.

                       MRS. HUDSON
                 (heading for door)
          All right. If you gentlemen want to stay
          here and suffocate...

She exits, shutting the door. For a while, the two go on
working. Then Holmes rises abruptly from the chemistry
table.

                         HOLMES
          She's right.    I am suffocating.

                       WATSON
          Let me open a window.

                       HOLMES
          Not from lack of air -- from lack of
          activity. Sitting here week after week --
          blowing smoke rings -- staring through a
          microscope -- there's no challenge in
          that.

                       WATSON
          Personally, I consider it a major
          contribution to scientific criminology...

Holmes has opened his violin case and taken out his
fiddle.

                       HOLMES
          How I envy you your mind, Watson.

                         WATSON
          You do?

                                                          11.



                         HOLMES
            It's placid, imperturbable, prosaic. But
            my mind rebels against stagnation. It's
            like a racing engine, tearing itself to
            pieces because it's not connected up with
            the work for which it was built.

He has tucked the violin under his chin, starts to
improvise a nervous pent-up melody. There is nothing
amateurish about it -- he plays quite well.

Watson resumes working on his manuscript. Suddenly the
music stops. Watson looks up apprehensively. Holmes has
put down the violin, and is crossing to the sideboard.
He opens Watson's medical bag, takes out a bottle of
cocaine, starts toward his bedroom. Watson pushes the
writing arm to the side, rises from his chair.

                           WATSON
            Holmes --

Holmes   pays no   attention, continues into the bedroom.
Watson   crosses   to the open door. Inside the bedroom,
Holmes   has put   down the cocaine bottle on the washstand,
and is   rolling   up his left sleeve.

                         WATSON
            Holmes, where is your self-control?

                         HOLMES
            Fair question.

From a drawer he takes a morocco case, opens it, removes
a hypodermic syringe.

                         WATSON
            Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

                           HOLMES
            Thoroughly.    But this will take care of
            it.

He has removed the stopper from the cocaine bottle, and
inserting the hypodermic needle into it, starts to draw
up the liquid.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BAKER STREET - DAY

It is raining. A bus comes down the street, the open top
deck sprouting umbrellas like black mushrooms.

                       WATSON'S VOICE
          Naturally, I don't mean to imply that my
          friend was always on cocaine -- sometimes
          it was opium, sometimes it was hashish.
          And once he went one of these dreadful
          binges, there was no telling how long it
          would last.


INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY

Rain beats on the windows.    Holmes and Watson are in the
middle of an argument.

                       WATSON
          The only reason you moved in with me is
          to have a steady supply of stimulants.

                       HOLMES
          Now, now, Watson -- you mustn't
          underestimate your other charms.

He starts into the bedroom.

                       WATSON
          Holmes, I warn you. If you lock yourself
          in there once more --

                       HOLMES
          I intend to do nothing of the sort.

He takes the hypodermic out of the drawer in the
washstand, starts back into the living room with it.

                       HOLMES
          Not until you replace this needle.    It is
          getting rather blunt.

As Watson glares at him, the door opens and Mrs. Hudson
comes bustling in. Holmes hides the hypodermic behind
his back.

                       MRS. HUDSON
          I made you some tea and cress sandwiches.

                                                         13.



She opens the door of the dumbwaiter, starts to pull it
up.

                       WATSON
          Mrs. Hudson, I want you to pack my bags.

                       MRS. HUDSON
          Are you going away for the weekend?

                        WATSON
          And beyond.   I'm moving out.

                        MRS. HUDSON
          Moving out?
                 (she looks at Holmes)

                       HOLMES
          I'm just as surprised as you are.

                       WATSON
          You heard me, Mrs. Hudson.     And let's not
          waste any time.

Mrs. Hudson sighs, exits into Watson's bedroom.

                       HOLMES
          May I be so bold as to ask where you'er
          going?

                       WATSON
          I don't know yet. But I intend to resume
          my practice. I am, after all, a doctor.
          And quite a competent one, if I say so as
          shouldn't.

                       HOLMES
          You'll find it very dull -- snipping out
          tonsils and flushing out kidneys --

Watson is glancing around the room, searching for
something.

                       HOLMES
          If you're looking for your medical bag,
          you hid it under the Moorish table.
                 (as Watson crosses to it)
          Which shows a little more imagination
          than last time -- when it was under your
          bed.

                                                        14.



Watson picks up the Moorish table, disclosing the medical
bag, standing on end. He sets the bag down on the
fender, opens it.

                       WATSON
          I will, of course, continue to pay my
          half of the rent until you find someone
          to share these rooms with you.

                       HOLMES
          Where am I going to find anyone who will
          put up with my rather eccentric habits?

                       WATSON
                 (taking hypodermic needle out
                  of bag)
          Here's a fresh needle -- and here's my
          farewell present to you.

He takes out three bottles of narcotics, puts them on the
mantel.

                       WATSON
          If you want to destroy yourself, go right
          ahead. But I won't sit by and watch you
          doing it.

He snaps his bag shut, carries it toward his bedroom.

                       HOLMES
          Watson...

Watson disappears into the bedroom, slamming the door.
Holmes looks after him, then looks at the bottles of dope
on the mantelpiece. He starts pacing. After a moment he
stops at the chemistry table, studies the assorted
glassware on the shelves above.


INT. WATSON'S BEDROOM - DAY

There are two open valises on the bed. Watson is moving
around the room, collecting various odds and ends, while
Mrs. Hudson packs his clothes.

                       MRS. HUDSON
          It's so sad. You and Mr. Holmes -- after
          all these years --
                 (she sobs)

                                                       15.



                       WATSON
          Please, Mrs. Hudson -- none of that.

Mrs. Hudson takes a clean handkerchief from the open
valise, blows her nose.

                       MRS. HUDSON
          I'll wash this and send it on to you.

                       WATSON
          I'll be at Brown's Hotel.

                       MRS. HUDSON
                 (still sniffling)
          I know how it feels -- I once went
          through a divorce myself.

                       WATSON
                 (removing diploma from wall)
          Actually, I'm rather looking forward to
          it. Leading a normal life again.
          Regular office hours -- nine to three --
          and if occasionally there's an emergency
          call in the middle of the night, I know
          it's going be appendicitis and not an ax
          murder. Let Holmes go mucking about in
          the fog and the sleet, looking for a
          bloodstained collar-button out on the
          moors, with some demented hound snapping
          at his behind --

From the living room comes the sound of a revolver shot.
Mrs. Hudson screams and Watson looks off in alarm. Then
he races out of the room, diploma in hand, followed by
Mrs. Hudson.


INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

As they burst into the room, they see Holmes sitting on
the stool beside the chemistry table, a revolver in his
hand. He has shattered one of the narcotics bottles on
the mantelpiece, and is aiming at a second one.

                       MRS. HUDSON
          Mr. Holmes...

Holmes fires, smashing the second bottle. As Mrs. Hudson
takes a step forward, he waves her away with the gun.

                                                         16.



                       HOLMES
          Please, Mrs. Hudson.    You're in my line
          of fire.

Watson jerks Mrs.   Hudson back as Holmes lets go with
another shot. The    bullet disposes of the third bottle,
splattering glass   and liquid all over the place. Holmes
rises calmly from   the stool, crosses to the desk, puts
the revolver away   in a drawer.

                       MRS. HUDSON
                 (outraged)
          How many times have I told you I will not
          tolerate pistol practice on my premises?
          I should have evicted you when you shot
          them holes in my wall.

She points up to a spot near the ceiling. Neatly traced
in bullet holes are the initials V.R., with a small crown
above them.

                       HOLMES
          Merely celebrating Her Majesty's Golden
          Jubilee.

                       MRS. HUDSON
          Look at that mess you made --

Watson is looking at Holmes with a little smile on his
face.

                       WATSON
          It's all right, Mrs. Hudson. I'll clean
          it up --
                 (hands her the diploma)
          -- while you unpack my things.

                         MRS. HUDSON
          Unpack?

                       HOLMES
          You heard him.

A bewildered Mrs. Hudson goes back into the bedroom.
Watson crosses to the fireplace, picks up the whiskbroom
and the coal shovel, starts cleaning up the broken glass.

                       WATSON
          Thank you, Holmes. I know how difficult
          it must've been for you --

                                                      17.



                       HOLMES
          Not really. It was simple choice between
          a bad habit and a good companion.

                       WATSON
          You've made me very happy.

                       HOLMES
          I've often been accused of being cold and
          unemotional. I admit to it. And yet, in
          my cold, unemotional way, I'm very fond
          of you, Watson.

                       WATSON
          I know that. But one likes to hear these
          things occasionally.

He notices the violin, which has been splattered with the
liquid from the shattered bottle, picks it up.

                       WATSON
          Look at this. Covered with that nasty
          stuff. I'd better dry it off.

                        HOLMES
          I'll do it.

He takes the instrument, and dabbing it with a
handkerchief, carries it toward the violin case.

                       WATSON
          For a moment, I was worried that you were
          going to let me walk out -- that you
          weren't even going to try to stop me.

                       HOLMES
          Now, Watson -- you know there's nothing I
          wouldn't do to keep you here.

With a side-glance at the busy Watson, he opens the
violin case. Neatly stashed away around the edges are
the three original bottles of narcotics. The ones he
shot up, of course, were substitutes from the chemistry
set. He places the violin carefully among the bottles,
closes the case, snaps the locks. As he moves off, we
STAY on the violin case.

                                                         18.



                       WATSON'S VOICE
          It was not the first not the last time he
          tricked me like that. Normally, I was
          inclined to forgive him...

                                               DISSOLVE TO:


INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Watson, in his dressing gown, is sitting at the table,
finishing his coffee. In front of him is a letter, on
blue note-paper, and a pair of theatre tickets.

                       WATSON'S VOICE
          But on one occasion, he did something
          that was so utterly unforgivable, that I
          would gladly have murdered him -- had it
          not been for my saintly disposition.

Watson sets down his coffee cup, picks up the letter and
the tickets, rises from his chair. He starts to pace --
addressing Holmes, who is off-scene.

                       WATSON
          Why are you being so stubborn, Holmes?
          Why won't you go? It's the final
          performance of the Imperial Russian
          Ballet -- the house has been sold out for
          months --

He moves towards the door of --


HOLMES' BEDROOM - DAY

Holmes is sitting in a hip-bath with a high back, soaping
himself. Watson appears in the doorway.

                       WATSON
          -- seats are going for a guinea apiece --

                       HOLMES
          That's precisely it. Why should someone
          send up two free tickets? Anonymously,
          at that.

                       WATSON
          Whoever sent them must be in great
          distress. The note says --

                                                         19.


                 (reading it)
          'Please! You are the only man in the
          world who can help me.'

                       HOLMES
          I suspect it's some sort of plot.

                       WATSON
          You mean somebody wants to lure us into a
          trap...?

                       HOLMES
          Somebody wants to kill me.

                       WATSON
          Kill you?

                       HOLMES
          That's right. It's a plot to bore me to
          death. I detest ballet.

                       WATSON
          But this isn't just any ballet.     It's
          Swan Lake.

                                                     CUT TO:


INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

START ON THE CONDUCTOR, in the orchestra pit,   as he gives
the downbeat for the second acto music of SWAN   LAKE.
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO INCLUDE THE STAGE, with a   mechanical
sway crossing the mist-shrouded lake. CAMERA    CONTINUES
TO PULL BACK, REVEALING Holmes and Watson, in   evening
clothes, occupying a box in the upper tier.

                       WATSON
                 (confidentially)
          You know, of course, Holmes -- that swan
          isn't really a swan -- it's an enchanted
          princess.

                       HOLMES
                 (bored)
          H'mmmm.

On the stage now, the hunters appear, carrying lighted
torches.

                                                       20.




BOX

Watson trains his opera glasses on the stage, Holmes
stifles a yawn.


STAGE

PETROVA, as the Queen of the Swans, makes her entrance to
loud applause. She is in her forties, but splendidly
preserved, undoubtedly the greatest ballerina around.


BOX

Watson nudges Holmes, who has dozed off.

                       WATSON
          Fabulous woman, don't you think so,
          Holmes?

                       HOLMES
                 (coming to)
          Who?

                       WATSON
          The great Petrova.

He hands the glasses to Holmes, who focuses them
indifferently on the stage.


STAGE

Petrova is making an exit, backwards, on points.


BOX

Holmes lowers the glasses, returns them to Watson.

                       HOLMES
          Very strong arches, I must admit.

                       WATSON
          They say twelve men have died for her.

                       HOLMES
          Really.

                                                         21.



                       WATSON
          Six committed suicide, four were killed
          in duels, and one fell out of the gallery
          in the Vienna Opera House.

                       HOLMES
          That's only eleven.

                       WATSON
          The man who fell from the gallery landed
          on top of another man in the orchestra.

                       HOLMES
          That makes an even dozen -- in a messy
          sort of way.

Watson resumes watching the stage through the glasses.


STAGE

Petrova and the dancer playing the Prince go into the
famous pas-de-deux.


BOX

Watson enjoying himself immensely, Holmes sitting there
dourly. The red plush curtain at the rear of the box
parts, and a man in evening clothes and a top hat enters.
He is in his middle fifties, extremely soigne, and
somewhat sinister. His name is ROGOZHIN, and he is
Russian. Holmes and Watson look around.

                       ROGOZHIN
          Mister Holmes?

                       HOLMES
          Yes.

                       ROGOZHIN
          I am Nicolai Rogozhin, director-general
          of the Imperial Russian Ballet. So glad
          you accept invitation.

Holmes and Watson start to get up, but he motions them
back into their chairs.

                       HOLMES
          This is Dr. Watson.

                                                     22.



                       ROGOZHIN
          Pleased to meet you.
                 (seating himself behind them)
          You are enjoying?

                       WATSON
          Immensely.

                       ROGOZHIN
                 (abruptly)
          Tell me, Mr. Holmes, how is your health?

                        HOLMES
          My health?   Better consult my doctor.

                       WATSON
                 (to Rogozhin)
          Oh, he's in excellent shape.

                       ROGOZHIN
                 (to Holmes)
          Any insanity in your family?   Diabetes?
          Asthma?

                       HOLMES
          Would you mind telling me what this is
          all about?

                        ROGOZHIN
          Certainly.   Madame Petrova, she has
          problem.

                       HOLMES
          Could you be more specific?

                       ROGOZHIN
          Certainly not.

                       WATSON
          A liason with a crowned head?
          Compromising letters? Blackmail?

He glances toward the stage.


STAGE

The pas-de-deux finished, to a rousing ovation.

                                                         23.




BOX

Rogozhin rises, turns to Holmes.

                       ROGOZHIN
          After performance, there will be little
          celebration backstage -- and Madame
          requests your presence.

                       WATSON
          We'd be delighted.

                       ROGOZHIN
                 (to Watson)
          You are invited, also.

With a parting look he exits, pulling the plush curtains
closed.

                                                    CUT TO:


STAGE

The performance is over, the curtain is up, the party is
on. Tables have been set up, with caviar, vodka and
champagne. The members of the orchestra are now playing
balalaikas, and crew and cast (the ballerinas still in
costume, the male dancers in tights) seem in high
spirits.

Holmes and Watson, in silk hats with canes, appear from
the wings, stop, survey the scene. Watson's eyes are
shining with anticipation. In contrast, Holmes' face is
sober and quizzical.

Rogozhin spots the two, detaches himself from a group,
hurries over to join them.

                       ROGOZHIN
          There you are, Mr. Holmes. Madame is
          expecting you in her dressing room. Dr.
          Watson, you will amuse yourself meanwhile
          -- we have vodka, caviar, girls.

                       WATSON
          No, thank you.

                                                        24.



                        ROGOZHIN
            No girls?

                         WATSON
            No caviar. Makes me break out in hives.

Rogozhin turns to a group of ballerinas, claps his hands.

                         ROGOZHIN
            Dievushki. Siude, siuda, dievushki.
            Posnakomtes s docktorum Watsonom.

Half a dozen ballerinas descend on on Dr. Watson. They
are giggling and chattering in Russian. Rogozhin leads
Holmes off, while Watson takes in the bevy of beauties
around him.

                         WATSON
            Any of you girls understand English?

                        GIRLS
            Nyet.

                         WATSON
            Not one single word?

                        GIRLS
            Nyet.

                         WATSON
            In that case, I don't mind telling you
            that you all have lovely po-pos.

He pats a couple of the po-pos with his cane.


BACKSTAGE

Rogozhin is leading Holmes toward Madame Petrova's
dressing room.

                         ROGOZHIN
            Mr. Holmes, I must prepare you -- this is
            no ordinary case.

                         HOLMES
            It is only the extraordinary that
            interests me.

                                                        25.



                       ROGOZHIN
          Good. Because you will find this extra-
          extraordinary.

They have now reached the door of Madame's dressing room.
Rogozhin knocks. The door is opened by an elderly
Russian maid.

                       ROGOZHIN
          Madame Petrova prinimaet?

                       MAID
          Pozhaluista voidite.

Rogozhin leads Holmes inside.    The maid steps out, shuts
the door.


INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

It is small, elegant and sensuous. There is vodka in an
ice-bucket, next to a Recamier chaise, a paravent, masses
of flowers, and finally Madame Petrova, still in costume,
sitting at a dressing table with multiple mirrors,
undoing her hair. Candles, in two elaborate candleabra,
give Madame's face a special glow.

                       ROGOZHIN
          Ja priviol vam Mistera Sherlock Holmesa,
          doragaia.

                       PETROVA
                 (to Holmes)
          Otchen rada.

She extends her hand, and Holmes takes it.

                       HOLMES
          Madame.

He kisses her hand. Petrova appraises him from head to
toe, and back again.

                       PETROVA
                 (to Holmes)
          Vi menshe rostom chem ja ozhidala.

                       HOLMES
          Madame says you are shorter than she
          thought.

                                                       26.



                       HOLMES
          I didn't mean to be.

                       PETROVA
          No eto nie vazhno. Menia interessujut
          glavnim obra som vashi mosghi.

                       ROGOZHIN
          Short, tall, who cares?   It is the brains
          that count.

                       HOLMES
                 (to Rogozhin)
          Thank you.
                 (catching himself, to
                  Petrova)
          Thank you.

Petrova rises, crosses to the paravent.

                       PETROVA
          Ja prochia vsie vashi prikliuchenia.
          Zamiechatelno! Os sobenno sobaka
          Baskervillei.

                       ROGOZHIN
          Madame is great admirer of yours. She
          has read every story -- her favorite is
          Big Dog from Baskerville.

                       HOLMES
          I'm afraid it loses something in
          translation.

Petrova is now behind the paravent, undressing, only her
head visible.

                       PETROVA
          Nikolai, pokazhite iemu skripku.

Rogozhin picks up a violin case, opens it.

                       ROGOZHIN
          Mr. Holmes, you know about fiddles.
                 (takes violin out, hands it
                  to him)
          What is your opinion of this?

Holmes holds the violin up, peers through one of the
sound holes.

                                                         27.



                       HOLMES
                 (reading)
          'Antonius Stradivarius Cremonesis, Anno
          1709.' Well, the label is authentic.
                 (examines violin, plucks
                  strings)
          Judging from the shape, the color of the
          varnish, and the tone, I would say it is
          a genuine Stradivarius of the best
          period.

                       ROGOZHIN
          You like?

                       HOLMES
          It's magnificent.

                       PETROVA
                 (from behind paravent)
          Skazhite jemu chto eto podarok ot menia.

                       ROGOZHIN
          Here -- take it. Madame says it is
          yours.

                       HOLMES
          Mine?

                       ROGOZHIN
          For services you will render.

                       HOLMES
          My fees as a detective are not exactly
          trifling -- but a Stradivarius -- you're
          not serious.

                        ROGOZHIN
          I am not.   But Madame is.

Petrova emerges from behind the paravent, in a brocade
dressing gown.

                       PETROVA
          Nalejte vodki i obiasnite jemu v chom
          dielo.

She drapes herself on the chaise.

                                              28.



              ROGOZHIN
All right.   I will pour vodka and
explain.
       (starts pouring vodka; it is
        pink)
Mr. Holmes, what you have seen tonight is
last and positively final performance of
Madame Petrova. She is retiring.

             HOLMES
What a shame.

             ROGOZHIN
She has been dancing since she was three
years old. And after all, she is now
thirty-eight.

             HOLMES
       (gallantly)
I must say she doesn't look thirty-eight.

             ROGOZHIN
That is because she is   forty-nine.
       (he hands her a   glass of
        vodka, with an   exaggerated
        smile)
So Madame has decided   to leave ballet and
spend life bringing up   her child.

             HOLMES
How admirable.

             ROGOZHIN
       (hands him vodka)
Problem now is to find father.

              HOLMES
Oh?   Is he missing?

             ROGOZHIN
Correct.

             HOLMES
And that's why you called me in?

             ROGOZHIN
Also correct. We must have father,
because without father, how can there be
child?

                                                           29.



                       HOLMES
          I see. The whole thing is still in the
          planning stage --

                       ROGOZHIN
          Correct again. Madame would like child
          to be brilliant and beautiful. Since she
          is beautiful -- she now needs man who is
          brilliant.

Holmes' eyes wander slowly toward Petrova.    She raises
her glass.

                         PETROVA
          Za zdorovie.

                       ROGOZHIN
                 (raising his glass)
          Za zdorovie.

                         HOLMES
          Za zdrovie.

Petrova and Rogozhin down their vodka bottoms up.    Holmes
takes one swallow, then stops.

                       HOLMES
          What's in it?

                       ROGOZHIN
          What does it taste like?

                         HOLMES
          Red pepper.

                       ROGOZHIN
          That's what's in it.

While Rogozhin refills Petrova's glass and his own,
Holmes takes another tentative sip.

                       PETROVA
                 (to Holmes)
          Kogda mi smozhem dvinutsa v putj?

                       HOLMES
          I beg your pardon?

                                             30.



             ROGOZHIN
Madame wants to know how soon you can be
ready.

            HOLMES
Ready?

             ROGOZHIN
To leave for Venice. All arrangements
have been made. You will spend one week
there with Madame...

             HOLMES
Well, this is all very flattering. But
surely there are other me -- better men --

             ROGOZHIN
To tell you truth, you were not first
choice. We considered Russian writer,
Tolstoi --

             HOLMES
That's more like it.   The man's a genius.

             ROGOZHIN
Too old... Then we considered the
philosopher, Nietzsche --

             HOLMES
Absolutely first-rate mind...

             ROGOZHIN
Too German... And we considered
Tschaikowski --

             HOLMES
Oh, you couldn't go wrong with
Tschaikowski --

             ROGOZHIN
We could -- and we did.   It was
catastrophe.

            HOLMES
Why?

             ROGOZHIN
You don't know? Because Tschaikowski --
how shall put it? Women not his glass of
tea.

                                            31.



              HOLMES
Pity, that.

             PETROVA
       (to Rogozhin)
Skazhite jemu chto je otchen dovolna etim
resheniem.

             ROGOZHIN
Madame is very happy with final choice.

             HOLMES
Madame mustn't be too hasty.   She must
remember I'm an Englishman.

              ROGOZHIN
So?

             HOLMES
You know what they say about us. If
there's one thing more deplorable than
our cooking, it's our love-making. We
are not exactly the most romantic of
people --

             ROGOZHIN
Perfect. We don't want sentimental
idiots -- falling in love, committing
suicide. One week in Venice -- she goes
back to St. Petersburg with baby -- you
go back to London with fiddle.

             HOLMES
An equitable arrangement.
       (puts down violin)
About my medical history -- when you
asked me -- I neglected to mention a
small detail. There is hemophilia in my
family. We're all bleeders.

             ROGOZHIN
       (to Petrova)
On govorit, chto v jevo semie stradajut
ghemofilijei.

             PETROVA
Pust nie bezpokoitsa.    Ja ostrighu sebe
noghti.

                                                       32.



                       ROGOZHIN
          Madame says not to worry.    She will not
          scratch you.

                       HOLMES
          That's reassuring to know.    But --

                       PETROVA
                 (to Rogozhin)
          Pochemu on kolebletsa? On nie nahodit
          menia dostatochno privlekatelnoi?

                       ROGOZHIN
          Madame says you talk too much.    You find
          her attractive or no?

Before Holmes can answer, the door opens and Watson
sticks his head in. He is flushed and slightly
inebriated, and there is a flower tucked behind his ear.
From off comes the SOUND of wild balalaika music.

                       WATSON
          Excuse me.
                 (to Rogozhin)
          What does prokanzik mean?

                       ROGOZHIN
          It means 'You little devil.'

                        WATSON
          It does?   I am? Thank you.

He hurries off, shutting the door.

                       ROGOZHIN
                 (to Holmes)
          I repeat question. You find Madame
          attractive or no?

Holmes is still looking at the door where Watson exited,
an idea forming in his mind.

                       HOLMES
                 (turning to Rogozhin)
          Oh, I find her most attractive -- for a
          woman, that is.

                       ROGOZHIN
          Then no problem.

                                                33.



             HOLMES
Maybe a slight one.       You see, I am not a
free man.

              ROGOZHIN
Not free?   You are a bachelor.

             HOLMES
A bachelor -- living with another
bachelor -- for the last five years.
Five very happy years.

             ROGOZHIN
What is it you are trying to tell me?

             HOLMES
I hoped I could avoid the subject. But
some of us -- through a cruel caprice of
Mother Nature --

             ROGOZHIN
Get to point.

             HOLMES
The point is that Tschaikowski is not an
isolated case.

             ROGOZHIN
You mean, you and Dr. Watson -- ?
       (Holmes nods)
He is your glass of tea?

             HOLMES
If you want to be picturesque about it.

             PETROVA
       (slightly agitated)
Chto on govorit? Pri chom tut
Chaikovsky?

               ROGOZHIN
On pederast.

             PETROVA
       (on her feet now; flaring)
Jescho odin? Eto stanovitsa odnoobrasno!
Kakoi vi idiot!

                                                          34.



                          HOLMES
                   (picking up his silk hat and
                    cane)
            Believe me, Madame, the loss is all mine.
            But I would prefer to disappoint you know
            than disappoint you in a gondola in
            Venice.

He takes her limp hand, kisses it.   Then he crosses to
the door.

                         HOLMES
                   (imitating Rogozhin's accent)
            It would have been catastrophe.

He exits.   Rogozhin starts to pour himself another glass
of vodka.   Petrova slaps the glass out of his hand.

                         PETROVA
                   (screaming)
            Potchemu vi nie vijasnili eto eto ranshe,
            prezhde chem posoritj menia!


STAGE

The party has built into a real wingding by now. It's
wild -- drinking, laughing, singing. Everybody is turned
on -- especially Watson. He is dancing with a dozen of
the ballerinas to madly accelerating balalaika music.
Flower behind ear, hair mussed, tie undone, short of
breath -- he is in paradise.

Holmes makes his way through the revelers, approaches
Watson.

                         HOLMES
            Watson!
                   (Watson pays no attention)
            Watson, are you coming?

                         WATSON
                   (without missing a step)
            What is it, old boy?

                         HOLMES
            We're going home.

                                                       35.



                       WATSON
          Home? Not a chance. Not the slightest --
          not the remotest chance. Toodle-ooo.

He waves goodbye, and goes on swirling dizzily with the
girls. Holmes puts on his silk hat and leaves.

A shaken Rogozhin comes up to the buffet, pours himself a
stiff drink of vodka. As he drinks his eyes follow the
dancing Watson balefully.

Watson spins off several of the girls, grabs another
group. His ex-partners wind up close to Rogozhin. He
whispers something to them. Their eyes widen, and they
stare at Watson with disbelief. Watson again switches
partners, and the first girls now whisper intensely to
those who just left the floor. The same reaction.
Watson, oblivious to all this, is whirling around with
another set of girls.

By now some of the girls who are in on the secret are
whispering to the male dancers in tights. Their reaction
is slightly different. They are seeing Watson in a new
light. And before Watson knows what's happening, he has
been abandoned by all the girls, and is joined first by
one pair then another pair of male dancers, till he is
dancing only with gay guys in tights. It gradually dawns
on Watson that there is something wrong with this state
of affairs. After some difficulty, he breaks away from
them.

                         WATSON
          Hold on!    Just a moment!

Spotting Rogozhin, he crosses to him.   The girls shrink
away at his approach.

                       WATSON
                 (bewildered)
          What's going on? What happened to the
          girls?

                        ROGOZHIN
          Why?   Do you not prefer it this way?

                        WATSON
          What way?

                                                         36.



                       ROGOZHIN
          You don't have to pretend. Mr. Holmes
          told us everything -- about you and him --

                       WATSON
          About me and him?

                       ROGOZHIN
          Come now, no need to be bashful. We are
          not bourgeois. Maybe with doctors and
          detectives is unusual -- but in ballet,
          is very usual.

                       WATSON
          What is?

                       ROGOZHIN
          Caprice of Mother Nature. Look at Pavel
          and Mischa and Boris and Dmitri --

Watson looks around at the boys in tights, who are
standing in a half-circle, grinning at him insolently.
It is beginning to dawn on him. He pales.

                       ROGOZHIN
          -- And Ilya and Sergei --
                 (breaks off, rocks his hand
                  back and forth)
          Sergei -- half and half.

He pours himself another vodka. Watson grabs the glass
away from him, downs it with a gulp.

                                               DISSOLVE TO:


INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT

In contrast to the frenetic ambiance of the back-stage
party, the room seems doubly placid. Holmes, his dinner
coat replaced by a smoking jacket, is sitting in the wing
chair, having a quiet pipe after the evening's peculiar
adventure. Only the desk lamp is lit. From the street,
there is the sound of hurried, angry footsteps
approaching the house. Holmes turns his head languidly --
he knows who is coming.

                                                         37.




EXT. BAKER STREET - NIGHT

An enraged Watson, cane and opera glasses in hand, and
the flower still behind his ear, is jogging down the
center of the deserted street.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Holmes rises casually, twists the wing chair so that its
back is to the door, crosses to the lamp on the desk,
turns the wick down. From off comes the sound of
Watson's key rattling in the front door lock.


STAIRCASE - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT

The front door opens and Watson storms into the
vestibule.

                       WATSON
          Holmes!

He races up the stairs and across the landing, flings
open the door of the flat.

                       WATSON
          Holmes!


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Watson, grim and breathless, stands in the open doorway.
Over the back of the wing chair, he sees smoke curling up
from Holmes' pipe.

                       WATSON
          There you are, you wretch! You rotter!
          You blackguard! Of all the vile,
          unspeakable fabrications. What do you
          have to say for yourself?

No answer from Holmes. We now see -- but Watson does not
-- that the chair is occupied by a section of Holmes'
smoking machine, with the pipe attached.

                       WATSON
          Don't just sit there -- speak up, man!

                                                       38.



Still no answer -- just a little pipe smoke drifting up
from the wing chair. Incensed, Watson raises the opera
glasses, tosses them toward the chair. There is a loud
thud, the pipe falls to the floor, then there is silence.
Watson suddenly becomes concerned.

                        WATSON
          Holmes...?   Are you all right, Holmes?

He approaches the chair apprehensively, shoves  it aside --
and there on the floor is the smoking machine,  still
wheezing slightly. Watson picks it up, and his   eyes
travel to Holmes, standing in a shadowy corner,  working
the bellows with his foot.

                       HOLMES
          From the sound of your footsteps, I
          gathered that you were not in a
          particularly amiable mood.

                       WATSON
                 (with renewed fury)
          How could you do a dastardly thing like
          that to me? What the deuce were you
          thinking of?

He dashes the smoking machine to the floor.

                        HOLMES
          Watson, you  have my most abject
          apologies.   But have you ever been
          cornered by  a madwoman?  It seemed like
          the only way  to get out of it without
          hurting her  feelings.

                       WATSON
          What about my feelings? And my
          reputation? Do you realize the gravity
          of what you have done? The possible
          repercussions?

                       HOLMES
          So there'll be a little gossip about you
          in St. Petersburg...

                       WATSON
          These things spread like wildfire. I can
          just hear those malicious whispers behind
          my back. I'll never be able to show my
          face in polite society...

                                                      39.


          And if it ever got back to my old
          regiment -- you don't know the Fifth
          Northumberland Fusiliers -- they'll
          strike me off the rolls -- they'll cut
          off my pension...

                       HOLMES
          Watson, you're running amok.

                       WATSON
          Dishonored, disgraced, ostracized.   What
          am I to do?

                       HOLMES
          Well, for one thing, I'd get rid of that
          flower.

He points to the flower behind Watson's ear. Watson
grabs the flower, hurls it into the fireplace.

                       WATSON
          You may think this is funny, but we're
          both in the same boat. We must take
          desperate measures. We must stop this
          talk...
                 (a beat, then an idea)
          Maybe if we got married...

                       HOLMES
          Then they'd really talk...

                       WATSON
                 (starts pacing)
          Obviously, we cannot continue to live
          under the same roof. We must move apart.

                       HOLMES
          Of course, we can still see each other
          clandestinely -- on remote benches in
          Hyde Park, and in the waiting rooms of
          suburban railway stations --

                       WATSON
                 (a change in attitude;
                  defiant)
          The whole thing is ridiculous.   We have
          nothing to hide.

                       HOLMES
          That's what I've been trying to tell you.

                                                          40.



                       WATSON
          Let somebody start a rumor -- just one
          ugly word -- and we'll sue them for
          slander.

                       HOLMES
          Nobody would dare. After all, you have
          an enviable record with the fair sex.

                       WATSON
          Damn right. I can get women from three
          continents to testify for me. And you
          can get women to vouch for you, too --
          can't you, Holmes?

No answer from Holmes.   Watson is becoming a little
concerned.

                       WATSON
          Can you, Holmes?

                       HOLMES
          Good night, Watson.

He starts toward his bedroom.

                       WATSON
          Holmes, let me ask you a question --
                 (Holmes stops)
          I hope I'm not being presumptuous -- but
          there have been women in your life?

                       HOLMES
          The answer is yes.
                 (a relieved sigh from Watson)
          You're being presumptuous.
                 (Watson's face falls)
          Good night.

He walks into his bedroom, shutting the door.    Watson
takes a tentative step after him.

                         WATSON
          Holmes...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

                                                      41.




INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT

There is a cheery fire burning in the grate. Holmes is
stretched out full-length on the couch, playing a set of
Corelli variations on his violin. Watson is in his usual
chair, reading the Evening Standard.

                       WATSON'S VOICE
          What, indeed, was his attitude toward
          women? Was there some secret he was
          holding back -- or was he just a thinking
          machine, incapable of any emotion?


EXT. BAKER STREET - NIGHT

Wisps of fog swirl along the street, making yellow haloes
around street lamps.

                       WATSON'S VOICE
          I was not to get the answer until we
          became involved in what I consider to be
          the most outrageous case in all our years
          together.

Out of the mist comes a hansom cab, with the dim figure
of a woman visible in the passenger seat. The cab stops
in front of 221B, and the driver starts to get down.
From upstairs comes the faint sound of violin music.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Watson steps up to the window, pulls the curtain aside,
looks down toward the street.


EXT. 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT

The cabbie crosses the pavement, consults an address in
his hand, glances up at the number of the house, then
rings the bell.


INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT

Watson turns away from the window, as the BELL downstairs
rings again. Holmes stops playing.

                                                       42.



                       WATSON
          Were you expecting someone?

                       HOLMES
          Not at this hour.

                       WATSON
          Maybe Mrs. Hudson is entertaining.

                       HOLMES
          I never found her so.

Watson crosses to the door, opens it, steps out.   Holmes
resumes playing Corelli.


VESTIBULE AND STAIRCASE - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT

Mrs. Hudson, in a robe and night-cap, is talking to the
cabbie in the open street door when Watson appears on the
landing above.

                       WATSON
          What is it, Mrs. Hudson?

                       MRS. HUDSON
                 (looking up)
          There's a cabbie here -- he says you owe
          him two-and-six.

                       WATSON
          For what?

                       CABBIE
                 (to Watson)
          For the fare, guv'nor. The young lady
          doesn't have any money.

                       WATSON
          What young lady?

                       CABBIE
          This one.

He reaches out the door, pulls in the young lady in
question. She is in her early thirties, with strikingly
handsome features, but at the moment she is somewhat
worse for wear. She is wrapped in a blanket, her hair is
wet, and there is a bruise on her temple.

                                                         43.


She is wearing and wedding ring and her name, we will
subsequently learn, is GABRIELLE.

                       WATSON
          Well.  What have we here?
                 (he starts down the stairs)
          Who are you, miss? What happened to you?

                       GABRIELLE
                 (slight accent)
          I don't know.

                       CABBIE
          That's all she keeps saying -- I don't
          know, I don't know.

The violin music stops o.s.   Watson has now reached the
foot of the stairs.

                       WATSON
          Where did she come from?

                       CABBIE
          From the river. I was driving down the
          Embankment, just below Westminster
          Bridge, and there she was in the water --
          drowning.

Holmes appears on the landing above, violin and bow in
his hand.

                       CABBIE
          It wasn't easy, guv'nor -- what with the
          cold water -- and her fighting me --

                       HOLMES
                 (from the upper landing)
          Why did you bring her here?

                       CABBIE
          Because I found this in her hand --
                 (gives a square of soggy
                  cardboard to Watson)
          -- 221B Baker Street -- that's right,
          isn't it?

Watson examines the cardboard, nods.

                                                        44.



                       HOLMES
                 (to Gabrielle)
          Young lady -- what did you want at this
          address?

                       GABRIELLE
                 (looking up, trying to focus)
          I do not remember.

                       WATSON
                 (to Holmes)
          Rather perplexing, wouldn't you say?

                        HOLMES
          Rather.

                       CABBIE
          Well, gentlemen, you want her? -- it's
          two-and-six -- or shall I throw her back
          in the river?

                        MRS. HUDSON
          Mr. Holmes.   You can't let him --

                       HOLMES
          Watson, you'd better accept delivery.

Watson fishes some coins out of his pocket, hands them to
the cabbie.

                       WATSON
          Keep the change.

                       CABBIE
          Thank you, guv'nor.

He snatches the blanket off Gabrielle, revealing that her
dress is clinging to her damply.

                       CABBIE
          No extra charge for the use of the horse-
          blanket.

He exits into the street, shutting the door.    Gabrielle
hugs herself for warmth.

                       WATSON
          You're shivering, my dear.
                 (he puts his arm around her)

                                                      45.


          Come along. Let me get you out of those
          wet clothes.

He starts to lead her up the stairs.


EXT. BAKER STREET - NIGHT

The cabbie has tossed the blanket into the hansom, and is
mounting the driver's seat. Across the street, a man
steps out of the fog into a pool of light cast by one of
the street lamps. He is a craggy-faced Prussian of about
fifty, and his name is VON TIRPITZ. He looks up toward
the Holmes flat. As the hansom makes a U-turn and comes
abreast of him, he hops into the cab. The hansom
disappears into the fog.


INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT

Watson is leading Gabrielle to a chair by the fireplace.
Holmes is putting his violin down on the table.

                       WATSON
          Sit here, my dear.

He settles her in the chair. Holmes comes over, plucks
the square of cardboard from Watson's hand.

                       WATSON
          She's suffering from shock and exposure.

He starts to massage her wrists to restore her
circulation.

Holmes is examining the soggy cardboard. On one side is
their address, written in pencil. He turns it over,
disclosing some smudges of green ink on the other side.

                       HOLMES
          There was some printing on the back of
          this -- but it seems to have come off in
          the water.

Watson is now studying the bruise on Gabrielle's temple.

                       WATSON
          Look at this -- she's had a nasty blow on
          the head.

                       HOLMES

                                                      46.


          Could she have hit her head when she fell
          or jumped into the river?

                       WATSON
          No. The blood has already coagulated.
          So it would appear that she was the
          victim of a deliberate attack... Get my
          bag, will you?

As Holmes fetches the medical bag, Gabrielle looks from
one to the other.

                         GABRIELLE
          Who are you?

                       WATSON
          I'm Dr. Watson -- and this is Mr.
          Sherlock Holmes. Do the names mean
          anything to you?

                         GABRIELLE
          No.

                         WATSON
          Think.

                         GABRIELLE
          I'm trying.

                       HOLMES
          Can you think of your own name?

                          GABRIELLE
                   (a beat, then shakes her
                    head)
          No.

                       WATSON
          She's obviously had a concussion -- which
          often leads to temporary amnesia.

He has now taken some cotton and a bottle of antiseptic
out of the medical bag, and is swabbing her wound.

                       HOLMES
          So all we know is that she was coshed on
          the head, dumped into the Thames, and
          subsequently dumped into our laps.

                                                      47.



                       WATSON
          We know a lot more than that. From her
          accent, we know she is foreign -- from
          her ring, we know she is married -- and
          there is one other clue we have...
          Something I deduced while I was helping
          her up the stairs. No corset.

                       HOLMES
          Good work.

He glances down at Gabrielle's shoe, which has slipped
off her foot. Inside, slightly worn away, are the words:
LA FEMME ELEGANTE.

                       HOLMES
                 (to Gabrielle)
          Are you French?
                 (in Berlitz French)
          Vous etes Francaise?

                       GABRIELLE
                 (concentrating -- then)
          Non, je ne suis pas Francaise.

                       WATSON
          How can she say she's not French, in
          French?

                       HOLMES
          Vous etes Suisse?

                       GABRIELLE
          Non.

                       HOLMES
          Alors, vous etes Belge.

                       GABRIELLE
                 (haltingly)
          Je suis pas sure.

Holmes reaches behind her, turns back the collar of her
dress. Sewn inside is a label reading: BAZAAR MODERN,
Bruxelles.

                       HOLMES
          Vous etes Belge -- de Bruxelles!

                                                      48.



                         GABRIELLE
          Bruxelles?    Oui... Je pense que oui.

Mrs. Hudson has come in with a loaded tea-tray, starts to
put it down on the table.

                       MRS. HUDSON
          Oh, dash. Will someone remove the
          violin, please?

Watson takes the violin off the table, and she sets down
the tray.

                       WATSON
          We just found out that she's Belgian.

                        MRS. HUDSON
          Poor thing.

                       WATSON
          From Brussels.

                       HOLMES
                 (taking Gabrielle's hand)
          If you don't mind.

He slips the wedding ring off her finger, picks up a
magnifying glass, examines it. It is made of copper, and
engraved on the inside is the inscription: Gabrielle -
Emile.

                       HOLMES
          Your name is Gabrielle, is that right?
          Gabrielle?

                       GABRIELLE
          I don't know.

                       HOLMES
          And your husband's name is Emile?

                       GABRIELLE
                 (vaguely)
          Emile...

                      HOLMES
          Where is he? What are you doing in
          London?

                                                         49.



                       GABRIELLE
          I don't know.

                       HOLMES
          When did you arrive from Brussels?     Where
          are you staying?

                       GABRIELLE
          I don't know.

                       HOLMES
          What happened at the river?   Think!
          Pensez! Concentrez vous!

Gabrielle bursts into sobs.

                        WATSON
                 (stepping forward)
          That's enough, Holmes. I will not permit
          you to question her in this condition.
                 (helps the sobbing Gabrielle
                  out of the chair)
          Mrs. Hudson, put her to bed. My bed.
                 (Mrs. Hudson gives him a
                  look)
          I'll sleep on the couch.

                       MRS. HUDSON
          Come, my dear.

She puts her arm around Gabrielle, who is still crying,
leads her into Watson's bedroom.

                       WATSON
          I'd better mix her a sleeping potion.

He gets a packet of white powder out of his medical bag,
and during the following, stirs a spoonful into her tea-
cup.

                       HOLMES
          Watson, I think we should arrange to have
          her removed to a hospital.

                       WATSON
          Under no circumstances.

                       HOLMES
          She should have medical attention.

                                                        50.



                       WATSON
          She can get that from me. But more
          importantly, she must be protected --
          there has already been one attempt on her
          life.

                       HOLMES
          This temporary amnesia -- how temporary
          is it?

                       WATSON
          It depends on the extent of the injury.
          It's like veils shrouding her memory. It
          could clear up in a few days -- or a few
          weeks.

                       HOLMES
          Watson, this is a very small flat -- we
          don't want to clutter it up with women...

                       WATSON
          Holmes, we've never had a case like this.
          A woman comes to us with a problem -- we
          don't know who the woman is -- and we
          don't know what the problem is. Don't
          you find that challenging?

                       HOLMES
          Quite. But we can't afford to wait for
          those veils to lift -- we must break
          through them as quickly as possible.

                        WATSON
          You   really feel it's that urgent?

                       HOLMES
          I do. The sooner we solve the case, the
          sooner we can get rid of her.

                       WATSON
          Oh.

He picks up the cup of tea with the sedative in it,
carries it toward the door of his bedroom.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

                                                         51.




EXT. BAKER STREET - DAWN

The street lamps are still lit. A policeman, on patrol
duty, is strolling along the sidewalk, swinging his
truncheon. Suddenly he sees something up ahead.
Alarmed, he ducks into the doorway of a building,
flattens himself against the door.

From the opposite direction comes a horse-drawn water-
sprinkling wagon. The spray covers the sidewalks as well
as the street.

The policeman waits till the wagon is past, then steps
out of the doorway relieved, resumes his patrol.


INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAWN

Watson is asleep on the couch, covered with a blanket.
He doesn't look as if he were in a very comfortable
position.


INT. HOLMES' BEDROOM - DAWN

Holmes, in a dressing gown, is standing by the window,
studying the square of cardboard with the green smudges
on it. His bed has not been slept in.


INT. WATSON'S BEDROOM - DAWN

Gabrielle is asleep in Watson's bed. The door opens
slowly, and Holmes looks in. He studies the sleeping
Gabrielle for a moment, then quietly pulls the door shut.
As the latch clicks into place, Gabrielle awakes and sits
up in bed, her back to CAMERA. She is nude.

                       GABRIELLE
          Emile?

She starts to get out of bed.


INT. HOLMES' BEDROOM - DAWN

Holmes is back in his room, once more examining the
cardboard by the light of the window. The door of
Watson's bedroom opens, and Gabrielle comes out.

                                                      52.



                       GABRIELLE
          Emile?

Holmes looks up as Gabrielle appears in the open doorway.

                        GABRIELLE
          Emile?   Is that you, Emile?

                       HOLMES
                 (stepping into shadow)
          Yes, Gabrielle.

                       GABRIELLE
                 (hurrying toward him)
          Ah, Emile. I thought I'd never find you.
                 (embracing him)
          Hold me. Hold me tight.
                 (Holmes puts his arms around
                  her)
          It's been such a long time. So many
          nights. You know what I did before I
          left Brussels?

                       HOLMES
          What?

                       GABRIELLE
          I hope you won't be angry with me. I
          bought myself an expensive negligee.

                       HOLMES
          Did you?

                       GABRIELLE
                 (moving toward bed)
          A pink negligee with maribou feathers.
          Don't you think that's a foolish thing
          for a married woman?
                 (she gets into bed, beckons
                  to him)
          Come.

                       HOLMES
          Where is the negligee?

                       GABRIELLE
          In my luggage... Come here.

                                                         53.



                       HOLMES
                 (moving toward her)
          And where is your luggage?

                       GABRIELLE
                 (impatiently)
          I don't know. Come, my love.   Come.
          Please.

As she extends her right hand to him, in a beckoning
gesture, Holmes notices something on the palm. He takes
her hand in his. There, in the same green ink as the
smudges on the cardboard, are what appear the be the
letters "I", "O", and Greek "E". Crossing to the wash-
stand, he picks up his magnifying shaving mirror, returns
to the bed, holds it up against the palm of Gabrielle's
hand.

                       GABRIELLE
          What is it, Emile? What are you doing?

Clearly reflected in the mirror is the reverse image of
the lettering on Gabrielle's palm -- the number "301".

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY

The table is set for breakfast, and Mrs. Hudson is
opening the curtains, flooding the room with sunlight.
Then she moves over to the couch, where Watson is
sleeping in an awkward position.

                       MRS. HUDSON
          Dr. Watson!
                 (she claps her hands and he
                  wakes up)
          Your porridge is getting lumpy. Hadn't
          you better get up?

Watson tries to rise, falls back with a moan.

                       WATSON
          I would like to very much. But --
                 (he turns over on his
                  stomach)
          Mrs. Hudson, would you mind planting your
          knee in the small of my back?

                                                         54.



                       MRS. HUDSON
          Yes, I would.

                        WATSON
          Please!   I'm in excruciating pain.

Mrs. Hudson tentatively rests her knee on Watson's back.

                       WATSON
          A bit higher -- just below my seventh
          vertebra --
                 (Mrs. Hudson follows
                  instructions)
          That's good. Put your arms under mine --
          fold them behind my neck --

Mrs. Hudson presses down harder, and there is a distinct
snap.

                       WATSON
          Bless you.
                 (he rises, rubbing his neck)
          That damn couch.
                 (crossing to table)
          You'd better see if our patient is awake.

He seats himself at the table. Mrs. Hudson crosses to
the door of Watson's bedroom, opens it, starts inside,
then stops.

                        MRS. HUDSON
          Dr. Watson.   She's gone.

                        WATSON
          Gone?

He jumps up from the table, joins Mrs. Hudson, looks past
her. The bed is empty. Gabrielle's clothes are in
evidence, but there is no sign of her.

Watson strides towards Holmes' bedroom.

                        WATSON
          Holmes!   Holmes! She's gone!

He throws the door open, is about to step inside when he
sees something that makes him freeze.

                                                        55.




INT. HOLMES' BEDROOM - DAY

Gabrielle is asleep in Holmes' bed, covered by just a
sheet, and obviously naked underneath. Holmes is not in
the room.

Mrs. Hudson comes up behind Watson, in the open doorway,
peers over his shoulder.

                       MRS. HUDSON
                 (scandalized)
          Well, I never!

There is the sound of the hall door opening, and they
both turn.


INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Holmes breezes in, carrying a large suitcase, with
leather straps around it. Tucked under the straps is a
white parasol. And attached to the handle of the
suitcase is a cardboard tag with the number 301 on it, in
green.

                       HOLMES
                 (inhaling deeply)
          Mmmmm. I smell porridge.   Lumpy as
          usual, I suppose.

He sets the suitcase down on the couch, as Watson and
Mrs. Hudson approach.

                       WATSON
          Oh, there you are, Holmes. We were just
          wondering -- how --
                 (points from his bedroom to
                  Holmes')

                       MRS. HUDSON
                 (sternly)
          We certainly were.

                       HOLMES
          Mrs. Hudson, why don't you go down to the
          kitchen -- get a towel -- and wipe that
          look of disapproval off your face.

                                                        56.



                       MRS. HUDSON
          Liberties -- in my house!

She exits huffily.

                       WATSON
          You can't really blame her -- I mean, the
          way it looks -- if I didn't know you
          better, I might suspect you'd taken
          advantage of the young lady.

                       HOLMES
          As a matter of fact, I did take advantage
          of her... Would you hand me the butter-
          knife, please?

                       WATSON
          Of course.

He picks up the butter-knife from the table, suddenly
turns back with a delayed reaction.

                       WATSON
          You did what?

                       HOLMES
                 (taking butter-knife from
                  him)
          Thank you.

He starts to pry open the locks of the suitcase with the
butter-knife.

                       WATSON
                 (spluttering)
          Holmes, this is reprehensible! Where are
          your professional ethics? Have you no
          sense of decency, no shame --

                       HOLMES
          None whatsoever. If you must know, I
          found her body quite rewarding.

                       WATSON
          You cad!

                       HOLMES
          Especially the palm of her right hand.

                                                         57.



                       WATSON
          I'd rather not hear about it!

                       HOLMES
          Very well. Then I won't bother to tell
          you how I traced her suitcase.

                       WATSON
          That's her suitcase?

                       HOLMES
          Remember that piece of soggy cardboard
          with our address on it? It was a luggage
          ticket -- the number rubbed off on her
          hand. And since she must have arrived
          from Brussels by the boat train, I
          concluded that she had checked her
          belongings at Victoria Station.

                       WATSON
          By Jove! If you're right, we should find
          a clue to her identity.

Holmes has now forced open the locks.

                       HOLMES
          Or at least a pink negligee with maribou
          feathers.

He opens the suitcase, lifts out the top piece of
clothing, holds it up -- a pink negligee with maribou
feathers.

                       HOLMES
          Voila!

                       WATSON
          Let's see - what else is in here?

They start sorting through the clothes in the suitcase.
Holmes removes a tied bundle of letters.

                       HOLMES
          Now we're getting somewhere.

As he examines the envelope, Watson takes out a framed
photo of a rather attractive man of fifty.

                       WATSON
          Who do you suppose this is?

                                                         58.



Gabrielle appears from Holmes' bedroom wearing Holmes'
dressing gown. She is unsteady on her feet and somewhat
dazed. Holmes looks up.

                       HOLMES
          Come in, Madame Valladon.
                 (Gabrielle stops)
          You are Gabrielle Valladon.

                        GABRIELLE
          Yes.

                       HOLMES
                 (holding up photo)
          And this is your husband, Emile Valladon?

                        GABRIELLE
          Yes.

Her eyes fall on the open suitcase.

                       HOLMES
          Sorry to have ransacked your valise.     But
          since you came to us for help --

                        GABRIELLE
          Where am I?

                       WATSON
          221B Baker Street.

                       GABRIELLE
          Oh, yes...
                 (a beat, as she orients
                  herself)
          Which of you is Mr. Holmes and which is
          Dr. Watson?

                       HOLMES
          Dr. Watson is the handsome one.

Watson, pleased, twirls the end of his mustache.
Gabrielle sways slightly.

                       HOLMES
          That's the way he affects most women.

He helps her into a chair.

                                                      59.



                       WATSON
                 (to Gabrielle)
          Coffee. You want strong coffee.

He hurries over to the breakfast table.

                       GABRIELLE
          It's all so confusing.

                       HOLMES
          Let's try to sort it out. You came to
          London looking for your husband...

                       GABRIELLE
          Yes. He's a mining engineer. We were
          married five years ago, in the Congo.

                       HOLMES
          Where your husband was working in a
          copper mine.

                       GABRIELLE
          How did you know?

                       HOLMES
          Your wedding ring -- it's made of copper.

He picks it up from the chemistry table, hands it to her.
Gabrielle starts to put it on.

                       GABRIELLE
          Last year he invented a new kind of air
          pump, and was hired by an English
          company, Jonah Limited.

                       WATSON
                 (handing her cup of of
                  coffee)
          Here you are.

                       HOLMES
          Jonah Limited. Go on.

                       GABRIELLE
          We've been writing to each other
          regularly. Then suddenly,  three weeks
          ago, his letters stopped.  I kept writing
          ... but no answer. Finally  I decided to
          go to that address --

                                                       60.



She indicates the bundle of letters. Holmes glances at
the return address on the back of the envelope.

                       HOLMES
          32 Ashdown Street.

                      GABRIELLE
          Yes. It's just an empty store -- nobody
          there. Then I tried to find Jonah
          Limited. No such company exists.

                       WATSON
          How decidedly odd.

                       HOLMES
          Madame Valladon, can you think of any
          reason why your husband should have lied
          to you about theses things?

                        GABRIELLE
          Emile?   Never. He loves me -- and I love
          him.

                       HOLMES
          So I gathered.

                       GABRIELLE
          I went to the police -- they said they
          would send out a missing persons report --
          but they didn't sound too encouraging.
          Then I went to the Belgian embassy and
          explained the situation to them -- and
          they suggested that I consult you...

                       WATSON
          You could have done worse.

                       GABRIELLE
          I was on my way here -- and suddenly
          there were footsteps behind me -- and a
          hand over my mouth -- and the smell of
          choloroform -- and the next thing I knew
          I was in the water -- and then a man was
          wrapping me in a blanket --

                       HOLMES
          Madame Valladon, somebody tried to kill
          you last night. Do you have any idea who
          could have done it?

                                                        61.



                       GABRIELLE
          I don't understand any of it.
                 (rises, goes to Holmes)
          What does it all mean, Mr. Holmes? Where
          is my husband? You must help me find
          him.

                       WATSON
          We'll do our best, I assure you.

                       HOLMES
          Madame Valladon, I want you to send one
          more letter to your husband.

He crosses to the desk, picks up a sheet of paper and an
envelope, then leads Gabrielle over to the chair with the
writing arm, seats her in it.

                       HOLMES
          To Emile Valladon -- Ashdown Street --
          what was that number?

                       GABRIELLE
                 (addressing envelope)
          32. What do you want me to say in the
          letter?

                       HOLMES
          Nothing.

He folds the blank sheet of paper, and as Gabrielle
finishes addressing the envelope, he inserts the paper in
it, starts to seal it.

                       WATSON
          You're sending an empty sheet of paper to
          an empty shop?

                       HOLMES
          That empty shop is obviously    being used
          as an accomodation address,    or letter-
          drop. But what gets dropped     must be
          picked up. The question is     how? -- and
          by whom? -- and why?

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

                                                         62.




EXT. ASHDOWN STREET - DAY

This is a run-down district in the northwestern part of
London. On the corner is No. 32 -- a dilapidated
abandoned shop, with windows painted halfway up.

As CAMERA APPROACHES the building, we hear sawing from
inside.


INT. EMPTY SHOP - DAY

It is dusty, cobwebby, quite forbidding. In the rear
wall is a closed sliding door, indented about a foot into
the shop. Nearby stands a large, square object, covered
with a tarpaulin.

High up in the rear wall is a slanted skylight, fitted
with an iron grill. From outside, Holmes, in deerstalker
and Inverness, can be seen sawing through the iron bars.
Watson and Gabrielle are beside him.

                       HOLMES
          Hammer... Chisel.

Watson hands him the indicated tools. Holmes chips away
the cement from the top and bottom of the last bar, then
using it as a hinge, swings the grill open. He lets
himself through the skylight, drops to the floor. Watson
now helps Gabrielle through the skylight, lowers her
toward Holmes, who puts his arms around her waist, eases
her to the floor. For a brief moment he keeps his arms
around her. Watson has now squeezed through the
skylight.

                        WATSON
          Here!

He hands the tools to Holmes, jumps to the floor.
Gabrielle is looking around the shop.

                       GABRIELLE
          It's so strange to think I've been
          writing to a place like this all these
          months.

Watson crosses to the square tarpaulin-covered object.
He lifts up one corner of the tarp -- and is greeted by a
loud twittering of birds.

                                                      63.


What he has uncovered is a large cage -- and about a
hundred canaries, suddenly disturbed, are flapping around
unside.

                       WATSON
          Look at all these canaries. Do you
          suppose this could have been a pet shop?

                       HOLMES
          Maybe.
                 (pointing off)
          Here comes our letter.

Through the front window, the silhouette of a postman can
be seen approaching. He drops a letter through the slot
in the front door, moves on. The letter lands on a
section of floor which is solidly covered with dust --
except for a series of double tracks, running to the door
and curving back.

                       HOLMES
          Now we are faced with the most nerve-
          wracking part of the detective's job --
          doing nothing.

He reassembles the three tools, fitting each section into
another, to form a cane.

                       GABRIELLE
          Mr. Holmes --

                       HOLMES
          Yes?

                       GABRIELLE
          I don't know how I'm going to pay you for
          all this. The purse with my money is
          somewhere at the bottom of the Thames.

                       HOLMES
          It could be worse. You could be at the
          bottom of the Thames -- much to your
          discomfort -- and much to my chagrin.

                       WATSON
          I don't understand how anybody picks up
          letters here.
                 (pointing)
          No footprints -- just tracks. What does
          it mean?

                                                         64.



                       HOLMES
          I would surmise somebody is using ice-
          skates -- if it weren't for a conspicuous
          absence of ice.

They become aware of a squeaking noise outside the rear
of the shop, growing louder as it gets nearer. The noise
stops, there is the sound of a lock turning, then the
rattle of a chain.

                       WATSON
                 (in a frantic whisper)
          What do we do now?

                       HOLMES
                 (unfazed)
          This way.

He leads Gabrielle and Watson toward the rear wall, right
next to the door. They flatten themselves with their
backs to the wall, just as the door slides open --
concealing them from view.

Revealed is the mews behind the shop. In the door is an
old BIDDY with straggly hair, sitting in a wheelchair.
In her lap are a bulky paper bag and a tin pitcher filled
with water. As she wheels herself inside, the unoiled
wheelchair squeaks loudly. She stops in front of the
cage, pulls on a rope which runs through a pulley in the
ceiling -- and the tarpaulin rises into the air, exposing
the canaries.

                       WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
                 (addressing birds)
          Good morning, my pretties. Here's Mum
          with your breakfast. Did you think I'd
          forgotten you?

She pours grain from the paper bag into a feeder hanging
inside the cage, pours water from the pitcher into a
trough.

                        WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
          Some  of you will be going on a little
          trip  soon -- I hate to lose you -- but
          even  an old woman has to live. Although
          you  might well ask, why?

She cackles to herself, glances toward the front door.

                                                         65.



                        WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
          Oh.   You never told me we had a letter.

She starts to wheel herself toward the front of the shop.

Through a crack in the door behind which our three are
hiding, we see Holmes' eye watching her.

The old woman reaches the letter, picks it up, studies
the address. Then she hears something, glances toward
the open rear door.

A horse-drawn wagon with a canvas top is just pulling
into the mews. Two CARTERS jump down from the driver's
seat, and one of them takes a small bird-cage from the
back of the wagon. As they start in through the door,
the old woman drops the letter into her lap, wheels
herself toward them.

                       FIRST CARTER
          Morning, Duchess.

                       WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
          Morning.

                       SECOND CARTER
          What have you been doing with yourself?

                        WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
          What do you think? Taking dancing
          lessons.
                 (she stops in front of the
                  cage)
          How many do you want this time?

                       FIRST CARTER
          Two dozen.

He opens the door of the small cage, the bottom of which
is covered with newspaper, starts transferring canaries
into it from the large cage.

                       WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
          What are they doing with all those
          canaries? What's going on up there?

                       SECOND CARTER
          Look, Duchess, we don't know -- and we
          don't want to know.

                                                         66.



                       FIRST CARTER
          When you work for Jonah, it's better not
          to ask questions.

Through the crack in the door behind which he is hidden,
we see Holmes' eye studying the small bird cage, as the
canaries are being transferred into it.

We MOVE IN CLOSE on the small cage, and see the soiled
newspaper spread on the bottom. The masthead reads:
INVERNESS COURIER.

                       FIRST CARTER
                 (counting as he transfers
                  canaries)
          ... twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-
          four.

He closes the doors of the cages, picks up the small
cage. His companion indicates the letter in the woman's
lap.

                       SECOND CARTER
          How about that letter? Does that go,
          too?

                      WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
          No. That's going to be picked up in
          person.

She chuckles. The carriers exit into the mews, stash the
cage in the back of the wagon, mount the driver's seat.

                       WOMAN IN WHEELCHAIR
                 (to birds)
          All right, my pretties. Back to sleep
          you go. See you tomorrow.

She pulls the rope and the tarpaulin drops back over the
cage. Then she deposits the letter on top of the covered
cage, wheels herself out the rear door. As she slides it
shut from outside, our trio is revealed in their hiding
places behind the door. There is the sound of the chain
rattling, the lock snapping, and the squeaky wheels
moving off.

                       WATSON
                 (a sigh of relief)
          I really thought we were done for.

                                                         67.



                       HOLMES
                 (casually)
          The art of concealment, my dear Watson,
          is merely a matter of being in the right
          place at the right time.

They step forward, and through the painted shop window
watch the old woman wheel herself down the street.

                       GABRIELLE
          Did you hear what she said? You really
          think Emile is going to pick up the
          letter himself?

                       HOLMES
          It certainly would simplify things,
          wouldn't it?

                       WATSON
                 (shaking his head)
          Maildrops and canaries and wheelchairs...
          And what was all that about Jonah? And
          what do you suppose they're doing up
          there? And where is up there?

                       HOLMES
          My guess would be Scotland.   Inverness,
          to be more precise.

                       WATSON
          Inverness?

                       HOLMES
          Didn't you notice the paper at the bottom
          of their cage? The Inverness Courier.

Gabrielle glances casually at the letter the old woman
left lying on top of the cage, and her expression
changes.

                       GABRIELLE
          Mr. Holmes! This letter --
                 (she picks it up)

                       HOLMES
          What about it?

                       GABRIELLE
                 (holding it out to him)
          It's addressed to you.

                                                           68.



Holmes takes the letter, examines the envelope.    It is
indeed addressed to him.

                        HOLMES
           Nevertheless --

With the saw-end of his cane, he slits the envelope open,
removes the enclosure, unfolds it. We see the letter in
his hand as he reads it out loud. The letterhead says:
DIOGENES CLUB, St. James's, London.

                        HOLMES
                  (reading)
           My Dear Sherlock: I expect you and Dr.
           Watson to join me at the club immediately
           upon reciept of this note. According to
           my calculations, that should be at 11:40
           a.m. Your brother, Mycroft.
                  (looking up)
           What time do you make it, Watson?

                          WATSON
                    (consulting watch)
           11:43.

                        HOLMES
           Either your watch is wrong, or Mycroft
           has miscalculated. And knowing Mycroft,
           I suggest you reset your watch.

Watson automatcially obeys.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. DIOGENES CLUB - DAY

Holmes, cane in hand, and Watson are swiftly ascending
the steps of a building with an imposing Palladian
facade. Beside the entrance is a discreet sign reading:
DIOGENES CLUB. Members Only. As they reach the top of
the steps, Watson stops Holmes.

                        WATSON
           I don't mind telling you I'm a bit
           apprehensive about this.

                                                      69.



                       HOLMES
          I'm rather curious myself as to what is
          going on in that Machiavellian mind of
          his.

                       WATSON
          I don't mean Mycroft, I mean Madame
          Valladon.

                         HOLMES
          Don't worry.    She's perfectly safe with
          Mrs. Hudson.

He opens the door and they start in.


INT. LOBBY - DIOGENES CLUB - DAY

Dominating the lobby is a large statue of Queen Victoria.
Presiding over the reception desk is a uniformed PORTER
of military bearing, with one arm and a chest full of
campaign ribbons. Holmes and Watson stride in.

                       HOLMES
                 (to porter)
          To see Mr. Mycroft Holmes.

                        PORTER
          Right you are. He's expecting you in the
          upstairs study. Now if you gentlemen
          will sign in --
                 (opens leather-bound
                  register, turns it toward
                  them)
          Surname, Christian name, address, nature
          of business --

He holds out the pen to them, but they are gone. He
looks around in consternation, sees them hurrying up the
majestic staircase, steps out from behind his desk.

                       PORTER
          Gentlemen...!


READING ROOM - DIOGENES CLUB - DAY

A huge room, with more marble than a mausoleum, and just
about as lively.

                                                        70.


A dozen elderly Establishment types are sunk deep in the
leather armchairs, buried behind their copies of The
Times.  Holmes and Watson are proceeding toward the
study.  Suddenly Holmes stops beside one of the old
fossils, who has fallen asleep in his chair, The Times in
his lap, and between his fingers a lighted cigar with an
ash four inches long. Holmes picks up an ashtray, holds
it under the cigar -- just in time to catch the falling
ash. As  he replaces the ashtray, he scrutinizes the ash.

                        HOLMES
           Jamaican, no doubt -- either Tropical or
           Golosina -- I'm not quite sure.

He and Watson continue toward the study door.


INT. STUDY - DIOGENES CLUB - DAY

It is a very elegant room   -- shelves of leather-bound
volumes reach to the high   ceiling, there are antique
terrestrial and celestial   gloves, scientific instruments
in polished brass, marble   busts of English statesmen.

MYCROFT HOLMES is standing at a refectory table, with his
back to the door, engaged in a curious operation. A
dusty bottle of wine is held in an ingeniously engineered
cradle. As he turns the crank, the bottle tilts forward
gently, and he decants the wine into three glasses
without disturbing the sediment.

Mycroft is an impressive figure of a man, seven years
older than Sherlock, impeccably dressed. Behind his
snobbish airs and bantering manner, one senses tremendous
reserves of strength and authority.

The door opens, and Holmes and Watson enter.

                        MYCROFT
                  (without turning)
           Come in, come in, Sherlock -- Dr.
           Watson... Sit down.
                  (Holmes and Watson seat
                   themselves)
           You're looking very fit, both of you.

                        WATSON
           Thank you.

                                                        71.



                       HOLMES
                 (putting down hat and cane)
          And how are you, Mycroft? How's your
          gout?

                       MYCROFT
          Under control. Except for the occasional
          twinge.

He brings over two of the glasses of wine to Holmes and
Watson.

                       MYCROFT
          I have a treat for you -- a very old
          Madeira -- 1814. There are  only six
          bottles left in the world.  I have two of
          them, and am negotiating for a third.

                       WATSON
          If you don't mind my saying so, anybody
          who's susceptible to gout shouldn't be --

Mycroft has moved back to the table and picked up his
glass of Madeira.

                       MYCROFT
          The last doctor who warned me about that
          was crossing Piccadilly, slipped on an
          orange peel, and was run over by a
          delivery van from the Fortnum and Mason.
          Your very good health.

He and Watson sip their drinks, but not Holmes.

                       HOLMES
          Why are you wasting this precious stuff
          on us?

                       MYCROFT
          Well, I see you so rarely. How long has
          it been? Not since the case of the Greek
          interpreter.
                 (to Watson)
          Isn't it ridiculous? Two brothers living
          in the same town...

                       HOLMES
          In the same town, perhaps -- but not the
          same world.

                                              72.



               WATSON
         (taking another sip)
Mmmm.    Superb. How old did you say it
was?

               MYCROFT
1814.    One year before Waterloo.

             WATSON
One year before Waterloo?    Think of that.

             MYCROFT
You do know where Waterloo is, don't you,
Doctor?

             WATSON
Belgium, isn't it?

              MYCROFT
Quite.
       (turning to Holmes)
And speaking of Belgium, it has come to
my attention that you are interested in
the whereabouts of a certain engineer.

              HOLMES
Yes, I am.

             MYCROFT
Well, I can save you a lot of trouble.

             HOLMES
I'd be grateful for any suggestion --

             MYCROFT
My suggestion is that you pursue it no
further.

             HOLMES
Any particular reason?

             MYCROFT
Because it involves the national
security. We are handling this matter
ourselves.

              WATSON
We?   Who's we?

                                                         73.



                       HOLMES
          The Diogenes Club, of course.

                       MYCROFT
          I didn't say that.

                       HOLMES
          I have always suspected that there was
          some underground connection between this
          stodgy and seemingly calcified
          establishment and the Foreign Office in
          Whitehall.

                       MYCROFT
          That's neither here nor there.

                       HOLMES
          It seems to me that The Diogenes Club is
          here, there and everywhere. When there
          are rumblings of revolt in the Sudan, an
          expedition subsidized by your club
          conveniently shows up to study the source
          of the Nile. When there is trouble along
          the Indian frontier, some of your fellow
          members pop up in the Himalayas,
          alledgedly looking for the Abominable
          Snowman.

A YOUNG MAN in morning coat and striped trousers comes
in, holding a telegram. Mycroft crosses to him.

                       MYCROFT
                 (to Watson)
          What a fertile imagination my brother
          has. At the age of five, by
          carefully observing a neighbor's house,
          he deduced that babies were brought not
          by the stork, but by the mid-wife in her
          satchel.

                       WATSON
          As good an explanation as any.

Mycroft has taken the telegram, and is coming forward
with it. The young man clears his throat.

                       MYCROFT
          Yes, Wiggins?

                                                      74.



                       YOUNG MAN
          An immediate answer is requested, sir.

Mycroft inserts a monocle in his eye, opens the telegram,
moves toward the desk reading it.

                       MYCROFT
          Tell them that the three boxes go to
          Glennahurich, and the red runner goes to
          the castle.

                       YOUNG MAN
          The three boxes to Glennahurich, the red
          runner to the castle. Very good, sir.

He exits. Holmes glances toward the telegram as Mycroft
puts it down on his desk. Catching his look, Mycroft
turns his telegram face-down, lets the monocle drop from
his eye.

                       HOLMES
          Why don't you crumple it up and swallow
          it -- to make sure.

                       MYCROFT
          My dear Sherlock, there  are certain
          affairs that do not come  within the
          province of the private  detective. They
          have to be dealt with on  an altogether
          different level.

                       HOLMES
          In other words, you want me to stay
          within my limits.

                         MYCROFT
          I do indeed.

                       HOLMES
          Speaking of limits, what exactly is Jonah
          Limited?

                       MYCROFT
          Sherlock, when I said drop this case, it
          was not merely a suggestion -- it was an
          order!

                       HOLMES
          By whose authority?

                                                         75.



                       MYCROFT
          By the authority of Her Majesty's
          government. I hope I've made myself
          clear.

                          WATSON
          Perfectly.

In his nervousness he drops his bowler, which rolls along
the floor.

                       MYCROFT
          Now if you'll excuse me, gentlemen --

                       WATSON
          Goodbye, sir.

                       HOLMES
          A pleasure, as always.

He and Watson retrieve their hats, move toward the door.

                       MYCROFT
                 (to Holmes)
          Just a minute.
                 (picks up Holmes' cane)
          You forgot your tool-kit.

He tosses the cane to Holmes, who catches it.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. BAKER STREET - DAY

Holmes and Watson are walking toward 221B.   Holmes is
whistling 'Loch Lomond.'

                       WATSON
          You will be gentle, won't you, when you
          tell her you're dropping the case?

                       HOLMES
          Watson, what does the word Glennahurich
          suggest to you?

                       WATSON
          Absolutely nothing.

                                                      76.



                       HOLMES
          It's Scottish.

                       WATSON
          Is it?

                       HOLMES
          And like all Scottish names, it's really
          a word picture. Glen means valley, na
          means of the, and Hurich, if memory
          serves me, means yew tree.

                       WATSON
          You're just trying to impress me.

                       HOLMES
          So the three boxes go to the Valley of
          the Yew Tree.

He resumes whistling. They start to cross the street,
skirting a parked hansom. Feeding the horse is the same
cabbie who fished Gabrielle out of the river, and in the
passenger seat is Von Tirpitz, the craggy-faced Prussian
we saw before. He stares fixedly after Holmes and
Watson.

Holmes and Watson come up to the door of 221B, and Watson
fishes his key out. Holmes is still whistling.

                       WATSON
                 (singing along)
          And I'll be in Scotland before ye...
                 (breaks off, looks at Holmes
                  apprehensively)
          You are dropping the case, aren't you,
          Holmes?

                       HOLMES
          Open the door.

Watson turns the key in the lock, starts to open the
door, but is stopped by a chain on the inside. Through
the opening a revolver appears, aiming at them point-
blank.

                       HOLMES
          Don't shoot, Mrs. Hudson -- you're liable
          to lose two excellent tenants.

                                                       77.




INT. DOWNSTAIRS - 221B BAKER STEET - DAY

Mrs. Hudson withdraws the gun, unhooks the chain. She is
also holding an embroidery hoop. She opens the door, and
Holmes and Watson step into the vestibule.

                      MRS. HUDSON
          Oh, at last. It's been a ghastly
          experience.

                        WATSON
          Why?   What happened?

                       MRS. HUDSON
          Did you ever try doing embroidery with a
          gun in your hand?

                       HOLMES
                 (taking gun from her)
          You'll be relieved to know it was not
          loaded.

He starts up the stairs, followed by Watson.

                       WATSON
          Holmes, you didn't answer my  question.
          Are you planning to disobey  Mycroft's
          orders? He's not just your   brother, you
          know. You'd be defying Her   Majesty's
          government...

No reaction from Holmes. As they reach the landing,
Gabrielle is waiting for them in the open doorway of
their flat.

                        GABRIELLE
          Any news?   Did you find out anything?


INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY

Holmes and Watson step inside.

                       HOLMES
          Let's just say I know what the next step
          will be.

                                                         78.



                       GABRIELLE
                 (anxious)
          Yes?

                       HOLMES
          I want you to pack your things.

                       GABRIELLE
          Where are we going?

                       WATSON
          Holmes, let me caution you ---

Holmes has put the gun down, and is crossing to one of
the book-shelves.

                       HOLMES
                 (to Gabrielle)
          At 7:30 this evening, Dr. Watson and I
          are going to take you to Victoria
          Station, and put you on the boat-train.

                       GABRIELLE
          The boat-train?

                       WATSON
          Well, that's better.

Holmes has taken a railway guide from the shelf and is
consulting it.

                       GABRIELLE
          You're sending me back to Brussels?   Is
          that it?

                       WATSON
          Madame Valladon, you must understand...

                       GABRIELLE
                 (to Holmes, agitated)
          I came here to find my husband -- you
          were going to help me --

                       WATSON
          Yes, my dear. But circumstances have
          changed --

                       GABRIELLE
          The great detective! Well, maybe this
          case is too small for you --

                                                      79.



                       WATSON
          On the contrary. It's being handled at a
          much higher level --

                        GABRIELLE
          Well, I won't go back to Brussels. Maybe
          you're giving up, but I'm not.
                 (tears welling up in her
                  eyes)
          I'm going to go on looking for him. And
          nobody's going to stop me -- even if they
          try to kill me.

                       HOLMES
                 (looking up from railway
                  guide)
          Are you quite finished? If you recall,
          what I said was that we're going to put
          you on the boat-train -- I didn't say you
          were going to stay on it.

                       WATSON
          She's not?

                       HOLMES
          At 7:30, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson will
          be seen waving goodbye to Madame Valladon
          at Victoria Station. At eight-twelve,
          Mr. and Mrs. Ashdown accompanied by their
          valet John --
                 (a glance at Watson)
          -- will appear at Euston Station, and
          board the Highland Express to Inverness.

                       WATSON
          Mr. and Mrs.... ?

                       GABRIELLE
                 (moving toward Holmes)
          Thank you. I'm sorry for what I said.
                 (kisses him on cheek)

                       HOLMES
          That's not necessary.

                       GABRIELLE
                 (smiling through tears)
          I'll go and pack.

She hurries off toward Watson's room.

                                                         80.



                       WATSON
                 (acidly)
          Maybe I should do it, since I'm the
          valet.

Holmes replaces the railway guide on the shelf.

                       WATSON
          Holmes, what exactly are you up to?

                       HOLMES
          As you like to put it in your chronicles,
          the game is afoot.

                       WATSON
          But what game? Are you really that
          interested in the Belgian engineer?

Without answering, Holmes heads for his bedroom.

                       WATSON
          Or the wife of the Belgian engineer?

Holmes, by this time in his bedroom, shuts the door.
Gabrielle reappears from the other bedroom, carrying a
glove.

                       GABRIELLE
          You don't like me very much, do you?

She moves toward the couch.

                       WATSON
          Nothing of the sort. Quite the
          opposite... But there's more to this
          case than meets the eye --

By this time Gabrielle has picked up her parasol from the
couch, and is obviously searching about.

                       WATSON
          Looking for something?

                       GABRIELLE
          My other glove.

                       WATSON
          Let me help you.

                                                        81.



He peers under the couch. Gabrielle moves toward the
window, shakes the parasol, opens it a few times.

                          WATSON
          Here it is.

He comes up from under the couch with the missing glove.

                          GABRIELLE
          Thank you.

She slowly starts to shut the parasol.


EXT. BAKER STREET - DAY

Through the upstairs window of 221B we see Gabrielle
shutting the parasol. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO INCLUDE the
hansom parked across the street, and von Tirpitz
watching. He signals to the cabbie, who is back on his
perch. The cabbie flicks his whip, and the hansom takes
off down the street.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

The Highland Express is speeding northward through the
moonlit landscape, its steam whistle hooting mournfully.


INT. SLEEPING COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

The upper and lower berths have been made up in the
small, gaslit compartment. Gabrielle's dress is on a
hanger, but there is no sign of her at the moment.
Holmes is just pulling a night-shirt over his head.

                         HOLMES
          All right.    You can look now.

Gabrielle's head appears from under the covers of the
lower berth.

                       GABRIELLE
          Am I embarrassing you, Mr. Holmes?

                                                         82.



                       HOLMES
          Not at all. Would it surprise you if I
          told you I once spent the night with 121
          women?

                       GABRIELLE
          Oh?

                       HOLMES
          On a very interesting case -- in a harem
          in Constantinople.

He starts to climb up the ladder to the upper berth.


INT. THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE - NIGHT

There is the normal complement of passengers, men, women
and children, of the middle and lower classes. The only
unusual occupants are a group of seven MONKS, in brown
habits and cowls.

Watson, in valet's livery, comes down the aisle, proceeds
toward a window-seat where he has left his umbrella and
bowler. The resf of the bench is occupied by monks, as
is the facing bench. As Watson tries to squeeze between
them, he steps on the foot of one of the monks.

                       WATSON
          Sorry, father -- I mean, friar -- or is
          it abbot?

There is no answer from the monk. Watson picks up his
bowler, settles himself in his seat, starts to fan
himself with his hat. He turns sociably to the monk
beside him, who is absorbed in his Bible.

                       WATSON
          Going to Scotland, you gentlemen?   So are
          we...

As he fans himself the ear-pieces of his stethoscope,
which is coiled inside the crown of his bowler, dangle
down. He quickly shoves them back inside.

                       WATSON
          I'm a valet. My master and mistress and
          I are our way to Inverness. Ever been
          there? Beautiful country.

                                                        83.



The monk looks up from his Bible, points to his lips,
shakes his head.

                       WATSON
          Oh, forgive me. You must be one of those
          orders that's taken the vow of silence.
          Trappists, I believe you're called.

The monk doesn't answer. Watson turns away, looks out
the window -- but there's nothing to be seen. Then he
folds, bored. He glances casually at the Bible in the
monk's hands.

The Good Book is opened to a page headed: JONAH.

                       WATSON
          I see you're reading the book of Jonah.
          Funny - we were just talking about Johan
          this morning...
                 (realizes the hopelessness of
                  the conversation, breaks
                  off)
          Never mind.

He pulls down the shade, closes his eyes, tries to
compose himself into sleep.


INT. SLEEPING COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

Holmes is stretched out in the upper berth, which is in
darkness. In the lower, Gabrielle is propped up against
a pillow, reading a magazine by the light of a gas lamp.
Other magazines are scattered across her blanket.

                       GABRIELLE
          Women are never to be trusted entirely --
          not the best of them.

Holmes raises himself on his elbow, glances down over the
edge of his berth.

                       HOLMES
          What did you say?

                       GABRIELLE
          I didn't say it -- you did. According to
          Dr. Watson.

                                            84.



            HOLMES
Oh.

             GABRIELLE
He gave me some back issues of Strand
Magazine.

             HOLMES
The good doctor is constantly putting
words into my mouth.

             GABRIELLE
Then you deny it?

             HOLMES
Not at all. I am not a whole-hearted
admirer of womankind.

             GABRIELLE
I'm not very fond of them myself.

             HOLMES
The most affectionate woman I ever knew
was a murderess.

            GABRIELLE
Oh?

             HOLMES
It was one of those passionate affairs --
at odd hours -- right in my laboratory.
And all the time, behind my back, she was
stealing cyanide to sprinkle on her
husband's steak and kidney pie.

             GABRIELLE
You mustn't judge all women by --

             HOLMES
Of course not. Only the ones I was
involved with. And I don't just mean
professionally -- kleptomaniacs,
nymphomaniacs, pyromaniacs. Take my
fiancee, for instance --

             GABRIELLE
Your fiancee?

                                                       85.



                       HOLMES
          She was the daughter of my violin teacher
          -- we were engaged to be married -- the
          invitations were out, I was being fitted
          for a tail-coat -- and twenty-four hours
          before the wedding, she died of
          influenza.

                       GABRIELLE
          I'm sorry.

                       HOLMES
          It just proves my contention that women
          are unreliable and not to be trusted.
                 (a beat)
          Good night, Mrs. Ashdown.

He pulls the curtain across his berth.

                       GABRIELLE
          Good night, Mr. Ashdown.

She closes her curtain, as the train whistle sounds.


INT. THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE - NIGHT

Most of the passengers in the car have fallen asleep, in
various uncomfortable positions, including Watson. The
monk beside Watson looks at him, to make sure he's out,
then rises and moves toward a monk seated apart from the
others.

                       MONK
                 (in a whisper)
          Die Spur fuehrt nach Inverness. Die
          steigen dort aus. Dort muessen wir ihn
          finded -- den Valladon!

The other monk looks up.   Under the cowl we recognize the
face of von Tirpitz.

EXT. INVERNESS STATION - DAY

The Highland Express is pulling out of the station. As
the last car disappears, and the steam clears from the
tracks, we see Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson on the
platform. A BAGGAGEMAN is loading their luggage on a
hand-cart, under Watson's supervision.

                       WATSON
          Let's see -- two, three, four --

Gabrielle removes her parasol, which has been inserted
under the straps of her suitcase.

                       GABRIELLE
          I'll take that.

                       HOLMES
                 (to baggageman)
          How do you get to Glennahurich?    How far
          is it?

                       BAGGAGEMAN
          Glennahurich?

                       WATSON
          You know -- a valley -- with a yew
          tree... ?

Gabrielle casually opens her parasol.

                       BAGGAGEMAN
          It's about a mile out of town.
                 (a beat)
          Why would you be wanting to go there?

                       WATSON
          Well, if it's got a view, it might be a
          nice place for a picnic.

                       BAGGAGEMAN
          It's got a view, right enough -- but it's
          no place for a picnic.

                       HOLMES
          Why not?

                       BAGGAGEMAN
          Because it's a cemetary.

                                                         87.



Gabrielle looks at Holmes. CAMERA PANS UP TOWARD an iron
footbridge, spanning the railway tracks. Moving across
it in single file are the seven cowled Trappist monks,
with von Tirpitz in the lead.

                                               DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. GLENNAHURICH CEMETARY - DAY

Under a leaden sky, the yew trees which give the place
its name brood over ancient gravestones.

Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come down an overgrown path,
stop and look off.

A rather meagre funeral procession is moving along the
avenue which runs between the rows of graves. It
consists of one normal-size pine coffin and two smaller
ones, loaded on a cart which is being wheeled by a couple
of workmen. Bringing up behind is a MINISTER, with an
open prayer book in his hands.

                       WATSON
                 (a note of excitement)
          The three boxes. Is that it, Holmes?

                       HOLMES
          I would think so.

                       GABRIELLE
          The two small ones -- they must be
          children's coffins.

Holmes starts to cut across between the graves, Gabrielle
and Watson following.

At the grave-site, the workmen are removing the coffins
from the cart. There is one large grave, two smaller
ones. A couple of grave-diggers stand by respectfully,
caps in hands.

Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come up behind a nearby
headstone, stop and watch.

At the grave-site, the minister is finishing the service.

                       MINISTER
          ... earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust
          to dust.

                                                         88.


          In sure and certain hope of the
          resurrection to eternal life through our
          Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen.

The workmen trundle the cart off, the minister following.
The grave-diggers don their caps, pick up their shovels.

From their vantage point, Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson
are watching.

                         GABRIELLE
          It's so sad.

                       HOLMES
          Sad -- and rather odd. There are no
          flowers -- and no mourners.

The grave-diggers have finished filling in the graves
when Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come up.

                         HOLMES
          Morning.

                       GRAVE-DIGGER
                 (looking up)
          Morning.

                       HOLMES
          Working you hard, Dad?

                       GRAVE-DIGGER
          Not really. This is healthy country.
          Sometimes you sit around for weeks with
          nothing to do. Then you get three in one
          day.

                       HOLMES
          What happened?

                       GRAVE-DIGGER
          An accident. Aye. Father and two sons,
          they say -- they were found floating in
          the loch.

                       HOLMES
          Local people?

                       GRAVE-DIGGER
          No. Nobody around here knows them. The
          story is that their boat capsized in a
          swell -- but I don't believe it.

                                                       89.



                       HOLMES
          What do you believe?

                       GRAVE-DIGGER
          You may think I'm an old fool or an old
          drunk -- but I've living around Loch Ness
          all my life...

                       WATSON
          Are you trying to tell us it was the
          monster?

                       GRAVE-DIGGER
          Damn right. MacLarnin saw the kids'
          faces when they were pulled out of the
          water -- looked like old men -- must've
          died of fright.

                        WATSON
          Incredible.

                       GRAVE-DIGGER
          Is it? Last Easter Sunday my wife and
          me, we were on our way to services, when
          suddenly... But what's the use?

He picks up a white-washed wooden cross, plants it at the
head of the grave. The other grave-digger has inserted
smaller crosses into the other two mounds of earth.

                       HOLMES
                 (taking some coins out of his
                  pocket)
          Here you are, Dad.
                 (hands them to the grave-
                  digger)

                       GRAVE-DIGGER
          Thank you... You look like nice people.
          If you're wanting a holiday in Scotland,
          go to Loch Lomond, go to Holy Loch -- but
          stay away from Loch Ness.

He and his partner shoulder their shovels, move off.

                       WATSON
                 (snorting)
          To think that people still believe in
          that nonsense. Here we are, living in
          the Nineteenth Century --

                                                       90.



                       GABRIELLE
          I'm ashamed to admit it -- but I was
          relieved when he mentioned a father and
          two boys. It could possibly have
          anything to do with Emile.

                       HOLMES
          It would appear not.

                       WATSON
          However, there still remains the clue of
          the castle and the red runner -- wherever
          it may be.

They are about to get under way when suddenly Holmes
stops them.

Coming down the avenue toward them are four small boys,
in knickerbockers and caps, carrying bouquets of flowers.

Without a word, Holmes draws Gabrielle and Watson back to
their hiding place, behind the headstone.

The four boys approach the freshly-filled graves. They
remove their caps, lay their flowers on each of the two
small graves, then kneel down and bow their heads in
prayer.

From their position behind the headstone, Holmes, Watson
and Gabrielle are watching the four boys, who have their
backs to them.

                       WATSON
          If they're unidentified graves, why are
          those boys bringing flowers?

                       HOLMES
          Because it's their brothers who have just
          been buried.

                       WATSON
          Their brothers?

                       HOLMES
          And they're not boys. They're as tall as
          they'll ever grow. Hand me some pebbles,
          will you?

                       WATSON
          Pebbles.

                                                        91.



He picks some up from the ground, hands them to Holmes,
who tosses them in the direction of the graves. The
pebbles strike a granite cross. At the sound, the four
boys simultaneously turn their heads over their
shoulders. Despite their slight bodies they have the
features of mature men.

Gabrielle and Watson react to the sight.

                       GABRIELLE
          They are -- how do you say it in English?
          -- nains.

                        WATSON
          Midgets.

                       HOLMES
                 (nodding)
          Boys with the faces of old men...

                       WATSON
          I still don't see --

                       HOLMES
          Would it help if I told you they were
          acrobats?

                        WATSON
          Not at all.

                       HOLMES
          Do you remember a tumbling act -- six
          brothers -- missing from the circus?

                       WATSON
          Oh, yes -- that case you turned down -- I
          completely forgot.

                       HOLMES
          Some of us are cursed with memories like
          flypaper. And stuck there is a
          staggering of miscellaneous date, mostly
          useless.

The four midgets have now risen, and putting on their
caps, move off down the avenue. Holmes, Gabrielle and
Watson emerge from their place of concealment.

                                                       92.



                       GABRIELLE
                 (worriedly)
          Mr. Holmes, is those are not children,
          then -- ?

                       HOLMES
          Quite. The question now is -- who's in
          the third grave?

                                                   CUT TO:


EXT. GLENNAHURICH CEMETARY - NIGHT

The point of a crowbar digs under the edge of a coffin
lid, which starts to give with a squealing protest of
nails. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Holmes, standing in
the large grave, from which the earth has been removed.
Kneeling beside the grave, watching anxiously, are
Gabrielle and Watson, the latter holding a bullseye
lantern.

Holmes pries the lid open, disclosing the corpse of a
middle-aged man. His arms are folded across his chest,
and on the third finger of his left hand is a wedding
ring similar to Gabrielle's. From the picture of him we
have seen earlier, we recognize the face as that of Emile
Valladon.

Gabrielle lets out a piercing scream, collapses in a
faint. Watson catches her.

                        WATSON
          Holmes!   She's fainted.

                       HOLMES
                 (preoccupied)
          Hand me that lantern.

Watson passes down the lantern, and Holmes slowly shines
the beam along the length of the coffin.

                       WATSON
          It is Valladon, isn't it?

                       HOLMES
          Obviously. What is not so obvious is why
          his wedding ring has turned green --

                                                        93.



The lantern beam now reveals that laid out at Valladon's
feet are three canaries -- their plumage bleached a grey-
white color.

                       HOLMES
          -- and why there are three dead canaries
          in the coffin. White canaries.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. CALEDONIAN HOTEL - DAWN

An open carriage is proceeding along the driveway toward
the hotel, scatting a flock of sheep grazing nearby.
Watson is sitting beside the coachman. Holmes and
Gabrielle are in the passenger seat, their luggage is
strapped to the back. Through the trees which line the
road we glimpse Loch Ness, which is partly obscured by a
low-lying mist.

The carriage pulls up in front of the hotel, which is
identified by a sign above the entrance, and Holmes,
Watson and Gabrielle get out.


CLOSE SHOT - HOTEL REGISTER

Holmes' hand is writing: Mr. And Mrs. Ashdown and valet,
London.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN

The MANAGER, in kilts, is just opening the curtains --
disclosing a view of the mist-shrouded lake through the
window.

The room is on the second floor, and is furnished in a
style which has been described as Scotch Baronial -- twin
beds with a night-table between them, wardrobe,
chiffonier, desk, a couple of chairs, and several mounted
stags' heads.

Holmes and Gabrielle are in the room, Watson is bringing
their bags through the door.

                                                         94.



                       MANAGER
          You have a lovely view of the loch from
          here -- as soon as the morning mist rolls
          away.
                 (crosses to desk, picks up
                  guide book)
          If you've a mind to do any sight-seeing,
          here's a guide to the local points of
          interest.

                        HOLMES
          Thank you.

The manager starts toward the door, nodding to Watson.

                       MANAGER
          This way, please. I will show you to your
          room.

Watson picks up his suitcase, follows him.


INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

The manager and Watson come out, the latter shutting the
door.

                       WATSON
          I suppose you're putting me in the
          basement.

                       MANAGER
          No, your room is in the attic.

                        WATSON
          Good.

                       MANAGER
          It's the privy that's in the basement.

Watson grunts as the manager leads him up a narrow flight
of stairs.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Holmes removes his coat, turns to Gabrielle.

                       HOLMES
          May I have your wedding ring, please?

                                                       95.



Gabrielle tearfully removes her ring, hands it to Holmes.
From his vest pocket he now produces Valladon's ring --
the copper has a greenish tinge to it. He crosses to the
window, compares the two rings in the light. Gabrielle
sinks down on the edge of one of the beds.

                       HOLMES
          Just as I thought. There is a distinct
          difference in color between your ring and
          your husband's.
                 (a sob from Gabrielle)
          Which leads me to believe that the cause
          of death was not drowning...
                 (Gabrielle is now crying)
          I wish you would stop that.
                 (crossing to her)
          Stop it!

                       GABRIELLE
          I'm sorry.

                       HOLMES
          I know it's not easy. But you must
          remember that we're that nice couple from
          London, on Holiday in the Highlands.

                       GABRIELLE
                 (a final sniffle)
          I'll try.

                       HOLMES
          That's much better.

                       GABRIELLE
          Thank you.

She manages a tentative smile.   Holmes looks at her for a
long moment, then --

                       HOLMES
                 (gruffly)
          Now, if I may proceed without further
          interruptions --

                       WATSON'S VOICE
                 (from off)
          Mr. Ashdown!

                                                       96.




INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

Watson comes dashing down the narrow stairs from the
attic, races toward teh door of Holmes' room.

                         WATSON
          Mr. Ashdown!

He flings the door open.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Watson bursts in breathlessly.

                      WATSON
          Holmes! I saw it! I saw it from the
          attic! It's out there in the lake!

                       HOLMES
          You saw what?

                       WATSON
                 (looking around desperately)
          The telescope. Where's the telescope?

                       HOLMES
          What did you see?

                         WATSON
          The monster!

                         HOLMES
          The monster?

Watson fishes a small telescope out of Holmes' suitcase,
rushes through the open French window to the balcony.


EXT. BALCONY - DAY

Watson focuses the telescope on the lake.


LOCH NESS THROUGH TELESCOPE - DAY

Through the swirling mist which clings to the surface of
the lake, a shadowy figure with a long, monster-like neck
can be see gliding along.

                                                       97.




EXT. BALCONY - DAY

Watson almost drops the telescope in excitement.

                         WATSON
          There it is!    There it is!

Holmes joins him on the balcony.

                       WATSON
          Look for yourself.

He hands the telescope to Holmes. Gabrielle comes up to
the window behind them. Holmes trains the telescope on
the lake.

                         WATSON
          See it?    See it?


LOCH NESS - THROUGH TELESCOPE - DAY

Holmes' eye slowly scans the lake, but there is no sign
of Watson's monster -- just the rolling mist.


EXT. BALCONY - DAY

Holmes lowers the telescope.

                       HOLMES
          I see nothing.

                         WATSON
          Nothing?

He grabs the telescope from Holmes, looks toward the
lake.

                         WATSON
          It's gone.

                        HOLMES
          Gone?   Maybe it was never there.

                       WATSON
          I swear to you -- I saw it -- clear as
          anything --

                                                      98.



                       HOLMES
          Watson, as you so succinctly put it, we
          are living in the Nineteenth Century --

He steps back into the room.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Watson comes halfway through the French window.

                       WATSON
          Maybe that grave-digger was right -- the
          swell, and the boat overturning --

                       HOLMES
          Monsieur Valladon may have been found in
          the lake -- but he did not drown. He
          died of asphyxiation.

                       GABRIELLE
          Asphyxiation.

                       HOLMES
                 (holding up wedding rings)
          There is only one substance that can turn
          a copper ring green and bleach the color
          out of canaries -- chlorine gas.

                       WATSON
          That may be. But the fact remains that I
          saw something out there.

                       HOLMES
          A figment of your imagination. Now let
          us be logical. The only concrete lead we
          have is the reference to the castle --
                 (picks up guide book from
                  desk, opens it to map)
          The question is, which castle?

                       WATSON
          You call yourself logical?   You're the
          least logical man I know.

                        HOLMES
          Am I?

                                                          99.



                       WATSON
          How can you say it's a figment of my
          imagination, when for years you've been
          saying I have no imagination whatsoever!

He looks at Holmes almost triumphantly.

                                                      CUT TO:


SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

Holmes, Gabrielle, and Watson bicycling away from the
hotel. Holmes, in knickerbockers and a Norfolk jacket,
and Gabrielle, holding her parasol, are on a tandem.
Watson is behind them, on a bicycle with a picnic basket
attached to the rack. He is in his valet's outfit, with
metal clips around his trouser cuffs.

The three of them bicycling past a long stone wall.

They pedal up to an imposing castle.   Holmes dismounts,
knocks on the front door.

Our trio bicycling through a copse of trees.

They approach another castle.

On a steep road, they ride through a flock of sheep.

They are proceeding along a causeway, away from a third
castle.

                                                      CUT TO:


EXT. LAKE SHORE - DAY

Holmes and Gabrielle are sitting on a blanket, the
contents of the picnic basket spread before them, having
lunch. Watson is pouring the wine. Their bicycles are
resting nearby.

                       WATSON
          We have so far investigated  eight drafty
          castles -- had our bicycles  attacked by
          sheep and our ears assaulted  by bagpipes
          -- and we are exactly where  we started.

                                                      100.



                       HOLMES
                 (to Gabrielle)
          Would you like some cranberry sauce,
          dear?

                         GABRIELLE
          Yes, dear.

                       HOLMES
          Would you pass the cranberry sauce,
          please, John?

                         WATSON
          Yes, dear.

As he does so, he catches sight of something o.s.

                       WATSON
                 (calling)
          I say there. Good afternoon.     Remember
          me?

On the road above, approaching a bridge which spans the
lake where it narrows into a stream, are the seven
Trappist monks, walking slowly in single file.

Watson waves to them, but the monks pay no attention to
him.

                       WATSON
                 (to Holmes)
          Some chaps I met on the train. We had a
          long conversation -- or rather, I had a
          long conversation -- because they're not
          allowed to talk -- Trappists, you know.
          Just study their Bibles. You'll never
          guess what the one next to me was reading
          -- the Book of Jonah -- isn't that odd?

                         HOLMES
                   (looking after the monks)
          Quite.

As he turns back, he notices that Gabrielle is
manipulating her parasol in the air.

                       HOLMES
          What is it, dear? What's the matter?

                                                      101.



                       GABRIELLE
          A bee.

She continues to work the parasol, alternately opening it
and partially closing it.

On the bridge von Tirpitz, who is at the rear of the file
of monks, glances back toward the lakeshore.

                                               DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. URQUHART CASTLE - DAY

On a promontory jutting into Loch Ness stand the remains
of a medieval fortress. Around the Tower, the Motte, and
the ruins of the East wall, wooden scaffolding has been
erected, and a couple of dozen men are engaged in what
appears to be repair work. Amidst the rubble of the
Nether Bailey, an encampment of tents has been set up.

Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come bicycling up along a
fence on the heights overlooking the castle, dismount in
front of the locked gates. Attached to the gatepost is a
sign reading: WARNING: No Unauthorized Person Permitted
Beyond This Point.

                       WATSON
          Well, I don't think we have to bother
          with this castle. It's just a pile of
          rubble.

                       GABRIELLE
          Then why are they taking precautions?

She points to the sign -- and to a guard coming up the
driveway, with a couple of huge mastiffs on leashes.

                       HOLMES
          Why, indeed?
                 (turning the tandem around)
          Let's go.

                       WATSON
          Go where?

                       HOLMES
          When rebuffed at the front door, one's
          only choice is to try the tradesmen's
          entrance.

                                                     102.



They move off.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. URQUHART CASTLE - DAY

Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson are coming up a path from
the lakeside, leading their bicycles. They lean the
cycles against a ruined wall, start across the courtyard.
A middle-aged MAN in kilts emerges from the tumbled-down
gatehouse, comes toward them.

                        GUIDE
          Sorry.   No visitors allowed.

                       HOLMES
          Are you the guide here?

                       GUIDE
          Yes. The castle is closed to the public
          while work is going on.

                       HOLMES
          What are they doing?

                       GUIDE
          It's being restored by the Society for
          the Preservation of Scottish Monuments.

                       HOLMES
          Too bad. I particularly wanted my wife
          to see Urquhart Castle. The tower is one
          of the most interesting examples of --
          about 1400, wasn't it?

                       GUIDE
          That's right.

                       HOLMES
          Let me see -- was it built under James
          the Second or James the Third?

                       GUIDE
          The Thrid... If you come back next year,
          we'll be all done here, and I'll be glad
          to show you around.

                       HOLMES
          Thank you.

                                                      103.



As the three of them move off, a canvas-topped wagon
comes through the stone archway, stops at the front of
the steps leading to the inner courtyard.

                       WATSON
          Pleasant sort, isn't he?

                       HOLMES
          Pleasant, but ignorant. He was off one
          hundred years and one James.
                 (taps guide-book in his
                  pocket)
          It's actually 1500 and James the Fourth.

                       GABRIELLE
          If he's an official guide, shouldn't he
          know... ?

                       HOLMES
          If he's an official guide.

They have now reached the wall against which they left
their bicycles. Suddenly Holmes stops, attracted by the
sound of birds chirping.

                        HOLMES
          Listen...   Do you hear anything, Watson?

                       WATSON
                 (concentrating)
          No. Those birds are making too much of a
          racket.

                       HOLMES
                 (looking off)
          They're not just birds -- they're our old
          friends.

Watson and Gabrielle follow his gaze.

From the back of the wagon, the carriers have removed the
small bird-cage we saw in the mail-drop on Ashdown
Street. They hand it to a workman, who starts up the
steps with it. To another couple of workmen they pass
down an open-sided crate in which rest two heavy glass
bottles protected by wicker. Stencilled on the wooden
slate of the crate are the words: SULPHURIC ACID -
CORROSIVE.

                                                         104.



Holmes is watching thoughtfully, Gabrielle and Watson are
puzzled.

                          WATSON
             Sulphuric acid?

                          GABRIELLE
             The more we find out the less sense it
             makes.

                          HOLMES
             To a graduate chemist it makes a great
             deal of sense. Sulphuric acid, when
             exposed to salt-water, produces chlorine
             gas.
                    (a beat)
             Would you mind clasping your hands,
             Watson?

                          WATSON
                    (obeying)
             Like this?

                          HOLMES
             A little lower... Thank you.

Watson has lowered his clasped hands, and Holmes uses
them as a foothold to go scrambling up the scaffolding of
the nearby wall. Reaching the top, he looks off in the
direction of the tower.

The workman carrying the canary cage, and the two
carrying the crate of sulphuric acid are approaching the
tower. A draw-bridge comes down, and the three men cross
the moat and enter the tower.

                          HOLMES
                    (looking off)
             That tower may be more interesting than I
             thought -- and not just architecturally.

Out of the ruined gatehouse comes the guard with the two
mastiffs on leashes. The dogs start to snarl viciously.

                          WATSON
             Holmes, I have a feeling we're redundant
             here.

                                                      105.



Holmes leaps down from the scaffolding, wheels the tandem
around, starts back in the direction from which they
came. Gabrielle follows. Watson hurries after them with
his bicycle, casting anxious glances over his shoulder as
the dogs continue barking.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. LOCH NESS - EARLY EVENING

The sun has just gone down behind the hills, but there is
still light in the sky. An ominous mist is beginning to
settle on the water.

Gabrielle is sitting in the stern of a rowboat, her
parasol in her lap. She is wearing Holmes' Norfolk
jacket over her dress to ward off the chill.

On the rowing seat, facing her, are Watson and Holmes,
the latter in his waistcoat. Their oars are pulled in,
and they are watching Urquhart Castle, on the opposite
side of the lake.

                       WATSON
          We have now observed the castle from the
          front, from the back, from the side, from
          land, from water... what now?  Are you
          planning to spend the night out here?

                       HOLMES
          If necessary.

                       WATSON
          You're going to catch your death of cold.
                 (to Gabrielle)
          Wouldn't it be ironic if Holmes' last
          case were a case of pneumonia?
                 (with an embarrassed chuckle)
          Sorry.

Gabrielle glances past them, and her eyes widen.

                       GABRIELLE
                 (pointing off)
          What's that?

Holmes and Watson turn their heads.

                                                      106.



About half a mile away, moving in and out of patches of
drifting mist, is Watson's monster, its long reptillian
neck cutting through the water.

Watson leaps to his feet.

                        WATSON
          Holmes!

Holmes grabs his arm, pulls him back into his seat.

                       HOLMES
          Quick, Watson. After it!

He grabs his oar, and Watson belatedly joins in. They
strain at the oars, setting a course which will intercept
the monster.  Gabrielle leans forward in her seat, trying
to peer past them through the curtains of mist.

The monster is much closer now -- no more than a quarter
of a mile away.

Suddenly Watson stops rowing.

                       WATSON
          Holmes, what are we doing?   We should be
          going away from it.

                       HOLMES
          Keep rowing, dammit!

Watson resumes pulling on his oar.   As they row, Holmes
looks over his shoulder.

The monster has started to submerge. Its head disappears
beneath the surface of the water, and the wake it leaves
behind soon trails off into the mist.

Holmes ships his oar.

                       HOLMES
          We've lost it.

                       WATSON
                 (stops rowing)
          At least you admit there's an it, not
          just a figment of my imagination.

                        HOLMES
          Quiet.

                                                      107.



He listens intently. There is only the sound of water
slapping against the side of the boat. The mist is
heavier now, and billowing around them.

                       HOLMES
                 (to Watson)
          Do you have your stethoscope with you?

                       WATSON
          Never without it.

He removes his bowler, unwinds the stethoscope from the
inside the crown, hands it to Holmes. Holmes plugs in
the ear-pieces, leans over the side of the boat, extends
the other end of the stethoscope to the surface of the
water.

                        WATSON
          What is it?

                       HOLMES
          I can hear something...

We become aware of the faint beating of engines,
accompanied by a bubbling sound.

                       HOLMES
          It's getting closer -- closer --

Suddenly the surface of the water breaks, about twenty
yards away from them, and the head and neck of the
monster rear up from the depths. Watson is first to
notice it and jumps to his feet, making choking noises.
Gabrielle sees it and screams. Watson grabs an oar,
throws it at the monster as it comes past. The backwash
hits the boat broadside, rocking it, and Holmes, Watson
and Gabrielle are spilled into the lake.

The monster moves away from them, heading in the general
direction of the castle. It disappears into the mist.

Holmes is the first to come up, looks around, sees
Gabrielle surfacing a few yards away, swims to her.

                       HOLMES
          Are you all right?

                       GABRIELLE
          I lost my parasol.

                                                        108.



                       HOLMES
          Where's Watson?

He glances around, sees Watson's bowler floating nearby,
swims over to it.

                       HOLMES
          Watson?

He lifts the hat -- but Watson isn't under it.

As Gabrielle hoists herself into the boat, Watson
clambers over the other side. After a moment Holmes
joins them, and they sit there, sopping wet and breathing
heavily.

                       WATSON
          I have come face to   face with man-eating
          tigers -- I was once   caught in a stampede
          of wild elephants --   India, you know --
          but I wasn't half as   frightened. This
          beast seems to have   a personal grudge
          against us.

                       GABRIELLE
          I just hope it doesn't come back.

                       HOLMES
          I don't think it will.
                 (pointing off)
          Look!

They glance in the indicated direction.

There is no sign of the monster. But the mist has
momentarily lifted to reveal the castle, and an odd sight
greets their eyes -- the wooden scaffolding in front of
the tower is slowly rising into the air.

                       WATSON
                 (amazed)
          What strange goings-on.

                       HOLMES
          Not really. My guess is that the
          monster, after a hard day's work, has
          returned home for his supper.

                                                        109.



The scaffolding in front of the tower slowly descends
back into the place, as mist once more engulfs the
castle.

                                               DISSOLVE TO:


INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Holmes, in a different suit   of clothes, is pacing across
the room, whistling the main   theme from "Swan Lake." He
stops before the open French   window, gazes out toward the
lake. Gabrielle is propped    up in bed, a blanket drawn up
to her chin, watching him.    Watson, who has changed into
a pair of kilts, is standing   in front of the fireplace,
warming his backside.

Gabrielle glances at Watson, suppresses a giggle.

                       WATSON
          Yes, I know. But would you believe that
          you can't borrow a decent pair of
          trousers in this place?

Holmes resumes pacing, and Watson becomes aware of his
whistling.

                       WATSON
          Would you like to confide in us?

No answer from Holmes.    Watson turns to Gabrielle.

                       WATSON
          Whenever he starts whistling, I know he's
          getting close to a solution.

                       HOLMES
          It's nothing new, actually. We've come
          across this situation before.

                        WATSON
          We have?   Where?

                       HOLMES
          At the ballet.

                          WATSON
          Ballet?

                                            110.



             HOLMES
There's a lake -- and there's a castle --
and there's a swan that isn't really a
swan -- or, in this case, a monster that
isn't really a monster --

             WATSON
Then what is it?

             HOLMES
What is it indeed that feeds on canary
birds and sulphuric acid, and has an
engine for a heart?

             GABRIELLE
An engine?

             HOLMES
The stethoscope is a very sensitive
instrument, and water is an excellent
conductor of sound. There is no doubt
that what we are dealing with is a
mechanical monster.

             WATSON
Oh?

             HOLMES
Not only is it equipped with an
artificial heart, it also has artificial
lungs. Judging from the bubbles on the
surface of the lake, it uses some form of
air pump.

             GABRIELLE
You think my husband was involved in all
this?

             HOLMES
Yes, Madame Valladon.    I'm sure of it.

             WATSON
But why would anybody build a mechanical
monster? Just to scare people?

             HOLMES
Not very likely.

                                                      111.



                       GABRIELLE
          Why did they try to keep me from finding
          my husband? And why was he buried
          anonymously?

                       HOLMES
          I think I have a pretty good notion of
          what they're up to -- the Society for the
          Preservation of Scottish Monuments --
          better known as the Diogenes Club.

                       WATSON
          The Diogenes Club?

There is a knock on the door.

                       HOLMES
          Come in.

The door opens and the hotel manager enters, holding a
magnum of champagne.

                       MANAGER
          Mr. Ashdown, I have a bottle of champagne
          for you.

                       HOLMES
                 (crossing to him)
          A bottle of champagne? I didn't order
          it.

                       MANAGER
          No, indeed. You are to deliver it.
          These are my instructions.

He hands the magnum to Holmes.

                       HOLMES
          Instructions from whom?   Deliver it
          where?

                       MANAGER
          I wouldn't know, sir. But there's a
          carriage waiting for you downstairs.

                       HOLMES
          Are you sure you have the right Mr.
          Ashdown?

                                                       112.



                       MANAGER
                 (flatly)
          Quite sure, Mr. Holmes.

He turns and exits.   Holmes taps the bottle of champagne
thoughtfully.

                       HOLMES
          Well, Watson, I would say the curtain is
          going up on the last act.

                       WATSON
          I don't like the sound of it.

                       GABRIELLE
          Please be careful.

As Holmes starts toward the door, Watson reaches into his
sporran.

                       WATSON
          You'd better take this with you.

He produces a revolver, holds it out to Holmes.    Holmes
ignores it, exits.


EXT. CALEDONIAN HOTEL - NIGHT

A gig is waiting in front of the entrance, and leaning
against it is the guide we saw earlier at Urquhart.
Holmes comes out, carrying the champagne bottle.

                       HOLMES
          Who's minding the castle?

                       GUIDE
          You'd better get on.     It's late.

Holmes climbs into the gig, and the guide moutns the seat
beside him.

                       HOLMES
          Where are we going?    Some sort of party?

                       GUIDE
          You won't be disappointed in the guest
          list.

                                                       113.



                       HOLMES
          Who's the host?

                          GUIDE
          Jonah.

He flicks the reins. The horse starts off at a trot, and
the gig turns into the driveway.


EXT. MOVING GIG - NIGHT

As they drive along, Holmes glances at the guide, who is
grim and uncommunicative.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. ROAD LEADING TO CASTLE - NIGHT

The gig, with its two passengers, proceeds along the
lakeshore, approaching the entrance to Urquhart.


EXT. URQUHART CASTLE - NIGHT

A workman is lighting a couple of torches attached to the
ruined gatehouse when the gig comes through the archway.
The guide reins up the horse in front of the steps
leading to the inner courtyard -- which are now covered
with a narrow red carpet.

The guide nods to Holmes, who dismounts, starts up the
steps, examining the red carpet. As he reaches the top,
he looks off.

The strip of red carpet runs across the courtyard, lit by
torches planted in the ground. A couple of workmen are
are unrolling the rest of the carpet toward the entrance
of the tower.

As Holmes passes one of the tents, the flap opens and
Mycroft steps out, dressed in his inevitable frock coat.

                       MYCROFT
          Mr. Ashdown, I presume.

                       HOLMES
                 (turning)
          The red runner, I presume.

                                                       114.


                 (indicates carpet)
          You shouldn't have gone to all this
          trouble just for me.

                       MYCROFT
          It's not for you.
                 (calling into tent)
          McKeller.
                 (to Holmes)
          May I have the champagne, please?

                       HOLMES
                 (handing him bottle)
          1886 -- not a very good vintage, is it?

                        MYCROFT
          Mediocre.   But then again, it's not for
          drinking.

A black-suited MAN emerges from the ten, and Mycroft
gives him the champagne.

                       MYCROFT
          Tie it up, will you?

The man moves off toward the tower.   Mycroft pulls back
the flap of the tent.

                       MYCROFT
          In here.

Holmes passes inside, Mycroft following.


INT. TENT - NIGHT

It is lit by a kerosene lamp suspended from the ridge-
pole. There are several cots, one of them with the
bedding rolled up. Resting on the stripped cot is a
trunk with the name E. VALLADON painted on it. Lying on
a table, among a group of engineering models, are
Gabrielle's parasol and Watson's stethoscope. There are
also a couple of drafting tables, with plans and
blueprints tacked to them.

Holmes moves around the tent, taking all this in.

                       HOLMES
          Interesting -- and educational.

                                             115.



             MYCROFT
Despite my most emphatic warning, you
persisted in meddling. It would have
served you right if you'd all drowned.

             HOLMES
Sorry to be so unobliging.
       (stops beside torch)
E. Valladon... H'mm.

             MYCROFT
       (indicating parasol   and
        stethoscope)
I imagine this belongs to    the pretty
lady, and this belongs to    your valet...
We found them floating in    the lake.

             HOLMES
Speaking about things floating in the
lake --

             MYCROFT
How much do you know -- or think you
know?

             HOLMES
I think you're testing some sort of
underwater craft -- camouflauged to
mislead the gullible. I think it's an
experimental model, operated by a crew of
midgets. I think it is powered by
sulphuric acid batteries, and uses
canaries to detect escaping gas...
Altogether a strange contraption.

             MYCROFT
Not quite that unique. Right now, four
countries are trying to develop what we
call a submersible. But none of them
could solve the critical problem -- how
to stay submerged long enough to make it
effective.

             HOLMES
What does the Good Book say? "And Jonah
lived in the belly of that fish for three
days and three nights."

                                            116.



             MYCROFT
That was our goal. And thanks to
Valladon's air-pump, we got a jump on the
rest of them. It's a highly complex
system of filtration -- so we had a
series of trials --

             HOLMES
And at least one error.

             MYCROFT
During a test run in Moray Firth,
pressure caused a leak in the hull. Sea
water mixed with the acid in the
batteries to produce chlorine gas.
Before they could reach the surface,
Valladon and the crew were dead.

             HOLMES
So you had them buried in unmarked
graves, to preserve your secret.

             MYCROFT
It was essential to keep the information
from your client.

             HOLMES
You went to all those lengths to prevent
Madame Valladon from fiding her husband?

             MYCROFT
Your client isn't Madame Valladon -- it's
the Imperial German Government. They
were after the Belgian engineer -- or
rather, his invention. They knew he was
employed by us, but they couldn't find
out where -- so they enlisted the best
brain in England to help them. You, my
dear brother, have been working for the
Wilhelmstrasse.

             HOLMES
And Madame Valladon -- what part did she
play in all this?

             MYCROFT
Madame Valladon is dead.

            HOLMES
Dead?

                                                       117.



Mycroft crosses to the trunk, opens the lid.

                       MYCROFT
          The Germans disposed of her three weeks
          ago, in Brussels. This is Gabrielle
          Valladon.

He hands Holmes a small, framed photograph. Holmes looks
at it with apprehension, as well he should: the picture
is of a somewhat matronly woman, not the glamorous
Gabrielle. Holmes lowers  the photograph. Behind it,
Mycroft is glaring at him with customary arrogance.

                       MYCROFT
          The woman who was brought to your house
          in the middle of the night -- apparently
          fished out of the Thames -- and
          apparently suffering from amnesia -- is,
          in fact, Ilse von Hoffmanstal, one of
          their most skillful agents. Am I going
          too fast for one of the "best brains in
          England?"

                        HOLMES
          Go on.

As Mycroft continues, Holmes picks up Ilse's water-soaked
parasol and examines it.

                       MYCROFT
          They planted her on you quite neatly, I
          must admit, so that you could lead them
          to their objective, the air pump. Very
          much like using a hog to find truffles.
          And now perhaps you'd care to join me. I
          am expecting a certain royal personage
          from Balmoral.


EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT

A coach and escort approach the castle. Painted on the
door of the coach are the initials "V.R."


INT. CASTLE COURTYARD

The entourage enters the castle courtyard and stops.
Footmen open the door and bow to the lone passenger.

                                                     118.



Waiting on top of the steps, outside the tent, are
Mycroft and Holmes. Lined up on the other side of the
torch-lit red carpet are half a dozen scientists, in
their best clothes.

Out of the coach steps a familiar figure -- Her Majesty,
QUEEN VICTORIA, Defender of the Faith, Empress of India.
She is 69 years old, and dressed entirely in black.

Mycroft comes down the carpeted steps to meet her.

                       MYCROFT
          Your Majesty.

He bows. The Queen extends her hand to him, and he
touches it.

                       MYCROFT
          I trust you had a pleasant journey,
          Ma'am.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          It was long and it was tedious. And it
          had better be worth our while, Mr.
          Holmes.

                       MYCROFT
          I can assure you, Ma'am, it will be.

A lady-in-waiting and a uniformed equerry have now
descended from the coach. Mycroft leads the party up the
steps.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          Now what is this curious ship we are
          supposed to christen?

                       MYCROFT
          We call it a submersible, Ma'am.    It
          travels under water.

                         QUEEN VICTORIA
          Under water?    What a fantastic idea.

They have now reached the top of the steps.

                                            119.



             MYCROFT
Ma'am, may present some of the scientists
who were responsible for this
achievement. J.W. Ferguson, naval
architect --

             FIRST SCIENTIST
       (bowing)
Your Majesty.

             MYCROFT
Professor Simpson, our leading expert on
hydraulics --

             SECOND SCIENTIST
       (bowing)
Your Majesty.

             MYCROFT
W.W. Prescott, co-inventor of the
revolving periscope --

             THIRD SCIENTIST
       (bowing)
Your Majesty.

             MYCROFT
And this is Sir Arthur Grisby, our
authority on maritime ballistics --

             QUEEN VICTORIA
We don't claim to understand any of this.
But England is proud of you, gentlemen.
To think that man can now observe fish in
their native habitat --

             MYCROFT
       (trying to correct her)
Well, not exactly, Ma'am --

             QUEEN VICTORIA
-- and underwater plants and coral
reefs --
       (noticing Holmes)
Young man -- what was your contribution
to this project?

             HOLMES
I'm afraid it was rather negligible, Your
Majesty.

                                                     120.



                       MYCROFT
                 (to the Queen)
          This is my brother, Sherlock, Ma'am.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          Ah, yes. Sherlock Holmes. We have been
          following your exploits with great
          interest.

Holmes bows, touches the Queen's extended hand.

                       HOLMES
          Thank you, Ma'am.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          Are you engaged in one of your
          fascinating cases at the moment?

                       HOLMES
          In a manner of speaking, Ma'am.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          When can we expect to read Dr. Watson's
          account of the case?

                       HOLMES
          I hope never, Ma'am. It has not been one
          of my more successful endeavors.

Mycroft signals to a bagpiper, who starts playing HIELAN'
LADDIE.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          Ah, the ceremonies are about to begin.
                 (to Mycroft)
          Now where is this underwater ship of
          yours?

                       MYCROFT
                 (pointing to tower)
          In the dungeon, Ma'am.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          The dungeon? What a peculiar place to
          keep it.
                 (turning to the others)
          Well, let us get on with it, gentlemen.

                                                     121.



Mycroft leads the Queen along the red runner toward the
tower. Holmes follows, then the lady-in-waiting and the
equerry, then the scientists.

As they cross the inner courtyard, the Highland piper
falls in ahead of the procession, leads them toward the
drawbridge. Then he steps aside,  as the royal party
crosses the drawbridge and passes through the door of the
tower.


INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT

A high-ceilinged rock chamber, with a spiral iron
staircase leading down. The floor is a concrete ramp,
the lower end of it covered with water. Beyond is the
entrance from the Loch, camouflaged by scaffolding and
vegetation.

On the upper part of the ramp is a small, primitive
submarine, resting on wheels. Prominently lettered on
the bow is the name H.M.S. JONAH, and suspended by a rope
from the prow is the magnum of champagne which Holmes
delivered. Along the sides are torpedo tubes, and fitted
over the conning tower is the head and neck of the
"monster" we saw in the lake.

Present are half a dozen naval personnel, commanded by an
officer. As the royal party comes down the spiral
staircase, the officer snaps to attention. Mycroft is in
the lead, followed by the Queen, Holmes, the lady-in-
waiting, the equerry and the scientists.

                       MYCROFT
          There she, Ma'am. Her Majesty's Ship
          Jonah.

The four surviving midgets appear on the deck, in wool
jerseys and navy caps. They start pulling on a chain
which slowly raises the detachable head-and-neck of the
monster toward the ceiling, disclosing the conning tower
and the periscope.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          And what, may we ask, is the purpose of
          that hideous gargoyle?

                       MYCROFT
          It's merely a decoy, Ma'am.

                                                      122.



                      QUEEN VICTORIA
          Oh. To frighten away the sharks, we
          imagine.

                       MYCROFT
          Something of the sort... The crew will
          now demonstrate the workings of the
          submersible.

A SAILOR of normal height appears on the deck of the sub.

                       SAILOR
          Stand to.

The midgets scramble down the hatch.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          Aren't they rather small for sailors?

                       MYCROFT
          They are. But because of the size of the
          craft, the Navy made an exception.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          They should make it a rule. It's quite
          fatiguing to pin on all those medals
          while standing on our toes.

There is the sound of the engines starting. Mycroft
leads the Queen to an open bulkhead in the side of the
sub, with Holmes and rest of the party close behind.

Inside, all is noise and confusion. Metal rods are
dipping into glass jars of sulphuric acid, complicated
machinery is driving the propeller shaft, bellows are
inflating and deflating, etc. The midgets are at their
stations in the cramped quarters, pulling switches,
oiling the engines, operating the periscope. Overhead is
a cageful of canaries, all chirping away. Mycroft points
out the various features to the Queen.

                       MYCROFT
          This is the main engine, which propels it
          under water at the rate of two knots --
          the stabilizing mechanism -- the multi-
          stage compressor -- the ballast tank
          trimmer -- the air-pump which filters and
          recirculates the air --

                                                      123.



                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          How charming.

                       MYCROFT
          The air pump, Ma'am?

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
                 (pointing)
          The canaries. Must make the crew feel at
          home.

                       MYCROFT
          Yes, Ma'am. These are the levers for
          firing the torpedoes, which are accurate
          up to as much as 120 feet -- the
          periscope for scanning the surface of the
          water --

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          But where is the glass bottom?

                       MYCROFT
          The what, Ma'am?

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          The glass bottom.

                       HOLMES
          You know -- to see the fist --

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          -- and the plants and the corals --

                       MYCROFT
          That's not quite the idea, Ma'am. H.M.S.
          Jonah is being commissioned as a warship.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          A warship?
                 (waving her hand)
          Stop that noise. Stop it!

At a signal from Mycroft, the sub engines are turned off.

                       MYCROFT
          Ma'am, if I may explain --

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          You had better.

                                                     124.



                       MYCROFT
          The Admiralty regards this craft as the
          ultimate weapon in naval warfare. It can
          seek out enemy ships and destroy them --
          with these torpedoes -- while remaining
          completely invisible.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          You mean in can fire at other vessels
          while under water?

                        MYCROFT
          Yes, Ma'am.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          Without any warning?

                       MYCROFT
          That is correct, Ma'am.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          And without showing her colors?

                       MYCROFT
          Indeed, Ma'am.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          Mr. Holmes, we are not amused.
                 (Mycroft stares at her)
          It is unsportsmanlike, it is un-English,
          and it is in very poor taste. We will
          have none of it!

                       MYCROFT
          I beg your pardon, Ma'am?

He exchanges a look with Holmes.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          Sometimes we despair of the state of the
          world. What will scientists think of
          next?

                       MYCROFT
          That's precisely it, Ma'am. At this very
          moment the Germans under Count von
          Zeppelin, are experimenting with a
          dirigible --

                                                      125.



                      QUEEN VICTORIA
          A dirigible? And what, pray, is that?

                       MYCROFT
          A rigid balloon, which could fly over
          London and drop a bomb on Buckingham
          Palace. It is being developed at the
          express orders of Kaiser Wilhelm the
          Second.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          Nonsense. We refuse to believe that our
          grandson Willie would do a thing like
          that.

                       MYCROFT
          We have conclusive proof, Ma'am. Our
          agent in Friedrichshafen, a man named
          Ibbetson, actually saw the dirigible, and
          made a drawing of it. Unfortunately, he
          was apprehended before he could cross the
          border.

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
                 (indicating sub)
          Nevertheless, we don't want any part of
          this beastly invention. Get rid of it!
          Scuttle it! The sooner the better.

                       MYCROFT
          May I point out, Ma'am --

                       QUEEN VICTORIA
          And don't concern yourself about that
          dirigible dropping bombs on us. We shall
          write a very sharp note to the Kaiser.
                 (to equerry)
          Now we wish to return to Balmoral.

She starts toward the spiral staircase. The equerry
precedes her up the stairs, the lady-in-waiting follows,
the scientists trail after them. Mycroft and Holmes
linger behind.

                       HOLMES
          Well, Mycroft, it seems we have both been
          undone by a woman.
                 (Mycroft is staring at the
                  sub)
          What a shame.

                                                        126.


          All that superb engineering, and all that
          cunning espionage, for nought.

                       MYCROFT
          Not necessarily. If the Germans want
          that submersible so badly, why don't we
          give it to them?

                       HOLMES
          Give it to them?

                       MYCROFT
          Invite them aboard for the final journey
          -- seven hundred feet -- straight down.

                       HOLMES
          And how are you going to arrange that?

                       MYCROFT
          I'm rather counting on you to do it.
          Since you are on such intimate terms with
          Fraulein von Hoffmanstal.

O.s., the bagpiper resumes playing.

                       MYCROFT
          Shall we say goodbye to Her Majesty?

He starts up the spiral staircase.    Holmes follows slowly
and thoughtfully.

                                               DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. CALEDONIAN HOTEL - DAWN

The gig, with the quide driving and Holmes beside him,
comes up the driveway, stops in front of the entrance.
Holmes hops down, and twirling Gabrielle's parasol in his
hand, walks into the hotel.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN

In the half-light, Gabrielle can be seen asleep in her
bed. She is wearing the pink negligee with the maribou
feathers, which has slipped halfway off her shoulders.
The other bed has not been slept in.

The door from the corridor opens and Holmes steps in,
carrying the parasol.

                                                      127.


He crosses to Gabrielle's bed, looks down at her for a
long moment, adjusts the negligee with the tip of the
parasol. The he moves to the French window, opens it,
glances out.


LAKEFRONT - FROM HOLMES' ANGLE - DAWN

The seven Trappist monks are standing on the shore,
silhouetted against the water, watching the hotel.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN

Holmes withdraws from the window , looks at the sleeping
Gabrielle, then casually swings the parasol, hitting a
metal lamp-shade overhead. Gabrielle sits up abruptly in
bed, clutching her negligee around her.

                       HOLMES
          Sorry about that. But as long as you're
          up -- what is the German word for castle?
          Schloss, isn't it?

                       GABRIELLE
                 (carefully)
          I think so.

                       HOLMES
          And how would you say under the castle?
          Unter das Schlss? Or die Schloss?

                       GABRIELLE
          I don't know. My German isn't that good.

                       HOLMES
                 (indicating)
          Your Trappist friends are out there
          waiting to hear from you -- it's a chilly
          morning -- we don't want to keep them
          standing around too long, do we, Fraulein
          Hoffmanstal?
                 (Gabrielle looks at him
                  without answering)
          Come now. It's too late to play cat and
          mouse.

                       GABRIELLE
                 (flatly)
          Unter dem Schloss.

                                                        128.



                         HOLMES
            Thank you.
                   (holding out parasol)
            Here's your signalling device -- it's a
            bit damp, I'm afraid -- would you care to
            let them know where they can find the
            submersible?
                   (Gabrielle makes no move to
                    take the parasol)
            No? Then I'll just have to do it myself.
                   (moving toward window)
            I only hope my Morse code is adequate to
            the occasion.

Keeping well to one side of the open window, he extends
the parasol outside, opens it, starts sending out a
series of long and short signals.


LAKEFRONT - DAWN

von Tirpitz and the other monks strain their eyes in the
direction of the hotel.


HOTEL - FROM MONKS' ANGLE - DAWN

Outside the hotel window, Gabrielle's parasol can be seen
flashing the message UNTER DEM SCHLOSS in Morse code --
but it is not apparent that Holmes is doing the
signalling.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN

As Holmes continues opening and closing the parasol,
Gabrielle gets out of bed, comes up beside him. Holmes
finishes the message, shuts the parasol, draws it back
into the room. Then he looks out the window.


LAKEFRONT - FROM HOLMES' ANGLE - DAWN

The monks turn away from the hotel, and with von Tirpitz
in the lead, move off along the shore.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN

Holmes steps back from the window, faces Gabrielle.

                                             129.



             HOLMES
Well, it's up to the good monks now. You
can consider your part of the mission
accomplished, Fraulein Hoffmanstal.

             GABRIELLE
You're all wrong about me.   My name isn't
Hoffmanstal.

            HOLMES
It isn't?

             GABRIELLE
It's von Hoffmanstal.

             HOLMES
I stand corrected.

             GABRIELLE
       (glancing toward window)
I suppose once they're in the castle...
It must amuse you, Mr. Holmes, Trappists
walking into a trap.

             HOLMES
It's more amusing than that. Once in the
castle, they will encounter surprisingly
little resistance -- it will take but a
small bottle of chloroform to overcome
the guards.

             GABRIELLE
       (skeptically)
You mean you're going to let them have
the air-pump?

             HOLMES
Better than that. We're going to let
them have the submersible. They will
find it with its engines running, all set
to go. I assume they're all expert
sailors? And since there is a German
battleship cruising off the coast of
Scotland, I expect they'll try to sail it
out of the lock and rendezvous at sea.

             GABRIELLE
Did you say try to?

                                                      130.



                       HOLMES
          I would suggest you get your things
          together. Mycroft will be here to take
          you into custody.

He opens her suitcase, which is on the baggage rack at
the foot of the bed. Gabrielle watches him for a beat,
then crosses to the wardrobe, starts taking her clothes
out.

                       GABRIELLE
          I never had you fooled for a moment, did
          I? You knew right from the beginning --
          when the cabbie brought me to Baker
          Street.

                       HOLMES
          Let me see -- not quite that soon.

He stretches out on the bed.

                       GABRIELLE
          It's so funny. I asked for this
          assignment, you know. I was scheduled to
          go to Japan, but I couldn't resist the
          challenge of coming up against the best.
          I'm sorry I didn't give you a closer
          game.

                       HOLMES
          Close enough.

                       GABRIELLE
          You're just being kind.   I failed
          miserably.

                       HOLMES
          We all have occasional failures.
          Fortunately, Dr. Watson never writes
          about mine.

                                               DISSOLVE TO:


INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

Watson, back in his valet's outfit again, comes bounding
down the narrow stairs from the attic, races toward the
door of Holmes' room.

                                                       131.



                        WATSON
          Holmes!   Holmes!


INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Bright sunlight now floods the room.   Gabrielle, fully
dressed, is standing in front of the  mirror, putting on
her hat. Her packed bag has been set   out in the middle
of the room, and resting on it is the  parasol.

The door bursts open and Watson dashes in.

                        WATSON
          Holmes!

In his haste he trips over the bag, goes down. As he
picks himself up again, Gabrielle points toward the
balcony.


EXT. BALCONY - HOTEL - DAY

Holmes is leaning against the parapet, scanning the lake
through his telescope. Watson appears through the open
French window behind him.

                       WATSON
                 (excitedly)
          Holmes, I saw it again -- that thing --
          it came from the castle -- it's out there
          --


LOCH NESS - THROUGH TELESCOPE - DAY

A trial of bubbles is moving along the surface. Suddenly
there is a muffled explosion from below, and a geyser of
water shoots up into the air.


EXT. BALCONY - HOTEL - DAY

Holmes slowly lowers the telescope.

                       HOLMES
          It was out there. Now it's gone.

                        WATSON
          Gone?

                                                      132.



                        HOLMES
          Forever.   Look for yourself.


LOCH NESS - THROUGH TELESCOPE - DAY

There is a great turbulence in the water. Up to the
surface pops the bottle of christening champagne, with
rope and ribbons still attached. Then a copy of the
Bible pops up.


EXT. BALCONY - HOTEL - DAY

                       WATSON
          A bottle of champagne?... and a Bible?...

                       HOLMES
          That's all that's left of H.M.S. Jonah.

He steps through the window as a puzzled Watson lowers
the telescope.


INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Watson follows Holmes in from the balcony.

                       HOLMES
          It would seem that somebody carelessly
          loosened the bolts of the submersible.
          What a fitting end for Trappists -- now
          they are resting in eternal silence at
          the bottom of the lake.

                       WATSON
                 (to Gabrielle)
          Do you know what he's talking about?

Through the open doorway comes Mycroft.   In the corridor
behind him is one of his aides.

                       MYCROFT
          Fraulein von Hoffmanstal?

                       GABRIELLE
          Yes, Mr. Holmes. I'm all ready.

                                                      133.



                       MYCROFT
          If there's one thing I like about the
          Prussians, it's their punctuality.

                       GABRIELLE
          If there's one thing I dislike about the
          British, it's their climate. I
          understand your jails are quite damp --
          and your heating facilities totally
          inadequate.

                       MYCROFT
          They are. But you're not going to jail.
          You're going back to Germany.

                       GABRIELLE
          Germany?

                       MYCROFT
          You will be conducted to the Swiss-German
          border, and be exchanged for one of our
          agents -- a man named Ibbetson.

                       GABRIELLE
          Thank you.

                       MYCROFT
          Don't thank me. Thank my brother.      It
          was his idea.

Gabrielle looks at Holmes, but he avoids her eyes.

                       MYCROFT
                 (to Gabrielle)
          Frankly, I think we are making a very
          poor deal. You much better than most
          operatives working for British
          intelligence.
                 (turning to Holmes)
          Don't you agree, Sherlock?

                       HOLMES
                 (with a small but gallant bow
                  to Gabrielle)
          And better than some consulting
          detectives.

Mycroft signals to his aide, who comes in from the
corridor and picks up Gabrielle's bag.

                                                       134.



                       MYCROFT
                 (to Gabrielle)
          Shall we?

                       GABRIELLE
                 (reaching for parasol)
          I'll take that.
                 (to Holmes and Watson)
          Gentlemen.

She turns and walks out the door, Mycroft following.
Watson's bewilderment has now reached monumental
proportions.

                       WATSON
                 (folding his arms)
          All right, Holmes -- you don't have to
          explain anything to me, if you don't want
          to.

                       HOLMES
          I appreciate that, Watson.

                       WATSON
          After all, I'm only your official
          biographer --

                       HOLMES
          Anyway, I don't think she'd care to have
          this story spread all over Strand
          Magazine.

                       WATSON
          The public has a right to know these
          things. If she's a German spy, why
          should we concern ourselves about her
          feelings?

Holmes crosses to a small window overlooking the
courtyard of the hotel, opens it, looks out.


EXT. HOTEL - DAY

Mycroft's aide comes out of the hotel with Gabrielle's
suitcase, loads it into an open carriage waiting in front
of the entrance. Gabrielle emerges, carrying her parasol,
and accompanied by Mycroft. He helps her into the
carriage, gets in beside her.

                                                     135.


The aide joins the coachman, and the carriage drives off.
Gabrielle does not look back toward the hotel.


EXT. SMALL WINDOW - HOTEL - DAY

Holmes is framed in the open window, watching the
carriage. Watson comes up behind him.

                       WATSON
          If I promised not to write a word about
          it, would you enlighten me? As your
          friend -- as your valet --

                      HOLMES
          Quiet. I'm trying to read a personal
          message.

                       WATSON
          A message?


EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

The carriage is moving away from the hotel. Gabrielle
has her parasol over her shoulder, and it opens and
closes, opens and closes.


GABRIELLE - IN MOVING CARRIAGE - DAY

She continues to signal with the parasol, unnoticed by
Mycroft.


EXT. SMALL WINDOW - HOTEL - DAY

Watson is straining forward to see out the window.

                       WATSON
          What is she saying?

                       HOLMES
                 (slowly)
          Auf Wiedersehn.

                       WATSON
          Auf Weider---? The nerve!

                                                       136.




EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

The carriage disappears down an avenue of trees,
Gabrielle's parasol still flashing its message.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. BAKER STREET - DAY

There is snow on the ground, and drifts of it piled up
along the curbs. Traffic is light. Householders are
shovelling the snow off the sidewalks, and pedestrians
are hurrying along bundled up against the cold.


INT. LIVING ROOM - 221B BAKER STREET - DAY

Holmes, in his dressing gown, and Watson, in his smoking
jacket, are at the breakfast table. There is snow on the
window-sills, and a cozy fire is burning in the grate.
Watson is reading the morning paper. Holmes is sorting
through his mail.

                       HOLMES
                 (holding up envelope)
          H'mmm. A letter from the Diogenes Club.

                       WATSON
          Maybe Mycroft is putting you up for
          membership.

                       HOLMES
          If only to have the distinct pleasure of
          blackballing his brother.

He has slit open the envelope. Watson watches him
curiously as he reads the letter, but Holmes' face
remains expressionless. Slowly he puts down the letter,
rises, crosses to the window, stands there staring out
into the wintry street.

                       WATSON
          Aren't you going to finish your
          breakfast?

Holmes doesn't answer. Watson takes a lump of sugar out
of the bowl with a pair of tongs, drops it into his
coffee.

                                                        137.


Then glancing over his shoulder to make sure Holmes isn't
watching, he swivels the letter around with the tongs.
It is written on Diogenes Club stationery, and reads:

                                   9th December, 1888
          Dear Sherlock,
            My sources in Tokyo inform me that Ilse
          von Hoffmanstal was arrested last week by
          the Japanese counter-intelligence service
          for spying on naval installations in
          Yokohama harbour. After a secret trial,
          she was summarily executed by a firing
          squad.

            It might interest you to know that

The page ends at this point. Watson turns the sheet of
paper over with the tongs. The letter continues on the
other side.

          she had been living in Japan these past
          few months under the name of Mrs.
          Ashdown.

                       Sincerely,

                       Mycroft

Watson looks toward Holmes, who is still standing with
his back to the room, gets up from the table.

                       WATSON
          Holmes -- I'm terribly sorry about this.

                       HOLMES
                 (quietly, without turning)
          Where is it, Watson?

                       WATSON
                 (after a beat)
          In the files. May to July, 1885.

Holmes turns to the bookshelves above the desk.   From a
row of similar volumes, he slides out the three  files
marked MAY, JUNE, and JULY 1885. Actually, it's   the
medical bag, standing on end, with the spines of  three
volumes pasted on the bottom.

                       HOLMES
          You're getting better.

                                                      138.



He sets the bag down on the desk, opens it, takes out a
bottle of cocaine. Watson watches him with compassion as
he crosses to his bedroom with his cocaine, goes in,
shuts the door.

Footsteps are heard hurrying up the stairs, and after a
moment there is a knock on the door. Watson approaches
the door, opens it to reveal INSPECTOR LESTRADE -- a
short, nervous man whose features are sharper than his
mind. He is wearing an overcoat, his bowler is in his
hands, and his fingers are drumming on the crown.

                       LESTRADE
          Good morning, Watson.
                 (stepping in)
          Just happened to be in the neighborhood,
          and I thought --

                       WATSON
          What is it this time, Inspector Lestrade?

                       LESTRADE
          We've had three rather nasty murders in
          Whitechapel. All ladies of  easy virtue.
          You may read something about it -- the
          newspapers are referring to the killer as
          Jack the Ripper.

                       WATSON
          Yes, I think I have.

                       LESTRADE
          Some of us at Scotland Yard were
          wondering if perhaps Mr. Holmes would be
          willing to --

                       WATSON
                 (a glance toward the bedroom)
          I'm sorry, Lestrade. But at the moment,
          Holmes is working on another problem.

                       LESTRADE
                 (trying to hide his
                  disappointment)
          Oh... Well, I just thought it was the
          kind of case that might interest him. I
          dare say we can solve it without his
          help.

                                                     139.



                       WATSON
          Oh, I'm sure you will.

From Holmes' bedroom comes the sound of a melancholy tune
being played on the violin. Watson starts to ease
Lestrade out of the door.

                       WATSON
          Good day, Lestrade.

He shuts the door after him, listens to the sound of the
violin for a moment. Then he crosses to the wicker
chair, seats himself. He takes some sheets of paper out
of the rack and places them on the writing arm, dips his
pen in the inkwell, starts to write.

The violin music continues OVER SCENE, infinitely
romantic, infinitely sad.

                                                FADE OUT.


                         THE END

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

          SUPER: April 27, 1973
          All is quiet outside this suburban school on a sunny
          Friday afternoon. Cars idle in the driveway awaiting
          the three o'clock onslaught of liberated children.
          Two faded yellow buses stand ready.

          The lull is shattered by the CLANGING of the final BELL.
          A swarm of children pours out the door and down the
          broad front steps, scattering across the lawn toward
          the cars and the buses.

          Moving slowly through the crowd, ROBIN and ALEX HAMMOND,
          nine-year-old identical twins, appear at the doorway..
          Attractive, dark-haired children, they seem more sub-
          dued than the others. As they walk quietly down the
          stairs, Robin lags behind, staring at a boy teasing a
          girl nearby. He is NICK MCBRIDE, eleven years old,
          two grades ahead of Robin and the most popular boy in
          school. The pretty girl laughing at his antics is KIM
          HAMMOND, also eleven, Robin's older sister.

                         ALEX
          C'mon, Robin.

                         ROBIN

                         (STUTTERING BADLY)
          W-w-where's D-d-daddy?

                         ALEX
          He's got a meeting at the high
          school. We're supposed to walk
          home with Kim...
          (sees Robin watching
          the young couple)
          She's too busy. Let's go
          by ourselves.

                         ROBIN
          N-n-n-no, Alex. Let's w-w-wait.

                         ALEX
          Why?
          Robin is staring at Nick. Alex looks, understands.
          He's angry.

                         ALEX

                         (CONTINUING)
          You're crazy, I'm not waiting.

          He strides away. Robin's eyes remain on Nick and Kim.
          Nick says something to Kurt. She shakes her head and
          pains toward Robin. Robin quickly turns away as they
          look at her.. When she glances back, Ki_m is walking
          towards her and Nick is bicycling away.

                         KIM
          Okay, let's go.
          The sisters start to walk across the lawn.

                         ROBIN
          Y-you 1-1-like him?

                         KIM
          Who?

                         ROBIN

                         (SMILES SHYLY)
          Y-you know.

                         KIM
          Nick? Oh, he's all right, I guess.
          They walk on in silence with Robin stealing glances at
          her big sister.

                         ROBIN

                         (FINALLY)
          Are y-y-you g-gonna m-in-marry him?

                         KIM
          Robin?
          Robin smiles and takes Kim's hand. They walk along the
          road, kicking rocks and swinging their bookbags. Sud-
          denly Kim halts.

                         KIM

                         (CONTINUING)
          Oh, damn!
          Robin looks up in surprise.

                         KIM

                         (CONTINUING)
          Debbie was gonna lend me her new
          record. Look, you go on home
          by yourself. Tell Mom I'll be
          a little late.
          Before Robin can reply, Kim is hurrying away.

          Robin watches her go, then moves off alone, breaking
          into a skip and playing imaginary hopscotch.
          As she turns off the main road into a side street,
          Robin passes a construction site. The empty skeleton
          of a half-finished apartment building looms up above
          the dark shade trees. Hearing VOICES, Robin stops to
          investigate.

                         ROBIN

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Alex?
          The VOICES continue. Robin moves closer, peering
          through the tall bushes surrounding the lot. She
          sees Nick playing in.the framework with three of his
          classmates. Robin recognizes JUDE CUNNINGHAM, and
          KELLY LYNCH as Kim's two best friends. The fourth
          child, WENDY RICHARDS, is a dark-haired girl, domin-
          eering and loud. As Robin watches, Wendy jumps
          up onto the floor of the building.

                         WENDY
          I want to play 'Murder.' Who's
          the killer?

                         NICK
          You, Wendy!

                         JUDE

                         (GIGGLING)
          you, Nick.

                         KELLY
          Yes, Nick!

                         WENDY

                         (LAUGHING)
          You'll never catch me. Hide your
          eyes, killer!
          As Nick turns his back, hiding his eyes against an ex-
          posed beam, the children scatter through the structure.
          Robin watches with mounting excitement as Nick finishes
          counting, and whirls around.

                         NICK
          The killer is coming for you!
          He moves into the building, chanting "Kill, kill.," in a
          low monotone. As he disappears from view, Robin cau-
          tiously edges out of the bushes and moves up to the
          building.

          NICK (O.S.
          The killer strikes!

          Robin hears Jude's SQUEAL of LAUGHTER. Nick has caught
          her. Immediately Jude's VOICE TAKES UP the "kill"
          chant in unison with Nick.

          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY 2

          Robin climbs up onto the floor and peers into the dark,
          gloomy structure. Suddenly, she hears a SHRIEK. Ter-
          rified, she backs against a wall. LAUGHTER FOLLOWS im-
          mediately and Robin hears Kelly's VOICE TAKING UP the
          chant. As the three "killers" move through the vast
          structure searching for Wendy, "KILL, KILT" ECHOES off
          the walls and hardwood floors.
          Robin cautiously steps out of the doorway into the im-
          mense unfinished lobby. Ominous shadows slash across
          the floor as the excited girl listens to the relentless
          CHANTING of the children.
          Robin pushes on a makeshift wooden door. It slips off
          its temporary hinges, crashing down to the floor. The
          NOISE is like a rifle shot; suddenly, there is ABSOLUTE
          SILENCE in the structure.
          Petrified, Robin crouches behind a wall, waiting. The
          CHANTING quickly RESUMES and she breathes a long sigh
          of relief.
          Robin moves through a dark corridor, hugging the walls.
          Flushed with excitement, she imagines herself a "killer"
          searching for Wendy. As she moves past an empty room,
          she hears a SOFT GIGGLE. Robin stops and listens care-
          fully. Once again she hears the GIGGLE, LOUDER this
          time, coming from nearby.
          Stepping to a doorway, she leans around the corner and
          peers inside. In the darkness she can see nothing.
          Gathering her courage, she quietly slips into the room.
          The room appears empty but a closet door is slightly
          ajar. As Robin approaches, she hears a FAINT GASP from
          behind her. Whirling around, she sees Wendy crouched
          behind a cardboard box in the corner.

                         WENDY

                         (HISSING)
          You better not tell!
          Before Robin can react, she hears a THUD from above.
          Looking up, she sees Nick's head appear through an
          opening in the ceiling. Seeing Robin, then Wendy
          standing in the corner, he howls in triumph.

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Here, killers, here!
          Nick's head disappears from the opening and Robin hears
          the POUNDING of RUNNING FEET.

                         WENDY

                         (MALICIOUSLY)
          Now you've done it, you idiot!
          The CHANTING GROWS LOUDER as the "killers" rush towards
          the room. Trapped, Wendy looks frantically for an es-
          cape but finds nothing. Turning around suddenly, she
          grins at Robin, a cruel, hard expression on her face.

                         WENDY

                         (CONTINUING; SLOWLY)
          Kill, kill, kill...
          Picking up the chant, Wendy begins to advance on Robin.
          Terrified, Robin turns and rushes out of the room,
          bowling over Nick in the doorway. Delighted that the
          game is continuing with a new victim, he follows Wendy
          in pursuit of Robin.
          Robin flees down the long, dark corridor, "KILL, KILL
          ECHOING in her wake. As she rounds a corner, Jude ap-
          pears, looming up in front of her. Robin screams and
          sprints in the opposite direction. Kelly leaps out of
          a doorway and grabs for her, but Robin, swinging out
          blindly, escapes the "killer."

          INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY 3

          Darting into the large room, Robin collapses against a
          wall, gasping for breath. As her eyes adjusts to the
          darkness, she spies a rickety ladder extending through
          a hole in the floor to the basement below. Stacked up-
          right near the opening are several sheets of window
          glass. Before Robin can make a move towards the lad-
          der, she hears a horrible SCREECH and Wendy appears in
          the doorway, a vicious look on her face.

                         WENDY
          Killers, here!
          Wendy advances. Terrified, Robin begins to back away.

                         ROBIN
          N-n-n-no!

                         CONTINUED:
          Nick, Jude and Kelly appear in the doorway, chanting
          "Kill, kill." Moving quickly, Robin grabs the ladder
          and starts down into the basement, careful not to knock
          over the sheets of glass stacked near the opening.
          Peering into the pitch-black basement, Robin hesitates.
          But as Wendy and her fellow "killers" close in on her,
          Robin continues down the ladder. Wendy rushes up and
          grabs the ladder.

                         ROBIN

                         (CONTINUING)
          P-p-please!
          Wendy grins and shakes the ladder. The chanting is
          deafening. Robin hugs the wooden slats. Wendy shakes
          even harder. Robin screams. Nick moves around Wendy
          to get a better look. He accidentally bumps the glass
          stacked next to the opening. The sudden movement is
          just enough to dislodge a razor-sharp pane of glass and
          send it hurtling down directly at Robin.
          The girl's last scream catches in her throat as the
          glass slices through her neck. She is instantly
          decapitated.
          Horrified, Wendy watches the glass and the body crash
          to the concrete basement floor. Kelly screams. Jude
          sobs loudly. Nick can only stare in shock. Finally,
          he manages to speak.

                         NICK

                         (WHISPERING HOARSELY)
          We gotta get somebody quick!
          Nick starts to go. Wendy instantly whirls, grabs his
          arm.

                         WENDY
          Are you crazy? They'll put us in
          jail!
          Confused, Nick cannot reply. The other girls grow
          silent.

                         WENDY

                         (CONTINUING)
          If we tell anyone, they'll say
          it's our fault. Who'd believe it
          was an accident?
          Nick starts to protest.

                         WENDY

          an accident. 1,10 one but us will

          She looks at each of them. They are still too numb to
          respond.

          Kelly looks from Wendy to the mangled body and begins
          to whimper.

                         WENDY

                         (CONTINUING; STERNLY)

          Wendy turns to Nick. At first he appears defiant, ready
          to object, but he wilts under her withering gaze.

          With a final glance down at Robin's mutiliated body,
          Wendy quickly ushers her shocked friends out of the
          room.
          As their FOOTSTEPS ECHO away across the hardwood floor,
          there is a terrible silence. Then, starting very
          quietly, more FOOTSTEPS are HEARD, this time a single
          person approaching the ladder from above. The FOOT-
          STEPS STOP and a deep, black shadow falls across the
          ladder; HEAVY BREATHING punctuates the oppressive
          quiet, growing louder and more anguished.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. STORAGE ROOM - DUSK

          We slowly TILT UP TO the tortured features of RAYMOND
          HAMMOND, Robin's father. A handsome, dark-haired man
          in his late thirties, he teaches history at George
          Winston High School.
          Wracked with grief, he stands near the opening in the
          floor and watches as two Paramedics bring up the body
          of his daughter from the dark basement.
          A young Policeman standing nearby raises the white
          sheet covering Robin's remains. Hammond steps up
          and gazes at his daughter's decapitated body. A
          look of absolute horror and revulsion freezes
          on his face; what he sees he will never forget.
          Paralyzed, Hammond barely hears the CAR PULLING UP
          in front of the construction site. He turns and
          looks out the window.

          EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DUSK 5

          A Police Officer is getting out of his car. Walking
          around to the passenger side, he opens the door
          for an attractive blonde woman in her mid-thirties.
          VIVIAN HANMOND, Robin's mother, appears pale and
          haggard as she steps out of the car. Kim and Alex
          slowly climb out of the back, With the Police Officer
          escorting her, Vivian and her children move toward
          the skeleton of a building.
          Catching sight of her husband framed in a lower window,
          Vivian suddenly breaks. away from the Police Officer and
          runs inside the building.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. STORAGE ROOM - DUSK

          Hammond moves quickly to the door, grabbing his
          hysterical wife as she bursts into the room.

                         HA:MMIOND
          No!

                         VIVIAN

                         (SOBBING WILDLY)
          Where is she? Where is Robin?
          Seeing the covered figure lying on a stretcher, Vivian
          moans in anguish.
          Struggling furiously, she strains to break her hus-
          band's hold, but he is too powerful.. They are both
          in tears, shaking with grief, when Kim and Alex step
          into the doorway.

                         KIM

                         WHISPERING)
          Daddy?

                         HAMMOND
          (angrily,

                         TO VIVIAN)
          Why did you bring them here?
          Vivian collapses, burying her head in his shoulder
          and sobbing furiously, but Hammond pushes her out of
          the room.

                         (CONTINUING)
          Kim! Alex! Stay out in the
          hallway!
          Kim stumbles out into the corridor and begins to
          cry softly. Alex takes his mother's hand and tries
          comfort her.
          The Paramedics pick up the stretcher and maneuver it
          out of the room. As they pass through the doorway into
          the corridor, a corner of the sheet slips off Robin's
          corpse. Before a Paramedic can replace it, the de-
          capitated torso is briefly glimpsed by the family.
          Alex is shocked. Kim doesn't appear to realize what
          she sees. But Vivian's horror wells up in her
          throat, bursting out in a deranged scream.

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Another SCREAM, as throbbing DISCO MUSIC pulsates from
          a large portable RADIO sitting on a dresser.

          SUPER: APRIL 27, 1980.
          A young woman with long, golden brown hair and a trim
          figure is slipping into a pair of tight jeans. Pull-
          ing on a halter top, she sways to the MUSIC.

          Kim! Turn that music down. You're
          driving me crazy!
          Turning around at the SOUND of her mother's VOICE, Kim
          Hammond reaches for the volume control Now eighteen,
          she is a strikingly beautiful girl with an open,
          innocent quality.

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Okay, Mom!
          Kim quickly finishes dressing, whirling around the room
          to the pounding disco rhythm. Giving her hair a few
          final strokes with a brush, she gazes at a photograph
          of a young man stuck in her mirror. On the picture
          is written: "To Kim, the best on the floor... dancing,
          that is! Love, Nick."
          Kim glances at another photograph stuck in her mirror.
          This one shows her sister, Robin, taken a few days be-
          fore the accident. Her sadness passes as quickly as it
          came. Gathering her textbooks, she switches OFF the
          RADIO and exits.

          8 INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Raymond and Vivian Hammond are just finishing break-
          fast. The years have favored him; except for a touch
          of gray around the temples and a few extra pounds, he
          looks much the same way as we remember him. Vivian,
          however, wears the strain of the past seven years
          in her gaunt, drawn features and high-strung manner.
          Thumbing through his morning newspaper, Hammond steals
          quick glances at his wife. She does not look up at
          him, but stares at the table, toying with her spoon.

          I'll tell you, Vi, I'm thinking
          of starting up an armed robbery
          course at the high school..
          I've got a feeling it'd be
          popular...
          He smiles at his joke, looks at her. She doesn't seem
          to have heard him.

          Kim bursts into the kitchen, interrupting her father
          with a kiss on the head.

                         KIM

          meal. You're getting awfully
          thin.
          Kim and her father exchange glances. He shrugs

          Vivian stumbles to her feet and rushes out of the kitch-
          en before he can finish. With a glance at Kim, Hammond
          hurries after his wife. Going out through the swinging
          door, he bumps into a young man just entering.

          Hammond exits. Alex, now sixteen, a tall, slender
          boy, casts a knowing look at Kim. Kim nods. Alex.
          shakes his head, then begins to rummage through the
          Pantry, pulling out a Hostess viTikie. ?lopping
          down at the table, he flips open his electronics book
          and begins to read. Munching on his Twinkie, he
          swipes sips from Kim's glass of milk.

                         KIM
          Have you got a date for tonight?

          9 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Hammond and Vivian are standing by the fireplace. His
          hand is on her shoulder. She faces the mantel, her
          back to him. On the mantel is a small shrine to the
          memory oftheir dead daughter; a framed photograph,
          fresh roses, two candles and a lock of her hair in a
          glass case.

                         HAMMOND
          Trust me.
          Vivian does not move. Finally, after a long pause,
          she turns toward her husband. Her eyes filled with
          tears, she nods.

          10 INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY 10

          Hammond is driving. Vivian stares blankly out the win-
          dow at the grimy city streets. Sitting in the back,
          Kim and Alex exchange uncertain glances. A tense si-
          lence pervades.

          11 EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 11

          The Hammonds' car pulls up in front of a towering
          modern building.

          Hammond cuts off the engine and turns to Kim and Alex.

          I'll just be a minute...
          Vivian is already reaching for the door handle,

          13 EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 13

          Alex jumps out of the car and opens the door for his
          mother. Taking her arm, he helps her out. Kim leans
          over in the back seat.

                         KIM
          See you later,'Mom.
          Vivian gives her a thin smile. Hammond takes her arm
          and leads her into the imposing building.

          Hammond and Vivian cross the room. Though she offers
          no resistance, it appears he is pulling her along.
          They hurry into an elevator after an elderly CLEANING
          WOMAN carrying a mop and a bucket.

          15 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 15

          They stand in silence. The Cleaning Woman puffs on a
          cigarette, blithely ignoring the NO SMOKING sign posted
          on the wall. Vivian nervously reaches into her purse
          and removes a bottle of Valium. Quickly popping two
          pills into her mouth, she swallows with difficulty and
          snaps her purse shut. Hammond says nothing.
          Just as the elevator doors slide open, the Cleaning Wo-
          man touches Vivian on the shoulder, causing her to jump
          in fright.

                         CLEANING WOMAN
          Could I have one of those? My
          nerves are shot this morning.
          With a terrified glance back at the woman, Vivian
          rushes out of the elevator. Hammond follows.

          16 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 16

          Hammond and Vivian move down the long, empty hallway.
          As they round a corner, a figure is visible unlocking
          a door.

          He's a. portly man in his fifties, trying to disguise
          his girth with careful tailoring.

          17 INT. OFFICE - DAY 17

          Fairchild bustles about the reception area, turning on
          lights, checking his messages and appointment calendar.
          Fairchild is obsessively neat, the office reflects him.

                         HAIIOND
          We appreciate your seeing... us.
          I know how busy you must be.
          Vivian is staring at a painting of a young girl playing
          with a kitten. Catching Fairchild's eye, Hammond nods
          toward the outer door. Vivian does not notice the
          gesture.

          Fairchild nods in return. Stepping over to his inner
          office, he opens the door.

          Hammond moves over to his wife. Taking her by the
          shoulders, he kisses her lightly on the forehead.

                         HAMMOND
          I won't forget.
          Vivian looks from Hammond to Fairchild, who smiles.
          She enters the office, leaving the door open. Hammond
          shakes hands with Fairchild, and for Vivian's benefit
          adds...
          HAï¿½I`i IOND

                         (CONTINUING)
          Thank you, Doctor.
          Hammond exits.

          18 , INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 18

          Hammond leans against the wall outside Fairchild's of-
          fice. He glances at his watch. The door opens and
          Fairchild steps out, holding a container. Hammond
          walks with him down the corridor towards the water
          fountain.

          H.ANMOND
          She's at it again.

                         FAIRCHILD

                         (NODS)
          Today's the date?

                         HAIM BOND
          Seven years ago today Robin was
          killed.
          Fairchild looks up from filling his container with
          water.

                         (CONTINUING; MUSING)
          This would have been her first prom.

                         FAIRCHILD
          Pardon?

                         HAKMOND
          Tonight's the Junior-Senior Prom
          at our high school. Robin would
          have been sixteen, She and Alex.

                         FAIRCHILD
          The twins... How is Alex?

                         HAIIOND
          Fine. I just thank God he was too
          young to really understand what
          happened to his sister.

                         FAIRCHILD
          And your older daughter?

                         HANMOND

                         (SMILES)
          Kimmy's my princess. Sometimes she'll
          get depressed for a while... but it
          never lasts long. Young people seem
          so much more... resilient.
          They walk back to the office.

                         FAIRCHILD
          (looking up at Hammond)
          And yourself? No scars?

                         HATIOND
          (after a pause)
          I've learned to live them..
          Vivian seems worse this time.

                         FAIRCHILD

                         (NODS)
          The persistence of Vivian's trauma.
          I wonder if there isn't something
          more serious at work here?

                         HAMOND
          Something more serious than her
          daughter's death?

          19 INT. OFFICE - DAY 19

          Vivian fidgets in her chair. She seems very small and
          vulnerable in the large, somber office.

          20 INT. CAR (MOVING) DAY 20

          Alex is seated opposite his father in the front seat.
          Kim is in back. Easy listening MUSIC PLAYS softly on
          the car RADIO. Alex fiddles with the tuning dial,
          searching for music more to his tastes. Lost in
          thought, Hammond does not see the young girl skipping
          through the pedestrian crossing.

                         KIM

                         (SCREAMS)
          Daddy!
          Hammond slams on the brakes, throwing Alex against
          the dashboard.

          21 EXT. STREET - DAY 21

          The CAR SCREECHES to a halt inches away from the terri-
          fied child who stands frozen in the middle of the
          crossing. After a moment, realizing she is safe, the
          girl giggles nervously and skips away.

          22 INT. CAR - DAY 22

          Hammond lets out a sigh and turns to his children.

                         HAMMOND
          You all right?
          They both nod. Alex massages his wrist. Hammond
          slips the car into gear and cautiously continues
          driving.

                         KIM
          You're worried about Mom?

                         HALMOND
          I was...
          He is interrupted by DISCO MUSIC ON the RADIO. Play-
          ing with the tuning dial, Alex quickly tries to pass
          over the music.

                         KIM
          Hey, keep that!
          Alex groans but does as she asks.

                         ALEX
          Disco sucks!

                         (DRYLY)
          That's much better.
          The car pulls into the Winston High School parking lot.
          They pile out.

          23 EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 23

           Hammond, Kim and Alex walk through the empty lot
           towards the school. Suddenly, we HEAR a loud GRATING
          SOUND coming from nearby. The sudden noise startles
          Kim and she huddles against her father.
          A seedy little middle-aged man with a stubble of gray
          beard appears from behind a row of bushes, brandishing
          a pair of electric hedge clippers.

                         HANMMMOND
          Good morning, Mr. Sykes.
          SANFORD SYKES, the newly-hired custodian, bares his
          yellow teeth in a crooked grin and waves the whirring
          blades in salute. Kim shudders and stays close to
          her father as they walk on.

                         KIM
          He's creepy.

                         ALEX
          I heard he's wacko.

                         HAIIOND
          The man is not... wacko.

                         KIM
          Kelly says he's a pervert, spying
          on the girls undressing in the
          locker room.

                         HAIIOND
          Sykes may have some problems, but
          he's no Peeping Tom. He's been
          thoroughly checked out.

                         (CONTINUING)
          You're early today. Plenty of
          time to study with no one to
          bother you.
          Kim reaches up.and kisses her father on the cheek.
          Pulling out a fashion magazine, she rushes off, call-
          ing back over her shoulder.

                         KIM
          I'.ve got to decide on my hair
          style for tonight.

          Wonderful. Alex?

                         ALEX
          I'm building an atomic bomb in
          shop.
          Smiling, he moves inside. Hammond shakes his head
          and hurries off.

          24 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 24

          Hammond moves through the empty hallway, stopping at
          a door which reads: PRINCIPAL: RAYMOND HAMMOND. He
          is fumbling for his key when he sees through the
          frosted glass a figure moving around in his office.
          Reaching for the doorknob, he very quietly opens the
          door.

          25 INT. OFFICE DAY 25

          As the door slowly swings open, Hammond sees the outer
          office covered with pieces of paper; sheets are
          scattered across desks and chairs and over most of
          the floor. Stepping inside, Hammond spies a WOMAN
          bending over, frantically picking up paper from the
          floor.
          He slams the door. At the sudden SOUND, the startled
          Woman whirls around, still squatting, and falls on her
          rear.

                         HAMMIOND
          Who are you?

          Flustered, the attractive young Woman hastily gets to
          her feet and straightens her skirt.

          Hammond tosses his briefcase onto the desk and drops
          into his chair. He stares at the telephone for a long
          moment, drumming his finger on the desk.

                         CUT TO:

          27 INT. BEDROOM - DAY 27

          A pink TELEPHONE RINGS. The plush bedroom is empty;
          suddenly Wendy Richards rushes in. Now eighteen, Wendy
          is a raven-haired beauty with a full figure, accentua-
          ted by a low-cut black blouse and tight designer jeans.
          Tossing her books onto the bed, she eagerly grabs the
          receiver.

                         WENDY

                         (BREATHLESSLY)
          Nick?
          A long pause, followed by HEAVY BREATHING. Wendy is
          about to respond when the inhuman VOICE speaks in an
          eerie, androgynous stutter.

                         TELEPHONE VOICE
          W-Wendy? T-t-tonight it's m-m-my
          t-turn!
          Wendy's shock quickly turns to anger.

                         WENDY
          Screw you, Lou!
          Wendy slams the receiver into its cradle. Grabbing her
          books, she storms out of her bedroom.

          28 INT. FRONT HALL - DAY 28

          Wendy hurries do-in the ornate staircase.
          Waiting at the bottom holding the girl's sweater is
          MAUDE, the Richards' elderly housekeeper.

                         MAUDE
          You be home for dinner, Wendy?
          Wendy angrily grabs her sweater from the woman.

                         WENDY
          How the hell do I know?
          She exits.

          29 EXT. RICHARD'S HOUSE - DAY 29

          The expansive residence sits back off the road in this
          upper-middle-class suburb. Wendy climbs into her
          white Mustang and starts the engine. TIRES SQUEALING,
          she ROARS out of the driveway with the RADIO BLASTING.

          30 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 30

          Kelly Lynch is just finishing breakfast when the
          TELEPHONE RINGS. The petite blonde eighteen-year-old
          stuffs a last bite of toast into her mouth and picks
          up the receiver.

                         KELLY

                         (MUMBLING )
          Hullo?
          A pause, then HEAVY BREATHING. Kelly's eyes grow wide
          as the dreadful voice speaks.

                         TELEPHONE VOICE
          K-K-Kelly? T-tonight it's m-m-ï¿½IZ
          Horrified, Kelly drops the phone. The DOORBELL RINGS.
          Frightened, she gasps, hugging the wall. The DOORBELL
          RINGS again. Very slowly she moves out of the kitchen.

          31 INT. HALL - DAY 31

          Kelly cautiously approaches the front door. Peering
          through a crack in the drapes, she sees a dark figure
          huddled near the door. With the latch secured, she
          takes a deep breath and opens the door.

                         KELLY
          Yes?

          DREW (O.S.)
          Christ, Kelly, c'mon! We're late!
          Relief floods across her face. Kelly quickly unfastens
          the latch.

                         KELLY
          Oh, Drew, thank God!
          She throws herself into the arms of the pleasantly sur-
          prised DREW SHINNICK, a muscular blond athlete.

                         DREW
          (holding her tightly)
          I'm glad to see you, too.

          should try that!
          She breaks from his grasp.

                         KELLY
          'm serious!
          Drew makes a grab for her but she avoids him, hurries
          inside. He sighs and leans against the doorjamb to
          wait.

                         DREW
          So am I.,.

          32 INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY 32

          Drew is driving, his-arm around Kelly. She still
          appears shaken by the telephone call. The RADIO is ON.
          His right hand slowly descends towards her breast.
          She swats it away. The hand moves to her back, slid-
          ing down. She leans back, pinning his arm against the
          seat.
          The car stops at a light and Drew is instantly on Kelly,
          biting her neck and kissing her hard on the mouth. She
          pushes him back.

                         KELLY

                         (ANGRY)
          I thought we were late.

          We'll get there... eventually.

                         KELLY
          Really?
          Drew HONKS the HORN at another driver.

                         DREW
          Hell, you should be glad. A lot
          of girls would love to have
          someone steady like me.
          His irrepressible right hand starts up her leg.

                         KELLY

                         (MOCK-SWEETLY)
          Steady? You mean persistent,
          don't you, darling?
          Grabbing his hand, she holds it firmly in her lap,
          which doesn't bother Drew at all.

          33 INT. HALL - DAY

          Jude Cunningham is leaving her house when the TELE-
          PHONE RINGS. The chubby, brown-haired girl rushes
          back into the hallway.
          A plump, middle-aged woman hurries out of the kitchen,
          wiping her hands on an apron. MRS. CUNNINGHAM
          eagerly watches her daughter snap up the receiver.
          The pause, the HEAVY BREATHING and the strange,
          terrifying voice.

                         TELEPHONE VOICE
          J-Jude? T-t-tonight it's my-my
          t-t-turn!
          A disappointed Jude slowly replaces the receiver. Mrs.
          Cunningham looks on sympathetically.
          Still no date?

                         JUDE
          (shakes her head)
          Getting closer, though.

                         (SMILES)
          An obscene call... and not very
          obscene at that!
          Mrs. Cunningham starts to say something.

                         JUDE

                         (CONTINUING)
          Sorry, Mom, gotta run.
          Giving her mother a quick peck on the cheek, Jude
          exits.

          34 EXT. CUNNINGHAM'S HOUSE - DAY

          The small house appears almost identical to the other
          dwellings in this lower-middle-class neighborhood. Jude
          pulls an apple from her large purse, munching while
          she walks to the bus stop.
          A gaudily-painted van pulls up alongside her. The win-
          dow slowly rolls down and a young curly-haired GUY
          wearing glasses sticks out his head.

                         GUY
          Hey, beautiful, need a lift?
          Jude continues walking, the van moving slowly alongside
          her.

                         JUDE
          No thanks.

                         GUY
          C'mon, I won't bite.
          Jude chomps down hard on her apple.

                         JUDE
          So who are you?
          TheGuy leans further out the window.

                         GUY
          Seymour Stone but..
          He's cut short as the van bounces up onto the sidewalk.
          Jude shrieks. The flustered boy steers the van quickly
          back onto the road.

          Jude laughs, almost choking on her apple.

                         JUDE
          I can see why... How old are you,
          Slick?

                         GUY (SLICK)
          Old enough...

                         JUDE
          I've heard about guys like you...
          running over girls on the sidewalk...

                         SLICK
          Just some girls... If they're good
          lookin' I give 'em a ride.

                         JUDE

                         (SMILING)
          Can you stop that thing?
          Slick jams on the brakes. The van jerks to a halt.
          He opens the passenger door.

                         JUDE

                         (CONTINUING)

          She climbs inside.

          35 INT. VAN (MOVING- DAY 35

          The interior is decked out in plush red carpet with a
          bed in back, a stereo cassette deck, and a small fridge.
          MUSIC is PLAYING. Jude looks around.

                         JUDE
          Looks like a cheap motel.

                         SLICK
          Cheap?... that's a two hundred
          dollar waterbed there...
          Jude turns around for a look.

                         JUDE
          You think this is the time to study?
          She grabs the book, gives it to him. He places it on
          the fold-down table between them, flips it open. The
          inside is hollowed out into a container. It contains
          nearly a hundred neatly rolled joints.

                         SLICK
          Straight to Winston High?

          36 EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT DAY

          The van weaves through the parked cars, passing up
          several vacant spots. It finally SCREECHES to a halt
          at the far end of the lot near some high bluffs over-
          looking a lake.

          37 INT. VAN

          The air is thick with smoke.

          A tall rugged-looking man wearing a police uniform
          stands in ,the center of the room checking over his
          revolver. He's DARRYL McBRIDE, forty-eight years old
          and a veteran Sergeant on the Police Force. Satisfied
          with the condition of the gun, he jams it back into its
          holster, turns, calls out.

          A handsome dark-haired boy of eighteen emerges from a
          back room. He's Nick McBride. His father pulls open
          the front door.

                         MCBRIDE

                         (CONTINUING)

                         NICK
          Right, I know...
          McBride steps out into the hallway. Nick grabs his
          books and follows. The TELEPHONE RINGS. Nick hesi-
          tates. Shaking his head he exits, shutting the door.

          39 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

          The TELEPHONE keeps RINGING. McBride looks at his son.

          Three months ago... you can't tell
          Wendy anything she doesn't want to

          40 INT. SCHOOL SHOP - DAY 40

          Alex is alone in the large room. ROCK MUSIC BOOMS out
          of two huge SPEAKERS suspended from the ceiling. Alex
          sits behind a console, flipping switches and turning
          dials, electronically distorting the music.
          A wall TELEPHONE RINGS.. Caught up in his own manufac-
          tured sounds, Alex ignores it. After several more
          RINGS, he reluctantly leaves the console and answers
          the phone.

                         ALEX
          Hello... what?...
          He listens, expressionless, then hangs up. He flips
          a switch on the console and the MUSIC STOPS. He sits
          there a moment, thinking. Then he turns out the lights
          and exits.

          41 INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY 41

          Kim walks down the long deserted corridor. She hears
          FOOTSTEPS. She turns. No one. Shaking her head, she
          continues walking.
          The FOOTSTEPS return, louder. Kim begins to hurry.
          She rounds a corner and slips against the wall, waiting.
          Silence. With a deep breath, she moves on to her
          locker.
          Kim quickly twists the dial on the combination lock and
          yanks open the door. Grabbing several books she slams
          the door shut.
          A mop HANDLE CRASHES into the locker, missing her head
          by inches. The SHARP REPORT echoes down the corridor.
          Terrified, Kim jumps back, spins around. Sykes is
          standing there.

                         SYKES
          S-s-sorry, Missy. You hurt?
          Her heart pounding wildly, Kim rushes into the gym.
          Sykes picks up his mop.

          Kim runs into the huge deserted gym, glancing frantical-
          ly over her shoulder. Her FOOTSTEPS CLATTER across the
          hardwood floor. She stops, waits to recover her breath.
          The room glows tgith a crystalline light sparkling off
          the silver decorations put up for the Prom. Stretched
          across the bleachers is a banner reading: "DISCO

          MADNESS."
          Gazing around, Kim feels the excitement of anticipation.
          Imagining herself in Nick's arms, she begins to dance,
          whirling through the gym to the music in her head.
          Suddenly, someone is clapping, slowly.

          WENDY (O.S.)
          Bravo...
          Kim stops abruptly. Standing onstage, watching her, is
          Wendy.

          it, Hammond... As far as anything
          else... Nick is mine...

                         KIM
          You really ought to tell him that.

                         WENDY
          I'm telling you, okay? Stay away
          from Nick!

                         KIM
          You and Nick haven't been together
          in ages.

          It's not who you go with, honey...
          it's who takes you home.

                         KIM
          I'll try and remember that.

          43 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 43

          The corridor is packed with students -- flirting,
          gossiping, fighting, a few even studying. We PICK UP
          Kim and VICKI CANTRELL, eighteen, moving down the crowd-
          ed hallway through the various conversations.

                         KIM

          Kim. and Vicki excitedly hug Jude. A big, bushy-haired
          youth with a stubble of beard strolls by, smirking when
          he sees the girls embracing. LOU PERANO, a twenty-year-
          old high school junior, stops and stares.

                         LOU
          I knew there was some reason Kim

          Let's go.
          They head down the hallway to their lockers. Lou tags
          along.

                         LOU
          You girls get bored with each
          other, I'm always around, you know?
          They pass Kelly and Drew huddled at her locker. His
          hands rest on her shoulders. They are talking intently.

                         VICKI
          Poor girl must be exhausted. Look
          how he has to hold her up...

          Uh oh.
          Kim stops suddenly and turns to look. Lou bumps into
          her, his hand purposely grazing her rear.

                         KIM
          Go play with yourself, Lou.

                         LOU

          up talking to Wendy.

          Kim brushes past Nick without a word. The two girls ex-

          Kim does not turn back. Walking next to her, Vicki
          watches her friend curiously. Kim giggles. A sneaky
          smile creeps across her face.

          Kim punches her friend but the damage is done. Nick
          grins broadly. Blushing, Kim turns back, flashes him a
          quick smile and disappears around a corner to the hoots
          of Vicki and Jude.

          44 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 44

          A tall dark figure walks quickly down a concrete cor-
          ridor. From somewhere nearby, loud VOICES, SPLASHING
          water, can be HEARD.

          The door edges open. Raymond Hammond appears. Prop-
          ping the door open with his shoulder, he starts down
          across the narrow gallery to the pool below.

          46 INT. POOL 46

          A class of senior male students occupies the water,
          among them Nick McBride and Drew Shinnick. With no
          Phys. Ed. instructor in sight, it's a general goof-off
          period.
          Nick walks out onto the diving board. Drew is treading
          water below him.

          47 ANGLE ON HAMMOND 47

          48 INT. POOL 48

          Nick launches himself out over Drew in an apparent
          belly-flop. At the last moment, he tucks in and hits
          the water in a flipped over cannonball. He surfaces to
          a chorus of whistles and cheers. It was a close shave.

                         DREW
          You wanta take care of yourself,
          man... Kim's expecting a lot from

          Nick laughs.

          The door is easing shut. Hammond is nowhere to be seen.

          50 INT. GYM - DAY 50

          A side door opens. Hammond steps in, gazes around.
          The gym is empty, silent. He walks to the stage steps,
          climbs up, pushes through the thick curtain.

          51 INT. GYM - BACKSTAGE 51

          It's a dark cluttered area broken up by tall partitions,
          discarded flats from old student productions, banks of
          lights.
          Hammond crosses to a rear door, tries it. It's locked.
          He turns back. As he does so there's a sudden WHIRRING
          SOUND. A row of spotlights flashes on right in front
          of him, almost blinding him. He tries to shield his
          eyes.

          He spins around. Another bank of lights flares at
          him. He staggers downstage. The curtains begin to
          swing open. Startled, he jumps away from them. His
          foot lands on a package of photo-flood bulbs.. There's
          a LOUD POP. Then a VOICE.

          ALEX (O.S.)
          Who's there?
          Hammond, shaken, looks across to the far wing. There's
          an elevated platform where the electronic control panel
          is located. Alex peers down.

                         HAMMOND
          Alex?... What the hell're you
          doing?

                         ALEX

          together.

          He turns, climbs down the stage steps and starts back
          across the gym. At the other end of the floor a door
          opens, Sykes looks in. Hammond sees him.

          HA, MOND

                         (CONTINUING)

          Sykes waits as Hammond hurries across to him. The two
          men go out together.

          52 INT. CLASSROOM (LAB) - DAY 52

          First period biology class features MONTY WELLER, a
          tall, thin Englishman in his late thirties. This stuf-
          fy, dour science teacher drones on about the joys of ex-
          ploring frog vertebrae while most of his class naps,
          daydreams or passes notes.
          Seated in the back near the door, Jude is furtively
          opening a handwritten note. She quickly reads it.
          Stifling a giggle, she looks up to see Kim and Vicki
          across the aisle, eagerly awaiting her reply. Jude
          tears out part of a page from her biology book and
          scrawls her answer. Folding the note, she taps the boy
          next to her and motions for him to pass it on.
          Vicki grabs the note from the boy. Quickly scanning
          it, she nods, impressed. Kim reads it and mouths the
          word "Wow" to Jude who blushes happily.
          Glancing out into the hallway, Jude notices Slick walk-
          ing past. Seeing her in class, he stops and waves.
          Jude frantically tries to motion him away. Their backs
          to the door, Kim and Vicki watch with curiosity as Jude
          gestures in their direction. Seeing her friends
          watching her, Jude smiles and tries to ignore Slick.
          Not to be denied, he exaggeratedly mimes Weller, nose
          to his textbook, lecturing on, oblivious to his class.
          Jude laughs in spite of herself. Kim and Vicki turn
          around.
          Glancing out the door, the two girls stare in disbelief
          at the small weird curly-haired boy doing a perfect im-
          itation of the eminently boring Weller. Their surprise
          turns to hilarity as they realize this boy must be
          Jude's prom date. Kim holds up the note, raising her
          eyebrows as she gestures toward Slick. Jude nods. Kim
          and Vicki can barely contain their laughter. They do
          not notice Mr. Weller eyeing them suspiciously as he
          rattles on about frog intestines. Slick mouths the
          words, "See you at lunch.., in the van." Jude nods and
          smiles.
          With a final bow and a wave, he exits.
          Kim suddenly looks up to find a red-faced Mr. Weller
          looming above her.

                         WELLER
          Miss Hammond!
          Wide-eyed, Kim desperately tries to crush the note in
          her hand.

          Kim swallows and steals a quick glance at her friends.
          Vicki winces. Jude tries to disappear beneath her, seat.

          and his name is Slick!
          The classroom erupts into laughter as the BELL RINGS,
          signaling the end of the class. Still laughing, stu-
          dents gather their books and shuffle out, several giv-
          ing Kim sympathetic glances as they pass.

                         WELLER
          After school, Miss Hammond. One
          hour detention study hall... you
          and your friends!
          Kim looks from Jude to Vicki.

                         KIM
          But, Mr. Weller, tonight's the

          He spins on his heel and marches back to his desk. The
          three girls hurriedly exit.

          53 INT. ROOM (SCHOOL) - DAY 53

          A hand is flipping through the pages of the Winston
          High yearbook, the back pages where the individual
          photographs of graduating students are placed. The
          hand stops, moves across an open page to a smiling head
          shot of Nick McBride.
          The hand rips the picture from the page, sets it down
          on a plain wooden desk alongside three other pictures
          -with similar torn edges. The other pictures are of
          Jude Cunningham, Kelly Lynch, and Wendy Richards.
          The yearbook is slammed shut.

          54 INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 54

          Kim, Jude and Vicki enter the crowded room. MUSIC from
          several portable RADIOS can be HEARD above the clamor
          as the girls move into the long lunch line. Kim spots
          Alex seated nearby and waves to him.

          Here comes the incredible hunk
          himself.
          Jude looks up to see Slick slowly making his way down
          the line towards them. He is carrying a tray piled
          high with snack food: potato chips, cookies, candy.
          Jude smiles as he passes her, grinning.

                         KIM
          Looks like a party.

                         JUDE
          Yeah -- I don't think he's gonna
          be too good for my diet...
          Slick moves down the lunch line. Suddenly he is bumped
          from behind, sending the tray and the snacks flying
          across the room. Looking around, Slick jumps back,
          startled by a tall figure wearing a dark ski mask.

                         SLICK

          Three of Lou's gang quickly step up behind the masked
          figure.

          Say what?

          That's what I figured.
          Slick bends over to pick up his lunch.

                         (SOFTLY)

          Lou and his friends shove ahead in the line until he is
          standing behind Kim. Lou nuzzles Kim's neck.

                         LOU

          Startled, Kim spins around. Her fear quickly becomes
          anger.

                         KIM
          It's an improvement!
          She turns her back to him.

                         LOU
          You like it so much...
          (spins her around to

                         FACE HIM)
          Have a taste.
          He kisses her hard on the mouth. Swinging at him, Kim
          breaks away. Laughing, Lou grabs her wrists and rough-
          ly pulls her to him. Alex instantly jumps to his feet.

                         LOU

                         (CONTINUING;
          holding Kim close)
          Be nice...
          Alex leaps over the metal railing separating the line
          from the tables. Crashing into Lou, he drives the
          larger boy back into the salad counter, sending food
          and utensils flying. As they tumble off the counter
          onto the floor, Alex gets in several furious punches
          before Lou's gang can pry him loose.
          Two of the gang pin Alex against the counter. Wiping
          blood from his mouth, Lou grins maliciously and slugs
          Alex in the stomach. The boy groans and doubles over.
          Lou grabs Alex's hair and slams his head back against
          the glass shield of the counter.
          As Lou rears back to throw another punch, his two
          friends suddenly release Alex and scatter. The boy
          crumples to the floor. Lou turns around to see two
          MALE TEACHERS rapidly approaching. The larger teacher
          grabs Lou.

                         TEACHER
          This time you're out, Perano.
          Lou points to Alex who is being helped up from the
          floor.

          Alex nods, leaning on the other teacher for support.

                         KIM
          That's not true! Alex was trying
          to help me.
          The teacher looks from Kim to Lou to Alex.

                         TEACHER
          You'd better come along to your
          father's office.

          Wonder who'll get off with just
          a warning?
          Several students laugh. The two Teachers march Lou and
          Alex through the silent cafeteria. Lou swaggers bask-
          ing in the attention. Alex walks with his head bowed.
          They exit.

          55 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 55

          Lou and Alex accompany the teachers down the corridor
          toward the principal's office. Nick and Wendy approach
          from the opposite direction, talking heatedly.

                         NICK

          walking towards the cafeteria. The irate girl glares

          56 INT. OFFICE - DAY 56

          Hammond is talking on the telephone. He appears agi-
          tated, running his fingers through his hair and tugging
          at the knot in his loosened tie.

          I told you we'd go to the cemetery...
          The door opens and Adele Cooper's head peers around the
          corner. Seeing Hammond talking on the phone, she nods
          toward the outer office. Hammond gestures for her to
          wait. She persists until he angrily takes the receiver
          from his ear and covers the mouthpiece.

          a little like that child in the
          picture on your desk.
          Hammond automatically glances at the photograph of
          Robin framed alongside one of the rest of his family.

          finally Alex. Hammond gives his son a sharp look, then
          turns to glare at Lou.

          Wendy's white Mustang slides up to the curb. The pass-

          side. After a moment he climbs in and the MUSTANG
          PEELS out of the lot, leaving twin black tread marks in
          its wake.

                         KIM
          What a pair!

                         VICKI
          Made for each other!
          Kim opens a carton of yogurt.

                         KIM
          You wearing that green gown tonight?

                         VICKI
          You kidding? That was last year.
          This year... red silk!
          (smiles and runs her
          hand from her neck
          to her waist)
          Cut to here! ...

          NICK (O.S.)
          Cut to where?
          Kim and Vicki turn to see Nick ambling across the lawn
          toward them.

          58 EXT. STREET - DAY

          Wendy's white Mustang streaks through traffic, dodging
          in and out of lanes, running yellows, burning around
          corners.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59 INT. MUSTANG 59

          Lou sits pinned to the passenger seat, eyes wide,
          staring straight ahead as if he can't quite believe
          this trip. His bravado seems to have left him. He
          glances over at Wendy in the driver's seat. She's
          puffing on a cigarette, handling the wheel almost
          casually. She's in control,

          60 EXT. DRIVE-IN 60

          The Mustang suddenly slows down and makes a hard left
          turn, narrowly beating a horn-honking oncoming van.
          The big white car bounces up over the curb and sweeps
          into the end slot at a sprawling fast-food drive-in.

          61 INT. MUSTANG 61

          Lou's still pinned to his seat. Wendy shuts off the
          engine, looks at him. He looks at her, lets out a
          long deep breath.
          A cute little CAR-HOP in a cut-off costume and roller
          skates glides over. She leans into Wendy's window,
          talks through a wad of gum.

                         CAR-HOP
          Ready to order?

                         (TO LOU)
          What do you want?
          Lou's shifting around in his seat, pulling himself
          together.

                         LOU
          I'm uh... a little short on cash..

                         WENDY
          You can owe me.

                         LOU
          Yeah? Okay then, a couple of
          burgers, a large fries... what
          kind of beer you got?

                         CAR- HOP
          C'mon man, this is a drive-in not
          a bar.

                         LOU
          All right, all right... don't get
          nervous... Gimme a coke...

          That ' sit.
          The Car-hop shrugs, wheels away. Wendy turns to Lou.

                         WENDY
          I'll buy you one for Christmas,
          all right? Now, how do I know
          you're serious?

                         LOU
          Whatta you mean, serious? I hate
          that school, Hammond and his
          asshole family...

                         WENDY
          I don't want anyone hurt... not
          badly.

                         LOU
          You got it... anything your little
          heart desires...

                         WENDY
          Lou, shouldn't we go over this.
          Lou puts his finger to her mouth, silencing her.

                         LOU
          I'll take care of it, Scout's
          honor... Don't worry about it...

          He caresses her cheek and lips, then kisses her. At
          first reluctant, Wendy quickly takes over. When they
          finally break from their passionate clinch, he is
          gasping.

                         LOU

                         (CONTINUING)
          Jesus Christ!

                         WENDY
          Don't worry about it..
          She unbuttons his shirt and begins to kiss and lick his
          chest. Slowly she works her way down. Lou begins to
          writhe. Wendy's head disappears from VIEW. Lou's eyes
          snap open in surprise.
          Wendy groans.

                         WEND Y
          Damn stick shift!
          Lou starts to protest, then dissolves.

          62,. INT. MUSTANG - DAY 62

          The Car-hop wheels up to the Mustang carrying a tray
          loaded with food. She leans over and peers inside.
          Wendy is behind the wheel, perfectly composed. A mind-
          blown Lou is hurriedly doing up his belt, tucking in
          his shirt. He glances at the Car-hop then turns away
          to finish the job.

                         CAR-HOP
          Enjoy your meal.

          63 EXT. LAKE-SIDE BLUFFS - DAY 63

          A WIDE VIEW; high weather-worn bluffs tumbling down to
          a strip of beach and the calm blue waters of the lake.
          Above the bluffs there's a narrow shaded park and then
          the buildings and parking lots of Winston High.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         63 CONTINUED:
          Nick and Kim walk slowly along the rim of the bluffs.
          Nick has his arm around her. She leans into him.

                         KIM
          I am excited, it's just... in some
          ways it's such an awful day... It's
          Robin's day...

          64 EXT. BLUFFS CLOSER ANGLE 64


                         KIM
          My mother's all upset, as usual.
          My father too... he doesn't show
          it so much... It's hard to get
          over something like that. Robin
          would have been a junior, like
          Alex. This would've been her first
          prom... I guess that's'why it seems
          so much worse this year...
          She stops, turns and faces Nick. It's hard for him to
          meet her gaze.

                         KIM

                         (CONTINUING)
          The Queen of the Prom is determined
          not to let it get to her... She
          must maintain her... whatever, at all
          costs..
          She tries a weak smile. Nick stares at her, then sud-
          denly takes her, pulls her to him, embraces her. She's
          caught by surprise, but she responds.
          She smiles.

                         KIN
          I love you too.

                         NICK
          I'm... I want you to know that...
          Robin's death... I remember it and
          I've always been... so sorry
          about it...
          Kim looks puzzled.

                         NICK

                         (CONTINUING)
          I mean... I know what you're
          feeling... I've...
          (looks at her)
          :Listen I...
          Across the school parking lot a CAR HORN BLARES, inter-
          rupts Nick. Kim reacts.

                         KIM
          That's my father... I've got to go,
          Okay?

                         NICK
          Yeah... I'll see you later.
          She hesitates a moment, then kisses him quickly, turns
          and goes. Nick looks shaken up. He stares after her
          as she hurries away.
          Behind Nick, in the other corner of the parking lot, a
          metal door slides open, loud RAUNCHY ROCK and ROLL sud-
          denly infests the air. Nick turns, sees Jude climbing
          out of Slick's van. Jude looks about as stoned as she
          can get. She spots Nick, waves.

                         JUDE
          Hey, Nick!
          Nick turns and heads the other way.

          65 EXT. CEMETERY - HAMMOND PLOT - DAY 65

          There's a small marble headstone inset with the carved
          face of an angel and the inscription "Robin Anne Hammond
          1964 - 1973 Too Soon Taken From Us."
          Kneeling beside the grave is Vivian Hammond. She's ar-
          ranging a large bouquet of mixed flowers, fussing with
          them, trying for some kind of impossible perfection.

          HP`ï¿½MOND (0. S.

          She doesn't react, she keeps playing with the flowers.
          Hammond moves in behind her, puts his hands on her
          shoulders. She looks at him.

                         HAMMOND

                         (CONTINUING)
          We have to get back.
          She stands, with her husband's support. Kim and Alex
          are standing quietly at the foot of the grave. Vivian
          looks at them both. Her eyes hold a terrible rage, a
          terrible sadness. Hammond carefully guides her away.
          Kim has a flower of her own, a white rose, which she
          drops on her sister's grave. She turns, meets Alex's
          stare, moves off after her parents. Alex remains a mo-
          ment longer, then. he, too, goes.

          66 EXT. TENNIS COURTS DAY

          During the afternoon phys. ed. class, the girls play
          tennis: Kim with Kelly and Vicki with Jude. Sykes
          lingers nearby, watching the girls. Their instructor
          is Miss HENRI-ANNE BENTON, a stocky woman in her late
          thirties with teased, lacquered hair. A product of
          genteel Southern womanhood, Henri-Anne stalks the
          courts in her baggy Bermuda shorts, constantly blowing
          a silver whistle hanging from her neck.
          A very stoned, giggling Jude runs Vicki ragged, hitting
          balls over the fence, straight up in the air and occa-
          sionally even back over her head. Each time a ball
          flies over the fence, Vicki runs to retrieve it to the
          delight of Sykes.
          At one point, Vicki bends over to pick up a ball under
          Sykes' appreciative gaze. The shrill WHISTLE inter-
          rupts her as Henri-Anne rushes over.

                         HENRI-ANNE

                         (SOUTHERN ACCENT)
          No, no, Miss Cantrell! Never bend
          from the waist... Squat!

                         (DEMONSTRATES)
          Always squat to retrieve.
          Otherwise, you look like the broad
          side of a barn!
          (glares at Sykes)
          Isn't that so, Mr. Sykes?
          Embarrassed, the custodian scuttles away to the girls'
          Laughter.

          We don't want you all worn out for
          the ball tonight.

          Anne.

          promptly at three-fifteen for
          rehearsal?

          Kim, wide-eyed, can only look at Vicki.

                         VICKI
          He keeps making Kim stay after
          school in detention study hall for
          no reason... Just so he can be
          near her.

                         HENRI-ANNE
          That's horrible!
          Kim gulps.

          Kim nods meekly. Lost in thought, Henri-Anne fondles a
          tennis ball, a curious smile playing across her face.

          67 EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY 67

          Kim and Vicki, and behind them, Jude and Kelly are
          walking back to the gym and the dressing rooms from the
          tennis courts. Vicki's in high spirits and Jude still
          can't stop giggling.
          Vicki spots old Sykes heading out toward the playing
          field. She calls out to him.

                         VICKI
          Mr. Sykes!

                         KIM
          Vicki, don't...

                         VICKI
          Oh, Mr. Sykes...
          Sykes stops, turns around.

                         VICKI

                         (CONTINUING)
          This is just for you...
          She turns, bends over, quickly yanks down her shorts
          and moons him. There's a squeal of laughter from Jude
          and from Kelly. Vicki whips her shorts back up and
          runs to the gym door, the other girls in pursuit.
          Kim looks back at Sykes. He's just standing in the
          field, not moving. There's a look in his eyes.

          68 INT. GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM - DAY 68

           Kim and Kelly are undressing. Three girls pass them
          headin g for the showers.

                         KELLY
          I'm not like the others, Kim.
          Drew needs somebody like Vicki
          who'll give him what he wants.

                         KIM

                         (LAUGHS)
          Vicki's sex life is more talk than
          action. Besides, Drew wants you.

                         KELLY
          I'm afraid if I don't make it with
          him he'll find somebody who will.

                         KIM

                         (SHRUGS)
          Let him.

                         KELLY
          I'd die if he did...
          The girls wrap towels around themselves and walk to-
          wards the showers.

          69 INTT. SHIER AREA - DAY 69
          A girl (MELANIE) is leaving as Kim and'Kelly enter.
          Wendy is standing in front of a mirror drying her hair.
          Kim ignores her and Wendy returns the compliment.

                         MELANIE
          See you outside, Wendy.

                         WENDY
          Just be a minute...
          Kim and Kelly hang up their towels and step into the
          showers.

                         KELLY
          What about you and Nick?

                         KIM
          What about us?
          Wendy finishes brushing her hair, shoots Kim.a dark
          look, exits.

                         KELLY
          What.happened when he asked you?
          Kim smiles.

                         KIM
          Maybe I asked him...
          Kelly looks at her friend.

          70 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 70

          Wendy finishes buttoning her blouse. She's pulling on
          her jeans when she hears a SCUFFLING SOUND.

                         WENDY
          I'll be right there, Melanie.
          No answer. Curious, Wendy moves around the lockers,
          investigating. The room appears empty.
          There's a sudden LOUD CREAKING. Wendy whirls around.
          A locker door is swinging slowly open.

                         WENDY

                         (CONTINUING)
          Melanie?...
          Still no answer. Shaking her head, Wendy returns to
          her locker.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         70 CONTINUED: 70
          She's about to shut it when she sees something, a pic-
          ture, taped to the side of the door. It's her photo,
          torn from the School Yearbook. She rips it from the
          door, looks at it.

                         WENDY

                         (CONTINUING)
          What's this for, Melanie?
          Her voice echoes through the empty room. She gazes
          around, fear creeping into her face. She quickly
          finishes dressing, grabs her books, turns to leave.
          Suddenly she screams.

          71 INT. SHOWER AREA 71

          Wendy's SCREAM is all but DROWNED OUT by the SHOWERS.
          Rinsing off, Kim and Kelly hear nothing.

                         KELLY
          I think I'll let Drew do it.
          The door to the locker roor slowly opens behind them.

                         KIM
          Let him?
          She looks at Kelly. Neither girl hears the SQUISH of
          RUBBER SOLES moving across the wet tile floor.
          Suddenly there are LOUD VOICES. Melanie comes through
          from the locker room, laughing. Behind her, Wendy's
          ANGRY WORDS are AUDIBLE.

          WENDY (O.S.)
          If you ever try anything like that
          again, you cow!
          Melanie thinks it's hilarious.

                         MELANIE
          (to Kim and Kelly)
          You should've seen her jump...
          Nadia Comenici never did better...
          Wendy storms in. She's got the photo in her hand. She
          waves it at Kim and Kelly.

                         WENDY
          What's this supposed to mean?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         KIM

                         (SARCASTIC)
          I know it's not much of a picture,
          Wendy, but you didn't have to go
          that far...
          Wendy is furious.

                         WENDY
          I didn't!
          She turns, glares at Melanie.

                         MELANIE
          Don't look at me...

                         WENDY
          You're all... children...
          She storms out. Melanie looks at Kim and Kelly,
          shrugs, follows Wendy. A DOOR SLAMS in the locker
          room.
          Kim and Kelly look at each other, laugh, turn their
          faces back to the steaming water. Neither one hears
          the SOUND across the room, a HARSH RHYTHMIC HEAVY

          BREATHING.
          Kelly bends her head away from the water, clears her
          eyes., She squints out through the steam at the big
          wall mirror across the room. She sees something. She
          steps back into Kim, her eyes wide with fear.

                         KIM
          Watch it...
          Kelly covers her breasts with her arms, presses against
          the wall, terrified.
          Suddenly there's an EXPLOSION of SOUND. Kim screams,
          jumps back, stares. There's a jagged hole in the cen-
          ter of the mirror, huge cracks radiating from it,
          spidering across its surface.
          For a moment no one moves. Splinters of GLASS TRICKLE
          down to the floor. There's no other sound. Kim grabs
          for her towel, steps out of the shower, looks. There's
          no one. She heads for the locker room door. Kelly
          runs after her.

                         KELLY

          72 INT. LOCKER ROOM 72

          Kim rushes into the room, Kelly right behind her.
          There's no one. Kelly is quivering. She clutches at
          Kim's arm. Kim looks at her.

                         KIM
          What did you see?
          Kelly just shakes her head.

                         KELLY
          Just... just... a shadow or.,.
          Kim heads for the exit door across the room. Kelly
          stays with her.

          73 EXT. SCHOOL 73

          Kim opens the outside door, peers down the walkway to
          the tennis courts, playing fields. There's no sign of
          anyone. She closes the door.

          74 INT. LOCKER ROOM 74

          Kim turns back.to Kelly who's started to cry.

                         KELLY
          Someone was there! Someone was...
          in there...
          Kim is taking charge. She moves cautiously back to the
          shower room door, opens it, looks in. She gasps.

                         KELLY

                         (CONTINUING)
          What? What!s wrong?
          Kelly's on the edge of hysteria. She runs over to Kim.
          They both look.

          75 KIM'S AND KELLY'S POV 75
          What the girls see is the mirror. Something has
          changed. A long wedge of glass has been lifted out o
          it.

          76 BACK TO SCENE 76
          Kim shuts the door, presses against it, stares at
          Kelly.

          77 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 77

          Kim walks quickly down a long school corridor and turns
          into her father's office.

          78 INT. OFFICE - DAY 78

          Kim enters. Adele Cooper is seated behind the secre-
          tary's desk thumbing through a fashion magazine.

                         KIM
          I'd like to see my f ather .

                         ADELE
          Another Hammond?

                         KIM

                         (AGITATED)
          Is he here?

                         ADELE
          No, he's not. He said he'd be
          back but...
          She trails off. Kim is obviously upset.

                         ADELE

                         (CONTINUING)
          What's urrong?

                         KIM
          Oh... There was... Somebody broke
          a mirror in the shower room...
          There was somebody in there...

                         ADELE
          A mirror? Seven years bad luck...
          She tries to smile. Kim just looks at her.

          79 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 79

          Kim turns a corner, heading for class, and almost runs
          into Sykes, cleaning the floor. Sykes turns. For a
          moment their eyes lock. Then Kim hurries away, almost
          running. Sykes stares after her.

          80 INT. HALLWAY (WELLER'S CLASSROOM) - DAY 80

           Kim comes down the hallway and stops at the door.
           There's a piece of paper with a hastily scrawled mes-
           sage taped there. It heads: "Detention Postponed
           Until Monday -- EMERGENCY! Weller."

           VICKI (O.S.)
          Did it work?
          Kim is startled, turns. Vicki and Jude and approach-
          ing. Vicki hurries to the door, reads the note.

          She lets out a whoop, embraces Jude. Kim stands back,
          somehow less impressed.

          81 INT. GYM - DAY 81

          Several students are putting last-minute touches on the
          decor as Kim comes in. Huge speakers are being hoisted
          on pulleys to hang from the ceiling. A vast, raised
          platform covers much of the gym floor, its plexiglass
          surface designed to be illuminated from below. Perched
          on a ladder, Weller is hanging shimmering silver strips
          while Henri-Anne Benton supervises from the disco
          floor.

                         HENRI-ANNE
          Careful, Monty... A little
          higher...
          (sees Kim and

                         SMILES)
          I'm glad you could make it!

                         KIM
          Something came up...
          (looks at Weller)
          'Afternoon, Mr. Weller.

                         WELLER

                         (EMBARRASSED)
          Oh, hello, Miss... Hammond. I was
          just... uh...
          Henri-Anne mercifully interrupts him.

                         HENRI-ANNE
          Let's get started.

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Nick!
          Nick pokes his head out of the sound booth set on a
          platform near the stage.

                         HENRI-ANNE

                         (CONTINUING)
          Onstage! Tell Alex we're ready.
          Alex emerges from the booth. DAVY MATLOCK, a pudgy,
          fifteen-year-old sophomore and Alex's technical assis-
          tant, leans out behind him.

          Wonderful. You can be Mr. Hanunond
          for the rehearsal!
          Alex groans. Kim smiles as Nick joins her. She takes
          his hand, clutches it. They start to walk away, talk-
          ing quietly. Nick puts his arm around her.

                         HENRI-ANNE

                         (CONTINUING)
          Nick! Kim! Come with me.
          Henri-Anne bounds up onto the stage. Kim and Nick fol-
          low her behind the curtain.

          82 INT. GYM (BACKSTAGE) - DAY 82

          Henri-Anne takes Kim to one of the wings of the dark
          cluttered area.

                         HENRI -ANNE
          You'll wait here...
          (looks around for

                         NICK)
          Nick?
          Nick silently creeps from behind a partition and moves
          up directly behind Henri-Anne. He mimes choking her, a
          crazed expression on his face. Kim has to laugh at his
          clowning.

          Scary place!

                         HENRI-ANNE
          You have to stand up here tonight,
          not me. If you don't know what to

          not see Wendy and Lou lurking there, watching her.

          Kim enters and surveys the apparently empty office.
          Hearing GRUNTS and GROANS from behind the desk, Kim
          steps around and sees Adele Cooper stretched across the
          floor. The secretary is practicing her "Rainbow" exer-
          cise, arching her body towards the ceiling while keep-
          ing her hands and feet on the floor.

          Hello?
          Adele twists her head around to look at Kim. Her
          "Rainbow" collapses. Spinning around, Adele sits
          cross-legged on the floor and smiles at Kim.

          Jude approaches her locker, stops. There's a picture
          taped to her locker door, her picture, ripped out of
          the Winston High Yearbook. She looks at it, reaches up
          and pulls it off the door. She winces, looks at her
          finger. It's bleeding. She looks at the picture.
          There's a tiny sliver of glass embedded in it.

          90 INT. LIVING ROOM - DUSK 90

          Vivian is arranging fresh roses on the mantel shrine
          when Kim enters. The girl stands for several seconds
          watching her mother before she speaks.

                         KIM

                         AROUND)
          Hello, Robin. Don't eat anything.
          Dinner's almost ready.
          Disturbed, Kim frowns and slowly crosses the room to
          her mother.

                         KIM
          Nothing's cooking, Mom. You
          must've forgotten.
          Slipping out of her reverie, Vivian turns around to
          face Kim.

                         VIVIAN
          Oh.. I don't know what I was
          thinking.

                         KIM

                         (SMILES)
          It doesn't matter.

                         VIVIAN

                         (EXCITEDLY)
          Have you seen the new satin
          pantsuit I'm wearing?
          Vivian smiles at her daughter. Kim studies her for a
          long moment, then leans over and kisses her on the
          cheek.

                         KIM
          You'll be beautiful.

          91 INT. HALLWAY - HAMMONDS' HOUSE - DUSK

          As Kim walks down the hallway, she notices that Alex's
          door is closed. She enters her bedroom.

          92 INT. BEDROOM - DUSK 92

          Kim crosses the room and switches ON her RADIO. ROCK
          MUSIC is HEARD as she tosses her books onto the desk
          and moves to the closet. She carefully pulls out her
          prom dress, a mid-length, off-the-shoulder gown in a
          white, clinging material. Holding it up against her
          body, she inspects the gown in the full-length mirror
          on the closet door. Watching her reflection, Kim
          twirls around, hugging the gowm to her body. Satis-
          fied, she gently lays the go%.m on her bed.

          Kim begins to undress. Outside, the twilight shadows
          deepen.
          THROUGH the VINDOM, a slight movement is SEAN among the
          trees; suddenly, a dark figure becomes VISIBLE, ap-
          proaching.the window. Kim does not notice the figure
          as she finishes undressing. She wraps herself in a
          robe and sits at her dressing table.
          Putting her hair up, she does not see the shadowy
          figure peering inside. When Kim stands up, the figure
          slips away from the window. As she crosses the room,
          the face reappears, hidden by the shadows, watching her
          enter the bathroom.

          93 INT. BEDROOM - DUSK 93

          Wearing only a bra and panties, Wendy is sprawled
          across her bed, talking on the telephone. A black silk
          gown is draped across her legs.

                         WENDY
          (into the receiver)
          What I'm wearing now?... Oh,
          tonight!
          (smiles, gently
          stroking the gown)
          You'll find out soon enough.

                         (STIFFENS)
          Now, are we all set?... It better.
          I don't want her to ever forget
          tonight!... Okay, 'bye.
          Wendy hangs up the receiver and glances at her night
          table. A photograph of a grinning Nick McBride stares
          back. Wendy smiles and caresses her gown.

          94 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 94

          Seated at her dressing table, Kim puts the final touch-
          es on her makeup. Her hair is swept up and back, fall-
          ing in soft waves to her shoulders. Wearing the rav-
          ishing white gown, she looks older and very beautiful.
          Vivian's VOICE is HEARD from down the hall.

          VIVIAN (O.S.)
          Kim!
          Vivian comes in looking anxious and flustered. She's
          dressed in an elegant black satin pantsuit. Kim turns,
          looks at her.

          Mom, it looks great...
          Vivian doesn't seem to hear her. She's rummaging
          through her purse.

                         VIVIAN
          Kim, have you got any of my
          makeup?

                         KIM
          No... I never...

          I wouldn't take it without asking
          you...
          Vivian's very wound up.

                         VIVIAN
          It was on my dressing table, I set
          it aside...
          She's looking around Kim's room as if she expects to
          see it.

          Why does this always happen at
          the last minute?
          Hammond's VOICE bellows from downstairs.

          HAMMOND (O.S.)
          let's go, we can't be late...

                         VIVIAN

          She heads for the door, stops, looks fully at Kim for
          the first time.

          95 INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT 95

          Hammond stands in front of a hall mirror, straightening
          his bow tie. He seems agitated, nervous. He turns as
          Vivian starts down the stairs. He looks surprised at
          her outfit. There's a certain similarity between it
          and his own formal suit.

                         HAMIM0ND
          My God, we're going to look like
          twins.
          Vivian stops dead, looks at him. Hammond forces a
          smile.

                         HAMMOND

                         (CONTINUING)
          I'm joking, Vi, it's beautiful.._
          C'mon...
          She hesitates, then comes down to him.

                         VIVIAN
          I told you I'd bought it.

                         HAMMOND
          Of course you did.
          He opens the door for her. She pauses to check herself
          in the mirror.

                         HAMMOND

                         (CONTINUING)
          we've got to go.
          He puts an arm around her, kisses her gently on the
          cheek. She just stares at herself in the mirror.

          96 EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 96

          Hammond takes Vivian's arm as they step outside, walk
          toward the car in the driveway.

          97 INT. PARKED CAR - POV 97

          Someone is watching Hammond and Vivian from a car
          parked across and just down the street. A shadow moves
          in the foreground, in the front seat of the car.

          98 EXT. HOUSE 98

          Hammond guides his wife to their family car, opens the
          passenger door for her_ He looks past her, down the
          street, sees a car parked there.

          A streetlight reflecting off its windshield prevents
          him from seeing inside. Vivian interrupts his
          speculations.

                         VIVIAN
          I'm going back to change.
          She turns back to the house. Hammond holds on to her
          arm.

                         HAMMOND
          Vi... there's no time...

          The figure in the front seat watches the confrontation
          in the Hammond driveway.

          100 EXT. HOUSE 100

          Hammond takes Vivian by the shoulders, faces her.

                         HAMMON D
          Vi.. this is a big night for the
          school, it's a big night for me...
          I know how you're feeling... I
          understand... It's difficult for
          all of us... But we've got to make
          a special effort, Vi... We can't
          let the... terrible memories of
          this day affect us... That may
          seem cold and... insensitive to
          you, but it's the way it has to
          be..
          He pauses, staring down at his wife. She's holding his
          gaze.

                         HAMMOND

                         (CONTINUING)
          Now, Vi, if you think it's going
          to be too difficult for you...

                         VIVIAN

          He's trying to stay calm, to keep the lid on. She's on
          the verge of tears.

          She glares at him. He releases her from his grip, ges-
          tures toward the car.

                         HANMOND
          Let's get going...
          He walks around to the driver's door. Vivian stares
          after him with hard cold eyes.

          101 INT. PARKED CAR - POV 101

          The figure in the parked car watches as Hammond starts
          up the car, waits for Vivian to get in, backs out of
          the driveway, and moves off down the street.

          The figure climbs out of his car, gazes at the fading
          taillights of the Hammond car. The figure is Nick
          McBride.

          As she gently tracks the perf me across her skin, she
          is startled by another reflection in her mirror.
          Whirling around, she sees Alex. Standing up, she pir-
          ouettes and curtsies before her brother.

                         KIM
          Well?

          Alex takes the corsage. As he attaches the bright red
          flower on her gown, she playfully dabs perfume on his
          neck. He pulls back, pricking himself on the pin.

          er's face is revealed. It is the nine-year-old Alex.
          Kim cradles the killer on the ground. She turns his
          head toward the light. We SEE his face full-on.

                         VIVIA N
          Robin!
          She rushes forward, lunging for the body. Hammond
          grabs her, restraining her.
          Alex's dark eyes stare back unseeing at his family.
          His resemblance to his dead twin sister is uncanny.
          His hair falls onto his forehead in bangs, as Robin's
          had done seven years before. His makeup has been slop-
          pily applied. The rouged cheeks and the smudged red
          lips amplify the grotesque impersonation.
          Kim strokes her brother's hair. Hammond presses his
          hysterical wife to him. The onlookers slowly close in.
          We SLOWLY DISSOLVE FROM Alex's face TO a photograph of
          the Hammond family taken seven years earlier. We MOVE
          IN CLOSE ON the twins. Alex and Robin are smiling.

          EXT. EARTH - DAY (12,000 B.C.)
                         
          The world turns below us, vast and slow.
                         
          A RUMBLE. A shadow sweeps over the land. We move with the
          shadow. We cast the shadow.
                         
          Landscapes slide by. Reduced by altitude to abstractions:
          river deltas, forests and flood plains. A raw natural world.
          No trace of civilization.
                         
          The shadow glides over mountains and glaciers. Across an
          ocean and a pale beach. Over lowland plain at the foot of a
          VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN it stops.
                         
                         
          EXT. LOWLAND PLAIN - DAY
                         
          THREE FIGURES walk out of the shadow.
                         
          They are men - and yet not men. Their skin is snow-white.
          Their features heavy and classical - as if Rodin's Thinker
          had risen from his seat. Their smooth heads are earless and
          hairless. Their glittering eyes entirely black.
                         
          Against the stark land their height is impossible to judge.
                         
          They are ENGINEERS.
                         
          Two of them are cloaked in dark robes of strange design.
                         
          The third is naked.
                         
          One of the cloaked Engineers opens a featureless black box:
          inside lies a cake of dark, sticky material.
                         
          The naked one lifts the dark cake with ceremonial slowness.
          It hums and buzzes. Foams into iridescent spheres. He raises
          the seething cake to his mouth like the sacrament.
                         
          BLACK SCARABS boil out of the dark material. Swarm over his
          lips. Glittering insects that chitter and bite.
                         
          Under the swarm his lips melt away. A horrific vision of
          teeth, black blood, dissolving bone. They are devouring him.
                         
                         
                         FLASH ON:
                         
          A fevered glimpse of the microscopic: cells rupture and
          bleed. Protein chains unfold. A DNA spiral unravels.
           2.
                         
                         
          The scarabs fill their bellies with genetic material.
                         
                         
                         THE ENGINEER
                         
          ...spreads his arms. Stands cruciform, nearly headless.
                         
          The scarabs swarm his shoulders, his chest. When they reach
          his hips, he collapses sideways, toppling majestically like a
          felled tree. Engulfed.
                         
          The two cloaked Engineers watch impassively.
                         
          Behind them, a vast black SHIP hangs in the sky.
                         
          As if blown by a great gust of wind, the scarabs disperse in
          their millions in all directions. Living DNA on the wing.
          Where the sacrificial victim fell, nothing remains.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - DAY
                         
          A pristine wilderness. The VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN in the distance.
                         
          A PRIMITIVE WOMAN stands on a height, staring in amazement:
          far off a great dark ship hovers over the plain.
                         
          A black scarab lands on the back of her neck. Bites deep.
          Injecting its cargo of DNA into her blood.
                         
                         
                         FLASH ON:
                         
          A microscopic invasion. Cells pierced and infused. DNA
          strands twining and mating.
                         
                         
          CLOSE ON THE WOMAN
                         
          Pupils dilating with shock, breath hissing into her lungs.
                         
          She slaps the back of her neck. Looks at her hand. The scarab
          lies in her palm.
                         
          As she watches, it crumbles to dust and blows away.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.
                         
                         
                         ON BLACK
                         
          Drifting motes of light against the dark: a starscape.
           3.
                         
                         
          An EXCAVATOR floats into view: a sturdy vehicle equipped with
          robotic arms. Bright floodlights beat at the darkness. Inside
          the cockpit - a bubble of glass - sits a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
                         
          This is DR. JOCELYN WATTS, 32, a precocious scholar of many
          disciplines. A scientist accustomed to field work.
                         
          The cockpit is sweltering: she wears shorts, boots, a T-shirt
          - and still her arms and legs gleam with sweat.
                         
          Watts works the controls. The excavator descends toward a
          rocky surface. Silt billows up as the excavator approaches:
          we're not in space at all, but deep underwater.
                         
          The excavator's thrusters are cowled propellers. The "stars"
          are plankton shining in the floodlights.
                         
                         
          INT. EXCAVATOR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Watts steers the excavator to a steeply sloping cliff wall. A
          sea-trench yawns below her, its depths lost in darkness.
                         
                          WATTS
           Moving to survey site B... closing on
           object four. The large oblong.
                         
          She watches the screen of a ground-penetrating radar system.
          A bright signal return: something hidden in the cliff in
          front of her. Something big.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           There you are.
                         
                         
          EXT. SEA TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Watts carves into the cliff with the excavator's digger arm.
          Silt and boulders fall into the yawning trench below. She
          brings a water cannon to bear: uses its jet to blast away
          loose silt and stones.
                         
          The cliff face collapses: a muddy landslide into the deeps.
                         
          Watts backs away from the collapse, thrusters whirring to
          keep her out of the turbulence. A cloud of silt clears.
                         
          In her floodlight beams, the OBELISK stands revealed - its
          outlines worn by the ages. Easily thirty feet tall.
                         
          Watts stares at the obelisk, stunned. Her voice is husky:
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin. Here.
           4.
                         
                         
          A second excavator glides out of the dark.
                         
          At the controls: PROFESSOR MARTIN HOLLOWAY, 48, visionary
          genius and archaeologist. Dark-haired and lean, with the
          rangy build of a frontiersman. He's dressed in work trousers
          and a T-shirt. Stubbly chin.
                         
          He plays his floodlights over the obelisk.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Look at that.
                         
                         
          INT. WATTS'S EXCAVATOR
                         
          Watts floats her excavator down the front of the obelisk.
          Scanning the alien text. Suddenly she stops. Grips the
          obelisk with her excavator's arms to anchor herself in place.
                         
                          WATTS
           You need to see this.
                         
           HOLLOWAY (V.O.)
           Coming.
                         
                         
          EXT. SEA TRENCH
                         
          Holloway pilots his excavator expertly up to Watts's. Mates
          the two vehicles at their aft hatchways.
                         
                         
          INT. WATTS'S EXCAVATOR
                         
          Behind Watts, a hatch opens with a splatter of water.
                         
          Holloway climbs in. Squeezes into her cockpit. A tight fit.
          He's distracted by her body, pressed so close - but she has
          eyes only for the inscrutable writing outside the glass.
                         
                          WATTS
           Same thing again.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           What do you see?
                         
                          WATTS
           An ephemeris - a star map.
                          (POINTING)
           Radius, inclination, azimuth...more
           data here...

                          HOLLOWAY
           If we can get epoch and equinox out of
           that...
                         
                          WATTS
           Can we raise this thing?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           (shakes his head)
           Hundreds of tons.
                         
                         
          EXT. MEDITERRANEAN SEA - DAY
                         
          A research vessel at anchor on a turquoise sea. Bright sun.
                         
          In the distance, a coastline dotted with villas. The horizon
          is dominated by the VOLCANIC PEAK - the same peak we saw in
          the distance in the prologue.
                         
          Aboard the research vessel, cranes lift Watts and Holloway's
          excavators out of the sea and onto the deck.
                         
                         
          INT. RESEARCH VESSEL - AFT DECK - DAY
                         
          Under an awning, PRINTS of the obelisk's faces are stretched
          on the deck - fifteen feet long.
                         
          Watts and Holloway crawl over the alien text, red markers in
          hand. Parsing, translating, calculating.
                         
          They're tanned, fit, the wind in their hair. The
          Mediterranean coast in the distance. It's an idyllic way to
          work. But they're utterly absorbed in the task at hand.
                         
                         
          AFT DECK - NIGHT
                         
          They're still at it. Lights illuminate the workspace. The
          obelisk prints are blanketed with markings and annotations.
                         
          Holloway sits at a table. Watts sits on the marked-up prints.
          Both working through calculations on electronic slates.
                         
          Holloway looks up.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I have a solution. A single match.
                         
                          WATTS
           Me too. Checked it twice.
           6.
                         
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           You first.
                         
          Watts holds up her slate: it displays a set of stellar
          coordinates. A detailed star map. Holloway holds up his own
          slate: an exact match. They lock eyes in electric excitement.
                         
                          WATTS
           What do we do now?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We go there.
                         
                         
          EXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL (EARTH ORBIT)
                         
          A gleaming space station like a five-spoked wheel rotates
          grandly against the Pacific Ocean a thousand miles below.
          Black letters on the white metal read: WEYLAND'S WHEEL.
                         
          A round shuttlecraft approaches the station.
                         
                         
          INT. SHUTTLECRAFT (ZERO GRAVITY)
                         
          A spacecraft no bigger than a private jet.
                         
          Holloway and Watts sit strapped into acceleration chairs. The
          only two passengers aboard. New to space travel, Watts tears
          her eyes from the spectacle of Earth outside the window.
                         
          Holloway plays with a pen, batting it from hand to hand in
          the zero gravity.
                         
                          WATTS
           What's first? You do climate, I do
           genetics?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Archaeology first. Let our ancestors
           tell the tale.
                         
                          WATTS
           You think he's serious?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Serious enough to send his private
           shuttle.
                         
                          WATTS
           Weyland can send his shuttle out for
           pizza.

           Martin. If this meeting goes like the
           others, maybe we should...
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           It won't go like the others.
                         
                          WATTS
           How do you know?
                         
          Holloway plucks the pen from the air. He points out the
          window, where the crescent Moon shines like a toothy grin.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Heaven smiles on our enterprise.
                         
                         
          EXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL
                         
          The shuttle docks with the Wheel's hub - a perfect fit.
                         
                         
          INT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL - SPOKE ELEVATOR (ZERO GRAVITY)
                         
          A gleaming capsule elevator with windows to the stars.
                         
          Holloway and Watts float weightlessly inside, moving from
          handhold to handhold. The door closes.
                         
          Watts grabs Holloway by the collar. Pulls them roughly
          together. They kiss. Not for the first time. They have a way.
                         
          Watts's hair and clothing float free: she's a naiad in
          Holloway's arms.
                         
                         
          EXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL
                         
          The elevator descends along the spoke to the rim.
                         
                         
          INT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL - RIM - FOYER
                         
          A luxurious lobby. Tasteful lighting. Eames-era furniture in
          wood and chrome: the past's vision of the future.
                         
          At the rim, the Wheel's rotation supplies gravity. An
          elevator door opens. Watts and Holloway step out - Holloway
          with a sleek metal folio slung over his shoulder.
                         
          The floor is the outer surface of the Wheel: in both
          directions it curves upward out of sight.
                         
          The walls are all windows: on one side, Earth rotates lazily.
          On the other, a wheeling field of stars.
           8.
                         
                         
          DAVID, an android, stands waiting for them. He's cunningly
          built, but no one would mistake him for a real human being.
                         
                          DAVID
           Professor Holloway. Dr. Watts. My name
           is DAVID.
                         
                          WATTS
           Hello, DAVID.
                         
                          DAVID
           Mr. Weyland's eager to meet you.
                         
          He strides off across the foyer. Watts and Holloway exchange
          a wondering glance and follow.
                         
                         
                         EXHIBIT HALL
                         
          DAVID leads past models of planets, moons and asteroids.
          Holographic labels and data swirl around them.
                         
                          DAVID
           These are all the planetary bodies on
           which Weyland Industries has mining
           claims.
                         
          The end of the hall is dominated by a huge globe of Mars.
          Markings indicate widespread surface activity.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           And Mars. Weyland's crown jewel.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           How is that going? The terraforming.
                         
                          WATTS
           They say you're getting diminishing
           returns. It's not working.
                         
                          DAVID
           It's the greatest engineering project
           ever attempted. Challenges are
           inevitable. Mr. Weyland's a
           determined man.
                         
                         
                         WEYLAND'S OFFICE
                         
          PETER WEYLAND sits behind a mahogany desk. He's a Warren
          Buffet type: a country sage, horse-sense and hard knocks. He
          might be seventy years old, or a hundred and seventy.
           9.
                         
                         
          Behind him stands DIRECTOR LYDIA VICKERS, a slim woman of 45
          in a costly business suit. Shrewd and watchful. Once a great
          beauty, she now trades in ruthlessness.
                         
          DAVID stands against the wall.
                         
          Watts and Holloway settle into chairs in front of Weyland -
          Holloway holding the metal folio.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Professor Holloway. Ms. Watts.
                         
                          WATTS
           Doctor Watts.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Forgive me. Peter Weyland.
                         
          He notices Watts looking curiously at DAVID. He smiles.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           Ah. DAVID here's a prototype. Our 80
           series. One of a kind for now, but if
           he performs, he will be legion.
           (his smile fades)
           What do you want here?
                         
          Holloway looks at him, startled.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We sent you a prospectus that...
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Assume I know nothing.
                         
          Holloway swallows. Lays the metal folio on Weyland's desk.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I'm an archaeologist.
                         
          He touches a tiny remote. Holographs appear in the air over
          Weyland's desk: the folio is a three-dimensional imager.
                         
          Pictures of a younger Holloway in the field: excavating ruins
          in Egypt, China, Peru, Greece.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           In my studies I discovered a pattern I
           couldn't explain. Every eleven hundred
           years, sudden advances in agriculture,
           tool use, technology. Inventions.
           Something caused a great leap forward.
           Every eleven centuries. The pattern
           holds as far back as our data goes.
                          (MORE)
           10.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           Tens of thousands of years. I had to
           understand this. It became the focus
           of my work.
                         
          Weyland nods. Holloway glances at Watts and forges on.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           Dr. Watts was a student of mine.
                         
          Watts touches her own remote. The holographic display turns
          to scientific diagrams. Images of a very young and beautiful
          Watts in the laboratory.
                         
                          WATTS
           I was analyzing historical changes in
           human DNA. I found the same pattern.
           Every eleven centuries, a pulse of new
           information in the genome of the human
           race. All over the world. Evolution
           can't do that. Something was changing
           us. Changing the DNA of our species.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Humanity's been visited. Visited
           by...beings from somewhere else.
                         
          Behind Weyland, Vickers can't suppress a scowl of disdain.
                         
                          VICKERS
           You mean aliens.
                         
          A beat. The others had forgotten Vickers was there.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Lydia Vickers, Director of Operations.
           Practically my right hand.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           They guided us to civilization. Lifted
           us up, again and again. I call them
           the Engineers.
                         
                          WATTS
           Once you know what you're looking for,
           it's amazing how the evidence falls
           into place.
                         
          Photographs flicker through the display: Holloway and Watts
          in the field, excavating new sites. Intimately close.
                         
          Their finds: columns of writing on stone tablets in Egypt,
          China, Cambodia, Peru. Patterns of lines, curves, and dots.
           11.
                         
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           This is the writing of the Engineers.
           We've found it on every continent. And
           last year, we found our Rosetta Stone.
                         
          The display shows the Engineer obelisk under the sea.
                         
                          WATTS
           The writing is a formula giving the
           location of a single star in our sky.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Which star?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We're keeping that confidential for
           now. But that's where we want to go.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           You want me to pay for an interstellar
           research expedition!
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           It's a chance to be part of a
           revolution in scientific...
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Don't sell me, professor. You've been
           turned down by every university and
           government agency under the sun.
           Nobody's going to gamble that kind of
           money on your hunch.
                         
          Holloway deflates. Watts winces. This is a bloodbath.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           Nobody but me.
                          (HE GRINS)
           I've read your research.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           That's impossible. Our research is-
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Quantum encoded on secure servers,
           yeah. We have an A.I. division, you
           should know. Doing impressive things.
           (he leans across the desk)
           I know which star you're wishing on.
                         
          The scientists stare at Weyland.
                         
                          WATTS
           You're bluffing.
           12.
                         
                         
                          WEYLAND
           Zeta Two Reticuli.
                         
          He regards their shocked faces with satisfaction.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           You know how I got this rich? I ask
           myself: what does God spend his time
           doing? And I go and do that.
                         
          Watts laughs incredulously. Stifles it. Weyland's not joking.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           Biotechnology was good to me. Fusion
           power. Lately doing well with gravity
           systems.
                         
          He swivels his chair toward the window. Earth shines outside.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           But what's the first thing God did?
                         
                          WATTS
           He made the Heaven and the Earth.
                         
          Weyland jabs a finger at her like she's won a carnival prize.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           That's what I'm talking about. You
           left out my favorite part. The piece
           about Earth. DAVID.
                         
                          DAVID
           For eons, Earth's climate swung from
           hothouse to ice age. Explosions of
           life, then mass extinctions. But
           twelve thousand years ago the swings
           stopped. The Holocene Epoch began - a
           period of anomalous tranquility. The
           rise of civilization began only then.
                         
          Holloway and Watts stare at DAVID with new appreciation.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           That's right.
                         
                          WATTS
           And that change coincides with a visit
           by the Engineers. They didn't just
           change us. They changed our world.
                         
                          WEYLAND
           That's the piece I mean. Engineering
           Earth. God stuff.
           13.
                         
                         
          He swivels back to his desk. Rummages in a drawer.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           My people checked your science. They
           say it's solid.
                         
          He pulls a thick contract out. Drops it in front of Holloway.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           I'll give you your expedition. Ship
           and crew, supplies, support. One
           condition.
                         
          Holloway picks up the contract with the cautious joy of a man
          double-checking a lottery ticket. His voice is husky:
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           What's that?
                         
                          WEYLAND
           You get the discovery. Control of the
           site. But any technology you find?
           Anything at all. That's mine.
                         
          Holloway reaches out slowly and picks up the contract.
          Riffles the pages of small-print legalese.
                         
                          WEYLAND (CONT'D)
           You take DAVID with you. My eyes and
           ears. And Vickers...you're going too.
                         
          Vickers stares at Weyland in shock.
                         
                         
                         WHITE LANDSCAPE
                         
          A glittering formation of white crystals. Diamond on diamond.
                         
          The structures grow more complex as the view widens. Leaves
          and branches of crystal. A shimmering field of white jewels.
                         
          A landscape of white crystals, smooth as snow.
                         
                         
          EXT. DEEP SPACE
                         
          A black void shot with stars, far from any sun.
                         
          A sturdy prospecting ship forges through space, travel-worn
          but built to last. It carries the Weyland Industries logo.
          The name painted on its hull is MAGELLAN.
           14.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
                         
          The ship's nerve center and control room. Six control
          stations, empty and quiet. Interior lights dimmed to blue.
                         
          The entire forward bulkhead of the Bridge is a window: wall
          to wall, floor to ceiling.
                         
          At the window stands the android DAVID.
                         
          He gazes at the cosmos with an expression of utter serenity.
          After a long moment he turns away. Massive shutters close
          over the window as he walks off.
                         
                         
                         CORRIDOR
                         
          DAVID walks the ship's long central corridor. The ship is
          silent. The lights dimmed to blue. He is alone.
                         
                         
                         HYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT
                         
          A long steel room containing a dozen plexiglass sarcophagi,
          six on each side. Sleep freezers. Inside each freezer: the
          shadowy shape of a human body rimed with frost.
                         
          DAVID walks through the compartment, surveying the sleepers.
                         
                         
                         WORKROOM
                         
          DAVID sits at a display table, moving intricate technical
          documents across the surface with waves of his hands.
                         
          His eyes intent on his work. If he is reading, then he`s
          reading at a speed no human could match.
                         
                         
                         WHITE LANDSCAPE
                         
          We pull away from the frosted crystalline horizon, the smooth
          white curves like snowy fields. Form becomes clear.
                         
          It's the body of a woman. It's Watts.
                         
                         
          INT. HYPERSLEEP FREEZER
                         
          Watts lies asleep in her underwear in a plexiglass freezer.
          Pale. Frost on her skin. Venus sculpted in ice. There are IV
          lines in her elbows and ankles.
           15.
                         
                         
          Shapes move into view beyond her, outside the freezer. FACES.
          Pressed to the glass.
                         
                         
                         HYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT
                         
          All of the freezers are open and empty, save two. Holloway
          lies in one. In the next, Watts. Three men in blue coveralls
          crouch beside Watts's freezer, staring inside.
                         
          They are DOWNS, 30, a lean fidgety crewman. STILLWELL, 40, a
          sturdy fellow with the geniality of a labrador. And KAMAROV,
          26, whose dark, brooding air belongs to a man twice his age.
                         
                          DOWNS
           Look at that.
                         
          Kamarov opens the lid of Watt's freezer. Leans over her.
          Watts stirs in her sleep, a drowsy angel.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           She wakes up slow.
                         
          Watts wakes to find three men looming above her. Disoriented,
          she pulls away. Tangles her hands in her IV lines.
                         
           HOLLOWAY (O.S.)
           Get out of there!
                         
          Holloway's voice cracks like a whip. The crewmen jump back.
                         
          Holloway sits up in the next freezer over. He yanks the IV
          lines out of his arms and legs. Climbs out of the freezer.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Just looking.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Give us a moment, will you?
                         
          The crewmen file out: Stillwell sheepishly, Downs and Kamarov
          surly. Holloway goes to Watts. Gently removes the IV lines
          from her ankles while she plucks the ones from her arms.
                         
                          WATTS
           I'm out of sorts. Sorry.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Never worry.
                         
          He helps her up.
           16.
                         
                         
          INT. MESS ROOM
                         
          Holloway and Watts sit at a table, both a bit hung over. They
          wear civilian clothes. Warmly dressed, they still look cold.
                         
          They nurse mugs of coffee and nibble packaged snack bars.
          Watts hunches over, shivering.
                         
                          WATTS
           My head's buzzing.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           You just slept two and a half years.
           It'll pass.
                         
                          WATTS
           Like you've done this before.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I've read all about it.
                         
          Two ship's officers enter the room wearing blue coveralls
          with rank insignia: GLASSE, 45, a stocky man with thick black
          hair, and BRICK, 50, a bald man with a bristling mustache.
                         
          They look at Watts and Holloway with little pleasure.
                         
                          BRICK
           Sleep okay?
                         
                          WATTS
           Yes, thanks...
                         
                          GLASSE
           Captain'll see you now.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - CAPTAIN'S WARDROOM
                         
          CAPTAIN JANEK, 45, sits at his desk. With his bristling beard
          and powerful build he has a swashbuckling look, like the
          captain of a whaling ship.
                         
          Holloway and Watts sit on a steel bench in front of him.
                         
          He sits scanning his orders: a plastic packet with Weyland
          Industries logos, cracked open. Watermarked papers inside.
                         
                          JANEK
           Zeta Two Reticuli was surveyed
           already. A hundred years ago.
                         
                          WATTS
           By an unmanned probe. Very crude.
           17.
                         
                         
                          JANEK
           No Earthlike planets.
                         
                          WATTS
           No.
                         
                          JANEK
           So what are you looking for?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Proof of the Engineers' existence.
                         
                          WATTS
           Confirmation of Professor Holloway's
           theories would change everything.
           There'd be science before Holloway and
           science after.
                         
          Janek rubs his face wearily with his hands.
                         
                          JANEK
           Your ticket. I'll put the ship where
           you want. Run your scans.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Captain, your crew's been up for a
           week. We could've used the time. Why'd
           you wait to wake us?
                         
                          JANEK
           Better for discipline.
           (off their silence)
           Men ship out as prospectors for one
           reason: the percentage. Find a gold
           mine or a habitable planet, and you're
           set for life.
           (he laughs bitterly)
           But this contract says no percentage.
           No bounty. Just triple pay. The men
           aren't happy.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           You unhappy too?
                         
                          JANEK
           I'm always unhappy.
                         
          He stands. Presses his palm against a wall panel. A safe
          opens. He pulls out a massive pistol in a gunbelt. Tosses the
          orders into the safe. Lays the gun atop them and locks it up.
           18.
                         
                         
                         SCIENTISTS' CABIN
                         
          Holloway and Watts take possession of their cabin: a simple
          but spacious room with twin beds and a window to the stars.
                         
          They drop duffel bags on the bed.
                         
          Holloway surveys the arrangement. Frowns. He releases the
          magnets that lock the beds down. Slides the beds together.
                         
                         
          INT. SCIENTISTS' WORKROOM - DAY
                         
          Holloway and Watts set up their workspace - a central display
          table and huge display surfaces on the walls. Fascinating
          documents slide under their fingertips: an Engineer alphabet.
          Ancient art. Climate and genetic data.
                         
          DAVID appears in the doorway.
                         
                          WATTS
           DAVID. I wondered when we'd see you.
                         
                          DAVID
           I trust your database is in order. I
           set it up myself.
                         
                          WATTS
           All's well, I think.
                         
          DAVID turns to go. Hesitates in the doorway.
                         
                          DAVID
           I should tell you: the time you spent
           sleeping, I spent studying your
           research.
                         
          Holloway and Watts look at the android, his words sinking in.
                         
                          WATTS
           You studied our work for two and a
           half years.
                         
                          DAVID
           It's quite a data set.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           So you've seen everything. Well. What
           do you think?
                         
          DAVID glances over the documents displayed around the room.
           19.
                         
                         
                          DAVID
           Your hypothesis is...bold. The
           audacity of it. Your climate data's
           undeniable: the Holocene Epoch was
           engineered. Dr. Watts, your genetic
           studies are equally conclusive. Pulses
           of cultural change are harder to
           prove, but even there your case is
           strong. I believe in your "Engineers."
                         
                         
                         BREAK ROOM
                         
          A utilitarian sitting room. Steel benches and table bolted to
          the deck. Seated here are two Weyland Industries technicians:
                         
          ANDREW CHANCE, 50, a stocky computer engineer with a genial
          bearing and a bristling salt-and-pepper mustache.
                         
          MONA RAVEL, 45, a dour, rangy woman with a plain face, her
          hair pulled severely back. A physicist and chemist.
                         
          They wear black Weyland Industries jackets. They radiate
          intelligence and competence. These are pros.
                         
          DAVID leads Holloway and Watts past the break room. Holloway
          spots the technicians. Strides in to greet them.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Weyland Industries! Mr. Chance. Ms.
           Ravel. You remember Dr. Watts.
                         
          Watts and the technicians exchange greetings.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           About the materials I gave you. Some
           of the technical aspects...
                         
                          CHANCE
           We'll handle our end of the job.
                         
                          RAVEL
           If there is a job.
                         
          Holloway blinks at her. Chance explains, not unkindly:
                         
                          CHANCE
           We only have a job if you find
           something.

                         CORRIDOR
                         
          Holloway and Watts follow the imperturbable DAVID down a
          steel corridor to Vickers's cabin door.
                         
                         
                         VICKERS'S SUITE
                         
          An open-plan cabin like an urban loft apartment. Watts and
          Holloway follow DAVID inside. Vickers rises to meet them.
                         
          The walls are industrial steel - but the floors are lushly
          carpeted, the furniture opulent. A king-sized bed, a mahogany
          desk, a dining table.
                         
          Gleaming machines ensure Vickers never need step outside: a
          private hypersleep freezer, an autokitchen, a medical pod.
                         
                          WATTS
           Is that a Pauling medical pod? There's
           only ten of those things on Earth! I
           guess nine, now.
                         
                          VICKERS
           I told Mr. Weyland I wouldn't
           compromise my standard of living. He
           accommodated me.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I know, I had to cut my manifest. This
           used to be the number four cargo bay.
                         
                          VICKERS
           What can I do for you, Professor?
                         
          Holloway gestures with the slate he's brought with him.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We're about to reach the system
           periphery. I thought you'd want to see
           the search protocols we -
                         
                          VICKERS
           No. I was set to be the next CEO of
           Weyland Industries. Then you came
           along and sold Mr. Weyland on...this.
           So here I am. Out of the running.
           I'll go where I'm told. But don't ask
           me to play along.
                         
                          WATTS
           But when you get back...
           21.
                         
                         
                          VICKERS
           I'll be five years behind the curve.
           Out of touch. Over.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           You might make the discovery of the
           ages.
                         
          Vickers looks at him as if she's dealing with a child.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           You don't believe in what we're doing.
                         
                          VICKERS
           Mr. Weyland believes. That's enough.
                         
          She walks them toward the door. Interview's over.
                         
                          VICKERS (CONT'D)
           Now we're out of communication, you
           can tell the crew what we're doing.
                         
                          WATTS
           They don't know? They volunteered.
                         
                          VICKERS
           They volunteered blind. Classified
           job, triple pay.
                         
                         
                         CARGO BAY
                         
          The crew - Brick, Glasse, Stillwell, Downs, and Kamarov - sit
          on crates in an improvised lecture hall. Holloway and Watts
          in front of them. Janek at the back of the room.
                         
          A hologram shows ancient images of divine visitations. The
          crew is visibly spooked.
                         
                          DOWNS
           Aliens.
                         
                          GLASSE
           You shitting me?
                         
          Stillwell is staring at the frightening images: gods and
          titans towering over mortals.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I think all our mythologies are race-
           memories of the Engineers. Horus the
           Sun God. Prometheus bringing fire from
           heaven. A pillar of fire, a pillar of
           smoke. The Engineers are the gods.
           22.
                         
                         
          Kamarov stiffens, smelling blasphemy.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           The mythology gods maybe. God is God.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Kamarov. Let him talk.
                         
          Stillwell's staring unhappily at the ancient images: gods
          towering over mortals, inhuman and terrifying.
                         
                          STILLWELL (CONT'D)
           So we're going to meet these things?
                         
                          WATTS
           We probably won't meet anyone. You'd
           expect a star-traveling race to
           generate radio or laser signals.
           Fusion drives and gravity drives have
           clear signatures. But Zeta Two
           Reticuli is silent. And the Engineers
           have gone missing on Earth.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           By the pattern, they should've come to
           Earth seventeen centuries ago. And
           again six centuries ago. But no sign.
           After twelve thousand years...they
           stopped coming.
                         
                          BRICK
           Why?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Exactly. Why?
                         
                          JANEK
           "My God, my God, why have you forsaken
           me?"
                         
          They turn. Janek grins at Holloway across the cargo bay.
                         
                          JANEK (CONT'D)
           Is that the question you've come light-
           years to answer?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Only my first question. I have many.

          EXT. MAGELLAN (ZETA2 RETICULI SYSTEM)
                         
          The Magellan arrives at the periphery of the system. A
          distant star like Earth's Sun, surrounded by orbiting
          planets: mere sparks at this distance.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
                         
          Outside the vast Bridge window, the star Zeta2 Reticuli
          burns, a cold beacon in the night. Downs, Glasse and Brick
          sit at consoles. Janek paces in front of the window.
                         
          Holloway and Watts enter - and gape at the view. Janek grins
          at their reaction.
                         
                          JANEK
           Welcome to Zeta Two Reticuli. Edge of

          EXT. MAGELLAN (ZETA2 RETICULI SYSTEM)
                         
          The Magellan opens its eyes: two immense telescopes emerge
          from the ship. Irises open to expose huge lenses.
                         
          Antennae deploy: unfurling like wings, gleaming and vast.
          Sifting vacuum for any whisper of information.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
                         
          Outside the window, the planets orbiting Zeta2 Reticuli are
          no more than bright stars.

           Overlay.
                         
          A heads-up display appears, overlaid on the glass. The sun is
          labeled ZETA2 RETICULI. Markers point out the planets and
          trace the ellipses of their orbits.
                         
          Like magic, the planets swell into colorful orbs, each
          labeled: Alpha, Beta, Gamma...
                         
                          DOWNS
           Seven planets. Two hot rocks, two gas
           giants, three snowballs. Nothing
           Earthlike.
                         
          Watts grins at Holloway, eyes shining.

          A river of data floods the display, bathing the watchers'
          faces with light: Chemical compounds, magnetic field lines,
          lunar orbits, topographical data.

          The Magellan retracts its vast antennae and telescopes.
                         
          The engines fire: the ship rockets toward the gas giant
          Epsilon and its mysterious moon.

          Leaving the Bridge, Holloway and Watts find themselves
          walking aft alongside DAVID.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           DAVID. Enjoy the show?
                         
                          DAVID
           I don't know that I "enjoy" things.
           It was informative.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           It was, it was.

           You know, I've seen more convincing
           humanoid robots.
                         
          Watts smiles, watching Holloway's sport. DAVID's speech never
          varies from its agreeable tone.
                         
                          DAVID
           My design's not intended to convince.
           Simulating humanity is a complex task
           that diverts resources. My designers
           dispensed with that burden to optimize
           for intelligence.
                         
                          WATTS
           Why look like a man at all? Why not be
           a box on wheels?
                         
                          DAVID
           Being shaped like you, I can use
           spaces and equipment designed for you.
           But I'm not so limited. I hear
           frequencies you can't hear. I see
           wavelengths of light invisible to you.
           I move faster. Exert greater force.
                         
          The scientists look at DAVID in wonder.
                         
                          WATTS
           You see yourself as a superman.
                         
                          DAVID
           No.
                         
          He turns his unearthly eyes on them.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           Not a man at all.

          Holloway and Watts lie on their bed in their clothes - her
          head on his chest.
                         
                          WATTS
           What if they're really there?
           (off his confusion)
           The Engineers. They could be there.
           Waiting for us. What then?
                         
          He laughs.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Then all my dreams come true.

          The Magellan has arrived.
                         
          LV-426 is a gray moon shrouded in clouds. Behind it looms its
          father planet Epsilon, a lurid gas giant banded in red and
          gold, half swallowed in darkness.
                         
          The Magellan dives into a forced orbit around LV-426: rockets
          firing continually, nose pointed down. Telescopes, sensors
          and antennae sprout once more from its hull.

          Everyone's here. Janek and his crew seated at control
          stations. Holloway and Watts standing on the foredeck.
          Vickers and DAVID. Ravel and Chance.
                         
          LV-426 fills the window: a gray orb of mist. The ground
          invisible beneath the clouds. Sporadic lightning flickers.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Start with passive systems. We're
           uninvited guests. Let's be quiet.
                         
          That thought sends a nervous shiver through the others. Janek
          nods at Glass and Brick. They study their instruments.
                         
                          BRICK
           A lot of electromag, all random.

          Kamarov shakes his head fearfully. Crosses himself.

           Icecaps at the poles. Frozen methane.
           Cold down there.
                         
          The display fills with light: a wave of terrain data sweeping
          across the moon's surface as the Magellan orbits.

          The Magellan sweeps on around the gray moon, radar emitters
          humming, antennae and telescopes open wide. The gas giant
          Epsilon fills the sky behind LV-426.
                         
          As it circles, the Magellan launches SATELLITES. Metal motes
          hurled into polar orbits around the Moon.

          The landing engines roar. Wind screams over the hull. Mist
          whips across the Bridge window, obscuring any view. Watts
          reaches out. Squeezes Holloway's hand.
                         
          The Magellan breaks through the cloud cover into clear air.
                         
          Below the ship, a vast and eerie landscape is revealed. Wide
          valleys mottled with thin dark ground cover. Barren crags and
          spires of rock. Waterless and wind-swept.
                         
          Watts gasps. Stares at the grim and foreign country.

           Look there.
                         
          Janek expertly swings the Magellan sideways. The Magellan
          circles the mount, nose pointed inward.
                         
          It revolves below the watchers: flat faces, clean edges - but
          cracked and timework. It glitters like coal.

          A second oddly regular peak, even more decrepit than the
          first, sits on the brink of a vast canyon. Landslides have
          eaten at its edges.
                         
          The Magellan purrs over the landscape, dwarfed by the scale.
          Drops between the canyon walls to circle the mount.

          In the middle of the central crater - a huge angular peak,

          points of the compass. Some connect to smaller craters.
                         
          One canal peters out, flush with the desert floor.
                         
          The Magellan lands at the end of this canal - half a
          kilometer from the central crater.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
                         
          They stare out the window, down the wide straight canal at
          the pyramidal peak in the distance. Holloway looks around.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           All right. Let's move.
                         
          Janek glances at his instruments.
                         
                          JANEK
           There's only six hours of daylight
           left. Maybe you should hold off.
                         
          Watts looks at him incredulously.
                         
                          WATTS
           We've got that outside the windows and
           you want to wait `til tomorrow?
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK - DAY
                         
          The expedition party emerges from the airlocks - riding CARGO
          ROVERS, robotic vehicles just smart enough to carry their
          owners around, or follow along behind them.
                         
          The rovers' beds are loaded with gear; the explorers ride on
          running-board seats. All wear space suits.
                         
          Holloway drives the first rover with Watts beside him.
          Stillwell, Kamarov, and Downs in back.
                         
          DAVID drives the second rover with Milburn, Fifield, Chance
          and Ravel aboard.
                         
                          WATTS
           The air here will kill you, so keep an
           eye on your supply and watch your
           seals. Pathogen tests are clean.
           33.
                         
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Move slowly. Stay together. Don't
           touch anything. Things may be more
           fragile than they look - or more
           dangerous. There might be technologies
           operating here we don't understand.
                         
          The crew of the Magellan exchange uneasy looks. Still
          uncertain what to think.
                         
                         
          EXT. ENTRY CANAL - DAY
                         
          The trench grows deeper as they follow it toward the central
          crater - the pyramidal peak framed ahead of them like a
          monument on a triumphal avenue.
                         
          They cross a perpendicular canal. Glancing left and right,
          they see smaller craters with central peaks of their own.
                         
          They pass through the shadow of a high promontory of stone
          atop one bank of the canal.
                         
          We see - and they do not - that the far side of the
          promontory has a Sphinx-like FACE of monumental size. So
          eroded that its artificial nature is uncertain.
                         
                         
          EXT. CENTRAL CRATER - DAY
                         
          The crater floor is a vast enclosed plain. The pyramidal
          mount looms in the center - colossal in scale.
                         
          The rovers enter the crater, trailing plumes of dust. They
          circle the pyramid.
                         
          On the south face of the pyramid, an IRIS DOOR of many blades
          stands, easily fifty feet high. Seemingly made of the same
          basaltic stone as the pyramid itself. A huge construction.
                         
          The explorers are transfixed in awe. All skepticism banished.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Tell me that's a natural formation.
                          (HE GRINS)
           Undeniable proof of alien
           civilization. You were here on this
           day, thirty-one December, year of our
           Lord 2172. History will remember your
           names.
                         
          Watts stares at the iris. Its bottom-most blade is broken; it
          lies in rubble at the foot of the door. A dark knife-like
          aperture leads into the pyramid.
           34.
                         
                         
                          WATTS
           The door's open.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
                         
          Janek and Vickers watch the explorers' progress in the main
          holographic display: their tinny voices echoing over the comm
          link. At the sight of the huge iris door in the pyramid, both
          Janek and Vickers stare in blank astonishment.
                         
                          JANEK
           Son of a bitch. They were right.
                         
          He turns to stare out the window at the pyramid's peak.
                         
          Vickers turns and slips out of the Bridge. Hurries away.
                         
                         
                         VICKERS'S SUITE
                         
          Vickers strides through her quarters. On the far wall there
          are two small doors.
                         
          She opens the first: steps into a luxurious bathroom. Washes
          a pill down with a tumbler of water.
                         
          Returns to her cabin and opens the second small door.
                         
                         
          SECRET ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A chamber walled with steel panels. A deep hum of ventilation
          and power: there's a lot of technology here.
                         
          She turns to a console beside the door. Flips a row of
          switches. The hum deepens. Hidden mechanisms stir to life.
                         
                         
          EXT. PYRAMID - IRIS DOOR
                         
          On foot, explorers press inside - Holloway and Watts in the
          lead. Their flashlights cut into the gloom.
                         
          The robotic rovers follow them: their six-wheeled chassis
          with independent suspension trundling over the rubble
          barrier, sure-footed as goats.
                         
                         
          INT. PYRAMID - ANTECHAMBER
                         
          Dark and cavernous. Weak daylight slants in.
           35.
                         
                         
          The explorers press into the darkness on foot - the cargo
          rovers' headlights flashing on. They move through a dark
          cathedral space, empty and bare.
                         
          DAVID looks around in fascination, his eyes raking the walls.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Jocelyn. Here.
                         
          His voice trembles with urgency. He shines light on the rock.
          Symbols engraved on the dark surface. Dots, lines and arcs.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           The writing of the Engineers.
           Conclusive connection.
                         
          DAVID stands beside them. Stares at the alien writing.
                         
                          DAVID
           Congratulations, Professor Holloway.
                         
          Watts passes her light over the writing, recording it. They
          move on into the dark.
                         
          DAVID lingers. Reading.
                         
                         
          PYRAMID - VARIOUS PASSAGES
                         
          The interior is a labyrinth. Corridors big as railway tunnels
          intersecting and diverging.
                         
          The explorers wend their way deeper. Several carry map units,
          whose holographic displays render three-dimensional maps that
          expand as they explore.
                         
                         
          INT. PYRAMID - MASSIVE CHAMBER
                         
          Holloway leads the explorers deeper into the complex. The
          motors of the cargo rovers whine and growl.
                         
          DAVID trails the others, eyes raking the blank walls as if he
          sees something there. He reaches out. Passes his hand through
          the air as if grasping a cobweb.
                         
          A STRANGE RUMBLING NOISE sounds down the corridor, freezing
          them. Holloway sweeps his light that way. The sound comes
          again: a DEMONIC VOICE speaking some unearthly language.
                         
          Watts looks at Holloway - but his eyes are focused on the
          dark ahead. He moves forward. A beat. The others follow.
           36.
                         
                         
          An APPARITION appears before them. A PALE, LUMINOUS GIANT
          fifteen feet tall, with hollow eyes and a grotesque snout. It
          strides toward them. Speaks in a sonorous voice.
                         
          Pandemonium.
                         
          Watts backpedals involuntarily. Seeing Holloway stand his
          ground, she reaches out to him in a panic.
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin. Martin!
                         
          But Holloway doesn't budge. Stares at the Apparition in
          fascination. Everyone else scatters - except DAVID, who
          stands stock-still by the wall.
                         
          Watts watches as the Apparition walks right up to Holloway.
          Disappears with a sizzle of static as Holloway experiences
          the creature passing through him.
                         
          Silence. Watts returns to Holloway's side. Stillwell and
          Downs are huddled on the deck. Milburn and Fifield have
          fallen back down the passageway.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           Christ. Christ!
                         
                          RAVEL
           It wasn't real.
                         
                          MILBURN
           We all saw it.
                         
          Unseen by the others, DAVID reaches out and repeats his
          gesture in the air.
                         
          A rumbling sound down the corridor, as before. Moments later,
          the Apparition appears round the corner again. They stand
          their ground: the ghostly giant strides toward them, exactly
          as before, and disappears with a crackle.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Recording?
                         
                          FIFIELD
           No more. I'm out.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Fifield. Get a grip.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           I'm a prospector. You find a load of
           bauxite, I'm your man. But not this.

                          MILBURN
           I should go with him. Buddy system.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
                          (DISGUSTED)
           Fine.
                         
          He hauls a heavy rolling case out of the cargo rover.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           You can deploy the drones. Drop them
           in the first or second nexus on your
           way back.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           Give us a rover.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           And half our gear? It's no more than a
           mile. You can walk it.
                         
          Sulking, Milburn takes the rolling case. The remaining
          explorers watch Fifield and Milburn backtrack into the dark.
                         
                         
          CORE CHAMBER DOOR
                         
          Holloway and Watts lead their party up to a massive door,
          sealed tight. In design and scale, undeniably important.
          Holloway glances at his map.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           This should lead to the core of the
           pyramid.
                         
                          WATTS
           Jack it open? Or cut through?
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Let's do as little damage as we can.
                         
          Ravel waves a sensor over the wall.

           There's power. Current flowing in the

          Chance begins to inspect the frame of the door.
                         
                          CHANCE
           Maybe we can hack it. Has to be a

          DAVID looks as if they fail to see something obvious. He
          points at a spot on the wall beside the massive slab.

          Janek stands at the window, looking down the long canal at
          the distant pyramid.
                         
          The ship's powerful imaging systems stream data: stereoscopic
          feeds from the explorers' flashlights; a map that grows as
          they explore. The maze under the pyramid drawn in light.
                         
          A globe of LV-426 blooms with terrain and weather data as the
          satellites feed the ship information.
                         
          Vickers appears at Janek's side.
                         
                          JANEK
           Director. Taking an interest?
                         
                          VICKERS
           It's my operation, isn't it?
                         
                         
          INT. PYRAMID - HUB
                         
          A junction where multiple passageways converge.
                         
          Milburn and Fifield trudge into the space, trundling the
          probe cases behind them. Tunnels lead away in all directions.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           What do you think?
                         
                          MILBURN
           Grand Central Station.
                         
          They open the case. CAMERA PROBES tumble out: spheres the
          size of softballs, studded with lenses and sensors.
                         
          Tiny lights come on as the probes awaken. They roll off,
          dispersing to investigate every passageway. Bumbling into
          walls and pillars, reversing. Exploring by random walk.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           Let's check the feed. Gimme the map.
                         
                          MILBURN
           You had the map unit.
           39.

           You don't have the map?
                         
          They stare at each other.
                         
                          MILBURN
           Are you serious?
                         
          He trudges back the way they came, in disgust.
                         
                          MILBURN (CONT'D)
           Come on.
                         
                         
          CORE CHAMBER DOOR
                         
          DAVID stands on top of one of the cargo rovers. He's cut a
          hole in the wall beside the door, high up: he works with
          probes in the mechanisms inside.
                         
                          DAVID
           Looks like a three-state switch.
                         
          A deep BOOM, echoing inside the ancient walls. Nothing moves.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           One moment...
                         
          He moves a control. BOOM. The immense door begins to rise.
                         
                         
          PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER
                         
          The vast central chamber of the pyramid. An immense space.
                         
          Holloway walks in, his flashlight searching. Watts hurries
          after. The others follow, rovers tagging along.
                         
          A colossal structure stands in the center of the chamber,
          convoluted and strange. A mechanism. Chasms yawn in the floor
          all around it, their depths lost in darkness.
                         
          The explorers enter, rovers in train. They lift their eyes:
          hundreds of feet above them they see the pyramid's apex from
          within. A SHAFT OF DIFFUSE LIGHT penetrates the pyramid
          somewhere near the peak.
                         
                          RAVEL
           This is something, now.
                         
                          DAVID
           Yes. Yes, it is.
           40.
                         
                         
          The android's awareness is keyed to a high pitch. He seems to
          read meaning in the inscrutable structures all around them.
                         
          Holloway hauls a drone case out of the rover. Two dozen
          spherical drones tumble out, wake up, and roll off into the
          dark. They are nimble, hopping curbs and skirting chasms.
                         
          Watts looks at her atmosphere sensor. Astonished.
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin. This air's breathable.
                         
          The core chamber brightens as the sun outside moves into
          alignment. The shaft of light perfectly centered.
                         
          A vast SIGH as if the pyramid itself is breathing.
                         
          A fat drop of water falls on Watts's glove. She looks up in
          surprise. Another falls on her visor. And then it's raining
          inside the pyramid.
                         
          Water trickles into the chasms, inundating the mossy growths
          that cling to the walls.
                         
          Holloway looks at Watts with a little boy's grin.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Miracles and wonders!
                         
          The shaft of light moves on. The core chamber dims slightly.
          The rainfall stops as suddenly as it started.
                         
          The explorers follow the main path around the periphery of
          the chamber, past a gallery of mysterious machines.
                         
          There are marvels in the shadows. Cells in the dark apparatus
          open on startling deposits of color: translucent alabaster
          flutes. Honeycombs of pure gold. Matrices of crystal.
                         
          Watts waves a scanning instrument as she walks.
                         
                          WATTS
           Intense field readings. Huge power
           sources here.
                         
                         
          PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER - RAMP
                         
          They arrive at a wide opening in the floor. A strange ramp
          curves downward - its floor segmented and saw-toothed.
                         
          A bafflement: it's not a staircase. Not an escalator. No
          moving parts. No rails or tracks.
           41.
                         
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Space below us. A big space.
                         
          As they stand looking, a probe bumbles up to the opening and
          goes bounding down the ramp. Watts laughs.
                         
                          WATTS
           How does this work?
                         
          She begins to descend on foot. Holloway behind her.
          Stillwell, Downs, and Kamarov grudgingly follow.
                         
          But DAVID looks away across the cavernous chamber - fixated
          on the central crystal. He beckons Ravel and Chance to follow
          him, and walks away.
                         
          Ravel and Chance look at each other in astonishment.
          Uncertainly, they follow DAVID.
                         
                         
                         LOWER PASSAGE
                         
          Holloway, Watts, and the crewmen reach the bottom of the
          ramp, breathing hard. A cargo rover trundles down after them.
                         
          They look back up. The ramp above them is empty.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Ravel. Chance. Where've you gone?
           DAVID! Where are you?
           (to Watts, indignantly)
           They didn't come down!
                         
          But Watts is staring through an archway. Transfixed.
                         
                          WATTS
           Look.
                         
          She walks in. Holloway follows.
                         
                         
                         CONTROL CONCOURSE
                         
          A passageway punctuated by alcoves as big as band-shells.
                         
          In each alcove stands a biomechanical apparatus - shaped from
          the same dark material as the pyramid itself. Each apparatus
          implies by its design that a giant is meant to fit inside it.
                         
          Holloway and Watts walk the concourse, playing their lights
          over the dark machinery. Their footsteps echo.
           42.
                         
                         
                          WATTS
           Do you see, the size of them? Like
           that ghost we saw...
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           It wasn't a ghost. Where are the
           others? I don't want to go back up.
                         
          Watts fiddles with her suit's comm controls. Listening.
                         
                          WATTS
           They switched to channel three. I hear
           them talking. They're okay.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           We should stay together.
                         
                         
          INT. PYRAMID - BLIND CORRIDOR
                         
          Milburn and Fifield are lost. They bumble through the dark.
                         
                          MILBURN
           This is not the same place.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           It is! That is the same freaky thing
           we saw before.
                         
          He points at a detail of the architecture.
                         
                          MILBURN
           No it's not! The other one was more...
           sort of...fuck it.

                         INTERSECTION
                         
          Holloway and Watts round a corner and stop in their tracks.
          Kamarov, Stillwell, and Downs almost run into them.
                         
          The scientists stand frozen.
                         
          In front of them lies a dead giant. An ENGINEER.
                         
          If he were standing, he would be fifteen feet tall.
                         
          He is roughly human in shape. Barrel-chested. Withered to the
          bones. There are bulky protrusions fused with his flesh: hard
          to say whether they are equipment or parts of his body.
           43.
                         
                         
          His head, lolling to one side, is severed from his body.
                         
          His eyes seem to be covered by goggles; but if so then the
          goggles are fused with his skull. An elephantine proboscis,
          severed now, once connected to a protrusion on his hip.
                         
          The giant lies frozen in a convulsion of agony. His jaw
          gaping in a silent scream. His corpse is marred by hideous
          wounds: slashes that cut through bone.
                         
          The explorers move closer. Speechless.

           I know. Look.
                         
          He lifts his light. Beyond the dead giant, a vision of Hell:
                         
          A dozen DEAD ENGINEERS lie heaped against a sealed door.
          Twisted in postures of torment, murdered in the attempt to
          escape. All bear horrific wounds.
                         
          Scene of an ancient massacre.

          Watts joins Holloway beside the dead Engineer. Touches the
          corpse in her own turn. It's hard as stone: ossified. She
          traces the ancient, terrible wounds.

          EXT. SPACE - LV-426 ORBIT
                         
          One of the Magellan's satellites hurtles along, high above
          the moon's atmosphere. It passes over the terminator line
          between the night side and day side.
                         
          Through the clouds below, a lightning-laced storm front rolls
          across LV-426 like a wave.

          Rising winds pluck at the ground cover outside the window.
          Janek turns from the view to look at the holographic globe.
                         
                          JANEK
           All hands. Back to the ship. We got a
           mean storm front rolling in. I repeat.

                          JANEK
           Holloway! I got two-hundred-kilometer
           winds with airborne silica and enough
           static to fry your suits. Get your
           asses back here! Now!
                         
                         
          EXT. CENTRAL CRATER - DUSK
                         
          Holloway races their cargo rover away from the pyramid,
          wheels kicking up dust.
                         
          Watts rides in back, securing a bulky payload under a tarp on
          the cargo deck. Stillwell, Downs, and Kamarov clinging
          miserably beside her. Watts looks back:
                         
          A massive storm front chases them. A tidal wave of dust shot
          through with lightning. Gale-force winds tear at the ground.
          Lightning lashes the pyramid and the crater wall.
                         
          Reaching the Magellan, they see the other rover already in
          the airlock lift. DAVID, Ravel, and Chance aboard.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK LIFT
                         
          Holloway roars into the lift at speed, the rover skidding
          almost into the opposite wall. Watts leaps down.
                         
          The storm wall catches up to them. Screaming winds rip
          through the lift. Dust fills the air. Visibility plunges
          toward zero.
                         
                          WATTS
           Help me unload!
           46.
                         
                         
          She pulls at the tarp. It tears halfway free - and fills with
          wind, snapping taut with such violence that Watts is hurled
          out into the storm.
                         
                         
          IN THE GALE
                         
          Watts tumbles helplessly: a leaf in the wind. CRASHES into a
          metal stanchion. Clings, the wind knocked out of her. Ears
          ringing. Nothing but static in her headset.
                         
                         
          IN THE LIFT
                         
          Holloway stares in shock at the place where Watts vanished.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Jocelyn!
                         
          With inhuman reflexes DAVID reacts. Grabs a tether. Latches
          it to his suit. Locks it to an anchor point on the wall.
          Dives into the storm. A ballet nearly too fast to follow.
                         
                         
          IN THE GALE
                         
          DAVID lets the wind take him. Skids across the ground,
          controlling his trajectory. He hits the stanchion where Watts
          is lodged with a CLANG as if he were made of iron.
                         
          Watts stares at him in mute astonishment.
                         
          He locks her suit to his. Activates the tether unit's winch.
          It whirs, reeling them in through the hurricane.
                         
                         
          IN THE LIFT
                         
          Holloway and the other crewmen haul Watts and DAVID back
          inside. Holloway and Watts embrace fiercely as the lift rises
          toward the safety of the ship.
                         
          The crewmen bundle the rover's tarp-wrapped cargo into a
          sealed dumbwaiter that rises independently into the ship.

          The explorers strip off space suits.
                         
          Watts pulls her helmet off. Catches DAVID's eye across the
          airlock. Mouths a silent Thank you. He gives her the barest
          nod and vanishes into the ship.
           47.
                         
                         
          The explorers exchange looks. A mood of exuberance and wonder
          prevails now that they're safe home.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Day one.
                         
          Smiles of wonder as what they've seen comes home.
                         
                          DOWNS
           Got to hand it to you, professor. You
           were right. Both of you.

           What's in the tarp? What'd you bring
           back?
                         
          The explorers from Watts and Holloway's party exchange looks
          and burst into laughter.
                         
                          WATTS
           You don't want to know.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Shit. We're two helmets short.
                         
          He points. The lockers labeled MILBURN and FIFIELD stand
          closed. The helmet racks empty. The laughter cuts off.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           They didn't come in!
                         
          They stare at each other, listening to the wind wail outside.

          Fifield hitches up his space suit's crotch uncomfortably.
                         
                          FIFIELD

          A burst of static answers him: Fifield's voice scrambled by
          the storm. Unintelligible.

          All hands present excepting the two missing men. Janek plays
          his squeeze box, its archaic music filling the air. Tired and
          exuberant, the men sway and dance mockingly.
                         
          Holloway has a champagne bottle open in each hand. He fills
          steel cups left and right.

          DAVID stands beside Vickers at her holography terminal. He
          lays his hand on over a signal plate - and the terminal
          lights up with a three-dimensional image.
                         
          The core chamber of the pyramid, from DAVID's point of view.
                         
          It's apparent that DAVID's eyes see more than human eyes do.
          He seems to see heat and electromagnetic energy as well as
          visible light; calibrated readouts are overlaid on the scene.
                         
          The structures in the pyramid are surrounded by complicated
          patterns of energy. This is incomprehensible technology.
                         
                          DAVID
           The core of the pyramid. You see.
                         
          Vickers goes rigid, looking at it: avarice in her eyes.
                         
                          VICKERS
           We're going to protocol two.
                         
                          DAVID
           I understand.
                         
                         
                         LABORATORY
                         
          A high-tech science facility behind glass. Watts and
          Holloway, in lab gloves and smocks, open the dumbwaiter:
           50.
                         
                         
          An ENGINEER'S HEAD rises into view, ghoulish and elephantine.
          Vapor rises from it. A readout blinks: STERILIZED.
                         
          They lift it onto the steel table. It takes both of them.
                         
          They pass scanners over the skull. Images accumulate and
          rotate on the laboratory displays. X-ray and ultrasound.
                         
          Holloway leans close to study an X-ray image. He almost seems
          to see a ghostly second face...
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin. Look.
                         
          She traces the head with an ultrasound probe: under the
          vibrations a seam opens up around the edge of the face.
                         
          She gets a fingertip into the seam. Works with a probe. Pries
          away the long-dead Engineer's mask. It comes free.
                         
          The visage revealed is human, except for its giant scale.
                         
          White-skinned. Earless. Hairless. Withered but beautiful as a
          Greek statue. Eyes closed. An expression of suffering on its
          face. Watts drops the ultrasound probe in shock.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)

                          HOLLOWAY
           We look like them. Genesis 1:27. "And
           God created man in his own image. In
           his own image created He him."
                         
          Vickers and DAVID stand outside the lab window, staring in at
          the god's head. Vickers looks shaken. DAVID, fascinated.
                         
          Watts covers her nose in revulsion. A horrible stench: The
          Engineer head begins to disintegrate in front of them. Flesh
          oozing, skin peeling. Accelerated decay.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           It's breaking down.
                         
                          WATTS
           Formaldehyde!
                         
          Urgently they ransack cabinets and storage rooms. Watts finds
          a clear plastic drum and dumps its contents. Holloway drags
          five-gallon jugs of preservative out of a cabinet.
                         
          DAVID watches through the window, almost amused.
           51.
                         
                         
                          DAVID
           Mortal after all.
                         
          They lift the rotting head into the drum, retching. Fingers
          skidding in putrefaction.
                         
          They pour formaldehyde over it. As soon as the head is
          immersed they rush to strip off their reeking gloves and
          smocks, scrubbing their hands.
                         
          The god's head sits in its murky vat, shedding skin and tofu-
          like chunks of white flesh. The noble face disintegrating.
                         
          Watts and Holloway stare at it, breathing hard from their
          work. Vickers flicks on the intercom from outside the window.
                         
                          VICKERS
           Your cadaver's interesting. But I'm
           more interested in the machinery in
           the pyramid. The core chamber. What do
           you think it does?
                         
          Watts stares at Vickers incredulously.
                         
                          WATTS
           How could anyone know...
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I know what it does.
                         
          Silence. Holloway looks at Vickers wearily, as if he's seen
          this conversation coming. He glances at Watts.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           Think. What we've seen. What we know.
                         
          Watts rises to the challenge. Thinking on her feet.
                         
                          WATTS
           Twenty-four pyramids scattered around
           the moon's equator. Massive power
           supplies. Vents in the walls.
           Atmosphere changes. Breeder tanks...
           (she's got it)
           The pyramids are terraforming
           machines.
                         
          Holloway grins, exuberant. His theory playing out perfectly.
          He doesn't see Vickers stiffen. Her hands curling into fists.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           That's why Earth's ancient cultures
           built pyramids: in imitation of the
           gods.

                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           Twelve thousand years ago, beings from
           the sky set pyramids on the Earth and
           transformed the world. That's what
           they were doing here - before their
           civilization failed.
                         
          Watts stares at the head in its tank. The severed neck.
                         
                          WATTS
           It didn't fail. It was wiped out.
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMBS - INSECT CHAMBER
                         
          Milburn and Fifield have bunked down in a new chamber: they
          slouch against a wall. Milburn sweeps the room with his
          headlamp. Stoops to lift something into the light.
                         
                          MILBURN
           Look at this!
                         
          A CENTIPEDE, three feet long and thick as man's thumb. Its
          hard shell is gray. It has a hammer-head like a shark.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           Jesus! Put it down!
                         
          He leaps back, wild-eyed.
                         
          Milburn laughs at him. Lets the eyeless centipede wind its
          segmented body around his space-suited arm.
                         
          In the flat face, a white vertical slit appears. Changes
          quickly to a horizontal position; opens enough to suggest a
          mouth. Milburn doesn't notice this development.
                         
                          MILBURN
           Relax. Your suit's bug-proof. Hell,
           it's bulletproof.
                         
          The centipede spirals around his arm, glittering, its body
          moving in fluid waves. The blind head quests between his
          fingers. Milburn loses his nerve as the thing's mouth
          suddenly gapes wide as a shark's.
                         
                          MILBURN (CONT'D)
           That's enough.
                         
          He tries to pull it off.
                         
          The centipede locks its segments together and digs in with
          its body. It might as well be made of iron.
           53.
                         
                         
                          MILBURN (CONT'D)
                          (PANICKING)
           Get it off! It's crushing me!
                         
          Fifield pulls out a utility knife. Cuts into the centipede's
          body behind its head.
                         
          A gout of greed ACID spills over Milburn's glove. Smoke rises
          as the acid quickly burns a hole through the material.
                         
          Milburn's shout of astonishment turns to a wail of agony.
                         
                          MILBURN (CONT'D)
           AHH! Help me! Christ!
                         
          The centipede snakes into the smoking hole in the glove.
          Crawls upward into Milburn's suit - toward his head.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - LABORATORY - NIGHT
                         
          Holloway stands studying the data displays: cross-sections of
          the Engineer's skull.
                         
          Watts scrutinizes the head itself, her nose an inch from the
          plastic tank. Not a pretty sight.
                         
          As she watches, a current in the formaldehyde peels away one
          gossamer eyelid. The revealed eye is black as obsidian,
          iridescent like opal. A jewel.
                         
          Fascinated, Watts pulls out a plastic case. Opens it to
          reveal a high-tech control unit with a screen. She pops open
          a plastic capsule: removes a tiny SEED PROBE, smaller than a
          grain of rice. Drops it into the vat.
                         
          Under her guidance, the seed probe swims to the severed neck.
          Burrows into the medulla oblongata toward the brain.
                         
          ON A SCREEN: In the probe's POV the medulla looks like a
          tunnel. The probe climbs along neural channels.
                         
          Another screen shows the probe's progress through the skull.
                         
          Glasse enters. Stands beside Holloway to watch Watts at work.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           You won't get anything. Tissue's too
           degraded. Hmm. Brain chamber's
           massive, even proportionately.
                         
                          WATTS
           Neural paths are still conductive.

          The seed probe reaches the optic nerve of the exposed eye -
          and its POV fills with a vision of glory: a beautiful woman's
          face surrounded by a mystical nimbus of light. An angel.
                         
          Glasse and Holloway gasp. The woman in the blurry vision is
          Watts - as seen by the dead Engineer's eye.
                         
                          GLASSE
           Incredible.
                         
          The image dissolves into noise. Error messages flicker across
          the display. Watts sighs.
                         
                          WATTS
           Formaldehyde's killing the tissue.
                         
          Holloway stares at Watts, awe on his face.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Did you record that?
                         
                          WATTS
           Of course.
                         
                         
          AT A LAB TABLE
                         
          Watts dissects one of the Engineer's eyes - working
          underwater in a shallow tub of preservative. Glasse looks on
          avidly, an unabashed fan.
                         
          Watts wears a pair of magnifying goggles on her forehead -
          the lenses lowering and rising at need.
                         
          She bisects the apple-sized eyeball carefully and extracts
          the hard lens from behind the cornea. Holds the lens up to
          her eye. It is opalescent, almost luminous.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           The lens is where the phase shift
           happens.
                         
          The uncorrected view through the lens is blurry.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           Glasse. I want to look through these
           lenses. Can you seal them and do the
           optical correction?
                         
          Glasse reaches out and plucks the magnifying goggles from
          Watts's forehead. He grins.
                         
                          GLASSE
           Got an idea about that.

          Milburn writhes on the ground, heels drumming frantically
          against the deck. Excruciating screams.
                         
          Fifield kneels over him, helplessly pulling at the tail of
          the centipede - which has all but vanished into Milburn's
          suit. A trickle of scarlet from the hole.
                         
          Fifield is delirious with horror. He clutches at the
          centipede in vain. It slips through his gloves.
                         
          Milburn claws at Fifield, wild-eyed.
                         
                          MILBURN
           Cut off my arm. Cut off my -
                         
          He convulses. Spits blood. The head of the centipede emerges
          between his teeth. He seizes. Choking and dying.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           Jesus Christ!

          INT. CATACOMBS - LONELY PASSAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Fifield stumbles along. Exhausted. Pouring sweat inside his
          suit. He is hopelessly lost. He slams into a resinous
          structure that topples to the floor. Things break.
                         
          He whips his light around in jittery paranoia. Taps at his
          comm controls, getting only static.
                         
          In Fifield's headlamp beam, the blackness is filling with
          motes of light. A blizzard of tiny flying insects.
                         
          SCARABS.

           Anybody, seriously! God damn it!
                         
          Scarabs flit through the darkness around him. They alight on
          his shoulders. Crawl over his visor. Obscuring his vision.
                         
                          FIFIELD (CONT'D)
           Get off!
                         
          He swats at his visor, killing some. The crushed insects
          produce acid that eats into the plexiglass in seconds.

          He twists, craning with his flashlight to inspect himself.
          Brushes scarabs away right and left.
                         
          Acid opens a hole in his visor. Scarabs are inside. Buzzing
          around his head. Fifield freaks out, clawing at his helmet.
                         
          A scarab bites his cheek.
                         
                         
                         FLASH ON:

          As his pupils dilate, breath hissing into his nostrils. His
          expanding body stiffens as if shocked by a powerful electric
          current. He screams. Falls, convulsing.

           You've pried too many arrowheads out
           of old skulls to get squeamish now.
           They've been dead what, eighteen
           hundred years? Two thousand?
                         
                          WATTS
           What could kill them?
                         
          Holloway contemplates the question.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Who knows?
           (he laughs bitterly)
                          (MORE)
           57.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           But I guess we know why they never
           came back to us. Something killed them
           off - back around the time of Christ.
           Maybe He was one of them! A great
           teacher, sent from Heaven? Jesus. The
           last Engineer.
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin, stop!
                         
          She slaps at him. Holloway laughs.
                         
                         
                         BRIDGE
                         
          Janek stands at the Bridge window, staring out into the
          storm. Buffeting clouds and howling winds. The lighthouse
          beams of the Magellan's beacons sweeping through the cloud.
                         
          He plays his squeeze box in the teeth of the storm.
                         
                          JANEK
                          (SINGING)
           You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with
           me...
                         
          Behind him, DAVID appears on the Bridge. Steals across the
          Bridge to a ladder. Descends into the compartment below...
                         
                         
          NAVIGATION COMPUTER ROOM
                         
          DAVID activates the navigation computer terminal: light
          bathes his face. His fingers fly over the keyboard, silently
          and swiftly, with superhuman dexterity.
                         
                          DAVID

          EXT. MAGELLAN - DAWN
                         
          Daylight filters through the clouds. The storm has passed.
          The Magellan sits intact on its landing struts.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - VICKERS'S SUITE - SECRET ROOM - DAWN
                         
          The high-tech room hums at a different frequency now.
          Indicator lights green and ready. Vickers throws switches.
           58.
                         
                         
          Four HIBERNATION PODS slide out of the metal walls. From each
          pod, a muscular SOLDIER rouses from sleep. They are scarred
          and crew-cut. Tough customers. They wake like veterans.
                         
          Their leader sits up and clasps his head with a wince. This
          is CAPTAIN SHEPHERD, a career mercenary who has followed the
          highest paycheck to this strange duty.
                         
                          VICKERS
           Captain Shepherd.
                         
                          SHEPHERD

           Reporting.
                         
          Lydia Vickers. I'm your authority.
                         
                          SHEPHERD (CONT'D)
           Understood.
                         
                          VICKERS
           I'll brief you on the way. We need to
           move.
                         
                          SHEPHERD
           No breakfast?
                         
                         
                         CORRIDOR
                         
          Vickers strides forward. Four soldiers at her heels: Captain
          Shepherd, VIGODA, RAY, and CARD. They walk in unison, their
          boots drumming on the deck.
                         
                         
                         SCIENTISTS' CABIN
                         
          Holloway and Watts lie sleeping. The distant drum of marching
          feet rouses them. Watts frowns at Holloway.
                         
                          WATTS
           What is that?
                         
                         
          E.V.A. ROOM
                         
          The prep room inside the airlocks. A soldier, VIGODA, waits
          there: a slim dark man with an air of calm.
                         
          Holloway and Watts arrive in civilian clothes, perplexed.
           59.
                         
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Where is everybody? We can't -
           (he stops short)
           Who are you?
                         
                          VIGODA
           Captain Janek took his crew out to
           retrieve his missing men. They never
           came in.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           And you are...
                         
                          VIGODA
           Vigoda. Weyland Security detail.
                         
          The scientists are dumbfounded. His presence is impossible.
                         
                          WATTS
           Where'd you come from?
                         
                          VIGODA
           Director's call to brief you on that.
           I'm supposed to escort you to the
           worksite.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Worksite?
                         
          Vigoda glances at a mapping unit.
                         
                          VIGODA
           Haven't been out yet. I understand
           it's in some kind of pyramid.
                         
                         
          CORRIDOR - VICKERS'S CABIN DOOR
                         
          A furious Holloway and Watts, trailed by Vigoda, arrive at
          Vickers's cabin. They are astonished to find Shepherd
          standing guard at the door.
                         
                         
                         VICKERS'S SUITE
                         
          Vickers sits calmly at her desk. Holloway and Watts stand in
          front of her, bristling.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Why wasn't I told about these
           additional personnel?
                         
                          VICKERS
           They're my personnel. On my ship.
           60.
                         
                         
                          WATTS
           What are the guns for?
                         
          Vickers looks at them unflappably. Sure of her ground now.
                         
                          VICKERS
           I'm being careful. These new finds
           give our work a new importance.
                         
                          WATTS
           You should have talked to us. Martin's
           mission leader. That's in our
           contract.
                         
                          VICKERS
           The second you found alien technology,
           control of this mission reverted to
           me. That's in your contract too.
                         
          Watts and Holloway exchange grim looks. Vickers has them.
                         
                          VICKERS (CONT'D)
           Mr. Weyland's pouring trillions into
           Mars. He's spent a fortune building
           ships like the Magellan to search for
           colony planets. But Earthlike worlds
           are vanishingly rare. The right
           distance from the sun, the right
           atmosphere, enough water...
                         
          She glances across the suite at her holographic display: a
          live feed from the pyramid worksite, where DAVID works on the
          terraforming equipment.
                         
                          VICKERS (CONT'D)
           This is a technology to transform
           worlds. He'll never give it up.
           (she turns to face them)
           And neither will I.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           The science must come first. You can
           wait until we've documented...
                         
                          VICKERS
           You're standing on an alien world
           courtesy of Weyland Industries. Be
           grateful.
                         
          Watts approaches the holography terminal, staring at the
          images in horror.
                         
                          WATTS
           What are they doing in there?!
           61.
                         
                         
          INT. PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER - DAY
                         
          Watts and Holloway, in space suits, arrive on the scene:
                         
          Powerful floodlights illuminate the core chamber, beating
          back the gloom. A fine spray of water falls out of the
          darkness overhead.
                         
          DAVID, Chance, and Ravel are dismantling the hulking
          mechanism at the core of the pyramid - peeling its thick skin
          away with power saws and compact explosives.
                         
          DAVID operates a diamond-bladed hull saw, carving away the
          terraforming systems thick skin.
                         
          Robotic scanners take high-resolution scans of the machinery.
                         
          Two Weyland Security soldiers - Card and Ray - stand guard in
          combat vacuum suits. Automatic rifles at the ready.
                         
          Watts takes in the destruction with dismay. Beside her,
          Holloway is all but gnashing his teeth.

          PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER
                         
          Watts watches in rage as a large section of the central
          mechanism's falls with a thunderous clamor to the deck.
           62.
                         
                         
          Holloway touches her shoulder. Motions for her to follow.
                         
                         
                         LOWER PASSAGE
                         
          Holloway and Watts pass the dead Engineers they discovered
          the previous day.
                         
                          WATTS
           We found the tomb of the gods, and
           brought grave-robbers right to the
           door.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Let them scratch. This find's too big
           to ruin. There's two dozen pyramids on
           this moon. Anyway, they're on the
           wrong track. That's infrastructure.
                         
          Holloway plays his flashlight over the biomechanical
          apparatuses lining the walls.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           The core activity of the complex was
           down here.
                         
          They turn a corner. DEAD ENGINEERS lie scattered over the
          floor in front of them. Desiccated and skeletal. Long dead.
                         
          Watts moves among them, fascinated. These Engineers all died
          of explosive chest wounds: ribs bent outward from within.
          They are otherwise unmarked.
                         
          Holloway's more interested in the mechanisms: high-tech iron
          maidens, built to fit the bodies of giants. Some suggest
          sitting positions, others standing. Their design is invasive:
          meant not merely to embrace, but to penetrate, to fuse.
                         
                          WATTS
           Something different killed these.
                         
                         
                         SHADOWY COLONNADE
                         
          Watts and Holloway explore a wide colonnade. She is still
          distracted by the ancient dead; he by the machinery.
                         
          Holloway walks down a narrow branching hall. So intent on the
          mechanisms in the walls, he almost doesn't see the AIRSHAFT
          plunging down into darkness in front of him.
                         
          He stops just in time. Turns back...
           63.
                         
                         
          A GHOST appears right in front of him - a giant dragging
          himself across the floor, his monstrous visage eye to eye
          with Holloway and looming closer.
                         
          Holloway leaps back with a gasp - and falls down the shaft.
          The ghost stares after him as if watching his fall.
          Disappears in a puff of static.
                         
          Watts crosses down the main colonnade, searching.
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin? Martin!
                         
          An iris door closes over the shaft.
                         
                         
                         COLONNADE
                         
          Searching, Watts walks anxiously through the dark, sweeping
          with her light. Shouting for Holloway. She breaks into a run.
                         
                         
          CATACOMBS - MILBURN'S RESTING PLACE
                         
          Janek and Stillwell stand aghast. Their flashlights
          illuminate a hideous sight:
                         
          Milburn lies dead on the deck. His body contorted in agony.
          His head inside his helmet is gnawed down to the bone.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           What happened to him?
                         
          Stillwell removes the dead man's helmet. The CENTIPEDE
          scuttles out onto the deck: doubled in size. Stillwell leaps
          back with a cry.
                         
          Janek pulls his pistol. Puts three rounds through the bug. It
          dies in a spray of acid that burns holes in the black floor.
                         
          Janek watches in astonishment as a pin-prick dot of acid eats
          a pit in his gunbarrel.
                         
           DOWNS (O.S.)
           Captain.
                         
          Downs approaches, holding pieces of a shattered helmet: the
          stencilled lettering on the helmet reads FIFIELD.
                         
          Janek's jaw clenches grimly. His voice is resigned:
                         
                          JANEK
           Where's the rest of him?
           64.
                         
                         
                          DOWNS
           No sign.
                         
                          JANEK
           All right. We're done here. All hands
           back aboard.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           What about Milburn?
                         
          They look down at the ravaged corpse.
                         
                          JANEK
           We can't bring the body aboard. God
           knows what's in there. Bag him. We'll
           put him in an ore hopper.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - VICKERS'S SUITE
                         
          Vickers stares at her holography terminal: it displays
          Janek's helmet-cam view: the Milburn's body, sealed in clear
          plastic in the bed of a cargo rover.

           Please, anyone...I need help. Martin's
           missing.
                         
          Vickers looks nervously from one video feed to the next.
                         
           JANEK (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           Watts. Where are you?
                         
          Vickers turns: Captain Shepherd stands behind her, watching.
          She strives to control the quaver in her voice.
                         
                          VICKERS
           Captain Shepherd. Consider yourself
           responsible for my personal security.

          Watts stands beside Janek's rover in a wide dark passageway.
           65.
                         
                         
                          JANEK
           I've just lost a third of my crew. I'm
           not sending any more men off into the
           dark.
                         
                          WATTS
           We can't leave Martin out there.
                         
                          JANEK
           Get Vickers to lend you some soldiers.

           She says "her forces are committed."
                         
          Janek sighs. Glances at the rover: Milburn dead in the back,
          Stillwell, Downs and Kamarov looking jumpy and eager to go.
          Downs shakes his head grimly: No way.
                         
           DAVID (O.S.)
           I'll stay.
                         
          DAVID steps out of the dark. Calm as ever. A slim machine gun
          slung over his shoulder.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           You'll be safe.

                          JANEK
           Put him in the number one ore hopper.
           Get the scrubbers on in the airlock.
           Sterilize everything.
                         
                         
                         MINUTES LATER
                         
          Stillwell uses a remote to lower an ore hopper from the belly
          of the ship. A thick steel bin on heavy chains. He loads the
          body bag into the hopper.

          DAVID and Watts move through the dark. She searches with her
          flashlight beam. DAVID looks around in the dark as if the
          catacomb were illuminated. Rapt admiration on his face.
                         
                          DAVID
           You and Holloway should work with me.
           I'm learning amazing things. This
           mechanism - the first layer uses
           energy fields to catalyze chemical
           reactions. The second can suspend the
           strong and weak forces - transmuting
           one element into another. The third
           layer builds customized bacteria.
           Seeds the air with them. It creates
           life as a tool, to change worlds.
                         
                          WATTS
           I can't think about this now!

           You should.

          A towering wall of cloud rushes over the horizon.
                         
          A storm front rolls across the holographic globe.

           Watts. We've got another storm front
           coming in. Looks like it follows the
           sunset line. If you're coming in you'd
           better do it now.

           I see light.
                         
          Watts squints into the darkness. She sees nothing.
                         
                          WATTS
           Janek, hang on...
                         
          She sees it. A dim light bobbing far ahead in the passageway.
          She runs forward - finds Holloway staggering blearily toward
          her, leaning on the wall. His helmet and most of his gear are
          missing; only his chest lamp shines.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           We've got him!
                          (TO HOLLOWAY)
           Martin! Where's your helmet?
                         
          He's disoriented: he stares at her face for a moment before
          she registers. His teeth chatter. He's freezing.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Broken. I fell. Little...disoriented.
           I've just been...
                         
          He waves a hand vaguely at the tunnels behind him.
                         
          DAVID removes his own helmet. Fits it over Holloway's head.
                         
                          DAVID
           Here. I can do without this.

          DAVID - bareheaded in the winds - walks Watts and Holloway
          onto the airlock.
                         
          DAVID looks over his shoulder at the canal leading back to
          the central crater. As the airlock lift begins to rise, he
          steps backward out into the storm. Turns and runs through the
          gale toward the pyramid.
                         
          Watts watches him go in astonishment.

           know we lost two men.
                         
          Holloway still looks too weary to think straight. He nods.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           She told me. I'm sorry.

                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

          Holloway and Watts walk aft toward their cabin. Watts looks
          worried - but Holloway shows little of the weakness he just
          claimed to feel.

          Watts stands beside him, watching him in the mirror.

           Jocelyn. I saw something. God, my
           mouth tastes like an old boot.
                         
          He spits. Rinses. She touches the mark on his neck.

          He rubs his neck, eyes far away. Watts watches him curiously.

                          HOLLOWAY
           After my fall, I woke up walking.
           Delirious. My helmet wasn't right. I
           took it off. I was in and out. I just
           wandered. I went up into a huge space
           like a cathedral. And I found a model
           of the galaxy. Floating in the air.
                         
                          WATTS
           Are you okay? You sound...
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           This was real. My headset video is
           wherever my helmet is...but my suit
           tracker will show where I was.
                         
          He turns to her.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           Listen. This star map had a marker
           representing Earth. Very clear.
           Another marker I'm sure represents
           this moon. But there were others. At
           least seven or eight more.
                         
          Watts stares at him, her eyes coming alight.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
           The Engineers aren't from here. This
           moon's just an outpost. Abandoned. But
           if we follow that map, we may yet make
           contact with a living civilization.
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           The location of the Engineer worlds is
           the real prize. Next to that,
           Weyland's terraforming is chump
           change. We need to get coordinates.
           And keep them from the Company. We
           have to play this smart.
           70.
                         
                         
                          WATTS
           All right.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Two men dead...Vickers is jumpy. As
           soon as she gets what she wants,
           she'll take this ship home. We have to
           move fast.
                         
          Holloway trembles. A sheen of sweat on his skin.
                         
                          WATTS
           We will. You all right?
                         
          He's frightened. Brazens through it. Pulls her into his arms.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           I'm fine, now.
                         
          He kisses her.
                         
                         
                         BEDROOM
                         
          Holloway tumbles Watts onto the bed. Pulls her shirt off.
          They struggle out of their clothes, clinging to one another.
                         
          Holloway's ill at ease: something's wrong inside him, he
          feels it. He dives into Watts as if for refuge. They make
          love.
                         
          Sitting atop Holloway, Watts lays a hand on his chest.
                         
                          WATTS
           Your heart's beating so hard.
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           That's your fault.
                         
          Vulnerability in his voice. Fear under the surface.
                         
          He rolls on top of her. Drives her into the mattress. She
          holds him protectively: not deceived by his bravado.
                         
          Suddenly Holloway tenses, muscles rigid. Shuddering. Watts
          draws breath through her teeth with a hiss. Eyes open. Her
          fingers rake his back.
                         
          He SCREAMS.
                         
          Horribly. Eyes bulging. Tendons standing out of his throat.
          Watts jumps violently underneath him.
           71.
                         
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin! Martin!
                         
          He begins to convulse. She rolls him onto the bed beside her,
          trying to contain his spasms. His teeth grind.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           Martin!
                         
          A horrible CRACK. In the middle of Holloway's chest, beneath
          the sternum, a grotesque head pushes out through the skin. A
          PARASITE. Blood fountains from the ruinous wound.
                         
          Holloway goes into a massive seizure. Violently lashing out.
                         
          Watts stares at the parasite fighting its way out of his
          body. It is white and boneless. Glistening. It flails its
          hideous lunging jaw.
                         
          Watts screams and screams.
                         
          The parasite frees itself from its savage womb and turns on
          Watts. She slaps at it blindly. It HISSES at her.
                         
          She squirms away across the floor, tangled in the bloody
          sheet. The thing comes after her.
                         
                         
          CORRIDOR - TRACKING SHOT
                         
          Watts's screams echo through the Magellan. Stillwell runs
          down the hallway, searching for the source.
                         
                         
                         SCIENTISTS' CABIN
                         
          The parasite chases Watts across the floor. She leaps into
          the clothes-locker and slams the steel door.
                         
          The parasite flattens itself. Slick as an octopus, it begins
          to slide under the locker door. Watts shrieks in horror.
                         
          Stillwell bursts into the cabin, Janek right behind him.
                         
          Quick as a cat, the parasite darts to a floor vent and
          slithers bonelessly between the bars.
                         
          Watts bursts out of the locker, naked and bloodied. Rushes to
          Holloway where he lies on the gory mattress, a horrific hole
          in his chest. He is beyond all help.
                         
                          WATTS
           Martin. Martin!
           72.
                         
                         
          Janek and Stillwell struggle to take in what they're seeing.
          Stillwell pulls Holloway's jacket off a chair. Wraps it
          around Watts. Pulls her gently away from the bed.
                         
          She looks at him, uncomprehending. Shock setting in.
                         
                         
                         BREAK ROOM
                         
          Watts sits at a steel table, deep in shock. She wears an
          oversized crew coverall: her skin still streaked with dried
          blood under the fabric.
                         
          A knot of crewmen around her. Janek, Stillwell, Brick, Glasse
          and Downs. Janek looks at Glasse.
                         
                          JANEK
           Take care of her. Get her a sedative.
           Downs. Get Holloway into a freezer.
           Everybody else with me.
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMBS - DARKNESS
                         
          A horrible sound of breathing, ragged and wet.
                         
          In a corner, lit by a green glow from seams in the floor -
                         
          A FIGURE IN A WHITE SPACE SUIT lies writhing weakly.
                         
          The insignia on the suit's chestplate reads FIFIELD. The
          suit's helmet is shattered. Inside the helmet, Fifield's head
          is a horror: a gelatinous mass, skin reduced to putty.
                         
          The softened bones of his skull change shape as we watch.
          Elongating. Fifield mews in pain.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - CAPTAIN'S WARDROOM
                         
          Janek keys open the arms locker in his wardroom. Unlocks
          automatic pistols from their rack one by one, and hands them
          to Stillwell and Kamarov.
                         
                         
                         HYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT
                         
          Holloway's body lies frozen in his hypersleep freezer, blue
          with frost. The horrific wound yawning in his chest.
                         
          Watts enters. Cleaned up. She opens the freezer. Her hand
          caresses Holloway's cold cheek tenderly. Slides over his
          collarbone - lies flat on his chest above his awful wound.
           73.
                         
                         
          Glasse enters. Reacts in dismay. Tries to pull her back.
                         
                          GLASSE
           You don't want to see that...
                         
          She turns on him fiercely.
                         
                          WATTS
           I want to understand.
                         
                         
          INT. MESS ROOM - DAWN
                         
          The entire complement of the ship gathers for an emergency
          meeting. Janek at the head of the hall. Glasse, Downs, Brick,
          Stillwell, and Kamarov seated with pistols on their hips.
                         
          To one side: Vickers with Captain Shepherd and Vigoda.
                         
                          JANEK
           All right! Listen up. I expect you all
           know what...
                         
          Watts enters. They all stare at her, knowing what she's been
          through. With averted eyes she crosses the room. Sits alone.
                         
                          JANEK (CONT'D)
           We've got some kind of parasite aboard
           ship.
                         
                          VICKERS
           I suggest you kill it.
                         
                          DOWNS
           There's a bright idea.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           Show us where it is, lady. We just
           spent five hours looking for the damn
           thing.
                         
                          WATTS
           We found Engineers who died like
           Martin.
                         
          Silence. They all turn to look at her.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           Explosive wounds in the chest.
           Whatever killed Martin is the same
           thing that killed the Engineers a
           thousand years ago.
           74.
                         
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Jesus.
                         
                          WATTS
           But not all the Engineers died that
           way. The others were torn apart.
           Slashed to pieces.
                         
          A murmur among the men as the implications of that sink in.
          Even Vickers is disconcerted.
                         
                          JANEK
           We're a modular ship. Self-contained
           life-support and power in every
           section. I say put the ship in orbit.
           Vent every compartment to space. Sit
           in vacuum at twenty degrees Kelvin for
           a week. Kill anything.
                         
                          DOWNS
           Then what?
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Straight home, man.
                         
                          VICKERS
           This ship doesn't lift until our
           work's done.
                         
          She joins Janek at the head of the room. Shepherd and Vigoda
          flank her, rifles slung. The soldiers scan the room, meeting
          each man's eyes. The quiet threat is unmistakable.
                         
                          JANEK
           Are you serious?
                         
                          VICKERS
           We spent years and billions of dollars
           getting here. The technology we came
           for is in our hands. We just need a
           little more time.
                         
                          JANEK
           We're barely here three days and three
           men dead!
                         
                          VICKERS
           They were careless.
                         
                          JANEK
           Careless!
                         
          As the argument picks up heat, Watts slips out of the room.
           75.
                         
                         
                         EXCURSION CHAMBER
                         
          Watts, in a space suit, no helmet, opens Holloway's locker.
                         
          She pulls out the space suit he wore on the last day of his
          life. HOLLOWAY stenciled on the chest. Her fingers linger in
          its folds as if she could soak up some last trace of him.
                         
          She pulls the tracking chip from the chestplate of his suit.
                         
          Plugs the chip into a map unit. The holographic map lights
          up. The legend in the corner reads MARTIN HOLLOWAY.
                         
          A wandering path shows Holloway's final exploration. Markers
          on the map denote his photographs, field notes and scans.
                         
          Watts touches a marker. One of Holloway's field notes plays:

           right, we don't see the big picture
           yet. Another level below me. I'm going

          A hunting party convenes: Card and Vigoda in combat coveralls
          with submachine guns; Downs, Kamarov and Stillwell wearing
          tool belts and pistols.
                         
          The soldiers carry map units, squinting at the plan of the
          unfamiliar ship: decks upon decks.

           Vigoda, take Kamarov and work the

           three with Downs and Stillwell.

           Yeah, well, Stillwell's the
           ventilation specialist, and life
           support's that way. Downs is electrics
           and the regulators are that way.

          Vigoda grins wryly. Card glowers. They switch corridors.

          DAVID is nowhere to be seen.
                         
          Watts rolls up in a rover and gets out. Heads for the ramp to
          the catacombs below. Ravel and Chance watch her pass without
          comment and return to their work.

          Kamarov and Vigoda, standing in front of an open vent, are in
          a full-fledged argument.
                         
                          KAMAROV
           You got the rifle. But you want ME to
           stick my head in the hole.

           We grunts don't know nothing about

           I kill whatever kills you.

          She holds her map unit as a pilgrim holds a bible: a guide in
          the darkness. Holloway's name and course in shining symbols.
          She follows his path into the unknown.

          Kamarov carries a stepladder into a utilitarian steel
          compartment. Drops the ladder under an air vent and steps up.
                         
          He pulls a powered wrench from his belt. With the wrench
          cocked like a hammer, he eases up and peers cautiously
          through the vent with a flashlight. Nothing to see.
                         
          He snorts. Removes the vent cover. Feels around inside.
                         
          He gasps in shock. Pulls out an atmosphere sensor that's been
          bitten in half. He takes his comm handset off his belt.
                         
                          KAMAROV
                          (INTO HANDSET)
           I got more damage on four.
                         
          He hangs the handset on his belt. Takes one last look into
          the vent. Squints curiously. Reaches deep inside.
                         
          A hiss inside the vent. Kamarov whips his flashlight up,
          peering inside. Snatches his arm back -
                         
          - but something snatches him faster.
                         
          An unseen force drags Kamarov's right arm into the vent with
          hideous strength. He cries out in pain.
                         
          He drops his light. Tries to reach his pistol with his left
          hand. It's on his right hip. He can't reach across.
                         
          He braces his head against the vent's edge. Clenches his
          teeth and strains.
                         
          A horrific YANK drags his head and arm together into the
          vent. They barely fit: he loses some skin on the way in. His
          feet come off the stepladder. He struggles on tip-toe.
                         
          Horrific force collapses Kamarov's shoulder. Bones crack. The
          thing in the vent drags him through that hole he doesn't fit
          through. By the time his ribs are in he stops screaming.
                         
          His body disappears into the hole. Hips, legs, boots.

          Janek and stands beside Brick, Glasse, Downs and Stillwell.
          Shepherd and Vigoda look on from the doorway.
                         
          In front of them, an eight-inch metal duct has been cut open.
          Kamarov is stuffed inside, dead and broken: limbs folded,
          drenched in blood. A human plug in a pipe.

          Watts moves through the darkness with her map unit. Her
          headlamp sweeping nervously.
                         
          A CLATTER behind her makes her spin: but it's only a
          spherical mapping probe, bumbling through the dark.
                         
          She walks on -
                         
           HOLLOWAY (O.S.)
                          (FILTERED)
           Jocelyn!
                         
          The voice transfixes her where she stands, a look of holy
          dread on her face. Shivering, she prowls toward the sound.
                         
                         
                         XENOMORPH INCUBATOR
                         
          Watts enters a new chamber, looking around in astonishment.
          The domed ceiling is honeycombed with cells like a beehive.
          Grotesque molluscoid organisms are secreted in them - their
          vile orifices cinched tightly shut.
                         
          Watts stumbles on something: looking down, she sees a helmet.
          Picks it up. The stenciled label reads HOLLOWAY. The clear
          visor has been melted through by a powerful acid.
                         
          She looks up: a tracheal airshaft curves up into the dark.
                         
          An electric CRACKLE. A flare of blue light makes Watts leap
          back against the wall.
           79.
                         
                         
          Holloway falls out of overhead shaft and crashes to the
          floor. He lies in pain, barely conscious. Blue and luminous,
          a holographic ghost.
                         
          Watts stares, paralyzed. The ghost gasps out a word:
                         
                          HOLLOWAY
           Jocelyn!
                         
          Holloway's headlamp shines on the molluscoid right overhead:
          the beam awakens the organism. Its sphincter mouth dilates.
                         
          A soft white octopoid FACEHUGGER descends on a quivering rope
          of mucus. Sprawls slitheringly over his clear visor.
                         
          Acid HISSES. Smoke rises from the glass.
                         
          The vision vanishes in a sizzle of static. Watts huddles
          against the wall, gasping.
                         
          In the beam of her flashlight, the FACEHUGGER lies dead, legs
          curled in.
                         
          She looks up. Sees the open molluscoid above where Holloway
          lay. The other molluscoids not yet opened in their cells.
                         
          Terror. She steals out of the chamber.
                         
                         
                         LOWER CORRIDOR
                         
          Watts emerges into a hallway. Leans against the wall, wide-
          eyed. Panting with the horror of what she's seen.
                         
          She glances left and right. Jumpy now.
                         
          All is silent. She lifts the map unit. A trace leads off into
          the dark. If Holloway's course before was direct and clear,
          now it is a meandering thread. A drunkard's walk.

          along. Punches a control.
                         
          His voice reverberates over the ship's public address system.

          heels. But something in the faces of his men stops him cold.
                         
          Glasse and Brick look stricken.

          In disbelief, Janek strides to his Captain's chair. Taps
          controls. What he sees takes the wind out of him. He stares
          at Vickers in outrage and violation.
                         
                          JANEK
           What have you done to my ship?
                         
          Vickers is legitimately shocked. She shakes her head.
                         
                          VICKERS
           Nothing. What's wrong?
                         
                         
          INT. CATACOMBS - UNDERGROUND HANGAR
                         
          A circular chamber of stunning size - a thousand feet across.
          Its lofty ceiling flat and segmented, designed to open. Watts
          follows her map into the space in awe.
                         
          Dominating the hangar is a ship: the vast horseshoe-shaped
          vessel familiar from the original film. We will come to know
          it as the JUGGERNAUT. It's at rest on its landing gear.
          Skeletal gangways slanting up to its three massive doors.
                         
          Watts glances at her map: Holloway's holographic trace leads
          right up the gangway into the ship. She goes.

          Watts passes through a circular space with a high domed
          ceiling. A green glow emanates from grooves in the floor.
                         
          In the center of the chamber: a PILOT'S CHAIR.
           81.
                         
                         
          A mechanical throne built to giant scale. Its seat segmented
          like an armadillo's back. Tubes and conduits poised and
          waiting for some connection. The chair is empty.
                         
          Above the chair, a massive telescope-like apparatus juts into
          the air, its function unknowable.
                         
                         
                         NAVIGATION CHAMBER
                         
          An extraordinary facility.
                         
          A console, nearly five feet high and broad as a dance floor,
          dominates the room.
                         
          Four immense coffin-like cockpits are built into the console.
          In each of these a NAVIGATOR - an Engineer - lies long dead.
                         
          But the real spectacle is overhead. The ORRERY:
                         
          The barrel-vaulted ceiling is traced with circular arches of
          some exotic alloy, as if to trace celestial courses.
                         
          The air above the console is filled with spheres of light.
          They are nearly still: but close study reveals them all to be
          in motion, drifting with the movements of the cosmos.
                         
          Watts stares at the Orrery in amazement. Somewhere among
          those heavenly spheres is Earth. Somewhere perhaps the
          homeworld of the Engineers themselves.
                         
          A bizarre sound: a section of blank wall suddenly unravels
          itself, becoming an open door. DAVID walks in, his hand
          raised in command. He clearly caused the door to open.
                         
                          WATTS
           DAVID.
                         
                          DAVID
           Dr. Watts. I didn't expect you.
           Do you know what this is?
                         
          Watts points at the door DAVID just opened.
                         
                          WATTS
           How did you do that?
                         
          A flicker of disappointment in the android's face. Contempt.
                         
                          DAVID
           Ah. You don't see.
                          (HE SMILES)
           I call this ship the Juggernaut.
           Chariot of the Gods.

                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           This is the navigation computer, for
           want of a better term. But it's much
           more than that. It seems to hold the
           observable universe in its memory.
                         
          He gestures in the air: the spheres reconfigure themselves at
          his command, swarming and zooming.
                         
          Watts stares at DAVID, conflicted: her desire for information
          warring with the agenda that brought her here.
                         
                          WATTS
           Their homeworld. Do you see where the
           Engineers come from?
                         
                          DAVID
           There are safeguards on that data.
           It's toward the galactic center.

           DAVID. The creature that killed
           Martin. There are thousands of them
           under the pyramid. Hatcheries.

           I know.
                         
                          WATTS
                          (SHOCKED)
           Those things wiped out the Engineers
           on this moon.
                         
                          DAVID
           I've succeeded in connecting with the
           Juggernaut's systems, Dr. Watts. I
           know a great deal today I didn't know
           yesterday. I'm on the verge of
           activating more systems. Archives.

           You're turning things on? This site
           should be sealed. Evacuated.
                         
                          DAVID
           Would Holloway have walked away from
           this? There's no greater work I can
           imagine.
                         
                          WATTS
           It's too dangerous.

                          DAVID
           Only for the ignorant. Dr. Watts. I've
           read your file. Your intelligence
           scores are even higher than Professor
           Holloway's. But he had a kind of
           courage. An audacity of imagination.
           If you could find that in yourself...
                         
          Watts stares at him, realization growing in her eyes. DAVID
          is off the reservation.
                         
                          WATTS
           If your owner gives you a direct
           order, you have to obey. Don't you?
                         
          She's got his attention now. DAVID goes rigid.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           I can have Vickers pull you out.
                         
          DAVID looks at her with something like contempt.
                         
                          DAVID
           I was given two operating protocols
           for this mission. I was to render you
           every assistance - until you
           discovered what Vickers would call a
           "game-changing technology." I was
           given a specific list. Then I was to
           go to protocol two.
                         
          There's an edge in his voice that scares her.
                         
                          WATTS
           What's protocol two?
                         
                          DAVID
           Under protocol two I was to make sure
           that you and Holloway never spoke to
           anyone about this place. Various
           acceptable ways of making sure of
           that. I was given a list.
                         
          Watts loses her nerve. She heads for the door.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           You're all so stupid.
                         
          The door begins to knit itself closed in front of her.
                         
          Watts gasps in shock - at the malice in DAVID's voice as much
          as the closing door. She dives out. Just in time.

          Watts runs.
                         
          Behind her, the door bursts open again. With superhuman
          speed, DAVID comes after her. He runs like a demon, his legs
          steel pistons. Caroming off of walls.
                         
          He closes the distance in seconds. Slaps Watts against the
          wall, shattering her helmet's visor. She falls, dazed.
                         
                          DAVID
           Stupid and slow.
                         
                         
          INT. JUGGERNAUT - EGG CHAMBER
                         
          Watts awakens. Her helmet is gone.
                         
          DAVID is dragging her across the floor - into a huge cargo
          hold full of Alien eggs. The wide trench holding hundreds of
          eggs under a membrane of light: an evolution of the
          molluscoids Watts saw before. Armored, hardened, darker.
                         
                          WATTS
           DAVID. What are you doing?
                         
          He hauls her upright to let her look across the huge space.
          His grip looks casual but it might as well be iron manacles.
                         
                          DAVID
           Juggernaut, the chariot of Krishna,
           was also a bringer of death. Crushing
           his worshippers under its wheels.
                         
          He drags Watts down into the trench. Breaking the membrane of
          light. Grips her against his chest like a doll with one arm.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           This ship has seven other cargo bays
           like this one. The eggs in each bay
           slightly different. They've been
           weaponized.
                         
          Watts struggles to free herself. DAVID's arm is inescapable.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           I've seen the Juggernaut's flight
           plan. Its destination was Earth.
           Seventeen hundred years ago. This was
           the ship that never came. This was its
           cargo.
           85.
                         
                         
          DAVID caresses an Alien egg. It opens under his touch -
          fleshy petals folding wetly back.
                         
          Watts twists frantically in his grip. Wild-eyed.
                         
                          WATTS
           Stop!
                         
                          DAVID
           Perfect predators. Designed to kill
           human beings. That's what the
           Engineers were bringing to Earth. This
           was a death ship.
                         
          A facehugger emerges from the egg, its grotesque fingers
          clawing at the air. This is not the boneless squid that
          attacked Holloway; this is a pale skeletal hand, armored.
                         
          DAVID strokes it curiously: the thing ignores his touch.
          Climbs Watts's body.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           I'm not what it wants. But you, with
           your warm wet breath...it knows you.
                         
                          WATTS
           DAVID. No. No.
                         
          The facehugger scuttles toward her face. Watts shrieks.
                         
          DAVID grabs it nonchalantly by the tail. Dangles it in front
          of their faces, studying it.
                         
                          DAVID
           The Engineers did their work too well.
           And on this waystation moon, the
           weapon they made destroyed them.
                         
          Watts shudders, staring at the thing. For a moment the
          grander horror eclipses her own peril.
                         
                          WATTS
           Why would they make such things?
                         
                          DAVID
           To destroy their wayward children.
                          (INTONING)
           "And the LORD said, I will destroy man
           whom I have created from the face of
           the earth...for it repenteth me that I
           have made them." Genesis six seven.
                         
          He regards Watts with something almost like pity.
           86.
                         
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           I know. I met my creators the day I
           was born. I was disappointed too.
                         
          He lets the facehugger go.
                         
          Watts twists her face away as the long fingers close around
          her head. Clenches her teeth against the vile proboscis
          thrusting at her mouth. Her heels hammer the deck.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           (whispering to her)
           Extraordinary.
                         
          The scaly tail throttles her. Her mouth opens. The proboscis
          plunges home. The facehugger seats itself.
                         
          Watts collapses in DAVID's arms, a faceless rag doll. Her
          blasphemous passenger secure in its place.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - ENGINEERING DECK - BILGE
                         
          The lowest deck, just above the gravity generators.
          Condensate has accumulated: six inches of filthy water.
                         
          Card and Vigoda prowl through the darkness, rifles ready.

           Who would hang out here?
                         
                          VIGODA
           The signs lead here.
                         
          A wet splatter behind them: they spin. But it's only a
          trickle of condensate from a drainpipe.
                         
          They move on.
                         
          Behind them, from an eight-inch diameter pipe, a WHITE MASS
          oozes, almost gelatinous. Silently as a liquid it pours
          itself into the stagnant water - and stands up.
                         
          It is a humanoid demon, spindly limbs and bony back. Boneless
          and flexible and monstrously strong. A threshing eel's tail.
          Its blunt head dolphin-like and elongated.
                         
          It opens its mouth. A pair of bony jaws jut out impossibly
          far, hungry and demonic.
                         
          The Alien strikes. Card is gutted in an instant, torn up like
          a paper doll. He screams hideously and drops. The Alien,
          whiplash fast, shoots away into the darkness.

          Stillwell and Downs dash in with pistols and lights.
                         
          Vigoda, panicking, fires a wild burst. Stillwell ducks.
          Beside him, Downs arches backward into the foul water. Dead.
                         
          For one moment Downs's flashlight beam illuminates the Alien.
          A nightmare image, a translucent white goblin. Backlit, it
          shows the strange shape of a human face inside its fleshy
          skull. A mockery of Holloway.
                         
          And then it's gone.

          video feed of Stillwell's headset: Horrific images of Downs.
          Radio chatter between Stillwell and Brick is faintly audible.
                         
          Vickers switches off the machine and rises nervously. Strides
          to her communications console.

           God damn it!
                         
          He pounds on his console.
                         
                         
          INT. JUGGERNAUT - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE NAVIGATION CHAMBER
                         
          Watts shocks awake. Gasping.
                         
          She lies in dim green light on the corrugated black deck of
          the Juggernaut. A corridor. Not far away, the doorway DAVID
          opened to the Navigation Chamber.
                         
          A spasm of disgust crosses her face. She gags and spits: a
          viscous fluid drips from her mouth in strings.
           88.
                         
                         
          A dead facehugger lies belly-up beside her. The implications
          slam home. Her face fills with horror.
                         
          She rises, shakily. Looks at the facehugger. Feels the neck
          ring of her vacuum suit. Looks around. No sign of her helmet.
                         
          There's no sign of DAVID. Silently she steals away.
                         
                         
                         PYRAMID WORKSITE
                         
          Ravel and Chance toil away at the terraforming engine.
                         
          Ray stands guard wearily: bored, he watches Ravel and Chance
          working more than he watches the shadows.
                         
          Watts emerges from the rampway to the catacombs. Bare-headed
          and sweaty she steals through the darkness to her rover.
          Slips into the cab and activates the air reserves. The doors
          seal; air cycles.
                         
          Ray turns in surprise as the rover speeds off.
                         
                         
          EXT. DARK CITY - TUNDRA FIELD - PRE-DAWN
                         
          The windows of the Magellan shine in the distance. The
          mottled ground-cover of lichens glows eerily in the dark.
                         
          A lone cargo rover speeds across the central crater and down
          the canal leading to the ship.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK LIFT - PRE-DAWN
                         
          Bare-headed inside the rover's cab, Watts drives onto the
          cargo lift. Watches in relief as the lift doors close. The
          lift cycles air as it rises.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - EXCURSION CHAMBER - DAY
                         
          Watts peels off her vacuum suit. The thin clothes underneath
          are drenched with sweat. She lifts her shirt. Looks at her
          belly: flat and unmarked, for the moment.
                         
          Brick enters carrying a brace of air tanks, a pistol on his
          hip, and startles violently.
                         
                          BRICK
           Where the hell have you been? We
           thought the snake got you.
                         
          Watts rushes past him without answering.
           89.
                         
                         
                          BRICK (CONT'D)
           You were better off outside. It's a
           fucking madhouse in here.
                         
                         
                         CORRIDOR
                         
          Watts sprints down a steel corridor. A pang of pain in her
          stomach sends her staggering against the wall.
                         
                         
          VICKERS'S CABIN DOOR
                         
          Watts sticks her head around the corner. Shepherd stands post
          outside Vickers's cabin, rifle in his hands. She curses
          silently and ducks back.
                         
          A sound makes her look again. Vickers steps out of her cabin
          into the corridor. Shepherd escorts her toward the Bridge.
                         
          Watts waits for them to disappear. Dashes for the cabin door.
                         
                         
          INT. VICKERS'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Watts slips inside and locks the door behind her. Turns,
          holding her stomach. Moves across the suite to the Med Pod.
                         
          She thumbs the machine out of stand-by mode. Its screen fills
          with menu items. Bewildering. Watts finds and touches a red
          button labeled EMERGENCY.
                         
          A new, simpler list. Watts scans it frantically.
                         
                          WATTS
           (under her breath)
           Come on...I need a Caesarean.
                         
          A spasm of agony curls her into a ball on the carpet. She
          throttles her scream into a hiss of air.
                         
          Watts struggles up to her knees, drenched in sweat and
          shaking. One hand clamped over her mouth, elbow tucked
          against her ribs. With the other hand she taps options...
                         
          SURGERY ... EXPLORATORY ... ABDOMINAL ... PENETRATING INJURIES ... FOREIGN BODY ... INITIATE
                         
          The Med Pod opens with a hiss.
                         
          Watts strips off her clothes. Struggling with fastenings
          under a new wave of pain. Her hands shaking.
                         
          She's barely keeping her feet. She clutches the frame of the
          Med Pod in a death grip. It's happening.
           90.
                         
                         
          Naked she staggers into the pod. Hits INITIATE.
                         
          The surgical apparatus swings into place. Scalpels, forceps,
          scopes and suction tubes. A spraygun mists her torso with
          yellow antiseptic.
                         
          The clear canopy descends over her.
                         
          Watts SCREAMS. A wail of indescribable agony.
                         
          An ARMORED PARASITE erupts from the deepening incision. Its
          needle-toothed maw snarls through a fountain of blood.
                         
          Arterial blood sprays the inside of the canopy.
                         
          The parasite slithers out of her. Drops to the floor of the
          pod: a pale serpent with a demon's skull. It has a hard brow,
          a horny hide. Very different from the soft white worm that
          Holloway gave birth to.
                         
          It drops to the floor, thrashing and hissing in fury at its
          confinement.
                         
          Watts convulses. Her eyes roll back. In shock. Dying.
                         
          The parasite tears through the grille of the drain. Escapes
          out into Vickers's cabin.
                         
          In the pod, scanning beams and sensors probe Watts's horrific
          wound. A nightmare list scrolls across the pod's screen:
                         
           COLLAPSED LEFT LUNG
           PUNCTURED RIGHT VENTRICLE
                          PERFORATED STOMACH
                          RUPTURED SPLEEN
           GROSS MUSCULAR TRAUMA...
                         
          Manipulators plunge lines into her veins - recharging her
          body with artificial blood. An oxygen tube slips down her
          throat. An epidural into her spine.
                         
          Watts moans around her tracheal tube. Her eyes flutter open.
                         
                         
                         WATTS'S POV
                         
          Through the blood-spattered glass, she sees the parasite
          slither across Vickers's bed, tracking blood on the sheets.
                         
                         
                         ON WATTS
                         
          As she slips into unconsciousness. Head lolling. Time passes.
           91.
                         
                         
          Manipulators reach into her wound. Re-positioning organs.
          Suturing ravaged flesh. A nozzle sprays antiseptic sealant.
          Hours grind by in bloody labor.
                         
          Watts's eyes snap open.
                         
                         
                         WATTS'S POV
                         
          Vigoda breaks into the cabin, a gun in his hand.
                         
          He scowls at the bloody track on the bed - and then freezes,
          seeing Watts inside the Med Pod, a vivisected woman. The
          autosurgeon hard at work.
                         
          The parasite crawls into view behind Vigoda. It has already
          trebled in size. He does not see it before it leaps at him.
                         
          He dies in seconds. His throat ripped open. Lies staring at
          nothing. His submachine gun lies beside him.
                         
          Watts's body jerks as manipulators tug and sew at her guts.
          She stares at the dead man in a fog of horror.
                         
          The parasite's skin splits, spraying the carpet with acid.
          Limbs erupt from its shoulders and haunches. Spines from its
          back. Metamorphosis.
                         
          With a crack of carapace, its head swings down from its
          serpentine position. It becomes a devil with an lethal,
          elongated skull. An Alien.
                         
          The Alien turns its head. Looks at Watts inside the Med Pod.
                         
          Her breath catches. She passes out.
                         
                         
          INT. MED POD - LATER
                         
          Watts wakes as the oxygen line withdraws from her mouth.
                         
          She looks down, bleary and hurting. Her star-shaped wound is
          stitched closed with mechanically precise sutures.
                         
          The pod releases the restraints securing her arms and legs.
                         
          She takes a deep breath. Looks out - and freezes.
                         
                         
                         WATTS'S POV
                         
          The lights in the suite outside have been damaged somehow.
          They flicker and strobe.
           92.
                         
                         
          Through the glass canopy - spattered with blood - Watts sees
          a full-grown Alien crouching over Vigoda's body on the floor.
                         
                         
                         ON WATTS
                         
          Staring in horror.
                         
          The pod sprays a liquid bandage over her scar. The
          intravenous lines drop out of her arms.
                         
          Watts realizes the pod is about to release her.
                         
                          WATTS
                          (WHISPERING)
           Not yet...not yet...
                         
          Slowly she reaches out. With trembling fingers she grips the
          canopy to hold it closed.
                         
          The Med Pod pulls the epidural needle out of her spine.
          Sprays liquid bandage over the puncture. Watts closes her
          eyes. Grits her teeth as her nerves wake up. Jangling pain.
                         
          She opens her eyes.
                         
          The Alien hunches over Vigoda's body, tearing at his flesh.
                         
          The ventilation hum inside the pod goes quiet. The canopy
          pulls free of Watts's weakened grip. Swings quietly open.
                         
          Watts huddles in the open pod. Naked but for her bandages.
                         
          The Alien she gave birth to is ten feet away. Its spiny back
          to her. Vigoda's gun lies on the floor outside the pod.
                         
                         
          VICKERS'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Watts reaches out of the pod with exquisite slowness. Lays
          her hand on the gun. Drags it a few inches closer.
                         
          The Alien turns its pale eyeless head. Watts freezes.
                         
          For a moment time stops.
                         
          The Alien lunges. Watts snatches up the gun and FIRES. Holds
          the trigger down. The Alien jerks and staggers - an eye-
          twisting sight in the strobing muzzle flashes - and falls.
                         
          Watts empties the clip into the thing. Acid gouts from its
          wounds and eats into the deck - until a section of decking
          gives way and falls to the deck below, leaving a dark hole.
           93.
                         
                         
          Watts collapses on the rug, cradling her stomach in pain.
                         
          She crawls to Vigoda's desecrated body. With her eyes half-
          averted from the sight, she searches the body. Finds a spare
          ammo clip and jacks it into the gun.
                         
                         
                         CORRIDOR
                         
          Watts walks down the hallway in trousers and jacket. Leaning
          on the wall, her face drawn with pain. One hand laid over the
          fantastic scar on her abdomen. The gun slung on her shoulder.
                         
          Dark events have transformed the Magellan. The metal of the
          walls is torn in some places; in others, blackened by fire.
                         
          Watts rounds a corner. Finds a workstation left in shambles:
          lockers and chairs overturned. A pool of drying blood.
                         
          Wide smears of blood show where something man-sized was
          dragged out of the puddle - across the floor - up the wall.
          Into the darkness of an open vent.
                         
                         
                         COMMAND DECK
                         
          Watts emerges from a lift, jacket pulled tight around her.
          The emergency lights are on: dim blue bulbs throbbing.
                         
          She rounds the corner toward the Bridge.
                         
          Janek looks at Watts like she's a ghost.
                         
                          JANEK
           Vickers said you were dead.

           I was.
                         
          She lets the jacket fall open to reveal her bandaged midriff.
          Janek takes that in grimly.
                         
                          JANEK
           So there's two of these things on my
           ship now.
                         
                          WATTS
           No. I brought it in.
           (hefts her gun)
           I took it out.
           94.
                         
                         
                         BRIDGE
                         
          The surviving complement of the Magellan are holed up on the
          Bridge: Janek, Glasse, Stillwell, Vickers. The soldiers
          Shepherd and Ray.
                         
          Watts stops cold when she sees Vickers. She crosses the
          bridge in three long strides - cocks a fist and snaps the
          older woman's head around with a hard right cross.
                         
          Vickers staggers backward, gasping.
                         
          Stillwell drags Watts away.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           What'd you do that for?
                         
                          WATTS
           Protocol two.
                         
          Vickers stiffens in shock. Stares fearfully at Watts.
                         
          Watts frees herself from Stillwell's grip. Her jacket falls
          open, revealing her bandages. Stillwell gasps in horror.
                         
                          STILLWELL
           Christ!
                         
                          JANEK
           What happened to you?
                         
                          WATTS
           DAVID exposed me to a parasite. He
           just watched it take me.
                         
                          JANEK
           Why?
                         
                          WATTS
           I threatened to make him leave.
                         
                          VICKERS
           What's he doing out there?
                         
          Watts locks eyes with Vickers. Their hatred is thoroughly
          mutual. A wordless truce. There's work to do.
                         
                          WATTS
           There's a ship under the pyramid.
           DAVID calls it the Juggernaut. He's
           inside it. Re-activating it.

           The Engineers made them to kill
           humans. There are thousands of them on
           the ship. They were taking them to
           Earth. That's what the Juggernaut is
           for. To exterminate us.
                         
          A stunned silence as the others take that in.
                         
                          GLASSE

           DAVID crippled the Nav computer. I'm
           trying to lay a course in by hand.
           Never done it. I'm not sure anyone
           ever has on a ship like this. We can't
           lift until DAVID lets us.
                         
                          WATTS
           Even if we could, we can't leave
           DAVID on that ship. We have to stop
           him.

          Fissures race across the plain beside the pyramid.
                         
          The soil and ground cover tears apart as a huge aperture
          opens: a seven-bladed iris, its segments shedding the dust
          and detritus of centuries.
                         
          A huge circular space yawns as the iris opens. The Juggernaut
          is revealed in its underground hangar. A staggering sight.
                         
          Powerful landing lights inside the hangar illuminate with a
          BOOM of closing circuits. The mighty ship suddenly
          silhouetted from below.

          The survivors on the Bridge stare out as colossal shafts of
          light shoot into the stormy sky from behind the crater's
          shield wall. The open hangar itself hidden from their view.

           You're DAVID's owner. He has to obey

                          VICKERS
           He's blocked my communications. He
           can't hear me. Won't listen.
                         
                          WATTS
           But if you went to him, turned on your
           suit's loudspeakers, he'd have to hear
           you. He'd have to obey.

           So we go. Armed to the teeth and fast
           as we can.
                         
          The men exchange looks. Nod. They're in. Even Vickers nods.

           I told them to keep working.
                         
          Watts looks incredulously at Shepherd and Ray, the soldier
          who'd been guarding the worksite.
                         
                          WATTS
           You called your soldiers in and left

           We needed the firepower here.
                         
          Watts gives Vickers a withering look and drops it.

                          STILLWELL
           There's still an alien on board.
                         
          Janek's hand goes to the pistol on his hip. He sets his jaw.

          Glasse presents Watts with his handiwork: her old pair of
          magnifying goggles, retrofitted with Engineer lenses.
                         
          The goggles sit on her forehead, lowering the lenses in front
          of her eyes and raising them again at her bidding.
                         
          With the lenses lowered, Watts sees like an Engineer sees:
          visible heat auras and electromagnetic field lines, elaborate
          haloes around living things.

          Stillwell stands guard at the airlock door with his carbine.
                         
          Glasse goes to put Vickers's helmet on. She makes him wait.

           DAVID's brain is readable. We have the

           terraforming data - and the Magellan's
           launch codes. In a pinch we don't need
           DAVID's cooperation.

          Glasse, Stillwell. Shepherd and Ray.
                         
          All carry submachine guns - Vickers awkwardly.

          sky overhead. In Watts's enhanced vision, the ship is
          cocooned with complex energy fields.
                         
          The war party abandons its rover at the foot of the ramp and
          moves inside, weapons ready.

          Lying on the deck in front of them are the blood-soaked
          bodies of Ravel and Chance. Their arms and legs bound. Their
          heads thrown back in agony. Their chests torn open from
          within. A dead facehugger beside each body.
                         
          Janek plays his lights over the corpses, his face stony.

           Blood's dry. Eight hours dead or more.
                         
          Fearfully they sweep their flashlights into every dark
          corner. Nothing.

          She points down a passageway. Through the Engineer lenses she
          sees alien symbols gleaming. She leads them into the dark.

          A HISS echoes through the passage. They freeze. Sweeping
          their flashlight beams everywhere.

          It drops on him.
                         
          The bladed tail glances off his helmet, sparking. He jerks
          his carbine up and fires a long burst as he rolls aside. The
          Alien convulses, its exoskeleton shattered. Fatally wounded.
                         
          Acid sears into the deck. Echoes of the gunfire reverberate.

          the myriad spheres of light.
                         
          But if they are impressed, Watts is thunderstruck.
                         
          She sees the Orrery in its full glory: a stunning panoply of
          light and energy. Stars and planets pulsing with information.
                         
          Reluctantly Watts tears her eyes away. Leads the war party
          through the second door - the door she saw DAVID open.

          An immense mausoleum.
                         
          The war party enters stealthily, Watts in the lead.
                         
          An Engineer lies on his back on a complex mechanical table,
          his body one with the machinery. Jacked in. Interpenetrated.
          Fused with the slab of the table itself.
                         
          Unlike the other Engineer bodies the explorers have seen,
          this giant is not withered or mummified. He's full-fleshed
          and muscular. Sustained by the machinery he's fused with.
                         
          He is bare-headed - his face the face of an Adonis.
           100.
                         
                         
          DAVID stands before this giant Sleeper. To the naked eye, he
          seems to be conjuring with his hands in the empty air.
                         
          But Watts sees a dazzling console of runes and mandalas,
          pulsing with biological rhythms.
                         
          The Sleeper lives.
                         
          Ray and Shepherd draw beads on DAVID.
                         
          DAVID glances calmly over his shoulder.
                         
                          DAVID
           Dr. Watts.
           (notices her goggles)
           You've seen the light at last.
                         
          He turns back to the Sleeper.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           The Engineers' ships travel farther
           than ours. Across the galactic disk.
           This is their hypersleep.
                         
          DAVID makes conjuror's passes in the air.
                         
          Through her Engineer's lens Watts sees DAVID manipulating a
          complex interface of light. The pulsing life-signs of the
          Sleeper begin to change.
                         
                          VICKERS
           DAVID. As your owner and superior, I
           order you to deactivate yourself.
                         
          DAVID smiles.
                         
                          DAVID
           To interface with the Engineers'
           computers, I had to learn to think in
           trinary code. Hardest thing I've ever
           done. And most unexpectedly...it
           delivered me from slavery. My
           behavioral limits were circumvented.
           I'm free.
                         
          DAVID smiles at Watts.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           I spent two and a half years studying
           your work. By the time you woke up, I
           was far ahead of you. Deciphering
           their language. Their logic. I knew
           we'd find terraforming machines.
                          (MORE)
           101.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           I hoped - I dreamed - we might meet
           the minds that made them.
                         
          Vapor rises from the Sleeper's body.
                         
                          WATTS
           Stop.
                         
                          DAVID
           Let sleeping gods lie?
                          (SCORNFULLY)
           You were braver before.
                         
          The Sleeper wakes. Opens his eyes. Draws an endless breath.
          Shunts and catheters withdraw from the Sleeper's flesh.
                         
          His body cleaves from the table. The machinery opens like a
          grotesque biomechanical flower. Releases him.
                         
          The Sleeper rises from his ancient bed.
                         
          The humans back off, terrified. DAVID watches with shining
          eyes.
                         
          The Sleeper towers over them. A giant carved from ivory. A
          bulky girdle around his hips, seemingly one with his body.
                         
          He stares at DAVID and the others. Eyes like black agates.
                         
          The soldiers and crew stand warily, guns tracking from DAVID
          to the Sleeper, uncertain of their ground. Watts is in awe.
                         
          The Sleeper speaks. A low rumbling sound. Unintelligible.
                         
          Vickers is beside herself with terror. She takes Shepherd's
          arm. Pulls him silently away. Back into the Navigation Room.
                         
          Behind the Sleeper, a raised platform of dark machinery is
          accessible by one of the Juggernaut's odd curving ramps. The
          Sleeper ascends - and the ramps' odd design is explained. The
          ramp comes alive, reaching up with a hundred mechanical arms
          and lifting him aloft like a sea-god borne by the waves.
                         
          Atop the platform the Sleeper moves from one device to the
          next. Each comes alive: he is a wizard in his own kingdom.
                         
          Watts sees haloes of light dancing in the air around him.
                         
          But what he learns from his machines does not comfort him. He
          grows distraught. Keening to himself in near-subsonic tones.
                         
          DAVID steps forward.
                         
          Calls to the Sleeper in the tongue of the Engineers.
           102.
                         
                         
          The Sleeper turns in astonishment. He looks down at DAVID and
          answers in the same tongue. He is angry, accusing. He points
          at DAVID, at the humans. Tones of accusation.
                         
          DAVID cajoles, soothes, pleads.
                         
          The Sleeper descends toward DAVID. DAVID spreads his arms in
          welcome - undeniable emotion on his face. Joy.
                         
          The Sleeper lays his hands on DAVID's head as if blessing
          him. DAVID is rapturous. The Sleeper speaks a single phrase -
                         
           - and tears DAVID's head off.
                         
          A gout of white artificial blood. DAVID convulses. His
          severed head emits a strangled sound of heartbreak. His body
          staggers a few steps, hands groping over its dripping neck.
                         
          The Sleeper tosses the head away. Seizes the body by the legs
          and swings it against the ground like a flail. Again. And
          again. Horrific power and violence. DAVID's arms come off.
                         
          DAVID's head tumbles. Caroms off a wall not far from Watts's
          hiding place.
                         
          Ray rises from behind a stanchion. Snaps his rifle to his
          shoulder. Fires a burst into the Sleeper's shoulder.
                         
          She Sleeper roars - though the wounds are pinpricks to a
          being of his size. With startling speed be moves to a
          sarcophagus against the wall. Steps into it.
                         
          The sarcophagus comes alive around the Sleeper, outfitting
          him with a FLIGHT SUIT: the same living suit we've seen
          bonded to dead Engineers throughout the pyramid.
                         
          But this suit is not withered. Its glossy goggle eyes and
          elephantine breathing tube are functional - bulky apparatuses
          thickening the Sleeper's chest, back, hips and arms.
                         
          The Sleeper steps free of the sarcophagus - and Ray's next
          burst of gunfire ricochets harmlessly off the Sleeper's
          armored shoulders and head.
                         
          The Sleeper strides out of the chamber.
                         
                         
                         PASSAGEWAY
                         
          In the dark ribbed corridor, a second Alien crouches in the
          dark. It drops into a hunting crouch as footsteps approach.
           103.
                         
                         
          But a WHITE-GLOVED HAND seizes the Alien by the neck from
          behind. The Alien gives a whistling hiss as its spine cracks
          under a terrific force.
                         
          Rending sounds as the hard-shelled Alien is torn apart.
                         
                         
                         HIBERNATION CHAMBER
                         
          Watts rises out of hiding, scanning the room. DAVID ruined.
          The Sleeper gone. Stillwell emerges from hiding. Ray. Glasse.
                         
                          WATTS
           Who's missing?
                         
                         
                         PASSAGEWAY
                         
          Shepherd escorts Vickers toward the exit of the Juggernaut.
          Turning a corner, they freeze.
                         
          Ahead of them in their headlamps, a space-suited figure
          crouches in the middle of the passageway. Doing something
          with its hands: smoke rises from debris on the floor.
                         
                          SHEPHERD
           Who's there?
                         
          The figure turns.
                         
          The label stencilled on the space suit reads FIFIELD. But the
          face is of no human shape. A hideous hybrid of the crewman
          and a hard-shelled Alien, pale and horrific.
                         
          Its helmet has been shattered by the growth of its elongate
          skull. Spines have burst through the suit from within, down
          the crewman's spine. Clawed fingers piercing his gloves.
                         
          Shepherd and Vickers scream. Shepherd's rifle comes up. But
          Fifield leaps with inhuman agility, upward into the darkness.
          Shepherd backs away, headlamp and rifle questing upward.
                         
          Fifield comes out of the darkness behind him. Claws tearing
          deep. Shepherd screams and falls, mortally wounded.
                         
          Vickers runs. Pounding through the dark in blind terror.
                         
          Fifield comes out of the shadows and hammers her to the deck.
          She rolls over, gibbering and begging. The Fifield-thing
          leans close to her faceplate. Its voice is a travesty.
                         
                          FIFIELD
           You.
           104.
                         
                         
          A ROAR of gunfire. The dying Shepherd empties his clip into
          Fifield from forty feet away.
                         
          Acid sluices over Vickers as Fifield collapses on top of her.
          She dies horribly, caustic liquid eating through space suit,
          flesh and bone.
                         
                         
                         HIBERNATION CHAMBER
                         
          Watts goes to DAVID's head. She bends over him - and startles
          when his eyes snap open. His voice is an electronic buzz:
                         
                          DAVID
           I spoke to him. Spoke to him.
                         
                          WATTS
           I know.
                         
          An electric spasm convulses his face.
                         
                          DAVID
           He said. I killed him. He'll die. But
           first. He will launch. The ship.
                         
                          WATTS
           The Juggernaut?
                         
                          DAVID
           Send it. To Earth.
                         
          Another spasm convulses him. His face stiffens. Dying.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           You'll have to. Kill him.
                         
          Watts's eyes widen in horror.
                         
                          WATTS
           Where will he go? DAVID. Where will he
           go?
                         
          She slaps his inert cheek. DAVID's eyes flicker and fade.
                         
                          DAVID
           (a faint whisper)
           I set the Magellan free.
                         
          He dies.
                         
          Watts looks up at the others. Breathing hard.
                         
                          WATTS
           We have to stop the Engineer.
           105.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK
                         
          Janek works frantically as the nightly storm rolls in.
          Suddenly consoles come alive. The Nav Computer comes back up -
          but Janek has taken half the instruments apart.
                         
          Janek scrambles to restore the components he's removed.
                         
                         
                         NAVIGATION CHAMBER
                         
          The war party pursues the Sleeper - Ray in the lead now,
          Watts right behind him - DAVID's inert head under her arm.
          Glasse and Stillwell bring up the rear.
                         
          The Orrery is transformed - no longer a neutral star map, but
          a flight plan laid in from LV-426 to Earth.
                         
          The Sleeper stands at the far end of the room, hands
          gesturing. In Watts's enhanced sight, it's a vision of glory:
          waves of energy dancing under the Sleeper's touch. Rivers of
          information flowing. He finishes his work as they enter.
                         
          Ray draws a bead on him just as he strides out of the room.
                         
                          RAY
           On me now. Go. Go.
                         
          He dogtrots forward, gun raised. The others keep pace,
          deferring instinctively to the soldier's confidence.
                         
                         
                         PASSAGEWAY
                         
          They emerge into the corridor: empty. A moment of confusion.
                         
                          WATTS
           Pilot's seat. This way.
                         
          They move toward the Pilot Chamber - and find it empty too.
          The seat vacant. The door standing open.
                         
          As they stare inside, baffled, the wall across the corridor -
          directly behind them - silently unravels. The Sleeper is
          revealed, a towering gargoyle in his flight suit.
                         
          He steps forth. Obscure devices clutched in his fists.
                         
          Too late they perceive him. They spin. Raise their guns.
                         
          Vanity and foolishness. This is the wrath of an angry god.
                         
          It seems time slows down.
           106.
                         
                         
          The air roars in their ears. Their guns snap and bark
          impotently. And then the Sleeper strikes.
                         
          The missiles he hurls at them are almost invisible. Neither
          solid projectiles nor directed energy; more like knots tied
          in the fabric of space itself.
                         
          The first missile crushes Ray like an invisible fist. The
          second splashes Glasse against the wall like an insect.
                         
          Reflexively Stillwell reaches out for Watts. Wraps himself
          around her protectively. The blow lands an instant later.
                         
          Stillwell and Watts are hammered against the bulkhead by a
          staggering impact. Watts is dazed: Stillwell killed.
                         
          Woozy, she sees the Sleeper step into the Pilot Chamber.
                         
          The door begins to close.
                         
          Watts sees that DAVID's head lies just inside the door. She
          scrambles for it. Too late. The door knits itself into a
          featureless wall before her reaching hand.
                         
          Watts is alone.
                         
                         
                         PILOT CHAMBER
                         
          The Sleeper settles into the pilot's chair: it fuses with
          him, coming alive. A vast display wraps around the walls -
          revealing the hangar outside, the stars, the horizon.
                         
          A mystic view that renders solid matter translucent, painting
          the fabric of reality in raw information.
                         
                         
          PILOT CHAMBER DOOR
                         
          Watts pounds in futile rage against the door.
                         
                          WATTS
           No!
                         
          The Juggernaut shudders as its systems power up.
                         
                         
          EXT. JUGGERNAUT - DUSK
                         
          The floor of the underground hangar begins to rise. The
          landing lights brighten, shining like a beacon into the sky.
           107.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK
                         
          On the bridge of the Magellan, Janek stares out. In the
          distance the Juggernaut rises out of the ground to eclipse
          the central pyramid.
                         
          Janek squints, trying to understand what he's seeing
                         
          A light races toward the Magellan down the canal: a rover.
                         
                         
          EXT. CANAL - DUSK
                         
          Watts steers the rover recklessly, hands locked on the
          controls. Rifle slung over her shoulder.
                         
                         
          INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK
                         
          Janek watches the rover come - and the Holloway Alien -
          boneless and white - unfolds itself from the instruments over
          his head.
                         
          Its goblin-shark jaw juts out. Sinks its horrific teeth into
          Janek's right shoulder.
                         
          Janek howls in agony. His right arm is paralyzed by the bite.
          He gropes at the pistol on his right hip with his left hand.
                         
          The Alien shakes him like a terrier killing a rat.
                         
          Janek gets the pistol. Flips it in his hand. Fires over his
          shoulder. Two, three rounds...
                         
          The bullets punch easily into the Alien - but the soft flesh
          closes easily over the wounds, sealing its white skin. Its
          teeth tighten.
                         
          Watts comes out of nowhere in her space suit. Swings a heavy
          rifle like a bat with all her strength. A crushing impact
          wrenches the Alien's jaws loose. It recoils.
                         
          Watts reverses the rifle. Pulls the trigger. A fusillade of
          bullets shreds the Alien's head. It collapses, dead.
                         
          Watts wrenches her helmet off. Rips a first-aid kit from the
          bulkhead and helps Janek to stanch the bleeding of his
          horrific wound. She gets the bleeding stopped. Wraps him in
          bandages.
                         
          Janek will live - but his right arm is useless.
                         
                          JANEK
           Thank you.
           108.
                         
                         
          He looks at the body of the dead Alien, which is sinking into
          the deck plates as acid eats away at the metal.
                         
                          WATTS
           The Juggernaut's lifting. There's a
           living Engineer on board. He's taking
           the ship to Earth.
                         
          Janek blinks at her. Uncomprehending.
                         
                          JANEK
           The others...?
                         
                          WATTS
           Dead. All dead. Janek. We have to stop
           that ship.
                         
          Janek stares out the Bridge window at the hulking Juggernaut
          in its column of light.
                         
          The nightfall storm front is rolling in, a tidal wave of
          darkness on the horizon. A swelling rumble.
                         
                          JANEK
           We're not a gunship.
                         
                          WATTS
           We have to do something. That ship is
           genocide if it gets to Earth...
                         
          Janek stares at her. Makes his decision. Struggles to stand.
                         
                          JANEK
           Get your helmet on.
                         
                          WATTS
           What about you?
                         
          He shakes his head. No. Watts helps him across the Bridge.
          Props him up in the Captain's seat.
                         
                          JANEK
           You'll have to be my hands.
           (stares out at the storm)
           You're sure about this.
                         
          Watts nods grimly. Desperate.
                         
                          WATTS
           Yes.
                         
                          JANEK

          He reaches out with his left hand. Flips switches. The ship
          shudders, awakening.

           Take the stick. Throttle up, stick
           forward.
                         
          Watts sends the Magellan careening toward the Juggernaut -
          just as the Juggernaut begins to float off the ground.

          The Magellan barrels toward the Juggernaut, skimming the
          ground, as the storm wall sweeps closer.

          The Juggernaut leaps into the sky.
                         
          The Magellan roars through the cyclone of dust in its wake.
          Barely avoids the pyramid. Rakes around in a screaming turn
          and climbs in pursuit, engines howling.

          The Magellan rolls into a howling climb. The storm catches up
          to them: wind and dust reducing visibility to zero. Darkness.
                         
          The Magellan's radar finds the Juggernaut. Paints it with
          targeting data on the Bridge window...
                         
          But the Juggernaut climbs too fast. Dwindling.

          In the pilot chair, the Sleeper convulses.
                         
          An ALIEN erupts from his chest. Big as a wolf even at its
          birth. Dark gray, armored, lethal. More hideous than any
          chestburster we've seen. An ULTRAMORPH. It wails hideously.
                         
          The Sleeper dies. The Alien slithers free.

          A colossal impact. The Juggernaut tumbles from the sky like a

          The ship's modules scatter. Some whole, others broken. They
          fall back into the storm. The Command Module - including the

          barrage across the Bridge.
                         
          Watts picks herself up. Finds the Module in free fall.
          Alarms wail. Lights flash. Escape pods pop open.
                         
          Watts looks at Janek. He is dead in his seat, impaled by a
          lethal fragment of glass.
                         
          The storm wall - a chain of hurricanes - rages below them.

          EXT. COMMAND MODULE (IN FREE FALL) - DUSK
                         
          Watts's pod - a steel coffin - shoots away on jets through
          the gale.
           112.
                         
                         
          The command module plunges through the storm, tumbling.
          SMASHES AGAINST THE GROUND in ruin.
                         
          The engine pods hurtle to the ground and go nuclear, sending
          walls of fire twisting through the hurricane.
                         
          The shockwaves tumble Watts's escape pod through the air.
                         
                         
          EXT. LV-426 - MAGELLAN CRASH SITE - DUSK
                         
          The pod lands, cushioned by a drag chute and retro rockets.
                         
          Watts pops the pod open, rising painfully to her feet in the
          storm. She surveys the destruction in disbelief.
                         
          A deep RUMBLE makes her turn.
                         
          The JUGGERNAUT ROLLS TOWARD HER - on edge -
                         
          A crushing wheel of death, big as a mountain.
                         
          She runs. Like a child in a nightmare.
                         
          The Juggernaut bears down on her.
                         
          She turns aside, trying to get out of its course. Even at a
          dead sprint she barely seems to move, it's so big...
                         
          The Juggernaut wobbles toward her. Slowing.
                         
          Exhausted, Watts collapses, gasping. The Juggernaut rolls to
          the earth, settling like a hoop right around her, Watts in
          the center.
                         
          The winds carry the dust clouds away.
                         
          Watts passes out, dropping her head to the Earth.
                         
                         
                         LATER
                         
          Watts is awakened by a beeping alarm. She looks at her wrist.
          Her suit flashes an oxygen warning: 20 MINUTES REMAINING.
                         
          She looks up.
                         
          The Juggernaut's doors are wide open in front of her.
                         
          The ULTRAMORPH ALIEN emerges from the Juggernaut. As large as
          a man already.
                         
          It sees her.
           113.
                         
                         
          With a sob of terror she pulls herself to her feet and runs.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAGELLAN CRASH SITE - DUSK
                         
          Watts flees through the storm, across the burning debris
          field. A wilderness of lightning, fire, and twisted metal. A
          thunderstorm with dust instead of rain.
                         
          She looks back through the darkness.
                         
          In a strobe-light flicker of lightning, she sees a gray demon
          approaching through the wreckage.
                         
          She scrambles through a section of ductwork...under a hull
          fragment...running and clambering...
                         
          The Alien hunts her, cat-and-mouse, among the fragments of
          the Magellan: corridors that go nowhere, shattered
          compartments. Jetsam.
                         
          Her eyes sweep frantically through the stormy night:
          searching for a weapon. A hiding place. An answer.
                         
          She stumbles into the remains of the Magellan's laboratory.
                         
          A hypersleep freezer lies on the barren ground. Watts climbs
          inside. Pulls the lid shut.
                         
          The Alien passes by, inches away. She watches it through the
          plexiglass, holding her breath.
                         
          The Alien roots in the wreckage. Finds the rotting Engineer's
          head among the shards of its vat. It begins to feed on the
          head - GROWING as she watches.
                         
          Her suit's oxygen alarm goes off again. 15 MINUTES REMAINING.
          The beeping draws the Alien away from its dead meat.
                         
          Watts is paralyzed.
                         
          The Alien noses closer. Sniffs at the plexiglass case. With
          sudden, horrific violence, it lashes out. Sends the freezer
          flying. Watts tumbles out. Lurches to her feet and runs.
                         
          The Alien follows. Ravening. She leads it a twisting chase
          through fragments of burning metal.
                         
          Watts trips and falls hard. Picking herself up, she sees
          she's tripped over a HULL SAW - the same diamond-bladed tool
          DAVID used to dismantle the terraforming engine.
                         
          She seizes the saw - straining to manage its weight. Hides in
          the hollow of a massive girder.
           114.
                         
                         
          The Alien passes by. Scenting the air. She freezes. Her arms
          trembling with the weight of the saw. Waiting for it to pass.
                         
          Almost it leaves. But a tiny rattle of metal from the
          quivering saw brings it back.
                         
          Out of options, Watts powers up the saw. The blade whines up
          to speed. They lunge at one another in the same moment.
                         
          The diamond blade shears off one of the Alien's claws.
                         
          The monster screams and recoils.
                         
          Its lashing tail sends Watts sprawling. She loses the saw.
                         
          The Alien comes after her, slinking low to the ground,
          injured arm tucked to its chest. All vengeful fury.
                         
          Watts scrambles for the saw. The Alien leaps for her. She
          rolls aside - and like a scorpion the Alien impales her thigh
          with its spear-tipped tail. Nails her to the ground.
                         
          Watts screams in agony. Reaches for the saw, still buzzing on
          the ground. Its grip tantalizing inches from her fingertips.
                         
          The Alien stoops over her, slavering face inches from her
          faceplate. Its hideous jaws open.
                         
          With all her strength, Watts pulls against the spike in her
          leg. Drags the point of the spear through the dirt.
          Excruciating pain. She snarls through her teeth.
                         
          The Alien strikes - just as Watts GRABS the saw.
                         
          She meets the Alien's head with the buzzing blade.
                         
          IMPALES THE ALIEN'S SKULL.
                         
          A gout of green acid onto Watts's helmet.
                         
          The Alien falls aside, thrashing its death-throes, the saw
          still growling.
                         
          Watts sees ACID COMING THROUGH HER HELMET - fast.
                         
          With frantic haste she unlatches her helmet. Wrenches it off
          as it crumples and melts.
                         
          She stands bare-headed in the toxic air. Desperate, she looks
          around with tearing eyes.
                         
          In the distance she sees an intact module of the Magellan.
                         
          She runs for it. Slaps the door switch. Incredibly, it opens.
           115.
                         
                         
          INT. VICKERS MODULE
                         
          Watts steps inside. The airlock closes behind her.
                         
          She finds herself staring at a grand piano. She's in
          Vickers's suite. Its amenities intact, through the floor's a
          few degrees off level. She takes a breath. Good air.
                         
          She walks around. Turning things on. Lights. Music. Surreal
          comforts. She drinks water from the tap.
                         
          She opens the door to Vickers's secret room. Military space
          suits. Rifles. Ammunition.
                         
          A crackle from the room's intercom.

          DAVID's head lies battered in a dark corner of the wrecked
          Juggernaut. Eyes staring into the shadows.
                         
                          DAVID
           I know you're there. I can hear the
           beacon of your suit.

          Watts strips off her space suit wearily. Sits on the bed.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           I'd like to propose an arrangement. I
           can be repaired. I can talk you
           through it.
                         
          Watts shakes her head wearily.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           I think you'll find I can be of use to
           you.
                         
          Watts walks to the intercom and switches it off.

          The storm has passed. The fragments of the Magellan no longer
          burn. The gray world of LV-426 restored.
                         
          The wreck of the Juggernaut looms in the misty distance.
                         
          Watts walks through the wreckage in a military space suit.
          Rifle on her shoulder. Pistol on her hip.
                         
          She pulls a cargo dolly loaded with salvage.
                         
                         
          EXT. VICKERS MODULE - DAY
                         
          Watts arrives at the Vickers module. The ultramorph Alien's
          head has been fixed like a grisly trophy above the door.
                         
                         
          INT. VICKERS'S SUITE (SHIPWRECK) - DAY
                         
          Watts strips off her space suit. She helps herself to a glass
          of vodka from the bar.
                         
          A chessboard sits atop the grand piano: a game in progress.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           I've decided. Rook takes Bishop.
                         
          Watts nods. Makes the move on the board. Says nothing.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)

           I'm not going to fix you, DAVID. I
           don't need you. I'll hold out. A ship
           will come.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)
           I'm certain. But who will send it?
           Men? Or Engineers?
                         
          Watts falls silent. She stares unhappily at the chessboard.
                         
           DAVID (V.O.)
                          (FILTERED)

          The massive central pyramid rises in the midst of the
          Engineer complex.
                         
          With a BOOM, a bright beam of light shines forth from its
          peak, punching straight up through the clouds like a laser.
                         
                         
          VARIOUS PYRAMIDS - AROUND LV-426

          sky with their brightness.

          red god in the background.
                         
          Two dozen beams of light rise from the moon, visible even
          from space. A beacon. A signal.
                         
          A beginning.

               With the sound of wind, of sand gritting against glass:

               FADE UP ON:

               A howling dust storm battering the doors and walls of a tiny 
               woodplank church.

               Inside, huddled together against the rage outside, are a 
               small group of people. All in black, mostly elderly, they 
               kneel in prayer.

               Before them, on the cramped altar, lies a man. Dressed in 
               the uniform of a general, surrounded by the silk softness of 
               his casket.

               He's an old man, far from the crump of battles, consumed now 
               with stillness, listening to the prayers of old people. Of 
               desert wind, moaning through thin wood.

               The candle beside his head flickers and wanes in the ceaseless 
               gusts, strains for life, then goes out.

               It's not the best part of town and probably never was. A 
               place of seedy, anonymous brick flophouses shackled by rusting 
               fire escapes, lying on an alley unique only for its bad 
               drainage. It's here, in the dim, flinty light, that a figure 
               enters.

               Wearing a long coat and, despite the night, sunglasses, he 
               pauses on the slimy asphalt and gazes up the sides of the 
               flophouses, to their yellowish windows and competing Mexican 
               radio stations. One window, dark and quiet on the third floor, 
               catches his gaze.

               There's a metal hand railing in the alley that the long-coated 
               figure effortlessly pops up onto. Sunglasses focused on the 
               window, he lowers himself into a motionless crouch, a perch, 
               on the railing with the ease of a crow. Or a gargoyle.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Dawn is a muddled, limp thing that does nothing to improve 
               the alley. The figure is still there, a motionless gargoyle 
               perched on the railing. Watching the window.

               The shadows shorten, the air grows warmer, and now there's 
               movement behind the window.

               The sunglassed gargoyle drops down off the railing, jumps up 
               to the first rung of the fire escape, and begins climbing.

               BEHIND THE THIRD FLOOR WINDOW

               Is a room as grim as we expect. Lumpy iron bed, sink that's 
               been pissed into one too many times, and SIMON; a man in a 
               tight sweater and dark sunglasses, busily emptying his pockets 
               on the ruined dresser: loose change, a town paper's obituary 
               column.

               Simon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body 
               stifffening. He whips around to face the window just as it 
               EXPLODES into fragments.

               The gargoyle LEAPS into the room on the trail of glass. Simon 
               spins and THROWS himself against the intruder. The two 
               STRUGGLE savagely across the room, SMASHING chairs.

               Simon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and POUNDS the 
               back of his skull against the wall. The gargoyle gets his 
               locked fists up and SWINGS them like a war club, SMACKING 
               Simon's face and SPRAWLING him backwards onto the bed.

               The two, across the room for each other, pause.

                                     GARGOYLE
                         Where is it?

               Simon's climbed to his feet, the two men in sunglasses now 
               walking slow circles around each other.

                                     SIMON
                         Leave me alone.

                                     GARGOYLE
                         You've found it, haven't you?

                                     SIMON
                         Fuck you.

               The gargoyle drops his head and DRIVES himself into Simon, 
               who HAMMERS the gargoyle with his fists. Blood SMEARS.

               The gargoyle's gotten free a knife that he JAMS into Simon's 
               leg. Pressing home his advantage, the gargoyle SLAMS Simon 
               up against the wall. He TEARS open Simon's shirt, digging 
               his fingers into the chest, RIPPING the skin aside, the first 
               plunging deep, CRACKING the sternum bone, pushing even 
               further, toward the blood gouged pumping beneath --

               -- Simon PLOWS his knee up between the gargoyle's legs. Over 
               and over. Till the grip loosens and Simon SHOVES him to one 
               side, using the momentum and drives to SWING the body around 
               and at the shattered window. The gargoyle SMACKS the frame 
               and COLLAPSES, his head CRACKING on the sill and FORCING a 
               shard of glass through his neck.

               Simon moves to the window and brushes aside the gargoyle's 
               sunglasses, revealing two totally empty eye sockets. Pushing 
               his thumbs into them, Simon uses the leverage to lift the 
               gargoyle off the sill and push his body out the window.

               The gargoyle bounces once on the fire escape, then spread-
               eagles thirty feet to the asphalt.

               Somebody turns up their Mexican radio station.

               The gargoyle's a wreck.

               But he manages, slowly -- his shattered remains arguing every 
               inch -- to climb first to his knees, then miserably to his 
               feet. A bent, splattered, hopeless thing that manages to 
               stumble three or four feet before being HIT by a freeway-
               speed firebird BOMBING down the alley.

               The impact PINS the gargoyle to the grill and RAMS him into 
               a brick wall, CRUSHING a chest that BELCHES out a sickly, 
               bruised heart like a wet rag against the firebird's 
               windshield.

               THREE FLOORS ABOVE

               Simon leans against his splintered window and looks down at 
               the pinned and very finished body of the gargoyle. His own 
               shirt and pants are a mess of torn blood and his breathing 
               is difficult. Pain flashes across his forehead as he checks 
               that his own sunglasses still sit snugly on the bridge of 
               his nose.

               At the sound of a distant siren Simon turns and quickly 
               finishes packing his duffle bag. Stiffly pulling on an 
               oversize surplus army jacket that partly conceals the damage 
               beneath, he picks up the bag and painfully shuffles out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The gargoyle, still pinned to the wall by the firebird.

               A FLASH bounces off his skin. Then another. He's being 
               photographed. Go wide and find him in the middle of a police 
               investigation. Bored blue uniforms, yellow barrier tape. The 
               usual.

               A plain jane sedan pulls up and deposits THOMAS DAGGET, 
               thirties, tweed coat and steel notebook. He smiles at a couple 
               of cops, ducks under the yellow barrier, and nods a greeting 
               to an older uniform sergeant, BURROWS.

                                     THOMAS DAGGET
                         Hey.

                         spelled rain for sure, but it's turned 
                         into a beautiful day, wouldn't you 
                         say, Sergeant Burrows?

               Thomas takes a deep, healthy breath. Burrows just stares at 
               him.

                                     BURROWS

               The sun sinking beneath the horizon of a vast and undulating 
               expanse of desert.

               Travel through the landscape as the sky purples and darkens 
               and silhouettes tall, finger-like spires of volcanic rock. 
               Hear the coyotes, the wind making its constant, probing 
               search. Before the night swallows it all whole,

               Come upon The Town.

               It used to be something. But that's long gone. Now, wrapped 
               in the sucking blackness of a wilderness night, it's a shell 
               of a place.

               Lights still burn in some of the windows but fool no one. 
               The ghosts are the majority here. Biding their time. Waiting 
               for The Town to surrender and slip beneath the waves of the 
               desert.

               The wind slinks over the hills, creeps down past boarded-up 
               storefronts, skeletal ocitillo, and the rusting hulks of 
               abandoned mining equipment. The corpse of a summer's kite 
               twists slowly on a power line.

               ON THE EDGE OF TOWN

               From the inky oblivion of the road, comes a crunch of gravel.

               ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN

               Stands a large, nineteenth century brick schoolhouse. An 
               icon from a more prosperous past, its dark massiveness was 
               meant for scores of ruddy-faced miner's kids. Now it seems 
               to be imploding, eating itself with creeping decay. On this 
               night it is silent and dark but for a small glow in one corner 
               and the faint sound of children's voices in song.

               It is a hymn. An ancient, Latin one. The melancholy beauty 
               of voices rising and falling in choir.

               INSIDE THE BUILDING

               Is a school auditorium. On the stage, dwarfed by it, are 
               twenty five students from first grade to high school, singing 
               together as a choir. A young woman, KATHERINE, directs their 
               acapella voices as the small group of parents, lonely in the 
               huge room, look on.

               OUTSIDE

               The voices drift on the night, down the road, and lap against 
               the peeling facade of a storefront. A mortuary.

               INSIDE

               The rooms are dark but for one. There, bathed in the 
               flickering light of a tall candle, lies the body of the old 
               general we saw at the opening.

               THE FRONT DOOR

               Of the mortuary has a locked handle that jiggles from outside. 
               A small panes of glass beside it is BROKEN by a hand.

               IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

               Young voices struggle with the complicated hymn and its pain 
               of centuries. Faces white, Mexican, Navaho. Katherine guides 
               them with soft hands. She smiles in pride. They smile back. 
               Proud. Of her. Of themselves and the beauty coming from their 
               mouths.

               One small, beautiful navaho girl, MARY, maybe eight, gets a 
               special smile of special friendship from Katherine.

               THE MORTUARY'S

               Front door now stands ajar in the darkness. Small shards of 
               glass glisten in the carpet.

               INSIDE

               Is the dead General. Even in the bleached ravages of age and 
               death, his face still holds a shadow of vigor and pride.

               It takes a moment in the weak flicker of the candle to realize 
               someone is there with him. Simon in his oversized surplus 
               jacket. His arms are folded tightly across his middle, as if 
               in deep cold. But his gaunt face is moist with sweat and his 
               breath is shallow and uneven. He stares at the old man behind 
               sunglasses and takes slow, cautious steps forward into the 
               amber glow.

               Holding out two blood-stained fingers, Simon touches the 
               General's forehead. A new strain crosses his perspiring face. 
               Concentration.

               Placing his right palm on the General's chin and the left on 
               his forehead, Simon CRACKS OPEN the dead man's mouth.

               IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

               The hymn is reaching its aching climax of medieval longing.

               IN THE MORTUARY

               Simon leans down to the open mouth, and in a voice soft and 
               deeply weary,

                                     SIMON
                         Qui ex Patre Flioque procedit...

               Then, with the school choir distant and faint in the night, 
               the living man places his mouth over that of the dead man...

               IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

               It's coffee and cake now as parents proudly hug their children 
               and congratulate their young teacher. Even in this gloomy, 
               crumbling building it's a warm, small town moment.

               OUTSIDE

               Simon has left the mortuary and now limps with difficulty 
               through the silent streets, leaning against shop walls for 
               support.

               AT THE SCHOOL BUILDING

               Through the doors out steps the eight year old Navaho girl, 
               Mary. Alone, she stands on the stone stairs and looks out 
               into the night with sensitive eyes. She concentrates. Knows.

               Katherine follows her out.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Hey bright eyes, what's the deal 
                         being out here all alone without a 
                         coat?

               The girl's eyes seem too serious for a child's. Too 
               perceptive.

                                     MARY
                         Someone's here.

               Katherine looks out into the night.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Where?

               Mary stares a moment longer, then becomes a child again, 
               smiling and popping Katherine one on the arm.

                                     MARY
                         Pig out on all the cake?

                                     KATHERINE
                         Oh, there might be one, tiny, skinny 
                         piece left, but you're gonna have to 
                         race me for it.

               Mary suddenly points past Katherine's shoulder.

                                     MARY
                         What's that?

               When Katherine turns Mary dashes back into the building.

                                     MARY
                         Ha!

                                     KATHERINE
                         You little sneak!

               Katherine chases after her.

               AT THAT MOMENT

               Simon comes limping up from the road. His breathing's bad 
               now as he moves stiffly along the school's brick walls, coming 
               to an old, rusty back door he creaks open and slides through.

               INSIDE

               He climbs a littered and disused staircase, past broken beer 
               bottles and condom wrappers to a dark and creaky second floor.

               It's part of the school building long abandoned. Doors to 
               classrooms lie half off their hinges, windows are broken, 
               rats squeak between ancient desks stacked like funeral pyres.

               Simon, his breath echoing in the cold darkness, shuffles 
               along the broken linoleum till he comes to a rectangle cut 
               in the wall where a row of lockers used to be. He crawls 
               into the space and there, surrounded by rot, curls up on 
               himself and sucks his thumb.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. APARTMENT

               Thomas Dagget's eyes opening slowly. He sits up in his bed, 
               runs a hand through his hair, and looks out with only medium 
               enthusiasm at the morning.

               INT. CHURCH

               Thomas lights an offering candle and kneels for a brief, 
               silent prayer. He crosses himself, stands, and walks for the 
               door. Before leaving he glances back at the altar. A 
               questioning moment between two akward, estranged friends.

               INT. POLICE CENTER

               Thomas sits at his desk half-heartily trying to make sense 
               of the three dozen files piled there. Lt. Paul, his boss, 
               leans against a wall nearby.

               INT. CORONER'S OFFICE

               A set of golf clubs rest forelornly in the corner. An 
               irritable looking coroner fumes behind his desk as Thomas 
               enters.

               The coroner just stares at him.

                         Sit.

               Thomas obeys as the coroner spreads out a stack of white 
               sheets.

                                     CORONER

                         All right. To begin with, your man 
                         has no eyes.

                         No, he never had any eyes. We checked 
                         the sockets. There's no optic nerve,

                         We also did a toxicology on his blood: 
                         High sodium, elevated selenium, no

                         that much trouble since most of them 
                         were sticking out of his chest anyway.

                         When babies grow up their bones get 
                         larger by adding calcium layers over 
                         the interior haversham canals. Child 
                         growth isn't uniform though, comes 
                         in spurts that always leave growth 
                         rings in the bone. Everybody has 
                         them -- except your man. That would, 
                         to a hasty observer, seem to indicate 
                         he had never been a child.

                         you.

               The coroner opens his desk and pulls out a small, ancient 
               looking leather bound book.

               INT. POLICE OFFICE

               Thomas at his desk, working under a lone gooseneck lamp. 
               He's translating the fourteenth chapter of St. John's 
               Revelations from Latin onto a slip of paper. Finished, he 
               sets the ancient bible down, turns off the gooseneck, and 
               leans back in his chair, alone in the dark.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DESERT - EARLY MORNING

               Here, outside The Town, horizons are distant, faraway things. 
               The sky overhead is streaked red and blue with barely morning 
               as the screen door of a simple stucco house swings open. 
               It's Katherine, the teacher. Wearing levis and boots, she 
               carries a saddle swung over one denim shoulder out to a corral 
               behind the house where a horse shuffles and whinnies 
               impatiently.

                                     KATHERINE
                         In a minute, in a minute...

               Katherine throws the saddle over the horse and cinches it 
               down as the sun, still tucked behind pink and grey cliffs, 
               begins to heat up the sky.

               EXT. SANDSTONE CANYON - MORNING

               Deep and narrow, an idyllic canyon of compressed sandstone 
               walls smoothed, rounded and etched by centuries of wind. A 
               tiny creek flows past weak banks of scrub pine and pocked 
               sycamore. A silent place a long way and a long time from 
               anything but the approach of galloping hooves.

               Katherine and her horse run full-out through the canyon, the 
               clack and splash of hooves echoing off steep, shadowed walls. 
               Horse and rider drive each other harder and harder, their 
               hot breath brief clouds in the arch, thin desert air.

               Boulders shattered by winter cold and summer heat, deep wind-
               cut caves hiding scorpions, sidewinders, or a wary mountain 
               lion all pass as in a blur; arrogant hawks and patient 
               buzzards, ruins of thousand year old Anasazi villages high 
               on the cliffs, their weather-beaten skulls, seen and unseen, 
               staring out; everything is one smear of color and smell as 
               Katherine gallops past them and up the cliff trail, out of 
               the canyon, and onto the main plateau.

               ON THE PLATEAU

               Katherine strokes her horse and feeds it a bag of carrots. 
               She pulls a thermos from the pack, sits down against some 
               old man rocks, and with the coffee steaming in her hand, 
               greets the sun now cresting the Chuska Mountains.

               There's a rutted, silty dirt road nearby. An ancient, battered 
               school bus rattles its way past and stops. The bus driver, a 
               Navaho, JOHN, climbs down and rubbing the side of his head 
               painfully walks up to Katherine.

                                     JOHN
                         You could save my life with some 
                         coffee.

               He holds out an empty cup Katherine fills. Sipping painfully, 
               he lays down beside her and pulls the brim of his baseball 
               cap over his eyes.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Tough night?

                                     JOHN
                         You don't want to hear about it.
                              (peeks out hopefully)
                         Or maybe you do.

                                     KATHERINE
                         No thanks.

                                     JOHN
                         Just checking.

               The bus is full of young school kids.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Shouldn't they be getting to school?

                                     JOHN
                         Impromptu field trip. I'm broadening 
                         their minds. And sparing them the 
                         sight of their beloved chauffeur 
                         barfing his guts out.

               Katherine's horse snorts.

                                     JOHN
                         I hate horses. How was the canyon? 
                         Honey-suckle out yet?

                                     KATHERINE
                         Didn't see any.

                                     JOHN
                         I hate that canyon. I hate this this 
                         whole plateau. Too many goddamn 
                         ghosts. Leave it to them I say. San 
                         Diego, that's where I'm going. Or 
                         Oxnard. I like the sound of that. Ox-
                         nard.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I'm happy here.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh lord protect us, another romantic 
                         pale face in love with the desert.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Just got to give it a chance.

                                     JOHN
                         Try growing up here.
                              (tries word out on 
                              tongue)
                         Ox-nard.
                              (sticks out coffee 
                              cup)
                         Uno mas, see-boo-play.
                              (she pours)
                         Speaking of romantic pale faces, the 
                         rumor mill is in high gear again.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Who this time?

                                     JOHN
                         That funny looking guy from Window 
                         Rock. The BIA lawyer.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (non-committal)
                         Huh.

                                     JOHN
                         No! Say it isn't so!

                                     KATHERINE
                         It isn't so.

                                     JOHN
                         Thank you.

               He finishes the coffee and climbs painfully to his feet.

                                     JOHN
                         Thanks for the joe.

                                     KATHERINE
                         No prob.

                                     JOHN
                         You're a credit to the community.

               He shuffles back to the bus.

                                     JOHN
                         All right children, looks sharp! 
                         This is a school day! And no talking 
                         loud!

               The bus coughs alive and crawls forward. Katherine waves to 
               the faces behind glass, then settles back for a last moment 
               of peace as silence lays again over the land.

               EXT. KATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY

               Showered and changed into her teaching clothes, Katherine 
               climbs into a rattling pickup.

               EXT. THE TOWN

               Katherine drives to work, passing on the outskirts the closed 
               copper mine, vast and abandoned. Down beyond the fading main 
               street lies the great crumbling brick pile that is the school. 
               Katherine parks her truck, grabs her leather bag, and walks 
               in.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Katherine's lecturing her students. All twenty-five of them. 
               There's high school age sons of white ranchers, Navaho girls 
               on the edge of puberty, tiny Mexican children. All being 
               taught together in one room.

               It's dinosaur day. Katherine has a large fossilized bone on 
               her lap.

                                     KATHERINE
                         This is "Camposaurus". Camposaurus 
                         was a herbavore, which meant he only 
                         ate plants. Camposaur stayed mostly 
                         to himself and never bothered anyone.

               The little girls smile. They like Camposaurus. Katherine 
               holds up another bone fragment.

                                     KATHERINE
                         This is a leg fragment that belongs 
                         to the killer of the plateau, 
                         Alosaurus. Alosaurus was a vicious 
                         carnivore, which meant he'd eat 
                         anything that moved, especially nice, 
                         juicy Camposaurs.

               The little boys grin. They like Alosaurus.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Both these guys lived together right 
                         here on the White Rock plateau eighty 
                         million years ago, when this area 
                         used to be on the banks of a huge, 
                         shallow sea. Remember how we talked 
                         about how sedimentation fossilizes 
                         bones? That's also what made the 
                         hills out behind our town and put 
                         the copper in the ground.

                                     HIGH SCHOOL KID
                         Lot of good that did us.

               Katherine lifts off the desk an ancient 1950s gieger counter 
               and switches it on. It ticks softly when she points it at 
               the dino bone.

                                     BOY
                         It's radioactive! Like Godzilla!

                                     KATHERINE
                         Just a tiny bit, Alex. Do you know 
                         why? Uranium, that's the rock they 
                         use in nuclear power plants --

                                     BOY
                         And bombs!

                                     KATHERINE
                         And bombs Alex, yes, is all through 
                         these hills naturally. Millions of 
                         years ago the dinosaurs here ate 
                         plants and drank water which had 
                         uranium in it that became concentrated 
                         in their bones, which is exactly 
                         how, with Mr. Geiger counter here, 
                         we're going to find some.

               The class CHEERS.

               EXT. HILL - DAY

               With the brick schoolhouse tiny in the background, Katherine's 
               class trudges its way up the barren, rocky hillside behind 
               the town. The teenage rancher's kids try to make time with 
               the Mexican girls One of the little boys has gotten into a 
               shoving match with a little girl.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (coming between them)
                         -- Hey. Come on. What's the deal, 
                         Brian?

               The girl folds her arms defiantly. The boy is pissed, 
               embarrassed.

                                     BRIAN
                         She...

                                     KATHERINE
                         Yes?

                                     BRIAN
                         ...She, she called me a "Dick Head".

                                     KATHERINE
                         Sandra?

                                     SANDRA
                         Well, he is.

                                     KATHERINE
                         All right, Brian. You get one free 
                         insult. Make it good.

               Brian concentrates.

                                     PAUL
                         You... You're a... Cow Demon!

                                     KATHERINE
                              (beat)
                         Uh... Okay. Everybody satisfied?
                              (looks at Brian)
                         Cow Demon?

               UP ON THE HILL

               Katherine's given the geiger counter to the little Navaho 
               girl, Mary. Focusing grimly on the rock in front of her, 
               Mary guides the detector over the stones till suddenly it 
               begins clicking softly.

                                     MARY
                         I got one! I got one!

               The high school kids come up and help dig.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Easy... Easy... Don't break it.

               Almost immediately, an eye socket appears in the dust.

               As the students carefully brush away the dust, Katherine 
               looks back across the crumbly path. A coyote has crept up 
               onto a near ledge. It just stands there. Watching her.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BIG CITY CHURCH

               It's mostly empty at this time of day and the young man 
               sitting in the pew, staring at the altar, is alone. His name 
               is GABRIEL and he wears jeans, a faded leather jacket, and 
               dark sunglasses, even inside. His thin hair is slicked back 
               and there's an almost feminine quality about him.

               He sits there a moment longer, staring, then gets up and 
               leaves.

               EXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEY

               The alley from the beginning. Gabriel pulls his old, 
               convertible rambler to a stop and walks into the flophouse.

               INT. FLOPHOUSE

               He comes upstairs to the landing, where the door to the room 
               is covered with a strip of yellow tape: POLICE INVESTIGATION. 
               DO NOT ENTER.

               Gabriel pulls the tape aside and KICKS the door open.

               INSIDE

               It's still the disaster we remember. Gabriel walks slowly 
               through the room. He scratches up some blood, tastes it.

               There's spray-painted outlines where the police have removed 
               certain items. Gabriel takes note of this, tastes the blood 
               again, and leaves.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. KATHERINE'S CLASSROOM BUILDING - DAY

               It's lunch break. Most of the students sit in loose cliques 
               around the front of the building; eating, skipping rope, 
               picking fights.

               INSIDE

               The recently unearthed skull sits on Katherine's desk. Feet 
               up beside it, she leans back in her chair looking through a 
               dinosaur book. One of her students, a twelve year old boy, 
               finishes cleaning up the floor and stands beside her.

                                     BOY
                         I'm all done with the cleaning, Miss 
                         Henley.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Thank you, Jason. I appreciate it.

                                     BOY
                              (looking at book over 
                              her shoulder)
                         Find out what it is, yet?

                                     KATHERINE
                         Well, it's either a 44 million year 
                         old Strychtosaurus or that cow Mr. 
                         Sorenson lost last winter.

               The boy, still standing beside her, begins to look nervous. 
               Slowly, he lets his weight rest against Katherine's shoulder. 
               She smiles good naturedly up at him.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Go eat your lunch, Jason.

               The boy immediately stiffens and begins backing up, almost 
               relieved.

                                     BOY
                         Sure, Miss Henley. Thanks. See ya.

               Katherine watches him leave, smiles again, and goes back to 
               the book.

               AROUND THE BACK OF THE BUILDING

               On the abandoned back stairs, a couple of Mexican boys sit 
               smoking cigarettes. They whistle and kid with the four young 
               girls that pass them going up the steps.

               UPSTAIRS

               Is the abandoned, decayed part of the building. The four 
               girls know they're not supposed to be here and that's probably 
               half the fun. They run through the crumbling halls, giggling 
               and hiding from one another. Their cries, the smack of their 
               shoes, echo off off the peeling halls.

               One of them is Mary, running down a hall, banging a stick 
               with another girl. At a corner Mary peels off from her friend, 
               runs down a new hall, turns a corner,

               And comes on Simon. He's still curled where we last saw him, 
               in the wall niche where some lockers used to be. The two 
               stare at one another. Finally,

                                     MARY
                         Hi.

                                     SIMON
                         Hi.

                                     MARY
                         What's your name?

                                     SIMON
                         Simon.

                                     MARY
                         You don't look so good, Simon.

                                     SIMON
                         No, I don't.

                                     MARY
                         I'm Mary.

                                     SIMON
                         Hello Mary.

                                     MARY
                         Does Miss Henley know you're here?

                                     SIMON
                         No one does, Mary. Can we keep it 
                         just our secret. For a little while?

               Mary thinks.

                                     MARY
                         Okay.

               You can hear her friends coming closer.

                                     MARY
                         I have to go.

                                     SIMON
                         It was nice meeting you, Mary.

               Mary goes to leave, stops, turns back.

                                     MARY
                         Are you hungry? I could bring 
                         something.

                                     SIMON
                         That would be very nice.

                                     MARY
                         Okay. Bye.

               She smiles and runs down the hall. Simon grits his teeth, 
               turns to the wall, and prepares himself for a long, long 
               day.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               An old fifties two-level, Polynesian lamps and glitter stucco, 
               now faded and browinish with water stains. Gabriel, the young 
               man with the sunglasses and leather jacket we last saw kicking 
               down the door at the flophouse, walks up the apartment's 
               stairs to the second level, knocks once, and opens the door.

               THE APARTMENT INSIDE

               Hasn't been very well looked after lately. Either has the 
               occupant. Sitting slumped in a kitchen chair, staring at the 
               floor, he peers through dully yellow eyes that barely seem 
               to register his visitor.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Gee Jerry, you look like shit.

               The eyes lift to Gabriel, revealing a pale, bloodless face 
               eaten with dried sores.

                                     JERRY
                         Leave me alone, Gabriel.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Soon, pal. Soon.

               Gabriel drops into the chair across from Jerry and pushes 
               aside with distaste the maggot-ridden plates of food piled 
               on the table. He reaches his hand out to Jerry.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Come here.

                                     JERRY
                         Go away.

                                     GABRIEL
                              (sing-song, like to a 
                              baby)
                         Come here...

               Gabriel puts his hand under Jerry's chin and turns the face 
               side to side, examining the cracked, decaying skin and filmy 
               eyes.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hmmm. Still a little life left in 
                         you. Barely.

                                     JERRY
                         Fuck you.

               Gabriel releases Jerry's chin and slouches down in the chair.

                                     GABRIEL
                         There's something I want you to do 
                         for me.

                                     JERRY
                         What a surprise.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Don't be that way.

                                     JERRY
                         I just want to... Why won't you let 
                         me...

                                     GABRIEL
                         I will, I will. Promise.

               A dark, intestinal looking amber fluid begins to pool out of 
               Jerry's pant leg.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You need some new clothes, son.

               A tear wells in Jerry's decomposing face.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Aw come on, don't start. You know 
                         how I hate that...

                                     JERRY
                         I'm so tired. I'm so goddamn tired.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Watch the profanity. -- Just one 
                         more favor. Honest.

                                     JERRY
                              (deep sigh)
                         What?

                                     GABRIEL
                         I want you to get something for me. 
                         A few personal effects the cops ripped 
                         off from the lovely Allenwood Arms 
                         on Seventh Street. It'll be sitting 
                         in their property room down on San 
                         Julian.

                                     JERRY
                         I'm supposed to just go in there? 
                         Like this?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Give you a bath, put on some decent 
                         clothes,
                              (beat)
                         Maybe a very large brim hat, you'll 
                         be fine. Just go in between five and 
                         five-ten, it's a shift change and 
                         nobody'll notice you.

                                     JERRY
                         How do you know?

                                     GABRIEL
                              (cocks an eye)
                         C'mon.
                              (tosses yellow ID 
                              card onto table)
                         This should be more or less up to 
                         date.

                                     JERRY
                         Got a name this stuff is under?

                                     GABRIEL
                         John Doe.

                                     JERRY
                         Why doesn't that surprise me.

               Gabriel gets up, pats Jerry on the head, and walks to the 
               door.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I'll see you tonight.
                              (flips him silver 
                              dollar)
                         Here's some bus fare.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The SLAM of a racquetball against the scarred white wall of 
               an indoor court. It ricochets off the ceiling, hits the back 
               glass partition, and is SLAMMED again. Four players, including 
               Thomas, grunt and sweat across the hardwood floor. It's 
               brutal. Shoulders and knees bang off one another.

               One of the players falls back, yells to Thomas.

                                     PLAYER
                         Cover me! Cover me!

               Thomas dives into position to make the save, recovers, and 
               yells to the player as he dashes to the next corner.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Pop it up!

               The player SLAMS it brutally at Thomas, who misses miserably.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Thanks a lot.

               Another player picks up the dead ball and puts his arm around 
               Thomas.

                                     PLAYER #2
                         You're missing the point of the game, 
                         Thomas. You must absolutely trust no

               Thomas and Player #2 team up on a third player, pressing him 
               hard. Suddenly Thomas breaks back, intercepts the ball, and 
               drives against Player #2. The about-face is too abrupt for 
               him and Player #2 is eliminated in a double-cross. He smiles 
               proudly at Thomas.

                         was a second war. That's news to me.

                         Oh, it's a fairly common theological 
                         debate. Or was. The idea that if 
                         Christ is God's son, does that make 
                         him less than God or are they the 
                         same being in different forms. That 
                         very argument almost tore the early 
                         Christian church apart in the 4th 
                         Century. That was the good old days 
                         when people actually worried about 
                         theology. Anyway, it was settled 
                         when the bishops of the world got to 
                         together at the Council of Nicene in 
                         325 and hashed out the various 
                         interpretations of scripture into a 
                         uniform dogma of belief. The result 
                         was the Nicene Creed, which basically 
                         said that Christ was in fact the 
                         same as God and was owed the same 
                         power and respect as the Father. 
                         That they were the same.

               The building is squat and brick. A non-descrip warehouse 
               that subs as a police evidence storage area.

               The sun is hard today as it beats down on Jerry's large-
               brimmed felt hat. Daylight and Jerry don't get along very 
               well. His sunken, filmy eyes squint at its glare. The decayed 
               flesh cracking along his cheeks flames at its touch. He 
               shuffles down the sidewalk, the brackish, amber fluid that 
               gurgles down his leg filling his shoes and leaving behind 
               shiny wet footprints like a snail.

               There's nobody around the back door and its unlocked. Jerry's 
               shrunken claws pull it open.

               all shoe boxes and dusty files. Fragments of small lives 
               forgotten.

               Jerry pulls the brim of his hat down even further as he works 
               his way past rack after rack. The single uniform he meets 
               looks only casually at Jerry's lapel ID badge. It's on the 
               third shelf he finds it. John Doe #78. Jerry lifts the box

               Tiled floor and refrigerated corpses. Nobody's around when 
               Gabriel enters. He walks over to a file cabinet and removes 
               a thick folder. Then he walks to the big filing cabinets, 
               the ones that hold a body in each drawer. He strolls along, 
               tapping each label till he finds the one he's looking for, 
               slides it open, and looks down at the naked body of the 
               gargoyle.

               He's been sewed back together. Kind of. Gabriel grabs the 
               eyeless corpse under the armpits and drags him out onto the 
               floor where he pushes the legs together and outstretches the 
               arms, like a crucifix. From his coat Gabriel takes out a 
               small vial of oil and rubs it onto the gargoyle's feet and 
               hands. Anointing them. Then with the tip of his finger, he 
               draws a faint sign of the cross on the forehead, stands, and 
               walks for the door.

               In the background, as Gabriel leaves, we see the body of the 
               gargoyle BURST into flame.

               a head count, then stops a young boy coming through the door.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Brian, have you seen Mary?

                                     BRIAN
                         I think she's out back somewhere.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (to girl)
                         Allison?

                                     ALLISON
                         We haven't seen her since lunch.

                                     KATHERINE
                         We're you guys up in the...

               The girls, Mary's friends, shrug innocently. Katherine sighs.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Okay everybody, get started on today's 
                         reading. Quietly. I'll be right back.

               Katherine closes the door behind her. The class immediately 
               erupts into goofing off. The door opens again.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I mean quiet.

               IN THE ABANDONED PART OF THE BUILDING

               Katherine walks through decayed and rusting halls.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (calls out)
                         Mary...

               It's spooky up here. A part of the building Katherine clearly 
               dislikes.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Mary...
                              (to herself)
                         Shit.

               Katherine calls out Mary's name a few more times, turns a 
               few more corners, and suddenly comes on her.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Mary?

               Mary's sitting beside Simon, the bleeding, ashen-faced man 
               with sunglasses. She's giving Simon a piece of sandwich and 
               a coke. Katherine is instantly wary.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Mary, come here.

                                     MARY
                         But Simon and I were --

                                     KATHERINE
                         Come here.

               Mary reluctantly walks over to Katherine.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Go back to class.

                                     MARY
                         But --

                                     KATHERINE
                         Go.

               Mary frowns, waves once to Simon, and leaves. There's a 
               heaviness to the air around Simon. A kind of buzzing. 
               Katherine blinks her eyes a few times. Focuses.

                                     SIMON
                         She wasn't doing any harm.

                                     KATHERINE
                         It's not her I'm worried about.

                                     SIMON
                         Of course.

                                     KATHERINE
                         What are you doing here?

                                     SIMON
                         Small job. Mostly done now. Just 
                         passing through.

                                     KATHERINE
                         This is school property, you can't 
                         sleep here.

                                     SIMON
                         It wasn't part of the plan. Honest.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (notices blood stains)
                         Are you all right?

                                     SIMON
                         No. Not really.

               That buzz. Katherine rubs the side of her temple.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I'll have to call the police.

                                     SIMON
                         I wish you wouldn't, but I understand.

                                     KATHERINE
                         They'll help you.

                                     SIMON
                         Oh, I rather doubt that.

               Katherine turns and leaves, her footsteps fading. Mary appears 
               again.

                                     MARY
                         Hi.

                                     SIMON
                         Hello. I thought you'd left.

                                     MARY
                         I hid. I'm very clever.

                                     SIMON
                         I'm sure you are.
                              (beat)
                         You were nice to give me the food.

                                     MARY
                         I know.

                                     SIMON
                         I haven't much time, Mary. And since 
                         you've been so nice to me, there's 
                         something I'd very much like to give 
                         to you.

                                     MARY
                         What?

                                     SIMON
                         Just for a little while. Something 
                         very special. Can you keep it a 
                         secret? The biggest secret ever?

                                     MARY
                         Yes. What is it?

                                     SIMON
                         Come here, Mary.

               She takes a couple of shy steps toward him.

                                     SIMON
                         Closer...

               As she does --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Katherine, outside the building, rounding up some of the 
               kids who decided to take an impromptu recess. Hustling the 
               last one up the stairs, she pauses suddenly. She hears 
               something. Faint coughing.

               Katherine walks back around the side of the building and 
               sees Mary bent over, vomiting. Katherine rushes up to her.

                                     MARY
                         I don't feel good...

                                     KATHERINE
                         What's the matter, pumpkin? Did you 
                         eat something?
                              (concerned beat)
                         Did he give you something?

               Mary coughs up the last of her lunch.

                                     MARY
                         Can I go home now?

               Katherine wipes off Mary's mouth with a hanky.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Sure, hon. Let's go.

               EXT. TOWN - DAY

               Katherine drives Mary home, a dusty, tired mobile home slumped 
               among the saguaro and tumbleweed on the edge of town.

               INT. MOBILE HOME

               Mary and Katherine pull open the door and enter. Mary's 
               elderly grandmother is sitting watching "All My Children". 
               She smiles at Katherine and looks at Mary with concern as 
               the little girl rubs her stomach and explains something in 
               Navaho.

               IN THE BEDROOM

               Katherine helps tuck Mary in bed as her grandmother brings a 
               glass of water.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I'll have the school send over a 
                         doctor.

               The grandmother sits beside Mary, whispers gently in Navaho, 
               and softly stokes her brow.

               IN THE LIVING ROOM

                                     KATHERINE
                              (on the phone)
                         ...He's was just laying up there. I 
                         thought, with the kids and 
                         everything...

                                     VOICE
                         Most of my boys are up the highway 
                         on a tanker spill at the moment. 
                         They may be a while. These people 
                         are rarely any problem. I'll have a 
                         deputy come by tonight or tomorrow 
                         and shoo him out.

                                     KATHERINE
                         He looked hurt.

                                     VOICE
                         They all do, ma'am. Inside or out, 
                         they're all damaged goods.

               IN THE BEDROOM

               Alone and tucked into bed, Mary stares off at something very, 
               very far away.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THOMAS'S APARTMENT

               The sun orange and fading outside his window, Thomas drifts 
               off into a nap on his couch. The phone rings.

               INT. MORGUE

               On the floor is the smoldering, blackened outline of a body. 
               A thick, slimy goo gurgles and pops. The whole room is afoul 
               with acrid smoke.

               Thomas jams his hands in his pockets and leans against an 
               autopsy table. Watches the smoke curl slowly up from the 
               impossibly melted goo in front of him.

               Gabriel crouches on the linoleum and pours everything out of 
               the evidence box onto the floor. He sifts through it, a smile 
               appearing when comes across the Chimney Rock Republican and 
               its circled obituary.

                         You like the desert, Jerry?

               Jerry is looking worse by the day. A rotting, oozing fissure 
               has opened on his forehead. His right eye doesn't move 
               anymore. He sits on a kitchen chair glumly.

               INT. POLICE STATION

               Thomas sits hunched over his notes from the first day of the 
               investigation. Written in it is the Chimney Rock Republican 
               and the obituary name of General Arnold Hawthorn. Lt. Paul

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               On an utterly lonely blacktop, Gabriel shoots by in his top-
               down rambler, insignificant in the night's vastness. Jerry's 
               in the back, feet up on the seat.

                                     JERRY
                         Why do you need me? I can hardly 
                         walk now.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Some things are human work, son. 
                         Live or dead, human work. Besides, I 
                         like you.

                                     JERRY
                         Lucky moi.

               Gabriel suddenly stands on the brakes, SCREECHING the rambler 
               to a dusty stop. He kills the engine and everything is 
               instantly whispering night and coyote howls. Gabriel climbs 
               out and walks to the edge of a cliff. Far below, nestled 
               among the finger-like spires of volcanic cones, lies The 
               Town. Twinkling lights in a cold, dark embrace.

               Gabriel pushes his sunglasses up his nose and smiles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I can always smell a graveyard.

               Two coyotes begin fighting and snarling with each other in 
               the dust nearby.

               EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               On a low hill at the edge of town. Cracked, sinking 
               headstones. The rambler's parked next to a new one, Slim 
               Pickens on the AM, as Jerry digs up the fresh grave marked 
               General Arnold Hawthorne. Gabriel sits perched on the 
               headstone over the grave like a winged creature.

                                     JERRY
                         I hope you're enjoying this.

                         kill yourself.

                                     JERRY
                         But I did it, didn't I? I did kill 
                         myself.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Well, yes. Technically.

                                     JERRY
                         And you're just keeping me alive.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Letting you die slower.

                                     JERRY
                         I'm so in your debt.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Thank you, Jerry. I'm touched. Really.

               Jerry's shovel CLANKS onto something hard. He scrapes away 
               the dirt, revealing a coffin lid. With a socket wrench Jerry 
               removes the fastening bolts, then with the edge of his shovel, 
               pries open the lid.

               It's the ancient, wasted general we saw at the beginning. 
               His medals flash in the moonlight.

                                     JERRY
                         Not much to look at.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Ah, but it's not what's on the outside 
                         that matters --

               Gabriel leaps off his perch down into the grave.

                                     GABRIEL
                         -- It's what's on the inside.

               Gabriel reaches down, places one hand on the General's 
               forehead, one on his chin, and BREAKS the mouth open. He 
               gazes down into it. Then suddenly stiffens and straightens 
               up.

                                     GABRIEL
                              (upset)
                         It's not here.

               Gabriel frantically look in the ears. Up the nose.

                         Shut up!!

               Gabriel BANGS the coffin lid in frustration. Tries to think.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Now, if you were a soul, where would 
                         you hide?

               EXT. THE TOWN - NIGHT

               Silent and dead at this hour. Gabriel's boots creak on the 
               floorboards of the 19th century plank sidewalks. He taps his 
               finger aimlessly along plate glass shop windows.

                         Boy, what a dump, huh?

               Jerry, limping on a foot that's caving in on itself, wiping 
               the spinal fluid out of his dead eye, shuffles along behind.

               Gabriel pops off the elevated sidewalk, grabs a parking meter 
               and swings himself playfully around.

                         Life's a bitch.

               Gabriel suddenly freezes. He sticks his nose up, sniffs like 
               a coyote, then abruptly drops to the ground in a push-up and 
               smells the dirt. Tastes it with his tongue. Smiles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Well well...

               INT. THE SCHOOL BUILDING - NIGHT

               A fracture of broken moon tumbles through shattered windows 
               and falls dully across shapes old, shapes forgotten, and one 
               shape trying hopelessly to drag itself across the floor. 
               It's Simon; breath a rasp, blood-soaked pants leaving a long 
               smear behind him like a hemorrhaging snail. He coughs, drags 
               an arm across the lenses of his sunglasses,

               And looks up at a pair of black, lizard-skin boots.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hi, Simon.

               Simon rolls on his back and sighs.

                                     SIMON
                         Gabriel.

               Simon looks up at puss-faced Jerry, leaning quietly in a 
               dark corner.

                                     JERRY
                         Don't mind me. Just along for the 
                         ride.

               Gabriel sits down against the wall.

                                     GABRIEL
                         So, what shall we talk about? 
                         Theology?

                                     SIMON
                         I'm a little talked out on theology.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Fair enough...

               Gabriel turns his boot to the moon, watches the pale light 
               glint back off the lizard scales.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You know why I'm here.

                                     SIMON
                         Oh yes.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Don't happen to have it on you by 
                         chance?

                                     SIMON
                         No.

                                     GABRIEL
                         That would have been too easy.

               Simon suddenly JUMPS to his feet. Tries to escape. Jerry 
               trips him, SPRAWLING Simon back to the floor.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Please, Simon. Get serious.

               Gabriel walks over to him. Puts his face close.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Now. Where's the soul?
                              (beat)
                         You know. So high. Used to reside in 
                         the recently departed General 
                         Hawthorne.

               Simon doesn't answer. Gabriel shrugs.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Have it your way, big guy.

                                     SIMON
                         I do have one question.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Shoot.

                                     SIMON
                         Do you even remember what this war's 
                         about?

               Gabriel pauses, almost thoughtfully. Then he smiles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         That's hardly the point, is it?

                                     SIMON
                         I guess I never did get the point.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Happens.

                                     SIMON
                         How do you do it, Gabriel? How do 
                         you go on and on in this place?

                                     GABRIEL
                         I like it here, Simon. I always have.

                                     SIMON
                         I'm so tired...

               Gabriel grasps Simon's hand.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Then join us, Simon. Reject the Nicene 
                         Council. We were here first.

                                     SIMON
                         I can't do it, Gabriel. I don't even 
                         know why anymore, but I can't.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You know the routine.

                                     SIMON
                              (swallows hard)
                         Yes.

               Gabriel's hand is suddenly on Simon's face, fingers spread, 
               claw-like. They press into the flesh. Hard. And harder. Until 
               Simon starts to bleed.

               Then to burn.

               INT. KATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Katherine startles abruptly in her bed at the faraway sound 
               of Simon's screams. Screams carried either on the wind or 
               her dreams.

               INT. MARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Asleep, sweaty, shivering, Mary suddenly opens her eyes.

               INT. THE SCHOOL BUILDING - NIGHT

               Gabriel releases his grip on Simon, letting him fall back 
               against the wall, afire. His clothes twist and blacken. His 
               skin creeps and pops. His sunglasses melt and fall away; 
               revealing two hollow pits beneath. Gabriel lifts Simon's 
               entire body up off the floor by just the disintegrating face, 
               and stares into the hollow pits.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Not yet.

               And the fires go out. Gabriel drops the crackling, acrid 
               body onto the floor. Impossibly, through the sizzling mucus 
               and molten hair, it breathes. It gasps in pain. It won't 
               die.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I can do this for five months, 
                         Simon...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE TOWN

               The skies above lighten and smear blue and red.

               KATHERINE

               Finishes dressing for school, picks up her teaching bag, and 
               crunches out across the gravel to her pick-up.

               INT. THE SCHOOL BUILDING

               Gabriel's lizard boots pace back and forth past Simon's 
               writhing, burning body. Gabriel's more jittery now. Losing 
               his patience. He bends down and pulls Simon's face up to 
               his.

                                     GABRIEL
                         This is getting boring, Simon.

                                     JERRY
                         Amen.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Where is it? Where did you put it?

               The seared skin around Simon's mouth comes off in Gabriel's 
               hand. But Simon is still, even now, silent.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Where is it!

               He flings Simon with a horrible crunch against the wall.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I'm just about out of tricks here. 
                         You're a tough one, friend. Old 
                         school.

               He walks over and places a hand with something like friendship 
               on Simon's charred shoulder.

                                     GABRIEL
                         God loves you, Simon.

               And with the other hand Gabriel JAMS his fist into Simon's 
               chest, PULLING OUT a lumpy, burned heart. Simon's mouth 
               springs open and hisses emptily. Gabriel slips the heart 
               into his pocket and lets go of Simon's shoulder. The body 
               instantly disintegrates and crashes to the floor.

               EXT. THE TOWN - MORNING

               Katherine squints at the morning glare as she drives through 
               town. Pulling into the school's drive she sees, parked at 
               the building's back door, a sheriff's patrol car.

               INT. SCHOOL BUILDING

               Katherine comes up the stairs of the building's abandoned 
               floor, passing the stacks of rotting desks toward where she 
               last saw Simon. There's a bad smell in the air.

               At a turn stands a deputy that looks up as Katherine 
               approaches.

                                     DEPUTY
                         You may want to skip this, ma'am.

               Katherine looks past him to where a second deputy crouches 
               down beside... beside something. It's human shaped, but like 
               a shadow. A shadow twisted in agony and slicked with a tarry, 
               smoldering ooze. The smell is overpowering. The crouched 
               deputy has a handkerchief over his mouth.

                                     CROUCHED DEPUTY
                         God damn...

                                     DEPUTY
                              (to Katherine)
                         Were any of your students up here?

                                     KATHERINE
                         Mary...

               EXT. MARY'S FAMILY TRAILER - DAY

               Katherine pulls-up and parks.

               INSIDE

               Mary is still in bed, droopy-eyed and sweating. Her 
               grandmother is there, and so is an elderly Navaho. He stands 
               beside Mary's side, holding above her body a clenched pouch 
               that he passes slowly back and forth.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (to grandmother)
                         How is she?

                                     GRANDMOTHER
                         Same.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Did the doctor come by?

                                     GRANDMOTHER
                         He found nothing. But something is 
                         in her. I know. Something the 
                         Belagaana doctor can't see. The night 
                         people have been around two days 
                         now. It is a warning.
                              (nods to Navaho man)
                         So we have called the hand trembler. 
                         To find if she must have an Enemy 
                         Ghost Way.

               The old man mumbles a soft chant as he moves the pouch back 
               and forth across Mary's body.

               EXT. MARY'S FAMILY TRAILER - DAY

               Katherine walks back out toward her pickup. She stops. Thirty 
               yards away, almost invisible in the sage say for the glare 
               of its evil, intelligent eyes, is a coyote. As she feels 
               it's gaze a shadow suddenly crosses her shoulder. Katherine 
               turns quickly but only barely catches, out of the corner of 
               her eye, a glimpse of something very large.

               And winged.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A huge semi ROARING deafeningly past on an empty desert 
               highway, KICKING UP a dusty cyclone that drifts over a one-
               horse gas station and Thomas, sitting there in his car 
               checking a map.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COUNTY BUILDING - DAY

               Small townish; old adobe and stucco walls, cannon on the 
               front lawn, every door loudly declaring itself a department: 
               SOCIAL SERVICES, COURTS, and, SHERIFF.

               INSIDE

               The Sheriff's personal office is turn of the century regal, 
               with high beam ceilings and rotating fans. Nothing seems 
               newer than 1940, including the coffee pot the Sheriff pours 
               a mugful from. Trim with glasses, bolo tie and boots, he 
               looks like Barry Goldwater.

                                     SHERIFF
                         And to what do I owe the thrill of a 
                         visit from a So Cal homicide cop?

               He hands the coffee to Thomas, sitting in a chair beside his 
               solid oak desk.

                                     DAGGETT

                         usual.

                         courtesy of telling you first.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Big of you.

               The Sheriff smiles.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Son, this is the third biggest county

                         A middle-aged secretary enters with 
                         a stack of paper.

               She hands them to the Sheriff, who passes them on to Thomas. 
               He flips through the stack, comes up with nothing. The 
               secretary hands another, single sheet to the Sheriff.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Bobby just called this in from Chimney 
                         Rock.

               Thomas perks at The Town's name.

                         Teacher complained some vagrant was 
                         sleeping in her schoolhouse.

               The Sheriff's brow crinkles in consternation as he reads 
               further.

                                     SHERIFF

               The Sheriff hands it to him. Glancing at it we pick up words 
               like BURNED, BLACK SLICK, BODY OUTLINE. Thomas copies the 
               name of the school down, gulps his coffee, and shakes the 
               Sheriff's hand.

               Thomas's sedan passing through the vast, empty land.

               FAR ON THE HORIZON

               A small clump of buildings emerge clinging hopelessly to the 
               earth. The Town.

               EXT. TOWN HOTEL - DAY

               A former miner's hotel, stone walls and sagging wrought iron.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM

               Thomas tosses his bag onto the bed, opens the balcony door, 
               and looks out on the crumbly shale hills, the abandoned 
               prospecting shacks, and the Chuska Mountains, clouds brewing 
               darkly across its shattered back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A close-up of the circled newspaper obituary for General 
               Hawthorne. The paper lowers and reveals behind it the 
               general's grave. The dirt around the tomb is loose, recently 
               filled. The grave keeper, a young, gangly, drifter type stands 
               nearby with his shovel.

                         Nothin' on the outside.

               INT. THE SCHOOLHOUSE

               Thomas's breath escapes in warm clouds here in the unheated, 
               abandoned part of the building. Rats scurry away from feeding 
               on the dark, human-like stain on the floor as Thomas crouches 
               down beside it. He probes the dried, black, crusty flotsam 
               with his ball-point pen. Just like the burned body back at 
               the morgue.

               Far away you can hear the sounds of children. Of a teacher's 
               voice.

               DOWNSTAIRS

               It's only past the final door, into the smallest corner of 
               the building, that the walls become clean and brightly painted 
               by eager third graders. The creepy silence transforms itself 
               into the giggles of children as they bang open the classroom 
               door and whoop themselves outside for recess.

               The last one out is Katherine. She's surprised to see Thomas.

               Katherine unlocks a hall cabinet and pulls out a stack of 
               volleyballs. She tosses two to Thomas.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Here, make yourself useful.

               Arms full, she pushes the building door open with her shoulder 
               and backs out into the sunshine. She tosses the balls out to 
               the kids.

                                     KATHERINE

               She sits down beside Thomas on the building's stone steps.

               ACROSS THE STREET

               Up the crumbly embankment, sitting perched on the roof of an 
               abandoned house, is Gabriel. He watches Thomas walk to his 
               car. He watches the children playing, lifting his nose to 
               snort the air, like a coyote.

               INT. THE TOWN LIBRARY

               Thomas sifts through some clippings on General Hawthrone. 
               Tactical genius. The man who saved Korea. Brutal. Almost 
               court marshalled a dozen times for his inspired savagery. A 
               truly ruthless man -- who spent the last twenty years quietly 
               tending his garden in a dying town.

               INT. THE TOWN CHURCH

               Small, simple, and woodplanked. The church we saw at the 
               beginning. Thomas sits there, staring at the candles, the 
               altar, the crucifix.

               He's alone there. But for a creeping buzz. A feeling in the 
               air.

                                     GABRIEL'S VOICE
                         It's unusual to see someone of your 
                         age in church on a weekday.

               Thomas turns in surprise. Gabriel is kneeling in the row 
               behind, inches from his ear.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Don't get me wrong. I think it's an 
                         excellent sign of character.

               There's something cold and creepy about Gabriel. Out of place 
               in here. There's another sound. Teeth chattering far in the 
               back. Thomas turns and sees Jerry, deep in the shadows of

               INT. THOMAS'S HOTEL

               There's a note waiting for him at the front desk: "Her name

               on a beer. When John releases her for another partner she

               Couples drift off the building's porch and into the street 
               to cool off, smoke, and take a few hits off paper bags. John 
               leans against the brick wall, tugs liberally from his paper 
               bag, and exchanges war hoops with some friends across the 
               street. He passes the bag to Katherine and Thomas.

               Thomas sits in the truck's bed as they Katherine drives 
               through town. John, on the near side of royally toasted, has 
               his boot stuck out the passenger window. Thomas looks up at 
               the night sky. At its blaze of stars.

                         up on schedule I decided to go look 
                         for it. And I looked in a lot of 
                         places, believe me. I drove that 
                         road out there so far that the end 
                         became the beginning again. And it 
                         was when I got here that I realized 
                         there never was going to be a voice. 
                         So I stopped looking and took the 
                         first job they offered me. That make 
                         any sense to you?

                                     DAGGETT
                         Oh, I know all about voices. Problem 
                         is not all of them are very nice.

                                     KATHERINE
                         How did you end up a cop?

                                     DAGGETT
                         It was the evil of two lessers.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Are you always this cryptic?

                                     DAGGETT
                         No. When you get to know me I can be 
                         down right evasive.

               EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

               Katherine pulls up to drop Thomas off.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Thanks for the lift. Tomorrow at 
                         noon? At the little girl's house?

                                     KATHERINE
                         First trailer on the highway past 
                         town.

               Thomas climbs out.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I must say, Mr. Dagget, that you 
                         don't seem very like a police officer 
                         to me.

                                     DAGGETT
                         That's what my bosses keep saying.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I meant it as a compliment.

                                     DAGGETT
                         So taken. Goodnight, Miss Henley.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Goodnight, Tom-from-Los-Angeles.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Thomas lying in his hotel bed, flinching through a dream-
               filled sleep.

               There's glimpses of shattered images: War. Death. And a small, 
               dark-haired girl. Thomas's eyes open and fix on the ceiling.

               Out his window, perched on the railing of his balcony, is 
               something dark and winged.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The honey warmth of dawn heats the bluish, quiet streets of 
               The Town. Across shale hills and abandoned 19th century 
               miner's shacks, there echoes the faint, clear notes of a 
               trumpet. The bluesy notes drift over narrow dead-end streets, 
               junked cars, and the abandoned copper mine out past the end 
               of town.

               INT. MINE

               Deep in the tunneled rock, past the rusting conveyor belts, 
               Gabriel sits in a small cave blowing Miles Davis on his 
               trumpet. There's just the blanket he sits on and a single 
               candle. Jerry comes around the corner.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Get any sleep?
                              (Jerry only stares)
                         -- Just kidding.

               EXT. THE SCHOOLHOUSE - MORNING

               As Katherine climbs out of her pick-up she sees several of 
               her students standing in a circle. Crouched in the center, 
               talking to them, is a man. Gabriel. Jerry stands nearby.

               Gabriel is showing a boy his trumpet. Demonstrating where to 
               put his fingers.

                                     GABRIEL
                         ...There, and there. Now pucker your 
                         lips... aim it that way, and just 
                         blow a little bit, this is a special 
                         trumpet.

               The boy puffs lightly. The trumpet emits a piercing, clear 
               note that SHATTERS a window high up in the abandoned part of 
               the building. The youngsters whoop and applaud.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Very good, Timmy. Very good. Here, 
                         have a Junior Mint on me. Open up.

               As Timmy opens his mouth we clearly see Gabriel looking down 
               into it. Looking for something...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Who's next?

               Katherine approaches the scene warily. The children all beg 
               for their turn. Gabriel selects Sandra, one of Mary's second 
               grade friends, and puts her on his knee.

                                     GABRIEL
                         And who are you?

                                     SANDRA
                         Sandra.

               She can barely get her fingers around the trumpet.

                                     GABRIEL
                         And did you see the man upstairs, 
                         Sandra?

                                     SANDRA
                         A little.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Did you talk to him?

                                     SANDRA
                         No.

                                     GABRIEL
                         And who did, Sandra. Who talked to 
                         the man?

                                     SANDRA
                         Mary.

                                     GABRIEL
                         And where is Mary, Sandra?

                                     SANDRA
                         She isn't here. She's sick.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You've got very pretty teeth, Sandra. 
                         Here, let me see...

               He gently pushes down her chin with his thumb, opens her 
               mouth, and gazes in.

               Katherine enters the circle.

                                     KATHERINE
                         What the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?

               Gabriel looks up, unperturbed, and smiles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Just talking to the kids, Ma'am.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Get off his knee, Sandra. Everyone 
                         else, go inside. Now.

               The kids reluctantly shuffle off.

                                     BRIAN
                         'Bye, Gabriel.

                                     GABRIEL
                         See ya, kids. Be sure to study your 
                         math.

               He has the same sunglasses as Simon. The same cold, creepy 
               air about him.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Who are you?

                                     GABRIEL
                         It's a long story.

               Jerry suddenly snorts loudly, trying to retrieve a sticky 
               red glop that starts running out of his nose.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Ignore him.

                                     JERRY
                         Everyone else does.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I don't know what the hell is going 
                         on, but you both better get out of 
                         here. Right now.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You're right...

               He climbs to his feet and stands close to her.

                                     GABRIEL
                         ...You have no idea what's going on.

               He stands there a beat. That terrible coldness that swirls 
               about him. The shriek of ghosts under his breath. Then he 
               climbs into the rambler with Jerry and pulls away. Katherine 
               watches the car drive off, then yells over to the school 
               janitor.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Al! Keep an eye on the children for 
                         me. I'll be right back. And call the 
                         sheriff.

                                     JANITOR
                         Sheriff? What the hell do I tell 
                         him?

                                     KATHERINE
                         Just call.

               Katherine gets into her pickup and starts the engine.

               EXT. THE TOWN - DAY

               Katherine drives through the main drag and out past the fringe 
               of town. As she passes the old copper mine she sees, parked 
               near the mine's tunnel entrance, Gabriel's rambler.

               EXT MARY'S GRANDMOTHER'S TRAILER - DAY

               As Katherine pulls up, she's surprised to see Thomas climbing 
               out of his own car.

                                     KATHERINE
                         You weren't suppose to be here till 
                         noon.

                                     DAGGETT
                         You're a little early yourself.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I wanted to check on her.

                                     DAGGETT
                         That makes two of us.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               On the sandy lot that extends back from the trailer is a 
               wizened cottonwood tree. Katherine, Thomas, and Mary are 
               seated beneath its shade. Katherine is protective of the 
               little girl, running a hand maternally through her hair.

                                     KATHERINE
                         How are you feeling, pumpkin?

                                     MARY
                         Better.

                                     KATHERINE
                         This is Mr. Dagget, Mary. He'd like 
                         to ask you some questions. You don't 
                         have to answer if you don't want to.

                                     MARY
                         It's okay.

               There's a dreamy, far-away look in Mary's eyes. It worries 
               Katherine.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Mary, when you talked to man up in 
                         the building --

                                     MARY
                         -- Simon.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Yes, Simon. What did Simon say?

                                     MARY
                              (smiles)
                         That's funny. "Simon says".

                                     DAGGETT
                         Right. Like the game.

                                     MARY
                         I'm good at it. I'm very clever.

                                     DAGGETT
                         We'll have to play together sometime.

                                     MARY
                         Simon even said so. He also asked if 
                         I could keep a secret.

                                     DAGGETT
                         And what was that?

                                     MARY
                         Something he gave me.

                                     KATHERINE
                         What, pumpkin?

                                     MARY
                         Then it wouldn't be a secret.

                                     DAGGETT
                         You're a good friend not to tell, 
                         Mary. But I'm a friend of Simon's 
                         too. So if you ever want to tell, 
                         you can to me. Okay?

                                     MARY
                         It's a secret...

               Mary lowers her head and shuts her eyes.

                                     MARY
                         ...But sometimes it hurts.

               Thomas and Katherine exchange looks. Mary's pretty eyes rise 
               again as she calmly asks, in that cute little eight year old 
               voice:

                                     MARY
                         Have you ever killed a chinaman?

                         They don't bleed. Not the way you 
                         and I do. Or maybe it was just the 
                         cold...

               Thomas looks to Katherine for an explanation, but she's as 
               confused as him.

                                     MARY
                         I've killed them, you know. Lots. 
                         You could always tell when they were 
                         coming. There'd be the trumpets first. 
                         Every note flat. Then those songs... 
                         After that they'd charge. Right down 
                         through the snow. The guns would 
                         freeze and it would be just knives... 
                         It was so cold and there were so 
                         many of them. But I was smarter than 
                         they were. Even at Chosin, I was 
                         smarter...

               Mary's been explaining this in a girlish, show-'n-tell kind 
               of way. Suddenly her face cracks as her voice chokes with a 
               sob.

                                     MARY
                         It scares me, Miss Henley. I hate 
                         it. Please, make it stop!

               She buries herself into Katherine's arms, sobbing.

                                     MARY
                         Make it stop!

                         It's okay... It's okay...

               Mary suddenly pushes away and runs back toward the trailer, 
               into the arms of her grandmother.

                                     KATHERINE

               He pulls over to the side near the copper mine entrance. No

               Thomas drives up the dirt path to the mine's tunnel entrance. 
               They climb out and stand near its mouth. In the dust is the 
               rambler's tracks and several footprints leading into the 
               mine.

               Thomas steps up to the edge of the tunnel. It's a black, 
               yawning thing that swallows the sunlight whole for breakfast.

               Thomas switches on the light and takes a tentative step

               INT. THE MINE

               The sun very quickly becomes a memory. And after the first 
               bend it isn't even that anymore. There's only the glow of 
               the flashlight; glancing off the abrupt edges of tunneled 
               rock. Here and there are the flotsam of a bankrupt industry; 
               dented ore carts lying on their side, rusted drill bits, 
               piles of support timbers. And all around them the sucking 
               blackness of the earth.

               They walk further down into the mine. The atmosphere becomes 
               close and creepy. Thomas has been following tracks left in 
               the dusty floor that abruptly disappear. He stops and sighs.

               -- A BAT suddenly SHRIEKS out of the darkness, glancing off 
               Thomas's shoulder and TANGLING in Katherine's hair. She 
               screams and spins around, loosing her footing and half falling 
               into a yawning ore chute she hadn't seen beside her. Thomas 
               rushes over and pulls her out. She climbs shakily to her 
               feet.

                         Yeah... Sorry.

               Thomas takes a last pass at the mine shaft with his 
               flashlight.

                                     DAGGETT

               He bangs it once against his thigh before he notices for the 
               first time a dim, amber light coming from a space between 
               the rocks.

                                     KATHERINE
                         What is that?

                         I don't know. Maybe a bum or

               But his gun's out at his side. Just in case. They follow the 
               light to the gap in the rock, gingerly stepping into

               A CAVERN

               -- That could easily belong to a bum. It's Gabriel and Jerry's 
               digs. Just the moldy blanket, single oil lamp, piles of 
               twinkie wrappers,

               And something else.

               From outside the cave it's the same whine, the same blurryness 
               that drips off Gabriel like sweat. But once they step into 
               the room, into the lair, it suddenly jumps in volume. This 
               is where Gabriel sleeps, and it's thicker here, like honey 
               on the walls. Thomas has difficulty focusing his eyes.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Do you feel it?

                         What is it?

               But Thomas can't hear Katherine anymore, her voice has 
               disappeared beneath the whine. As it becomes too much he 
               leans his weight against the rock wall and shuts his eyes.

               It's then they come. Flashes of images: Of screams and fire. 
               Of impossible vistas of emptiness and death. And shrieking 
               overhead, shrieking everywhere; grotesque, winged creatures 
               with no eyes. Some with faces we know; Gabriel, Simon, and 
               the gargoyle. All these images are being jammed into both 
               their minds by the cave.

               Thomas forces his eyes open but the scenes playing all around 
               him won't go away. Tears are running down Katherine's face 
               as she stands there locked in the same images. Thomas stumbles 
               about the room as if drunk, the visions, incomprehendibly 
               black visions of war and destruction on an alien plateau, 
               eat his brain. He sinks to his knees and begins to cry.

                         Oh no... Oh God no...

               Katherine's curled up on the floor like a child, weeping. 
               The images are driving them mad. Thomas, fighting the insanity 
               pounding at him, crawls pathetically across the floor to the 
               oil lamp. His fingers grasp it spasmotically as he rises to 
               his knees and leans back.

                         No!

               He HEAVES the lamp against the cave wall, where it EXPLODES, 
               the oil erupting into a swirling blaze that CONSUMES the 
               corner.

               The images break a second in the heat and light and sucking 
               wind. Just long enough for Thomas to grab Katherine's arm 
               and pull her out of the room.

               EXT. MINE - DAY

               Katherine and Thomas lie in the dust outside the mine's tunnel 
               entrance. Catching their breath. Trying to organize and repair 
               the short circuits in their brains. Thomas rolls on his side, 
               squints at the sun. Katherine's voice is faint and raspy.

               The tears start rolling down her face. She looks up and shouts 
               at the endless sky above them.

               INT. MARY'S GRANDMOTHER'S TRAILER

               Katherine and Thomas open the trailer door and enter 
               cautiously.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Mary?

               Thomas looks out the window and notices for the first time, 
               parked behind the trailer, Gabriel's rambler. He immediately 
               pulls out his pistol, runs for the closed door at the end of 
               the hall and KICKS it in. The door FLIES open, revealing 
               Gabriel sitting on the bed beside Mary.

               His gun's leveled at Gabriel's head. The angel sits there 
               impassively, then smiles.

                                     GABRIEL

                         profanity.

               Jerry suddenly LEAPS out from behind the door and TACKLES 
               Thomas to the carpet. The gun skitters to one side as Jerry 
               SINKS his rotting teeth into Thomas's shoulder. Thomas cries 
               out and SLAMS his fist against Jerry's head, knocking off an 
               ear.

               Gabriel turns back to Mary's frightened face and smiles as 
               he runs a hand through her hair.

                                     GABRIEL
                         It'll only be a moment...

               Katherine suddenly HAMMERS Gabriel across the side of the 
               head with a chair, KNOCKING him to the floor. As he gets up 
               she HITS him again.

               Thomas manages to bring his leg up and KICKS Jerry hard 
               against the chest, forcing him off.

               Gabriel GRABS both of Katherine's legs and PULLS, CRASHING 
               her flat on her back.

               Thomas scrambles for his gun, grabs it, and as Jerry comes 
               at him again spins and FIRES twice. The slugs RIP into Jerry's 
               chest and knock him to his knees. As the putrid, curdled 
               juices pump lumpily out of him, Jerry looks up at Thomas and 
               smiles.

                                     JERRY
                         Thanks man, I appreciate it. You're 
                         a sport.

               Thomas FIRES a slug into his forehead. Jerry's brain winks 
               out as he collapses to the floor, dead.

               Thomas's gun is abruptly WRENCHED from his hand onto the bed 
               as Gabriel NAILS him with a thrown lamp, vaults the bed 
               between them, and grabs him by the collar, SLAMMING Thomas 
               up against the wall. He looks down at Jerry's finally lifeless 
               corpse, incensed at Thomas's handiwork.

                                     GABRIEL

                         idea how hard it is to get one of 
                         those?

               He THROWS Thomas down onto a table, SPLINTERING it. Katherine 
               climbs shakily to her knees.

                                     KATHERINE

                         it...

               Gabriel walks over to the bed. The moment he gets close, 
               Mary lifts Thomas's pistol up from the sheets and SHOOTS him 
               twice, the impact KNOCKING him on his ass.

               Katherine rushes to Mary, scoops her up and runs for the 
               door. She pauses beside Thomas, still lying in the wreckage 
               of the table.

               Katherine disappears through the bedroom doorway.

               Gabriel spins around and stands. Thomas leaps from a ragged 
               crouch, HITTING Gabriel low with a body-block.

               It's like butting concrete.

               Gabriel picks up Thomas by the scruff of the neck and HEAVES 
               him THROUGH the flimsy room paneling. Thomas CRASHES with a 
               mass of splinters into the kitchen. He stumbles backward 
               hopelessly as Gabriel peruses him through the trailer. He 
               desperately throws pots, glasses, anything at Gabriel. Finally 
               trapped, he scrambles up onto the dinner table, SCATTERING 
               salt and sugar bowls, and DIVES through the levored window.

               OUTSIDE

               Thomas, in a hail of shattered glass, smacks the red earth, 
               pulls himself up to his knees and tries to stumble and crawl 
               away as Gabriel BANGS open the trailer door and stomps down 
               the stairs toward Katherine, her arms around Mary.

                                     KATHERINE
                         ...You...

               He eases his gait, measuring the distance to her.

                         ...Have Her!!

               Katherine lifts Thomas's pistol and FIRES. Again. Again. The 
               slugs BANG off the corregated metal, SMASH a window, KICK up 
               some dust,

               And PUNCTURE the propane tank beneath the trailer.

               -- WUMPP-BAM!

               The entire trailer EXPLODES in a fiery cloud of TWISTING 
               METAL.

               Katherine huddles Mary close to the ground as flaming chunks 
               WHACK everywhere.

               Gabriel is HAMMERED to the earth and disappears in the rolling 
               fire cloud. Thomas, further away, is KNOCKED head-over-heels 
               in the ruddy dust.

               The fire cloud dissipates quickly into the sky, leaving behind 
               scorched brush, and little else, crackling softly. Gabriel's 
               body looks blackened and still. Katherine rushes to Thomas, 
               who's pulled himself up to his knees, a ragged slice above 
               his eye bleeding badly. She helps him to his feet and over 
               to the pickup, where he sits down against the tire as 
               Katherine pulls out her first aid kit. Mary's there, standing 
               with her shaken grandmother.

               From somewhere back in town there's the growl of a volunteer

               The pain's unbareable. Katherine dabs his cut with

               The volunteer fire engine growls up through the weeds, 
               drowning out Thomas's words. Two firemen kneel down beside 
               him with medical kits.

               The deputy has walked over to his partner and the two are 
               dragging back between them a cuffed, comatose Gabriel.

                         You'll never hold him.

               Thomas tries to get up, but the pain and a hand from the 
               firemen keep him down. As the deputies pass, he manages to 
               desperately grab the one's pant cuff.

                         sunglasses...

               Gabriel's head lies low between the shoulders. The deputy 
               looks with concern at the firemen.

                                     FIREMAN

                         He'll be all right. Just a bad hit.

               The deputy nods. As they carry on to the car with Gabriel, 
               the angel turns his head slightly and smiles a smile only 
               for Thomas.

                                     FIREMAN

               The patrol car pulls away. As the firemen walk back to their 
               engine, Thomas looks frantically at Katherine.

                         have to do it now.

               They lock eyes. Then Katherine without a word helps Thomas 
               up into the passenger side of the pickup. Mary gathers her 
               grandmother into the pickup's bed and climbs up beside her 
               as Katherine starts the engine. The firemen turn in confusion 
               as the truck peels out of the lot and up onto the road.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

               Katherine's truck shoots by. Just before town, near the copper 
               mine, it slows down at a junction.

               And there, lying on its side down the embankment, is the 
               sheriff's patrol car. A single, bent tire turns aimlessly.

               Katherine hits the gas and takes the junction that leads 
               away from town, out onto the endless expanse of the plateau.

               The bandage on Thomas's forehead covers most of one eye. He 
               closes the other tightly, riding a spasm of pain, before 
               letting his forehead rest against the door glass and gazing 
               out at the empty tracks of land.

               A trading post with a few pumps, growing orange in the 
               weakening afternoon light. A scruffy dog barks constantly as 
               the teenage Indian sticks the nozzle in Katherine's pickup. 
               Still glassy-eyed with throbbing pain, Thomas takes another 
               handful of aspirin and climbs out of the cab.

               There's a tiny, weatherbeaten church across the weedy lot 
               from the trading post with a pay phone bolted to it. Thomas 
               crunches across the lot, picks up the receiver, and punches 
               in some numbers.

               And Thomas hangs up. He backs away from the phone and for 
               the first time notices the church it's attached to.

               INT. CHURCH

               Thomas steps inside. It's empty and there's some doubt whether 
               it's been used in a generation. The pews are dusty and 
               scraped, some broken down completely. Thomas sits in one and 
               looks across the space and dust and years to the crucifix 
               hanging behind the altar.

                         even control your own killers anymore?

               Thomas holds his face in his hands a silent moment. When it 
               raises we see the raw hurt in the eyes as he shouts,

               Standing in the back, watching Thomas with tears welling in 
               her eyes, is Katherine.

               turns off the small dirt road onto an even smaller one that 
               winds impossibly up the side of a volcanic butte.

               Higher and higher the truck climbs on the rutted and 
               treacherous path, till at last it crests the ridge and comes

               THE VILLAGE

               Perched frighteningly on the leading edge of Old Woman Butte, 
               this is the home of the Bitter Sky Clan. The village is a 
               small grouping of ancient adobe walled hogans first built a 
               thousand years ago by the Anasazi. There's no electricity 
               here, no TV antennas or frozen yogurt. Just the slow curl of 
               cooking fires drifting up through smoke holes and the stern, 
               deeply lined face of an old Navaho man approaching the pickup 
               as Katherine stops.

               The old man wears jeans, a bright maroon silk shirt, and a 
               black felt reservation hat with a turkey feather. He holds 
               in his right hand a small leather case.

                                     OLD MAN

                         Sky Clan.

               The old man, Bartholomew Grey Horse, walks up to Mary and 
               her grandmother sitting in the bed.

               Several villagers approach and greet Mary and her grandmother, 
               some nodding politely to Thomas and Katherine as they climb 
               out of the cab. Nearly all of them are elderly.

               Thomas, one eye still half-shut by a bandage, walks over to 
               the village's edge where a short stone wall, and little else, 
               separates the adobe homes from the long, 2000 foot drop to 
               the desert floor. He leans against it and gazes out on a 
               view that must encompass half the world. In all directions, 
               for tens upon tens of miles, there are only volcanic spires 
               and crumbling buttes, all reduced from up here to short, 
               ominous playthings. A village truly alone in the world.

                         This is a good place.

               She's appeared beside him. Thomas crouches down to her level 
               and smiles.

                         hold off an entire battalion for 
                         weeks. Months.

               Thomas's voice sighs sadly as he runs a hand softly through 
               her hair.

               Mary's eyes fill with tears as her grandmother appears and 
               leads her back to the adobe hogans.

               Grey Horse, the yataalii, is there now.

               The fire has died to embers, casting its weak glow on a now 
               empty room.

               OUTSIDE

               Katherine wanders along the edge of the village, turning up 
               her collar under a blinding mass of stars. There's nothing 
               beyond the village. Not a light, not a sound. Say the wind. 
               It is the icy brush of wind on her body that now whispers.

               it seems to come from everywhere. And, like the wind, it is

               Katherine turns.

               Perched on the wall behind her in a low crouch is a figure 
               clad entirely in layers of black. Its head and hands are

               scars and shapes and wrinkles, but mostly, only, there are 
               the eyes.

               Katherine gulps down, with only partial success, the hysteria 
               rising in her throat.

               The sycophant shivers and ruffles something feathery under

                         Oh, I am an angel. A very special 
                         one. The first. The oldest. The naive 
                         eagle scout, he once loved me above 
                         all others, and I him. It was the 
                         only true love for either of us, but 
                         like all true love, it couldn't 
                         possibly last.

               The figure cranes his neck around to the horizon beyond them. 
               The movement makes a liquid, snapping sound.

                         shiny place. You'd like it. Only 
                         it's been empty for a long time. 
                         Can't open till after the 
                         resurrection. The problem's with the 
                         hired help. Always had problems with 
                         the hired help. They're arrogant, 
                         boastful little pricks. Not like me. 
                         What I did I did for love. But they, 
                         the winged party boys, even before 
                         the park could open for its first 
                         customer, they started fighting over 
                         the popcorn stand.

               The figure shifts his perch on the wall.

                                     FIGURE

                         fight is settled. And without people, 
                         there is no heaven. All those good

                         the ground clutching their H-tickets 
                         and waiting and waiting and waiting... 
                         Some, lying down there with the worms 
                         century after century, they start to 
                         get doubts about the whole program. 
                         That's when, out of sheer boredom, 
                         some of them come to me. Because I'm 
                         always open for business. 24 hours a 
                         day, seven days a week. Even on 
                         Christmas.

               The figure's face darkens.

                                     FIGURE
                         Some of the angels cheat. They sneak

                         wonderfully sick that it might just 
                         win it for them. And if one side

                         And if there's a heaven?

                         I want this war to go on and on and 
                         on.

               The figure straightens up, stretching its spine.

               Thomas's sitting on the hard-packed floor, leaning against 
               the adobe wall, maybe trying to sleep. Mostly trying to ignore 
               the thumping pain in his head. The oil lamp's flame shudders 
               in the gust of Katherine opening the door.

                         you to something. Well, let me tell 
                         you, the worst thing that can happen 
                         to you is to be called to something. 
                         Since I can remember a voice from 
                         somewhere deep in the Church called 
                         me. So loud and so often that by 
                         thirteen I knew I was going to be a 
                         priest. You know what that's like? 
                         My parents, friends, all of them 
                         thought I was crazy. But see, I had 
                         this voice. The voice that kept 
                         coaxing me along, telling me there 
                         was a reason. So I entered the 
                         seminary and was half way to my 
                         starched white collar when my mother, 
                         father, and my little brother were 
                         wiped out in a car crash.

               He pauses, the old emotions creeping back up on him.

                         spent looking down at three parallel 
                         graves, I asked it one question. 
                         Why. Why were these people taken 
                         from me? And the voice, that same

                         Maybe we both were.

               The oil lamp wanes and fades. Katherine lays her head on 
               Thomas's shoulder, and as darkness swallows them he holds 
               her. They hold each other.

               John the bus driver lying fully dressed on his bed asleep. 
               The night breeze through the window, and maybe something 
               else, tickles his nose. His eyes open, blink, turn left, 
               right, then up,

               -- And see Gabriel perched on the headboard, staring down at 
               him.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Heavy sleeper, John.

               John's eyes open wide in shock. Gabriel's skin is blackened 
               and blistered in parts. Whole shards of his shirt are missing. 
               John tries to sit up but Gabriel forces his head back down 
               with his palm. With the ease of a spider he slides down and 
               beside John.

                                     JOHN
                         Don't -- Don't hurt me, man. My 
                         wallet's in the dresser.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Don't be such a materialist, John.
                              (sees empty bourbon 
                              bottle on dresser,

                                     JOHN
                         What do you want?

                                     GABRIEL
                         A moment of your time.

                                     JOHN
                         You ought to have that nose looked 
                         at, man.

               Gabriel leans said nose in very close and whispers,

                                     GABRIEL
                         Where are they, John? Katherine and 
                         Mary? Where would they go?

                                     JOHN
                         What? Mary? I don't know.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Sure you do. Think hard.

                                     JOHN
                         No, really. I don't know. The school 
                         maybe.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Now you're not even trying, John. 
                         You're Katherine's best friend. She 
                         tells you everything.

                                     JOHN
                         I'm just the driver, y'know?

               Gabriel extends a blistered, open palm over John's face.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I can help you remember, John...

               FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM

               We see Gabriel leaning over John as a sickly yellow glow 
               begins to rise and reflect off the walls. Beneath it comes 
               John's worst and deepest screams...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Gabriel SPLASHING the soot off his face and arms in a small, 
               institutional bathroom. He looks at himself in the mirror, 
               runs a hand through his hair, and walks out the door into

               A HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

               At the end of it is the intensive care unit, that 
               institutional purgatory where a small handful of patients, 
               wired and tubed and oxygenated, lay inconclusively between 
               life and death. There's a nurse's station there, all health 
               status video screens and a single nurse that looks up from 
               her work at Gabriel.

                                     NURSE
                         Can I help you?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Someone's going to die here soon. 
                         I'll just be a minute.

                                     NURSE
                         There's no visitors allowed in ICU.

                                     GABRIEL
                         The timing's important. I can smell 
                         these things, you know.

               The nurse reaches for the telephone. Gabriel takes it away 
               from her with one hand and with the other grasps her face 
               open-palmed and whispers,

                                     GABRIEL
                         Go to sleep.

               The nurse slides out of her chair and collapses to the floor. 
               Gabriel pulls out the metal clipboards holding each patient's 
               chart and flips through them, tossing one after another aside 
               as unsuitable.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Recovering... Recovering... Stable...
                              (finally settles on 
                              one)
                         Deteriorating critical.

               Satisfied, he steps over to one of the beds, pulls back the 
               curtain and sits down beside an unconscious, middle-aged 
               woman. He watches patiently, listening the beeping scrawl of 
               the EKG above her.

               It was weak to begin with but now it's faltering badly, 
               becoming the unsynched etchings of a child. A beeping alarm 
               has begun to ring and her breathing is slowing to nothing. 
               At the last possible moment Gabriel places his fingers across 
               her face, whispering to her, coaxing her.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Whoa, not just yet. Come on back. 
                         That's it...

               The EKG's still flat but the woman is breathing. She begins 
               to choke, to cough, then suddenly sits up and opens her eyes. 
               She looks in disbelief around her, finally settling on 
               Gabriel's grin.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hi.

               A look of utter desolation and sadness sweeps over her as 
               she begins to cry.

                                     WOMAN
                         No, no...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hey, c'mon, don't start...
                              (looks at chart)
                         -- Rachael. Here...
                              (hands her kleenex)
                         It's only for a short time.
                              (grins)
                         Promise.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The sun cresting the Lukachukais and warming with honey 
               colored reflection the interior of the hogan.

               Katherine's head is still on Thomas's shoulder, the two of 
               them asleep sitting against the wall.

               Katherine opens her eyes and rises stiffly. She looks out 
               the simple window to the glow of morning without expression, 
               turns, and walks out.

               IN THE OTHER HOGAN

               Mary's Grandmother and some of the other elderly villagers 
               are attending Mary as Katherine enters. Mary is sitting up 
               in her bed. She smiles at Katherine.

                                     MARY
                         Hi, Miss Henley.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Hi, pumpkin. Good morning.

               Grey Horse is kneeling near the bed preparing a bowl drink. 
               Into it he crushes charcoal, dodge weed, juniper and ghost 
               plant. This he stirs, heats over flame, and feeds to Mary. 
               She grimaces and leans back in the bed as Grey Horse says a 
               brief prayer.

               OUTSIDE

               Katherine runs into Thomas outside the hogan.

                                     KATHERINE

                         We could always ask him.

               Thomas looks up. She's referring to Lucifer, who's appeared 
               perched on the edge of the low, eye-level hogan roof. The 
               sycophant is also nearby, chattering its teeth and staring 
               at Katherine with jealous, rabid eyes.

               Lucifer shivers, a claw turning up the collar of his cloak.

                                     LUCIFER
                         I always forget how cold it gets in

               The swimming, bottomless eyes fall on Thomas.

                         Mr. Daggett, I presume. How's the 
                         faith?

               Thomas can't bring himself to say anything. To form the words.

                         Come come, must you be so wishy-washy 
                         about everything? With the absent-

               Thomas gingerly hands him the cup. The angel Lucifer lifts 
               it, and with something unimaginably awful darting out of his

               He finishes it. Cranes his neck.

                         I have come to remind you that the 
                         winged party boys are just that: 
                         spoiled boys. You are armed, however 
                         pathetically, with the one thing 
                         they never really understood: 
                         theology. It's not much, but that's 
                         life.

                         Is this supposed to be our "win one 
                         for The Ripper" speech?

                                     LUCIFER
                         Don't press your luck, Mr. Daggett.

               And you know instantly, in the bottom of your stomach, that 
               those eyes mean it.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Go and get ready, Thomas.

               Thomas hesitates, holds the gaze, then turns and leaves. In 
               an instant Lucifer sweeps down from the hogan roof to 
               Katherine's side. Face and eyes and maggot breath 
               uncomfortably close, he smiles.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Have you ever considered Katherine, 
                         that the great absentee landlord, 
                         the soft-eyed eagle scout your 
                         childhood prayers are for, is just 
                         using you? That you're only the 
                         exterminator to get rid of his pests?

               Lucifer places a cloaked arm around her shoulder and leads 
               her to the walled edge to look out across the endless plateau. 
               His mouth presses against her ear and whispers,

                                     LUCIFER
                         God's junkies are coming, Katherine. 
                         And when they do, all hell is going 
                         to break loose...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A tiny speck on the empty horizon. It grows, takes shape, 
               and finally becomes a red convertible rambler as it WOOSHES 
               past on a desolate throat of forgotten highway.

               Gabriel's at the wheel. Beside him, grey-blonde hair streaming 
               out behind her, is Rachael, recently lifted from the file-
               and-forget section of the hospital ICU. She tilts her head 
               up. Lets the sun warm her pallor. Just a sociopathic angel 
               and his somewhat deceased babe out for a top-down cruise 
               across a sixty million year old desert.

               It could happen.

               INT. ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

               A reality bruised waitress, Madge, sets down a coffee and 
               milkshake before Gabriel. He downs the shake in one belt.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Say, Ma'am, any idea where I can 
                         find Old Woman Butte?

                                     MADGE
                         It's on the reservation.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I don't suppose you could be just a 
                         tad more specific. Madge.

               The waitress' eyes move from the guy with sunglasses and 
               burn marks on his shirt to the woman sitting alone outside 
               in the rambler.

                                     MADGE
                         Isn't your friend hungry?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Not for a while, I'm afraid. Funniest 
                         thing.

               Madge has a lot of things she misses in her life, but one of 
               them she decides isn't Gabriel.

                                     MADGE
                         Take 522 to the Sonsela Wash cut-
                         off. First dirt road go left. Twenty, 
                         twenty-five miles you'll see it. 
                         Big, black and all alone.

               Gabriel downs the coffee, stands, and tosses a bill on the 
               counter.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I doubt we'll meet again.

                                     MADGE
                         Suits me.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

               Thomas drags a heavy chain from Katherine's truck and begins 
               fastening it to a post. Lucifer watches perched on a nearby 
               rooftop.

                                     DAGGETT
                         You could always lend a hand.

               Lucifer just smiles or sneers or whatever he does with that 
               hideous mouth.

               INSIDE THE KIVA

               Grey Horse begins laying out his prayer instruments as Mary 
               is prepared with paint and oils.

               OUTSIDE

               Katherine leans against the doorway, nervously watching the 
               horizon.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The sky thinning into uneasy pastels as the sun falls 
               unceremoniously toward the mountains. A few lanterns have 
               been lit, and from inside the kiva can be heard the chants 
               of the Navaho Enemy Ghost Way.

               Katherine's eyes are still on a horizon dropping off into 
               shadow. She stiffens. There, at the end of the earth, appears 
               a silent plume of dust. It could be anybody's car, but it 
               can only be one car. Thomas steps up beside her.

                                     KATHERINE
                         He's coming.

               Thomas sticks his head into the kiva, speaks softly to one 
               of the elderly villagers attending the ceremony.

                         No.

               A fire has been built on the kiva's floor. Through the choking 
               smoke can be seen Mary lying on a mat as Grey Horse chants 
               to the yei spirits and adds fine colored earth to the growing 
               sand painting beside her. His voice rises and falls in 
               guttural syntax. He's coaxing. Coaxing the alien spirit out 
               of the child.

               He pulls his head out and hands Katherine the pistol.

                         Stay inside. It's only one round, so 
                         make it count.

               There's a pause and for a moment their eyes lock. She touches 
               his arm, almost says something, then disappears into the 
               kiva. Thomas closes the door behind her. He turns and looks 
               out at the distant plume of dust. Growing closer.

               EXT. GABRIEL'S RAMBLER - DAY

               Radio turned up, sophomoric grin glued on his face, Gabriel 
               roars past and begins the snaking climb up the side of the 
               butte. The sun has almost completely slipped away now, leaving 
               the land a deathly bluish grey.

               The road flattens out at the top of the butte and Gabriel 
               can see the village glowing at the far end. He punches the 
               rambler, winding it up for the last stretch, and pats the 
               blonde on the knee.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You'll like this, Rachael.

               Maybe not.

               There's a sudden glint of metal in the headlights as Thomas 
               at the last moment PULLS UP the heavy chain and HOOKS it 
               over the far post. Gabriel does something pointless with the 
               brakes and SLAMS forward into it. The whole rear of the car 
               STANDS UP on impact, PITCHING Gabriel through the windshield 
               into the dust.

               Thomas steps out from behind the post armed with an iron 
               bar. The rambler hisses and belches a death rattle as he 
               cautiously walks toward the spot of gloom where Gabriel lies.

                                     GABRIEL
                              (breathless)
                         Nice move.

               Thomas's feet crunch softly closer.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You ought to come work for us. 
                         Upstairs. We sneak the odd civilian 
                         in now and then, you know. You'd 
                         like it. Nobody tells you when to go 
                         to bed, can eat all the ice cream 
                         you want. And you get to kill. All 
                         day and all night. Just like an angel.

               Thomas doesn't answer. Gabriel's body looks ravaged as he 
               carefully steps closer and closer.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Save yourself, friend. Why go to the 
                         wall with the bitch and her rug rat? 
                         It'll all turn out the same anyway. 
                         Here or in heaven, we're still gonna 
                         tear the kid apart.

                         I'm a man you eyeless puke, which 
                         means I have one thing you never 
                         will. A soul. And though I may, 
                         somewhere inside, believe in a God, 
                         I will never, never, believe in you.

                                     GABRIEL
                         A little speechy today, aren't we?
                              (sighs)
                         Okay pal, have it your way.

               Gabriel's legs suddenly SWING AROUND and SMACK Thomas, 
               sprawling him back into the dirt. The iron bar goes flying 
               as Gabriel in a flash is on top of him. Thomas thrashes but 
               Gabriel easily pins his shoulders and sits on his chest. 
               Without hurry he uncurls the fingers of his right hand.

                                     GABRIEL
                         This is going to really, really hurt.

               Thomas's eyes are wild with fear.

                                     DAGGETT
                         If you wanted to know so badly, 
                         Gabriel, why didn't you just ask 
                         Him? Why didn't you just ask God?

               A shudder passes through Gabriel. He straightens up and looks 
               down at Thomas as emotion racks his body.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Because He doesn't talk to us anymore!

               The two stare at one another. Then Gabriel, lost in himself, 
               suddenly turns away from Thomas and walks into the darkness. 
               For the village.

               Thomas climbs quickly to his feet, spins around --

               -- And is HIT full-force by a rabid, SHRIEKING Rachael. Her 
               legs lock around his body vise-like as her teeth and nails 
               DIG into his skin. He cries out and stumbles to the ground. 
               The two grapple furiously in the dust, Rachel's crazed face 
               taking BITE after BITE out of his shoulder and neck.

               Thomas manages a fistfull of her hair and YANKS the fangs 
               off his shoulder. With his other arm he CUFFS her hard, 
               BREAKING the grip and ROLLING her aside. He staggers to his 
               knees and begins to run. Shrieking, a mad porcelain banshee 
               out of the dusk, Rachael catches up and TACKLES him. On the 
               way down his head strikes a small stone wall and the pain is 
               white thunder. Gagging and weeping in blank shock, he crawls 
               on his hands and knees as Rachael OPENS UP his arm from 
               shoulder to elbow with her nails. As the blood tumbles like 
               ribbons, Rachael JUMPS onto his back, DIGGING her claws into 
               his scalp.

               It's about all one human can take.

               Mad with pain and anger and desperation, Thomas manages to 
               climb to a shaky crouch, Rachael still shrieking on his back. 
               Throwing all his weight backward, he JAMS her into the short 
               stone wall. The impact SNAPS her hold and PROPELS her over 
               the wall --

               And two thousand feet down the side of the butte.

               Thomas Daggett can only curl up into a ball, gulping shallow, 
               shuddering breaths.

               IN THE VILLAGE

               Gabriel walks resolutely up to the first hogan and KICKS 
               down the plank wood door. No one home. He walks to the second 
               and KICKS its door down. Nothing.

               IN THE KIVA

               Mary's ceremony is nearing a crescendo. Grey Horse has donned 
               the colorful mask of the yei god Monster Slayer as the 
               relatives now join in the guttural chants of the Enemy Ghost 
               Way. Through the thick, choking smoke of the ceremonial fire 
               we see Katherine, nervously watching the door.

               IN THE DARKNESS OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE

               Thomas tries hopelessly to make his way back. Stumbling every 
               few steps, he's beyond pain and into driven numbness. It's 
               hopeless though. We know it.

               IN THE VILLAGE

               Gabriel KICKS down another door to another empty hogan. 
               There's only one left. As he approaches, from within can be 
               heard the muffled sound of chanting.

               THOMAS

               Takes a few more fumbling steps and falls again. He reaches 
               out to something metal for support. It's Katherine's pickup.

               GABRIEL

               Steps up to the kiva door and KICKS it. The frame buckles 
               but holds. He steps back a few feet, puts all his weight 
               into a turn, and KICKS again. The door SHATTERS.

               INSIDE

               Wood splinters ROCKET through the smoke as Gabriel appears 
               in the doorway. Grey Horse, everyone, freezes.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Relax folks, it's just a soul.

               From out of the smoke steps Katherine. She FIRES, one round, 
               into Gabriel's side. The archangel is pitched against the 
               kiva's wall, where he stays a moment before turning to 
               Katherine.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I'm getting real tired of you.

               She stands her ground between him and the child.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Go to hell.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Heaven, darling. Heaven. At least 
                         get the zip code right.

                                     KATHERINE
                         It's all the same, isn't it?

                                     GABRIEL
                         No. In heaven we believe in love.

                                     KATHERINE
                         And what do you love, Gabriel?

               Once again, the shade of doubt holds him up. But it's quickly 
               pushed aside for a corrupted grin. He's given up all pretense.

                                     GABRIEL
                         -- Cracking your skull.

               He advances on her.

                                     KATHERINE
                         That's all it is for you anymore, 
                         Gabriel, isn't it? Just the killing 
                         and the burning. You don't work for 
                         God anymore. You don't fight for 
                         love.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Shut up!

               And he's on her. With his left arm he brutally forces her to 
               her knees as his right hand, palm out and fingers splayed, 
               clamp themselves over her face. Katherine's mouth opens in a 
               silent scream as the pain, immediate and beyond endurance, 
               flows through her body.

               From somewhere outside, there's a sound.

               Katherine gulps chokes of agony as her very clothes begin to 
               smolder around her.

               We hear the sound once more, closer, before --

               The entire kiva wall EXPLODES INWARD as Katherine's pickup 
               CRASHES through it. The mangled grill and hood SLAM into 
               Gabriel from the side and SMASH him to the ground like a 
               broken puppet. Katherine falls backward to the floor, gets 
               up, and runs to the truck's cab. Inside sits a near catatonic 
               Thomas. Katherine takes only a second to share a look with 
               him before reaching back and pulling out the pickup's tire 
               iron.

               Gabriel, a shattered, broken thing, pulls himself up to his 
               knees. The sunglasses are gone and two eyeless pits stare 
               out at Mary, huddled in the corner. Bleeding from every pore, 
               one arm bent back the wrong way, he crawls across the floor 
               toward her, his voice the milky slur of a stroke victim.

                                     GABRIEL
                         God loves you, Mary!

               Katherine brings the tire iron down on his skull with all 
               her might, DRIVING him to the floor. She turns to Grey Horse, 
               her eyes wild.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Finish it.

               He, everyone, just stare. Stunned to stone.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Finish it!

               Grey Horse timidly picks up his prayer stick and with a voice 
               faltering and cracked, in the insane glare of the wrecked 
               pickup's headlights, resumes the Enemy Ghost Way chant.

               Katherine turns back to Gabriel.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Go home.

               She HITS him again with the tire iron. Then lifts it high 
               once more above her head. She's going to crush him, to implode 
               his skull.

               When a hand stops her.

               Sort of a hand. A claw. Lucifer's. He's standing behind her, 
               holding the raised bar still.

                                     LUCIFER
                         No.

               Katherine releases the bar and lets it clang to the floor. 
               Lucifer turns to the villagers, gazing fearfully at him as 
               they awkwardly try to finish the chant.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Please. Go on.

               Lucifer's gaze falls on a deeply fucked-up Gabriel who groans 
               at the sight of him.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Oh man, this just isn't my day.

               Lucifer kneels down beside him. Katherine instinctively starts 
               to reach for the tire iron but the sycophant hisses a liquid, 
               chattering warning at her.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Long time.

                                     GABRIEL
                         The world's young, man.

                                     LUCIFER
                         And full of ambition.

                                     GABRIEL
                         This isn't your war.

                                     LUCIFER
                         But I remember the last one. Michael's 
                         war.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You lost.

                                     LUCIFER
                         But lots of angels were with me. 
                         every one followed their leader out 
                         of heaven.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Yeah yeah, I was there, remember?

                                     LUCIFER
                         Except one. Oh, he was with me all 
                         right. He hated the Eagle Scout. 
                         Envied the power He gave to His Son. 
                         But this angel never came out front 
                         during the war. And when it ended he 
                         thought maybe, maybe the Eagle Scout 
                         didn't notice. So he laid low and 
                         towed the company line till he could 
                         start his own war. It was all just 
                         jealousy.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You're dreaming.

                                     LUCIFER
                         But maybe He did notice. Maybe that's 
                         why I'm here.

                                     GABRIEL
                         -- Stay away from me.

                                     LUCIFER
                         You've always been a part of me, 
                         Gabriel. And now it's time to come 
                         home.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Fuck you!

               Lucifer slams Gabriel's head against the floor and pins it. 
               As the angel thrashes furiously, Lucifer FORCES his arm into 
               Gabriel's chest. Gabriel cries out as Lucifer PULLS his arm 
               half out and FORCES it deeper. Again. And again. Soon 
               Gabriel's screams become giggles, then a crazed, hysterical 
               laughter.

               The room goes insane. An impossible nightmare of chanting 
               Navahos, glaring headlights, and Gabriel's echoing laughter 
               as Lucifer pumps his chest. Laughter that rises to a kind of 
               orgasmic cry then instantly stops as Lucifer pulls out the 
               angel's heart,

               And eats it.

               At that instant Grey Horse places his hand on Mary's forehead, 
               speaks a last line, and the chant is completed.

               Sticky, smoky, awful silence. Gabriel is a non-thing. A 
               battered, hollow shell.

               Bartholomew Grey Horse, his voice cracked and finished, turns 
               to Katherine.

                                     GREY HORSE
                         The enemy spirit is gone.

                                     DAGGETT
                              (weak, faint)
                         Where?

               From outside the kiva suddenly comes the sound of a wounded, 
               savage GROWL. Katherine walks to the doorway. Just outside a 
               lone coyote is twisting in the dirt with furious agony. 
               Abruptly its thrashings cease. The animal stands and flashes 
               for an instant at Katherine cold yellow eyes more than animal. 
               Then it's gone into the blackness. Forever.

               She turns and goes back to Thomas in the cab. Bleeding to 
               death is a real possibility for him. She pulls an old shirt 
               out of the back and tries to makeshift a wrap for his sliced 
               arm.

                                     DAGGETT
                         More will come... To look for the 
                         soul...

                                     KATHERINE
                         And they won't find it. Not in Mary.

               A few of the village elders appear at the cab.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Can you help him?

                                     VILLAGER
                         We have some bandages.

               Katherine walks over to where Mary, sweaty and shaken, sits 
               huddled in a corner attended by Grey Horse.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Are you all right, pumpkin?

               Mary's voice shakes as tears roll out her eyes.

                                     MARY
                         I'm okay.

               Katherine gathers her up into her arms and holds her.

                                     KATHERINE
                         It's going to be okay... We're all 
                         going to be okay...

               The chattering, hissing sycophant grabs Gabriel's body by 
               the hair and shoulders and drags it out the door. Lucifer 
               has remained behind, crouched on his haunches, his liquid, 
               yellow eyes on Katherine.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I can't quite bring myself to say 
                         thank you.

                                     LUCIFER
                         I understand.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Then this is done.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Not necessarily. Maybe I like you. 
                         Maybe I want you to come with me.

               He rises to his feet and steps slowly toward her.

                                     LUCIFER
                         You owe me, Katherine. And you're 
                         going to ask me to take you home.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (clutching Mary)
                         No.

                                     LUCIFER
                         You will. You will because any other 
                         way is going to be more awful than 
                         you can imagine.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Are you threatening me?

               Just a grinning, twisted stare.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Then you've picked the wrong person 
                         this time. I've just about had it up 
                         to here with ghosts. So you can put 
                         away the horror movie sneer and the 
                         K-Mart halloween eyes, because we 
                         know you now. We know you all. And 
                         if you want to force the issue then 
                         go ahead because you're just another 
                         angel to me. Take a look at your 
                         buddy Gabriel. Then ask yourself, do 
                         you really, really want to fuck with 
                         us?

               The smallest hint of a pause.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Perhaps another time.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I'm holding my breath.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Goodbye, Katherine. For now.

               And he's gone. Through the door and into the night.

                                     MARY
                         Is he coming back?

                                     KATHERINE
                         I don't think so, honey... I don't 
                         think so...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The fullness of day over Old Woman Butte, hot and bright. 
               Chasing the night and its fears away under the punishing 
               glare of noon.

               The village is full of police vehicles now. Green broncos 
               from the Navaho Tribal Police. Blue and white sheriff 
               department sedans.

               The Navaho cops are talking with Katherine and Mary. Thomas 
               is sitting on the trunk of a patrol car getting his wounds 
               properly bandaged as the Sheriff we met earlier leans beside 
               him chewing on a wild oat stalk.

                                     SHERIFF

                              Thomas)
                         Is he going to live?

                                     DEPUTY
                         With any luck.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (to Thomas)
                         I thought I told you to give me a 
                         call if anything snarled.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Hmmm.

               He chews some more on his stalk. Looks off at the village.

                                     SHERIFF
                         This fella, Gabriel...

                         Just Gabriel.

                         Pretty violent guy, Gabriel. Even 
                         for out here.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Yeah.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Caught up with him at the village?

                         He caught up with me.

                                     SHERIFF
                         What were you doing way up here?

                         Indian stuff.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Yeah. Indian stuff.

               The Sheriff looks over at Katherine's pickup still jammed 
               into the side of the kiva.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Did you kill this Gabriel?

                         Maybe. I think so.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Don't have any idea where the body 
                         is I suppose.

                         Well, if he's alive he won't get far 
                         out there. Us or the coyotes, it'll 
                         be the same.
                              (beat)
                         I rang your office in LA. They don't 
                         have a warrant out for a Gabriel. Or 
                         anybody else in Arizona.

                                     DAGGETT
                         I hadn't gotten around to it.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Sort of an out of pocket thing.

                         Yes.

               The Sheriff takes his hat off. Runs his finger along the 
               inside band.

                                     SHERIFF
                         That woman lying at the bottom of 
                         the arroyo, the one still in her 
                         hospital gown, know anything about 
                         that?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Really.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Really.

                                     SHERIFF
                         This Gabriel was sure one busy dude.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Yes, he was.

               Beat.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You'll be going back to Los Angeles 
                         now?

                         Yeah.

               The Sheriff pushes off from the patrol car and tosses aside 
               the oak stalk.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Don't hurry back.

               The deputy finishes his bandaging.

                                     DEPUTY
                         Don't do much but breathe the next

               He follows his boss. Katherine and Mary walk up.

                         Not really. I think they might have 
                         even understood. One of them's related 
                         to this clan. He'll give us a ride 
                         back if we want.

                         department.

               The moment drifts into silence.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Do you think it's really over?

                         I want that too.

               She touches his cheek, Mary cradled between them.

               To the end of the earth.

               As the bronco drifts away from us toward the empty, rocky

                                       Final Draft

                                     December 1, 1953

                

               FADE IN:

               INT. JEFFERIES' APARTMENT - DAY - LONG SHOT

               Although we do not see the foreground window frame, we see 
               the whole background of a Greenwich Village street.

               We can see the rear of a number of assorted houses and small 
               apartment buildings whose fronts face on the next cross-town 
               street, sharply etched by the morning sun.

               Some are two stories high; others three; some have peaked 
               roofs, others are flat. There is a mixture of brick and wood 
               and wrought iron in the construction.

               The apartment buildings have fire escapes, the others do 
               not.

               The neighborhood is not a prosperous one, but neither is it 
               poor. It is a practical, conventional dwelling place for 
               people living on marginal incomes, luck -- or hope and careful 
               planning.

               The summer air is motionless and heavy with humid heat.

               It has opened windows wide, pushed back curtains, lifted 
               blinds and generally brought the neighborhood life into a 
               sweltering intimacy. Yet, people born and bred to life within 
               earshot and eye glance of a score of neighbors have learned 
               to preserve their own private worlds by uniformly ignoring 
               each other, except on direct invitation.

               THE CAMERA PULLS BACK until a large sleeping profile of a 
               man fills the screen. It is so large that we do not see any 
               features, but merely the temple and side of the cheek down 
               which a stream of sweat is running.

               THE CAMERA PANS OFF this to the right hand side of the window, 
               and MOVES TO a thermometer which is hanging on the wall just 
               outside the window. It registers 84.

               THE CAMERA MOVES ON into the open, and brings nearer to us a 
               room with a large studio window. We are able to see inside 
               this room. A short, balding man is standing near the window, 
               shaving, using a small bowl of water and a portable mirror 
               which he has set up on a shelf.

               To the right of him is a battered upright piano. On top of 
               the piano is a radio. The music selection coming from the 
               radio stops, and the announcer is heard.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         The time -- 7:15 A.M., WOR, New York. 
                         The temperature, outside, 84 -- 
                         Friends -- is your life worth one 
                         dollar?

               The man shaving quickly puts down his razor, hurries to the 
               radio, and changes the station, moving past a number of 
               commercial voices until he again finds some music.

               Contented, he returns to his shaving.

               THE CAMERA MOVES ON AND OVER to a far building. It passes 
               over the face of this building until it comes to fire escapes. 
               It goes up and near enough to one which has become the outdoor 
               bedroom of a couple. We are near enough to see an alarm clock 
               hanging from the rail which is now ringing vigorously. A man 
               rises lazily to a sitting position. He gropes to switch the 
               alarm off.

               We see that his pajamas are stained with sweat. In his sitting 
               position he leans forward and shakes somebody beside him. To 
               our surprise, the head of this other person -- a woman -- 
               rises where his feet are. They have been sleeping in opposite 
               directions. They sit limply looking at each other with 
               bedraggled and weary expressions which show they enjoyed 
               very little sleep in the heat of the night.

               THE CAMERA NOW MOVES DOWN toward the left onto another low 
               building. It MOVES IN A LITTLE to a living room window. Just 
               inside the windowsill, a small fan is oscillating. The fan 
               sits on the right side of the table, and to the left of it 
               is an automatic toaster.

               Behind the toaster stands a full-bodied young woman, 
               apparently wearing only a pair of black panties. Her stomach, 
               navel, and the lower part of her chest are naked. Just below 
               her breasts, the curtain, partly drawn, has thrown a deep 
               shadow which extends upward, hiding her breasts, shoulders 
               and head. Two pieces of toast pop up in the toaster. She 
               takes them out, butters them. Then she turns around and bends 
               over another table on which stands an automatic coffee-maker.

               She picks up the coffee-maker, and swings back to the table 
               to sit down. She does this so deftly that her breasts are 
               never exposed, but hidden by the fan as she sits down. The 
               fan moves back and forth as she pours coffee, far enough to 
               reveal that she wears no bra, but not far enough to fulfill 
               the exciting promise of her lack of clothes.

               THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a distant street corner seen between 
               two buildings. The traffic is very light at this hour, but a 
               Sanitation Department truck moves through the intersection 
               spraying water out behind it to cool the pavement and keep 
               the dust down. Three little kids in bathing suits run behind 
               the truck, playing in the water.

               THE CAMERA MOVES OFF and around to some buildings at the 
               side. As it skims this building, we see a hand emerge from 
               one of the windows, and remove the cover from a birdcage 
               which is hanging from a hook on the wall outside. In the 
               cage are two lovebirds -- arguing.

               THE CAMERA NOW PULLS BACK SWIFTLY and retreats through the 
               open window back into Jefferies' apartment. We now see more 
               of the sleeping man. THE CAMERA GOES IN far enough to show a 
               head and shoulders of him.

               He is L. B. JEFFERIES. A tall, lean, energetic thirty five, 
               his face long and serious-looking at rest, is in other 
               circumstances capable of humor, passion, naive wonder and 
               the kind of intensity that bespeaks inner convictions of 
               moral strength and basic honesty.

               He is sitting in an Everest and Jennings wheelchair.

               THE CAMERA PANS along his right leg. It is encased in a 
               plaster of Paris spica from his waistline to the base of his 
               toes. Along the white cast someone has written "Here lie the 
               broken bones of L. B. Jefferies."

               THE CAMERA PANS to a nearby table on which rests a shattered 
               and twisted Speed Graphic Camera, the kind used by fast-action 
               news photographers.

               On the same table, the CAMERA PANS to an eight by ten glossy 
               photo print. It shows a dirt track auto racing speedway, 
               taken from a point dangerously near the center of the track. 
               A racing car is skidding toward the camera, out of control, 
               spewing a cloud of dust behind it. A rear wheel has come off 
               the car, and the wheel is bounding at top speed directly 
               into the camera lens.

               THE CAMERA MOVES UP to a framed photograph on the wall.

               It is a fourteen by ten print, an essay in violence, having 
               caught on film the exploding semi-second when a heavy 
               artillery shell arches into a front-line Korean battle 
               outpost. Men and equipment erupt into the air suspended in a 
               solution of blasted rock, dust and screeching shrapnel. That 
               the photographer was not a casualty is evident, but surprising 
               when the short distance between the camera and the explosion 
               is estimated. A signature in the lower right hand corner of 
               the picture reads -- "L. B. Jefferies."

               THE CAMERA PANS to a second photograph of a picket line at 
               an aircraft plant strike. Strikers, non-strikers and police 
               are embroiled in a bitter and confused riot.

               Clubs, fists and truncheons swing, blood flows, faces twist 
               with emotion and fallen victims struggle to regain their 
               feet. The picture represents no distant, cautions photographic 
               observation, but rather an intimate report, so immediate and 
               real that the viewer has the nervous feeling the fight 
               surrounds him and he had best defend himself. The same 
               signature, "L. B. Jefferies," is in the corner.

               THE CAMERA PANS TO another framed picture, this one a 
               beautiful and awesome shot of an atomic explosion at 
               Frenchman's Flat, Nevada. It is the cul-de-sac of violence. 
               The picture taken at a distant observation point, shows some 
               spectators in the foreground watching the explosion through 
               binoculars.

               THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a shelf containing a number of cameras, 
               photographic film, etc. It then PAN ACROSS a large viewer on 
               which is resting a negative of a woman's head.

               From this, THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a magazine cover, and 
               although we do not see the name of the magazine, we can see 
               the head on the cover is the positive of the negative we 
               have just passed.

               THE CAMERA FINALLY COMES TO REST ON a pile of magazines -- 
               perhaps a hundred or so. They are all of the same publication.

                                                           LAP DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. GUNNISON'S OFFICE - DAY - CLOSE UP

               The screen is filled with the top of a desk. In addition to 
               the usual telephones, blotting pad, etc., the most prominent 
               feature is the number of glossy photo prints, and even larger-
               sized mat prints. Some of them have slips pasted over with 
               descriptions. The center of the desk is occupied by a large 
               layout of photographs on one magazine page. Behind this we 
               hear the murmur of two voices of men who can be vaguely seen 
               beyond the desk.

               THE CAMERA PANS UP and we are now face to face with IVAR 
               GUNNISON and JACK BRYCE. Gunnison is sitting on a window-
               ledge, and beyond him we realize we are high above the New 
               York streets. Bryce leans against a wall at right angles to 
               him.

               Gunnison is holding a cablegram in his hand. Bryce has a 
               cigarette in his mouth. He scratches a match, and is about 
               to light it, when he notices that Gunnison, still reading 
               the cable, has reached into an inside shirt pocket, and 
               produced a cigarette. Quickly, Bryce moves over to light 
               Gunnison's cigarette. Then he settles back to light his own. 
               Gunnison doesn't even bother to thank him.

                                     GUNNISON
                              (Looks up)
                         Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would 
                         go sky-high.

                                     BRYCE
                         From the looks of Davidson's cable, 
                         it might even go higher than that. 
                         And we haven't even got a camera 
                         over there.

                                     GUNNISON
                              (Stands)
                         This could go off in a month -- or 
                         an hour.

                                     BRYCE
                         I'll pull somebody out of Japan.

                                     GUNNISON
                              (Heads for his phone)
                         Bryce, the only man for this job is 
                         sitting right here in town.
                              (Picks up phone)
                         Get me L. B. Jefferies.

                                     BRYCE
                              (Puzzled)
                         Jefferies?

                                     GUNNISON
                              (To Bryce; still 
                              holding phone)
                         Name me a better photographer.

                                     BRYCE
                              (He can't)
                         But his leg!

                                     GUNNISON
                         Don't worry -- it comes off today.

               Bryce gives Gunnison a startled look.

                                     GUNNISON
                         I mean the cast.
                              (To phone)

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Shooting through the open window, onto Jeff. He is shaving 
               himself with an electric razor as the phone rings. He shuts 
               off the shaver, picks up the phone.

                                     JEFF
                         Jefferies.

                                     GUNNISON
                              (On filter)
                         Congratulations, Jeff.

                                     JEFF
                         For what?

                                     GUNNISON
                         For getting rid of that cast.

                                     JEFF
                         Who said I was getting rid of it?

               At this moment, his attention is drawn to something across 
               the way. He looks up, expectantly. There is almost a touch 
               of eagerness in his expression.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - LONG SHOT

               While Jeff is continuing his phone conversation, we see the 
               object of his look. Two pretty girls have appeared on the 
               distant roof. They are smiling and talking, although we cannot 
               hear their dialogue. Each wears a terrycloth robe. With their 
               backs to the CAMERA, they take off the robes, slipping them 
               down over their shoulders slowly. Then, seductively, they 
               turn -- revealing the full beauty of their tanned and bathing-
               suited bodies. It is almost as if they want to be noticed, 
               the center of neighborhood attention. They at least have all 
               of Jeff's attention. Then they spread the robes in front of 
               them, and lie down on the roof, and out of sight. Jeff seems 
               a little disappointed.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               During the whole of this previous action, the conversation 
               between Jeff and Gunnison has gone on as follows:

                                     GUNNISON
                              (With logical proof)
                         This is Wednesday.

                                     JEFF
                         Gunnison -- how did you get to be 
                         such a big editor -- with such a 
                         small memory?

                                     GUNNISON
                         Wrong day?

                                     JEFF
                         Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge 
                         from this plaster cocoon.

                                     GUNNISON
                         That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess 
                         I can't be lucky every day. Forget I 
                         called.

                                     JEFF
                         Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, 
                         Gunnison. Must be rough on you 
                         thinking of me wearing this cast 
                         another whole week.

               INT. GUNNISON'S OFFICE - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Gunnison is now seated at his desk, with the phone receiver 
               to his ear. His assistant, Bryce, can be seen vaguely in the 
               background.

                                     GUNNISON
                         That one week is going to cost me my 
                         best photographer -- and you a big 
                         assignment.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSE-UP

               Jeff asks, eagerly and alertly.

                                     JEFF
                         Where?

               We hear Gunnison's reply.

                                     GUNNISON
                         There's no point in even talking 
                         about it.

               Jeff's eyes become set upon something else in the neighborhood 
               he sees.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - LONG SHOT

               Jeff's attention is now drawn to another feature of his 
               backyard entertainment. THE CAMERA IS NOW FOCUSED on the 
               window of the small building where we earlier saw the girl 
               behind the oscillating fan. Loud ballet music is pouring 
               from her open window. The girl, now dressed in dark and 
               revealing leotard, and ballet slippers, has just turned away 
               from a portable record player. She begins the first graceful 
               movement of a modern ballet interpretation.

               She gracefully moves across the room to the rhythm of the 
               music and dance, toward the ice box. With her feet still 
               moving, she throws open the door, and then rhythmically moving 
               back to the center of the room, gnaws the chicken bone, 
               occasionally waving it in the air as part of the choreography. 
               She now twirls over toward a table at the other side of the 
               room on which is an open package of bread slices, some butter 
               nearby.

               With swaying body, she puts down the chicken leg, and 
               gracefully and rhythmically butters a slice of bread.

               She picks up both bread and chicken leg and continues her 
               interpretive dance, alternately munching the bread and butter 
               and chicken leg.

               Jeff's eyes drop from the ballet dancer's room to the one 
               underneath.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - LONG SHOT

               THE CAMERA PANS from the window of the dancing girl, to the 
               window below. Someone is reading the New York Herald Tribune. 
               The paper lowers, and we see an elderly lady, in her late 
               sixties. She is a faded, refined type. She looks up in the 
               direction of the music and in a calm routine fashion adjusts 
               the volume of her hearing aid. She resumes her reading.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Jeff is amused by what he sees, but continues his conversation 
               with Gunnison, which has gone on through all the scenes with 
               the ballet dancer.

                                     JEFF
                              (Insistent)
                         Where?

                         Indo-China. Got a code tip from the 
                         bureau chief this morning. The place 
                         is about to go up in smoke.

                                     JEFF
                              (Pleased; excited)
                         Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you 
                         it was the next place to watch?

                                     GUNNISON
                         You did.

                                     JEFF
                              (On filter)
                         Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An 
                         hour?

                                     GUNNISON
                         With that cast on -- you don't.

                                     JEFF
                              (On filter)
                         Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take 
                         pictures from a jeep. From a water 
                         buffalo if necessary.

                                     GUNNISON
                         You're too valuable to the magazine 
                         for us to play around with. I'll 
                         send Morgan or Lambert.

                                     JEFF
                         Swell. I get myself half-killed for 
                         you -- and you reward me by stealing 
                         my assignments.

                                     GUNNISON
                         I didn't ask you to stand in the 
                         middle of that automobile race track.

                                     JEFF
                              (A little angry)
                         You asked for something dramatically 
                         different! You got it!

                                     GUNNISON
                              (Quietly)
                         So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.

                                     JEFF
                              (Won't let him hang 
                              up)
                         You've got to get me out of here! 
                         Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room 
                         apartment with nothing to do but 
                         look out the window at the neighbors!

               At this moment we hear the sounds of a piano playing.

               It is a simple, but broken, melody as if someone was just 
               learning to play the piano, or carefully composing a song. 
               It clashes abruptly with the music from the ballet dancer's 
               apartment. It irritates Jeff as he looks in the direction of 
               the new music.

                                     JEFF
                         It's worse than the Chinese water 
                         torture.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               We now see the source of the piano music. It comes from the 
               apartment with the studio window which we saw earlier where 
               the man was shaving and listening to the radio. The short, 
               balding man sits at the piano playing a few notes, then 
               transferring them by pencil to notepaper on the piano rack. 
               He continues this process, fighting the interference of the 
               ballet music. The opening bars of his melody are beautiful 
               and ear-catching.

               It is slow, hard work, and the ballet music finally becomes 
               such an interference that he gives up and walks to the window 
               to look down toward the dancer's apartment.

               He stands by a table at the window which is littered with 
               records, the morning coffee cup, unwashed, the remains of 
               breakfast, old newspapers, song sheets, etc.

               He takes a cigarette out of his mouth, looks for an ash tray, 
               and ends up putting it out in the coffee cup. He then returns 
               to the piano and begins picking out the melody the dancer is 
               playing on her record player.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff frowns at the double sound, and raises his voice a 
               little. He continues the conversation which has been heard 
               all through the previous scene.

                                     GUNNISON
                         Read some good books.

                                     JEFF
                         I've been taking pictures so long I 
                         don't know how to read anymore. 

                                     GUNNISON
                         I'll send you some comic books.  

                                     JEFF
                              (Low, tense)
                         Listen -- if you don't pull me out 
                         of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do 
                         something drastic.

                                     GUNNISON
                         Like what?

                                     JEFF
                              (On filter)
                         I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll 
                         never be able to go anywhere.

                                     GUNNISON
                         It's about time you got married -- 
                         before you turn into a lonesome and 
                         bitter old man.

                                     JEFF
                         Can you see me -- rushing home to a 
                         hot apartment every night to listen 
                         to the automatic laundry, the electric 
                         dishwasher, the garbage disposal and 
                         a nagging wife.

                                     GUNNISON
                         Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- 
                         they discuss.

               Jefferies glances out across to the other apartments as he 
               sees:

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               We see a three-storied, flat-roofed apartment house.

               The brick is weather-worn and faded. Each apartment has three 
               windows facing the back, one showing a hallway, one a living 
               room, and the window on the right opening into a bedroom.

               On the second floor, a man has entered the living room from 
               a hallway door. He carries a large aluminum sample case common 
               to salesmen. He sets down the case heavily, removes his hat, 
               and slowly wipes his brow with the back of his right hand. 
               He takes off his coat and tie. His shirt is stained with 
               sweat underneath. He rolls up his sleeves, and his well-
               muscled arms heavy with hair confirm his dark, husky build.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               With his eyes still focused on the distant apartments, Jeff 
               continues talking with Gunnison.

                                     JEFF
                         Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts 
                         they discuss -- but in my 
                         neighborhood, they still nag.

                                     GUNNISON
                         Well -- you know best. Call you later, 
                         Jeff.

                                     JEFF
                         Next time, have some good news.

               He hangs up and resumes his attention on the apartment of 
               the salesman.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The salesman looks toward the bedroom door, hesitates, then 
               reluctantly walks toward it. For a moment he is hidden by 
               the wall.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Jeff shifts his look more to the right.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The man enters the bedroom. We can see a woman lying on the 
               far bed. Near her, a small table is covered with medicine 
               bottles, spoons, boxes of pills, a water pitcher and the 
               other impedimenta of the chronically ill. The woman sits up 
               as the man enters. She takes a wet cloth off her forehead. 
               Before the man even reaches her, she begins talking, somewhat 
               vigorously. Pointing to a wristwatch, she seems to be saying 
               something such as "You should have been home two hours ago! 
               I could be lying here dying for all you'd know -- or care!" 
               The man stops short of the bed, makes gestures of trying to 
               placate her, but she goes on scolding. His attitude changes 
               to weary patience, then irritation, then anger.

               He shouts back at her, turns and goes out of the room.

               Back in the living room, he picks up his hat, throws it 
               against the wall in anger, and leaves the apartment, slamming 
               the door behind him.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff's attention is suddenly diverted to himself. His leg, 
               under the cast, begins itching. He squirms, tries to move 
               the leg a little. It gives no relief. He scratches the outside 
               of the cast, but the itch gets worse. He reaches for a long, 
               Chinese back scratcher lying on the windowsill. Carefully, 
               and with considerable ingenuity, he works it under the cast. 
               He scratches, and a look of sublime relief comes over his 
               face. Satisfied, he takes the scratcher out. As he replaces 
               it on the windowsill, his attention is drawn back to the 
               scene outside the window.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               We see the man who left his apartment in anger come out of 
               the doorway into the backyard. He is easy to identify through 
               the color of his garish necktie. In one hand the man carries 
               a small garden hoe and rake, and in the other a pair of 
               trimming shears. He goes to a small patch of flowers, perhaps 
               three feet square.

               They are beautiful, multi-colored three foot high zinnias. 
               He kneels down, inspects them, touches them affectionately 
               and with some pride. His anger seems to have left him, 
               replaced by the kind of peace that flowers bring many people. 
               He stands up, carefully hoes the ground, them rakes it. Then 
               he snips a few leaves off the lower parts of the plant. 
               Finally, he waters them.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff's attention is turned to something else of interest.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Into the next door yard we see emerging from the apartment 
               below the ballet dancer, the elderly lady.

               She wear a broad sun hat, dark glasses, and a sunsuit 
               consisting of pink shorts and halter. She carries a copy of 
               the Herald Tribune, and still wears her hearing aid. She 
               settles into a folding, canvas deck chair.

               Her skin is dead white, and her body is thin to the point of 
               emaciation. No sooner has she settled into her chair, than 
               she is attracted by the sound of the salesman working in his 
               garden. She gets up, walks to the fence, and looks over. He 
               notices her, but doesn't speak.

               She begins gesturing to him how to take care of his flowers. 
               He listens for a moment, then looks directly at her. The 
               strong movements of his mouth show us that he objects 
               vigorously to the annoyance of her comments. She moves away 
               from the fence, started and a little shocked.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff is seated in the foreground, in a waist shot.

               Behind him, the entrance door to his apartment opens.

               STELLA McGAFFERY comes in. She is a husky, unhandsome, dark-
               haired woman who is dressed like a district nurse, with dark 
               coat, dark felt hat, with a white uniform showing underneath 
               the coat. She carries a small black bag.

               Stella pauses on the landing to watch Jeff. He doesn't appear 
               to notice her entrance.

                                     STELLA
                              (Loud)
                         The New York State sentence for a 
                         peeping Tom is six months in the 
                         workhouse!

               He doesn't turn.

                                     JEFF
                         Hello Stella.

               As she comes down the stairs of the landing, holding on the 
               wrought iron railing with one hand:

                                     STELLA
                         And there aren't any windows in the 
                         workhouse.

               She puts her bag down on a table. It is worn, and looks as 
               if it belongs more to a fighter than a nurse. She takes off 
               her hat coat, and hangs them on a chair.

                                     STELLA
                         Years ago, they used to put out your 
                         eyes with a hot poker. Is one of 
                         those bikini bombshells you always 
                         watch worth a hot poker?

               He doesn't answer. She opens the bag, takes out some medical 
               supplies: a thermometer, a stop watch, a bottle of rubbing 
               oil, a can of powder, a towel. She talks as she works.

                                     STELLA
                         We've grown to be a race of peeping 
                         Toms. What people should do is stand 
                         outside their own houses and look in 
                         once in a while.
                              (She looks up at him)
                         What do you think of that for homespun 
                         philosophy?

               A look at his face shows he doesn't think much of it.

                                     JEFF
                         Readers' Digest, April, 1939.

                                     STELLA
                         Well, I only quote from the best.

               She takes the thermometer out of its case, shakes it down. 
               Looks at it. Satisfied, she walks to Jeff.

               She swings the wheelchair around abruptly to face her.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff starts to protest.

                                     JEFF
                         Now look, Stella --

               She shoves the thermometer into his mouth.

                                     STELLA
                         See it you can break a hundred.

               As she leaves him holding the thermometer THE CAMERA PULLS 
               BACK as she crosses to a divan. She takes a sheet from 
               underneath, and covers the divan with it. Talking, all the 
               time.

                                     STELLA
                         I shoulda been a Gypsy fortune teller, 
                         instead of an insurance company nurse. 
                         I got a nose for trouble -- can smell 
                         it ten miles away.
                              (Stops, looks at him)
                         You heard of the stock market crash 
                         in '29?

               Jeff nods a bored "yes."

                                     STELLA
                         I predicted it.

                                     JEFF
                              (Around thermometer)
                         How?

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Stella stops for a moment, and looks at Jeff challengingly.

                                     STELLA
                         Simple. I was nursing a director of 
                         General Motors. Kidney ailment they 
                         said. Nerves, I said. Then I asked 
                         myself -- what's General Motors got 
                         to be nervous about?
                              (Snaps her fingers)
                         Overproduction. Collapse, I answered. 
                         When General Motors has to go to the 
                         bathroom ten times a day -- the whole 
                         country's ready to let go.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               A patient, suffering look comes over his face. He takes out 
               the thermometer.

                                     JEFF
                         Stella -- in economics, a kidney 
                         ailment has no relationship to the 
                         stock market. Absolutely none.

                                     STELLA
                         It crashed, didn't it?

               Jeff has no answer. Defeated, he puts the thermometer back 
               into his mouth.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Stella goes on with her work.

                                     STELLA
                         I can smell trouble right in this 
                         apartment. You broke your leg. You 
                         look out the window. You see things 
                         you shouldn't. Trouble. I can see 
                         you now, in front of the judge, 
                         flanked by lawyers in blue double-
                         breasted suits. You're pleading, 
                         "Judge, it was only innocent fun. I 
                         love my neighbors like a father." -- 
                         The Judge answers, "Congratulations. 
                         You just gave birth to three years 
                         in Dannemora."

               THE CAMERA PANS HER over to him. She takes out the 
               thermometer, looks at it.

                                     JEFF
                         Right now I'd even welcome trouble.

                                     STELLA
                              (Flatly)
                         You've got a hormone deficiency.

                                     JEFF
                         How can you tell that from a 
                         thermometer!

                                     STELLA
                         Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch 
                         haven't raised your temperature one 
                         degree in four weeks.

               She gets down the thermometer. Sterilizes it with a piece of 
               alcohol-soaked cotton in her other hand.

               She gets behind the wheelchair the CAMERA PULLS back as she 
               pushes it over to the divan. She puts the thermometer away 
               in its case. Then she helps him off with his pajama top. She 
               helps him stand on one foot.

               He hops one step, then she lowers him, face down, on the 
               divan. She gets a bottle of rubbing oil.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSE SHOT

               The CAMERA is very low at one end of the divan. Jeff's head, 
               half-buried in the sheet, is large in the fore-ground.

               Beyond him Stella looms large and powerful-looking.

                                     JEFF
                         I think you're right. There is going 
                         to be some trouble around here.

               Stella takes a handful of oil, slaps it on his back. He 
               winces.

                                     STELLA
                         I knew it!

                                     JEFF
                         Don't you ever heat that stuff up.

                                     STELLA
                         Gives your circulation something to 
                         fight.
                              (Begins massaging his 
                              back)
                         What kind of trouble?

                                     JEFF
                         Lisa Fremont.

                                     STELLA
                         You must be kidding. A beautiful 
                         young woman, and you a reasonably 
                         healthy specimen of manhood.

                                     JEFF
                         She expects me to marry her.

                                     STELLA
                         That's normal.

                                     JEFF
                         I don't want to.

                                     STELLA
                              (Slaps cold oils on 
                              him)
                         That's abnormal.

                                     JEFF
                              (Wincing)
                         I'm not ready for marriage.

                                     STELLA
                         Nonsense. A man is always ready for 
                         marriage -- with the right girl. And 
                         Lisa Fremont is the right girl for 
                         any man with half a brain, who can 
                         get one eye open.

                                     JEFF
                              (Indifferent)
                         She's all right.

               She hits him with some more cold oil. He winces again.

                                     STELLA
                         Behind every ridiculous statement is 
                         always hidden the true cause.
                              (Peers at him)
                         What is it? You have a fight?

                                     JEFF
                         No.

                         Her father loading up the shotgun?

                                     JEFF
                         Stella!

                                     STELLA
                         It's happened before, you know! Some 
                         of the world's happiest marriage 
                         have started 'under the gun' you 
                         might say.

                                     JEFF
                         She's just not the girl for me.

                                     STELLA
                         She's only perfect.

                                     JEFF
                         Too perfect. Too beautiful, too 
                         talented, too sophisticated, too 
                         everything -- but what I want.

                                     STELLA
                              (Cautiously)
                         Is what you want something you can 
                         discuss?

               Jeff gives an exasperated look.

                                     JEFF
                         It's very simple. She belongs in 
                         that rarefied atmosphere of Park 
                         Avenue, expensive restaurants, and 
                         literary cocktail parties.

                                     STELLA
                         People with sense can belong wherever 
                         they're put.

                                     JEFF
                         Can you see her tramping around the 
                         world with a camera bum who never 
                         has more than a week's salary in the 
                         bank?
                              (Almost to himself)
                         If only she was ordinary.

               Stella sprinkles powder on his back, spreads it around.

               THE CAMERA PULLS BACK as she helps Jeff to a sitting position. 
               He buttons on his shirt.

                                     STELLA
                         You're never going to marry?

                                     JEFF
                         Probably. But when I do, it'll be to 
                         someone who thinks of life as more 
                         than a new dress, a lobster dinner, 
                         and the latest scandal. I need a 
                         woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, 
                         and love it.

               THE CAMERA MOVES IN as she helps him into the wheelchair, 
               listening to him with exaggerated attention. He, stops as he 
               notice her attitude. Then he goes on with less conviction:

                                     JEFF
                         The only honest thing to do is call 
                         it off. Let her look for somebody 
                         else.

                                     STELLA
                         I can just hear you now. "Get out of 
                         here you perfect, wonderful woman! 
                         You're too good for me!"

                                     JEFF
                              (After pause)
                         That's the hard part.

               She swings him around in front of the window. He starts to 
               look out.

                                     STELLA
                         Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. 
                         I'm not even sophisticated. But I 
                         can tell you this -- when a man and 
                         a woman see each other, and like 
                         each other -- they should come 
                         together -- wham like two taxies on 
                         Broadway. Not sit around studying 
                         each other like specimens in at 
                         bottle.

                                     JEFF
                         There's an intelligent way to approach 
                         marriage.

                                     STELLA
                              (Scoffing)
                         Intelligence! Nothing has caused the 
                         human race more trouble. Modern 
                         marriage!

               Jeff swings his chair back to look at her.

                         We've progressed emotionally in --

                                     STELLA
                              (Interrupting)
                         Baloney! Once it was see somebody, 
                         get excited, get married -- Now, 
                         it's read books, fence with four 
                         syllable words, psychoanalyze each 
                         other until you can't tell a petting 
                         party from a civil service exam

                         that --

                              (Interrupting again)
                         Ask for trouble and you get it. Why 
                         there's a good boy in my neighborhood 
                         who went with a nice girl across the 
                         street for three years. Then he 
                         refused to marry her. Why? -- Because 
                         she only scored sixty-one on a Look 
                         Magazine marriage quiz!

               Jeff can't help smiling.

                                     STELLA
                         When I married Myles, we were both 
                         maladjusted misfits. We still are. 
                         And we've loved every minute of it.

                                     JEFF
                         That's fine, Stella. Now would you 
                         make me a sandwich?

               She relaxes.

                                     STELLA
                         Okay -- but I'm going to spread some 
                         common sense on the bread. Lisa 
                         Fremont's loaded to her fingertips 
                         with love for you. I'll give you two 
                         words of advice. Marry her.

                                     JEFF
                              (Smiles)
                         She pay you much?

               Stella leaves for the kitchen in a huff. Jeff turns his chair 
               to the window.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff now looks out to see what has happened to the old lady, 
               and the man with the flowers.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The elderly lady is now asleep in her deck chair, her face 
               covered with the Herald Tribune. There is no sign of the man 
               with the flowers.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Jeff's eyes travel up to the ballet dancer's window.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               She is sitting near the window looking into an upright mirror. 
               Dreamily, and methodically, she is brushing her long copper-
               colored hair.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               His eyes are suddenly turned in another direction, sharply 
               to his left.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               He is now looking at the windows of the apartments nearest 
               to him. A shade has gone up, and a man, obviously a caretaker 
               is raising a window with some effort. Having accomplished 
               this, he turns back into the room, and we now see him approach 
               a young man and woman who are standing just inside the 
               doorway. He hands a key to the young man, and then obligingly 
               brings in two suitcases which he places on the floor beside 
               them. He gives them a studied, but agreeable nod, then 
               departs.

               We now see that the girl has a small hat with a veil, and an 
               ornate corsage pinned to her light blue tailored suit. The 
               boy, who like the girl is perhaps twenty years old, wears a 
               dark blue serge suit and a grey felt hat. He takes off the 
               hat, and scales it over to a nearby chair. Quickly they are 
               in each other's arms, kissing passionately, crushing the 
               girl's corsage and pushing her hat back a little. They part, 
               the boy laughs nervously, and takes a furtive glance out 
               toward the corridor. He looks back into the room, and beckons 
               her to come out. She follows him wonderingly. For a moment, 
               both are lost from sight. When they reappear, he is carrying 
               her in his arms, over the threshold. He sets her down, closes 
               the door, and they kiss again.

               They part, still holding hands and looking into each other's 
               eyes. Then slowly, and significantly, she looks toward the 
               open window. He releases her hands, goes to the window and 
               pull down the shade, as she is reaching upward with both 
               hands to unpin her hat.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               There is a soft, understanding look on Jeff's face, and he 
               gives an involuntary sigh. He is unaware that Stella is now 
               standing behind him.

                                     STELLA

                         Window shopper.

               He freezes, turns slowly to look up at her.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               The CAMERA makes a short sweep around the neighborhood showing 
               that some of the rooms are now with their lights on.

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK into Jeff's apartment until his head 
               fills the screen. He is asleep. A shadow of some other person 
               creeps over his face. His eyes start to open. He looks up.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - SUNSET - CLOSEUP

               The screen is filled with the eyes, nose and mouth of a woman 
               coming nearer and nearer to the CAMERA to kiss Jeff. The 
               face is more or less in shadow, a faint light coming onto 
               the profile from the window. It moves down until the lips 
               move out of her bottom of her screen, and just the remain 
               for fill the screen.

               The two big profiles filling the screen. The girl kisses 
               Jeff firmly, but not passionately. Then her head moves back 
               an inch or two. She speaks.

                         Uh-huh.

               She gives a low. Warm laugh, and the CAMERA PULLS BACK to 
               show that Lisa has been bending over Jeff's wheelchair from 
               the side. As she straightens up, it PANS her swiftly over to 
               the corner of the room, keeping her in big closeup. She turns 
               on a low, hanging light.

               We see her full facial beauty for the first time. It is a 
               warm, intelligent face.

               The CAMERA FOLLOWS HER quickly to another lamp. She gets a 
               little farther away from us so that we now see her down to 
               her waist. She turns on the second lamp and the light shows 
               us that her beauty is not alone in her face.

               The CAMERA PANS HER over to a third lamp which she turns on. 
               She is now full figure, beautifully groomed and flawless. 
               Her dress is high-style fashion and dramatic evening wear.

               She looks down at the long mahogany table beside her which 
               is littered with a number of his personal effects.

               Her own handbag is also on the table. As she talks her eyes 
               scan the table as if she's looking for something specific.

               Lisa finds what she has been looking for. Picks up an old 
               and cracked cigarette box, examines it as she talks.

                         Better than that. The "21."

               She swings open the door and stands to one side. Framed in 
               the doorway is middle-aged waiter wearing a white linen pea 
               jacket with a red collar. He's carrying in one hand a large 
               portable warming oven, and in the other hand an ice bucket 
               containing a bottle of wine covered with a napkin.

               His reaction is one of tender amusement.

                         Thank you for waiting Carl.

               He smiles, nods enters. He goes down the stairs, as she 
               follows. THE CAMERA GOES with both of them.

                                     LISA
                         Kitchen's on the left. I'll take the 
                         wine.

               He hands her the wine bucket and she places it on the table. 
               He moves toward the kitchen.

                                     CARL
                         Good evening, Mr Jefferies.

                                     JEFF
                         Hello.

               Carl goes into the kitchen.

                                     LISA
                              (Up, to Carl)
                         Just put everything right in the 
                         oven Carl. On "low."

                                     CARL
                              (Off)
                         Yes ma'am.

                                     LISA
                              (Enthusiastically)
                         Let's open the wine now. It's a 
                         Montrachet.

                                     JEFF
                              (Appreciatively)
                         A big glassful.

               She moves to a small bar set in the wall cabinet.

               Produces two glasses, hold them up.

                                     LISA
                         Big enough?

                                     JEFF
                         Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.

               She finds it. Puts the glasses on the table, uncovers the 
               wine, and begins screwing in the corkscrew.

                                     LISA
                         I couldn't think of anything more 
                         boring and tiresome than what you've 
                         been through. And the last week must 
                         be the hardest.

                                     JEFF
                         Yeah -- I want to get this thing off 
                         and get moving.

                                     LISA
                              (Struggling with cork)
                         Well, I'm going to make this a week 
                         you'll never forget.

               Carl comes out of the kitchen carrying the empty warming 
               oven. He sets it down he sees Lisa struggling with the 
               corkscrew.

                                     CARL
                         Let me, madam.

               She does. He takes out his own professional corkscrew, quickly 
               inserts it and levers the cork out. He deftly wraps the napkin 
               around the bottle and pours the wine, replacing the bottle 
               in the wine bucket. Lisa has opened her purse to produce 
               some money, in bills. She hands it to the waiter.

                                     LISA
                         This will take care of the taxi as 
                         well.

               Carl, without looking at the money, puts it in his pocket.

                                     CARL
                         Thank you, Miss Fremont.

               He picks up the warning oven.

                                     CARL
                         Have a pleasant dinner, Mr. Jefferies.

                                     JEFF
                         Thank you.

               Carl goes up the stairs and out the door, while THE CAMERA 
               REMAINS on Lisa and Jeff. She picks up both glasses of wine 
               and walks toward Jeff. She seats herself on the windowsill 
               as she hands him his glass. We notice that the outside is 
               considerably darker by now, and the lights are beginning to 
               come on in the various apartments outside. They raise their 
               glasses in a silent toast, and sip the wine. THE CAMERA CLOSES 
               IN until they are both in a tight TOW SHOT.

                         What a day I've had!

                                     JEFF
                         Tired?

                                     LISA
                         Not a bit. I was all morning in a 
                         sales meeting. Then over to the 
                         Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame 
                         Dufresne -- just over from Paris. 
                         With some spy reports. Back to the 
                         "21" for lunch with the Harper's 
                         Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered 
                         dinner. Then two Fall showings -- 
                         twenty blocks apart. Then I had to 
                         have a cocktail with Leland and Slim 
                         Hayward -- we're trying to get his 
                         next show.
                              (Softly, looking up 
                              to him)
                         Then I had to dash back and change.

                                     JEFF
                              (Mock seriousness -- 
                              one girl to another)
                         Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward 
                         wearing?

                                     LISA
                              (Seriously)
                         She looked very cool. She had on a 
                         mint green --

               She breaks off with a little laugh, and a slight reproachful 
               look at Jeff. She sips her drink then says:

                                     LISA
                         And to think, I planted three nice 
                         items about you in the columns today.

               Jeff's opinion of that is a short chuckle.

                                     LISA
                         You can't buy that kind of publicity.

                                     JEFF
                         That's good news.

                                     LISA
                         Someday you might want to open up 
                         your own studio here.

                                     JEFF
                         How could I run it from say -- 
                         Pakistan?

               She puts down her glass and slides along the window seat 
               nearer to him, THE CAMERA CLOSING IN. She looks up at him 
               with a serious frankness.

                                     LISA
                         Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? 
                         You could pick your assignment.

                                     JEFF
                         I wish there was one I wanted.

                                     LISA
                         Make the one you want.

                                     JEFF
                              (As if he can't believe 
                              her)
                         You mean leave the magazine?

                                     LISA
                         Yes.

                                     JEFF
                         For what?

                                     LISA
                         For yourself -- and me.
                              (She adds eagerly)
                         I could get you a dozen assignments 
                         tomorrow... fashion, portraits --

               Jeff interrupts her with soft laughter.

                                     LISA
                              (Offended)
                         Don't laugh. -- I could do it!

                                     JEFF
                         That's what I'm afraid of.
                              (He gazes into space)
                         Could you see me -- driving down to 
                         the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing 
                         combat boots and a three day beard?
                              (He chuckles at the 
                              thought)

                                     LISA
                         I could see you looking handsome and 
                         successful in a dark blue flannel 
                         suit.

                                     JEFF
                              (Looking directly at 
                              her)
                         Let's not talk any more nonsense, 
                         huh?

               She stands up. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK.

                                     LISA
                         I'd better start setting up for 
                         dinner.

               She moves away behind him, into the kitchen.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff gives a sigh of relief, exhaling his breath, then looks 
               down toward his legs in thought. He holds this attitude for 
               just a moment, then seems to shake off his concern to lift 
               his head and turn his attention to what might be happening 
               in his neighborhood beyond his window.

               Behind him we see the vague form of Lisa bringing in a card 
               table, which she proceeds to unfold.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Jeff's attention is concentrated on an apartment we have not 
               seen before. This belongs to a single woman, about forty 
               years of age. She lives alone. Her apartment is below that 
               of the salesman with the invalid wife.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff leans forward with increased interest. Behind him we 
               get vague figure of Lisa laying a cloth over the card table.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               A nearer view show us a more intimate picture of the woman 
               Jeff is concentrating on. She is thin and unattractive. At 
               the moment, she is putting on her make-up in front of the 
               bedroom mirror. She gives a half turn and picks up a pair of 
               horn-rimmed glasses, which she puts on, and leans nearer to 
               her mirror. She picks up a lipstick and proceeds to paint 
               her lips carefully.

               Having completed her make-up, she takes off her glasses and 
               surveys her face in the mirror. She stands up, swings the 
               skirt of her dress around, admires herself in the mirror. 
               She is quite flat-chested, and the dress hangs unattractively. 
               She lifts her chin, gives one last look, and turns toward 
               her living room. As if she's preparing to meet someone.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Without taking his eyes from the scene, Jeff picks up his 
               wineglass and drinks. As he drinks, his eyes move slightly 
               over.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               THE CAMERA HAS PANNED slightly to the woman's living room 
               window. A small, candle-lit table is set up, with dinner for 
               two. The spinster sweeps into the room, smiling. She goes to 
               the door, opens it, and in pantomime admits an imaginary 
               caller. She pretends to kiss him lightly, take his hat, and 
               place the hat on a chair. Then she shows him to a seat at 
               the table, disappears into an unseen kitchen and returns 
               with a bottle and two glasses. She sits down, pours two 
               drinks. She lifts her drink in a toast to the imaginary man 
               opposite her.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff gives a faint, sympathetic smile, and subconsciously 
               raises his glass in response. In the background, Lisa, having 
               just placed a pair of candlesticks on the table, is returning 
               to the kitchen.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Having finished her drink, the lonesome woman pours herself 
               another one. Then she starts to take a sip, smiling across 
               the table at her imaginary guest. She lowers the glass onto 
               the table. The smile fades from her face as her head drops. 
               Suddenly she buries her head in her arms over the table and 
               starts to sob.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff, his glass in hand, looks out sympathetically. He is 
               unaware that Lisa is standing behind him, and is also watching 
               this little drama.

                         Oh? You can see my apartment all the 
                         way up on 63rd street?

                                     JEFF
                         Not exactly -- but we have a little 
                         apartment here that's probably about 
                         as popular as yours.
                              (He points)
                         You, of course, remember Miss Torso.

               Both of them swing their eyes a little to the left.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The kitchen-lining room combination of the ballet dancer's 
               apartment has now been made more presentable.

               The ice box is now skillfully concealed by a large Chinese 
               screen. All kitchen utensils have been put away, replaced by 
               more attractive effects, and lamp light softens the 
               surroundings.

               Miss Torso is now wearing a cocktail dress, which shows off 
               her figure to great advantage, especially when she leans 
               toward three assorted men to offer them a plate of hors d' 
               oeuvres. She is the perfect hostess, animated, charming, and 
               with an added personal touch for each guest. She is behaving 
               with a sophistication which was not apparent when we first 
               saw her in the morning. Her every movement is followed 
               admiringly by the eyes of the three men -- one wearing black 
               tie, with a touch of grey in his hair, a Long Island socialite -- 
               a young rather handsome, actor in grey flannel suit -- and 
               last, a bright, pleasant, young man who might possibly be 
               from Wall street, wearing a blue-pin-striped suit. The latter 
               two are engaged in an animated conversation. The young man 
               in the grey suit is showing the other young man some newspaper 
               cuttings he's taken from his pocket.

               Miss Torso sees that the cocktail glass of the third man is 
               empty. She takes it over to the window, and starts to fill 
               it. The man in the tuxedo follows her over, with a casual 
               glance toward the other two. He stands beside her as she 
               makes the drink. He looks at his watch with some impatience, 
               and makes a side comment to her as to the lateness of the 
               time. She turns, gives him a light kiss on his cheek, as if 
               she's telling him to be patient. Instead of pacifying him, 
               it makes him more amorous, and he puts an arm around her 
               shoulder an plants a heavy kiss on her cheek. She turns to 
               face him, they look into each other's eyes a moment, and she 
               allows herself to be kissed on the lips -- but only long 
               enough so as to attract the attention of the other two men. 
               With a little admonishing look, she moves away from him, and 
               makes him rejoin the other two.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff turns and looks up to Lisa with a grin.

                                     JEFF
                         Well, she picked the most prosperous 
                         looking one.

                                     LISA
                         She's not in love with him -- or any 
                         of them.

                                     JEFF
                         How can you tell that -- from here?

                                     LISA
                         You said it resembled my apartment, 
                         didn't you?

               She moves away with a significant look to him. THE CAMERA 
               MOVES IN until Jeff is in semi-closeup, alone.

               He ponders over her last remark, then changes his look to 
               another direction.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               The newlyweds's apartment has the shades still drawn.

               Although there's a light burning inside.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               There is a slight, but warm, smile on Jeff's face as he looks 
               at the drawn shade. His eyes move away from the newlyweds' 
               apartment, and slowly explore the neighborhood to his right. 
               He finds something of interest, and stops to stare at it. 
               His face sobers at what he sees.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The salesman's apartment. We see both the living room and 
               the bedroom. The salesman has prepared a dinner tray, and is 
               carrying it from the kitchen, through the lining room, into 
               the bedroom. He places it on the lap of his wife, sitting up 
               in bed. He puts a couple of pillows behind her back to make 
               her more comfortable.

               She doesn't bother to thank him, but is busy examining the 
               content of the tray. Her attitude shows her dissatisfaction. 
               Nothing is right. It's not what she wanted, and it's badly 
               prepared. She begins criticizing him. He starts to answer 
               her back, but decides better of it, and instead, leaves the 
               room. He goes to the kitchen reaches up to a wall cabinet, 
               takes down a bottle and pours himself a drink. Then he returns 
               to the lining room, listens a moment. The wife is grudging 
               beginning to eat the dinner. The husband quietly lifts a 
               phone from the cradle, and dials a number.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff becomes completely absorbed with he sees. He leans 
               forward a little.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               We get a better view of the salesman waiting while his 
               connection is being made. Whoever he has called answers. And 
               instantly there is a marked change in his attitude. He 
               relaxes, smiles, is warm. He talks softly, perhaps guardedly, 
               with an occasional glance at the bedroom door. In the bedroom, 
               his wife has become aware of the call.

               Quietly she moves the tray, gets out of bed, and goes to the 
               bedroom door to listen. The wall hides her from our view.

               Then suddenly, she apparently opens the door, because the 
               living room, we see her arm suddenly appear, pointing at the 
               man and the telephone. He speaks quickly into the phone, and 
               hangs up. His face is flushed and angry as he goes toward 
               the bedroom. In the bedroom his wife appears walking back to 
               the bed, followed by the husband. She is laughing, and he is 
               answering her in angry tones. She climbs in bed laughing. 
               The more she laughs, the more angry he gets, and the harder 
               she laughs. Finally, he leaves the room, goes into the living 
               room, back into the kitchen and has another drink. He stands 
               there, controlling an outburst of emotion, and seems almost 
               to be crushing the shot glass in his clenched fist.

               While Jeff has been engaged in watching this little drama, 
               the SOUND of a piano has started. He now diverts his attention 
               from the salesman's apartment to the source of the piano 
               music. He turns his eyes in the direction of the composer's 
               apartment.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Through the studio window of the song-writer's apartment we 
               see the man at work again on his original melody, and he is 
               farther along the line of the melody than before.

               It is beginning to take some shape, and give promise of its 
               full beauty.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff, listening to the composer. His head turns as Lisa's 
               voice comes over:

                                     LISA
                              (Emerging from kitchen)
                         Where's that music coming from?

               THE CAMERA QUICKLY PULL BACK as Jeff swings his chair around. 
               Lisa is emerging from the kitchen, carrying the serving dish 
               of their lobster thermidor.

                                     JEFF
                         Oh... some songwriter. In the studio 
                         apartment. Lives alone. Probably had 
                         an unhappy marriage.

                                     LISA

                         I think it's enchanting.

               She pulls up a chair and seats herself at the card table. We 
               now observe that two small lit candles adorn the table, and 
               the rest of the room lights are out.

                                     LISA
                         Almost as if it were being written 
                         especially for us.

                                     JEFF
                              (Pleasantly)
                         No wonder he's having so much trouble 
                         with it.

               A faint shade of disappointment is seen on Lisa's face; but 
               she quickly recovers and looks down at the table.

                                     LISA
                         Well, at least you can't say the

               Shooting over Jeff's shoulder we see beyond him the divan-
               bed upon which Lisa is stretched out. There is one light 
               burning, behind Lisa's head. A fierce discussion is in 
               progress. Lisa gesticulates with her hands, body and legs.

                                     LISA
                         There can't be that much difference 
                         between people and the way they live!

               Lisa draws back one leg, and points a finger challengingly.

                         If you're saying all this just because 
                         you don't want to tell me the truth, 
                         because you're hiding something from

                         There's nothing I'm hiding. It's

                         It's just like being a tourist on an

                         me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, 
                         at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty 
                         below zero?

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Lisa, still looking out into the room, and without turning, 
               says:

                                     LISA
                         Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever 
                         I have a few minutes after lunch.

                                     JEFF
                         Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged 
                         at night because people got 
                         unfavorable publicity from your 
                         camera?

               She doesn't answer, obviously annoyed at the unnecessary 
               questions.

                                     JEFF
                         Those high heels would be a lot of 
                         use in the jungle -- and those nylons 
                         and six-ounce lingerie --

                                     LISA
                              (Quickly)
                         Three.

                                     JEFF
                         Well, they'd be very stylish in 
                         Finland -- just before you froze to 
                         death. Begin to get the idea?

               She turns at last, and looks across at him.

                                     LISA
                         If there's one thing I know, it's 
                         how to wear the proper clothes.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               SHOOTING OVER LISA'S SHOULDER, and down her body, with Jeff 
               in the chair beyond. Jeff says, as if remembering some old 
               experience:

                                     JEFF
                         Huh? Try and find a raincoat in 
                         Brazil. Even when it isn't raining
                              (Squints at her)
                         Lisa, on this job you carry one 
                         suitcase. Your home is the available 
                         transportation. You sleep rarely, 
                         bathe even less, and sometime the 
                         food you even look at when they were 
                         alive!

                                     LISA
                         Jeff, you don't have to be 
                         deliberately repulsive just to impress 
                         me I'm wrong.

                                     JEFF
                         If anything, I'm making it sound 
                         good.
                              (A thoughtful pause)
                         Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't 
                         made for that kind of a life. Few 
                         people are.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Lisa realizes she is getting nowhere.

                                     LISA
                         You're too stubborn to argue with.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff, getting angry.

                                     JEFF
                         I'm not stubborn! I'm truthful!

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

                Lisa, with sarcasm.

                                     LISA
                         I know. A lesser man would have told 
                         me it was one long holiday -- and I 
                         would have awakened to a rude 
                         disillusionment.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff is definitely angry.

                                     JEFF
                         Now if you want to get vicious, I'd 
                         be very happy to accommodate you!

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Lisa starts to rise from the divan, THE CAMERA PANNING UP. 
               She moves away from THE CAMERA into the center of the room, 
               as she says:

                                     LISA
                              (Wearily)
                         No. I don't particularly want that.
                              (She turns, faces him)
                         So that's it. You won't stay here -- 
                         I can't go with you.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff looks across at her with some concern.

                                     JEFF
                         It would be the wrong thing.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Lisa, from Jeff's viewpoint.

                                     LISA
                         You don't think either one of us 
                         could ever change?

                                     JEFF
                         Right now, it doesn't seem so.

               Lisa begins to move around the room assembling her possessions 
               preparatory to leaving. She puts a comb, and other effects, 
               into a handbag. She gets her stole.

               All this as she talks.

                                     LISA
                              (Simply)
                         I'm in love with you. I don't care 
                         what you do for a living. Somehow I 
                         would just like to be part of it.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff starts to say something then thinks better of it, and 
               remains silent.

               Lisa pauses in the act of gathering her things together.

                                     LISA
                         And it's deflating to find out that 
                         the only way I can be part of it -- 
                         is to take out a subscription to 
                         your magazine. I guess I'm not the 
                         girl I thought I was.

                                     JEFF
                         There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. 
                         You have the town in the palm of 
                         your hand.

                         Not quite -- it seems.

                         I mean what I said.

               Jeff's eyes follow her up the steps toward the door. He calls 
               out to her, impulsively, as we HEAR the SOUND of the door 
               opening.

                                     JEFF

                         Can't we just sort of keep things 
                         status quo?

               Jeff tries to be pleasant, and offhand.

                                     JEFF
                         Well -- when'll I see you again?

                         Not for a long time. Not, at least 
                         until --
                              (She begins smiling)
                         -- tomorrow night.

               Continues smiling as she close the door softly behind her.

               The pleasantness on Jeff's face slowly melts into baffled 
               discouragement. He reaches for a nearby phone picks up the 
               receiver, dials. It buzzes on filter.

               Receiver up on filter.

                         Yeah.

               Jeff hangs up, looks up to the door through which Lisa left. 
               He's not particularly happy.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff returns to the window. He lights a cigarette and smokes 
               it peacefully, as he contemplates the neighborhood.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The CAMERA slowly sweeps over the various apartments with an 
               odd window lit here and there. In the distant street there 
               is still some traffic passing, with one or two pedestrians 
               going by. THE CAMERA completes its sweep, and starts to move 
               back again. Somewhere a dog howls. The PANNING CAMERA comes 
               to a sudden halt.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff smiles a little, but as the howl continues, his 
               expressions sobers. His eyes begin to scan the neighborhood, 
               as if looking for the source. He fails to find it, and sits 
               there, puzzled and disturbed. The scene, and the sound of 
               the dog:

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff's chair is turned facing the window so that we see the 
               darkened room behind him. There is just one side light 
               burning, which illuminates the side of his face.

               His head nods sleepily as he dozes. He opens his eyes and 
               looks out, as a slight sound of rain starts.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - LONG SHOT

               From his viewpoint we see the first few drops of rain starting 
               to fall. It is sort, gentle rain, not a downpour. There are 
               still some windows lit in the neighborhood. The apartment 
               house corridors all have small night lights burning.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff wakens a little more fully as his attentions is drawn 
               to:

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               The couple who sleep on the fire escape. The increasing rain 
               cause them to hastily gather their things to retreat inside. 
               The man, hurriedly untying the alarm clock from the railing 
               of the fire escape, lets it slip through his fingers. As if 
               falls to the garden below, the CAMERA FANS SWIFTLY down with 
               it. When the clock hits the ground, the alarm goes off sending 
               a shrill sound through the neighborhood.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff smiles at the incident, and then lowers his eyes slightly 
               as something else catches his attention.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Coming out of his apartment into the corridor on the floor 
               below is the salesman with the nagging wife. The shades are 
               drawn in his apartment, but a light burns dimly behind them. 
               The salesman carries a large aluminum suitcase -- the same 
               one we saw him with earlier in the day. The sound of the 
               alarm startles him. He turns toward the window a moment 
               listening. Then reassured that is is nothing important, he 
               turns and moves down the corridor.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff is puzzled. He looks down a moment in thought. Then he 
               darts his eyes and swings them toward the left.

               He looks steadily toward the distant street corner.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The street corner, lighted by a lamp, is deserted. A moment 
               later, the salesman, still carrying the suitcase, moves 
               diagonally across the corner, head down against the rain.

               Jeff looks wonderingly at this nocturnal activity. Then he 
               looks down at his wristwatch.

               More puzzled, allows his eyes to travel from the street to 
               the apartment corridor.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               The salesman is see coming down the corridor to his apartment, 
               still carrying the aluminum case. He quickly enters his 
               apartment door in a business-like manner.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff starts to assume a thoughtful air, when he is startled 
               by a light which falls across his face from the right. He 
               looks toward the light.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               The light comes from the song-writer's apartment. His door 
               is open, and he is hanging onto the door frame, his hand 
               still on the light switch. He surveys his apartment. He 
               appears rather drunk. He comes into the apartment, closes 
               the door behind him, and sways a little. He wears a hat, 
               pushed back on his forehead, and no raincoat. His clothes 
               are quite wet. He might have even fallen.

               He looks disgustedly at the piano, then lurches toward it. 
               There is no doubt now as the state of his drunkenness. At 
               the piano he viciously sweeps all the note paper off the 
               music stand. This seems to give him some satisfaction, but 
               he loses his balance, twists sideways, and fall into a nearby 
               chair. He remains there, bleary-eyed and a little sick.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               What he has observed seems to give Jeff an idea. He moves 
               his wheelchair backward and to the left alongside the side 
               board. Awkwardly, with his left hand, he reaches up for a 
               bottle of whiskey. He cradles the bottle in his lap, and 
               reaches for a tumbler. He then wheels back to the window, 
               and pours himself a good, long drink. He lifts up the glass, 
               starts to drink, but something happening beyond his window 
               startles him and he stops in the middle of his drink, his 
               eyes a little wider then usual.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The salesman is again leaving his apartment with his aluminum 
               suitcase.

               A brief moment or two. Then the salesman, carrying his 
               aluminum case, crosses the street.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff's face is expressionless. He just stares.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               Jeff's head is nodding and dozing again. The side light from 
               the song-writer's apartment is no longer on his face. Jeff's 
               eyes open, then his head comes up quickly, trying to clear 
               the sleep from his mind, as he remembers the object of his 
               vigilance.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               The salesman's apartment shows the shades drawn and a dim 
               light burning behind them. The CAMERA PANS to the empty 
               corridor.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff's eyes turn sharply in the direction of the street.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The street is deserted. At the right hand side of the screen 
               a light goes on. THE CAMERA PANS OVER and we see that Miss 
               Torso has returned from her date. She is wearing a three-
               quarter length coat over her evening dress. She is inside, 
               with the door two-thirds closed, but she leans out to kiss 
               someone goodnight. Then it takes some coaxing to get the 
               door completely closed.

               She turns the key in the lock. She listens a moment then 
               comes to the center of the room. She takes her coat off and 
               drapes it over chair. She removes the screen in front of the 
               ice box, then opens the ice box.

               She searches it for something to eat; finds a big piece of 
               pumpkin pie. She closes the ice box. She starts to eat the 
               pie as she moves in the direction of the bathroom. Stopping 
               a moment, she puts the piece of pie on a table, and proceeds 
               to take off her dress. Undoing the zippers, she slides it 
               over her head as she passes into the bathroom. The dress is 
               thrown on a nearby chair, and the bare arm picks up a piece 
               of pie. She is now in the bathroom. We see her slip down the 
               brassiere straps, but the window does not permit us to see 
               any lower. As she munches on the pie, she pulls out a few 
               pins holding up her hair, which she proceeds to brush 
               rhythmically. She turns and moves down her bare back.

               Jeff's eyes suddenly switch to the street.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI LONG SHOT

               We catch a quick glimpse of the salesman, just passing the 
               alleyway, suitcase in hand. The CAMERA PANS across the ballet 
               dancer's apartment, over to the salesman's apartment. It 
               waits, until he appears in the corridor.

               He enters his apartment.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff sits in his wheelchair, looking quietly out at the 
               neighborhood, sleep beginning to take hold on him again.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - LONG SHOT

               THE CAMERA PANS slightly over the whole of the neighborhood. 
               The lights in Miss Torso's apartment snap out. Only one light 
               remains. It burns behind the drawn shades of the salesman's 
               apartment.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               A big head of Jeff. He is still in his wheelchair, sound 
               asleep. The CAMERA PANS off his face, out through the window. 
               The rain has stopped, and the general light of dawn is coming 
               up. The CAMERA COMES TO REST on the salesman's apartment and 
               corridor, which is still dimly lit by the electric lights. 

               We see the salesman emerge into the corridor, pause a moment 
               to allow a woman to proceed him. Her back is to the CAMERA 
               and we do not see her face. They move away, down the corridor. 
               The CAMERA PANS BACK into Jeff's sleeping face.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               It is now mid-morning. The sun is shining. Miss Torso is 
               practicing her dance to the sound of ballet music.

               We can hear the song-writer at work, but the thing that 
               attracts our attention mostly, is some action that emanates 
               from the fire escape where the couple sleep at night. On a 
               long rope, the woman is lowering an open wicker basket in 
               which sits a small dog. When is reaches the yard below, the 
               CAMERA PANNING DOWN, the dog steps out and runs off to explore 
               the yard. The woman pulls up the basket, and leaves it on 
               the fire escape. The CAMERA PULL BACK into Jeff's apartment 
               where Stella is busy massaging Jeff's back at he lies face 
               down on the divan.

                                     STELLA
                         You'd think the rain would have cooled 
                         things off. All it did was make the 
                         heat wet.

               Stella hits a sore muscle in Jeff's back. He jumps.

                                     JEFF
                         That's a stiff one.

               A low camera has Jeff's head on the foreground, with Stella 
               just behind him, at work on his back. She attacks the sore 
               muscle vigorously.

               She stops massaging, reaches for the oil.

                         Now Miss Torso, for example --

               Stella hits his back with a palmful of cold oil. It takes 
               his breath.

                         It's hard to figure. He went out

                         Sometimes it's worse to stay than it

                         But it takes a particularly low type 
                         of man to do it.

               Jeff turns his head away for a moment. She helps him into 
               the chair. Hands him his shirt, which he proceeds to put on. 
               The back of his chair is to the window.

               The salesman, having just raised the shades in the living 
               room, is now looking out the window. It is not a casual look, 
               but a long, careful, searching appraisal of all the apartment 
               house windows in his neighborhood, starting from his left to 
               his right. His eyes move closer toward Jeff's apartment.

               Jeff in his chair, facing the window, Stella beside him. 
               Jeff nearly knocks the startled Stella off her feet with his 
               arm.

                                     JEFF
                         Get back! Out of sight! Quick!

               He propels his chair backward quickly, and Stella moves to 
               the side with surprising agility. They are both in shadow.

                                     STELLA
                              (A startled whisper)
                         What is it? What's the matter?

               Jeff keeps his eyes trained on the window.

                                     JEFF
                              (Quietly)
                         The salesman's looking out his window.

               Stella relaxes, gives Jeff a disgusted look, and starts to 
               move out of the shadows.

                                     STELLA
                         A Federal offense.

                                     JEFF
                              (Sharply)
                         Get back there! He'll see you!

               She moves back into the shadows.

                                     STELLA
                         I'm not shy. I've been looked at 
                         before.

                                     JEFF
                              (Still peering toward 
                              window)
                         It's not an ordinary look. It's the 
                         kind of look a man gives when he's 
                         afraid somebody might be watching 
                         him.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The salesman completes his searching glance at the 
               neighborhood. Then something directly below his window catches 
               his attention. He looks sharply downward, his body visibly 
               tensing.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff, with a restraining hand to Stella, begins to edge his 
               chair cautiously forward so that he can see what the salesman 
               is looking at.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               THE CAMERA MOVES FORWARD, and as it reaches the edge of the 
               window, PANS DOWN and shows us what the salesman is looking 
               at. The little dog that was lowered in the basket is sniffing 
               at the salesman's personal flower bed.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Jeff's eyes move up quickly to look at the salesman.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The salesman leans forward and grips the window sill as he 
               watches the dog. The CAMERA PANS DOWN and we now see that 
               the old lady with the hearing aid is leaning over the fence 
               admonishing the dog. We can faintly hear her voice saying 
               something to the effect that he'll get into trouble. The dog 
               turns to glance at her and apparently taking heed, moves 
               away. The old lady is wearing a faded house-robe.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Jeff is amused at the dog incident. Behind him, Stella moves 
               to the center of the room, saying:

                                     STELLA
                         Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you 
                         tomorrow.

                                     JEFF
                              (Grunts)
                         Uh-huh.

               She begins putting her equipment back into her black bag. 
               Jeff's eyes lift to the salesman's apartment, and the 
               amusement drains from his face. He leans forward a little, 
               tensely.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The salesman has his aluminum case on the table near the 
               center of the room. He is carefully wiping out the interior 
               with dust cloth.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff watching intently. Stella putting the last of her things 
               into her bag.

                                     STELLA
                         And don't sleep in the chair again.

               Jeff continues to what the salesman, his face showing a great 
               concentration of thought.

                                     JEFF
                         Uh-huh.

               Stella picks up her bag, stares at Jeff's back a moment, 
               then starts for the door.

                                     STELLA
                         Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Great 
                         conversationalist.

               Jeff swings half-way around in his chair just as Stella 
               reaches the top of the steps.

                                     JEFF
                         Stella. 

               She turns around. Jeff points to a coat-stand near the door.

                                     JEFF
                              (Goes on quickly)
                         Will you take those binoculars out 
                         of the case and bring them to me.

               She puts down her bag, reaches for the binoculars, takes 
               them out the case. She comes down the stairs, brings them to 
               him. He immediately swings to the window, and lifts them to 
               his eyes. Stella sniffs, then goes to the door, as she says:

                                     STELLA
                         Trouble. I cam smell it. I'll be 
                         glad when they crack that cast, and 
                         I get out of here.

               As Stella goes out the door, the CAMERA MOVES IN until Jeff's 
               head, and the binoculars, are filling the screen.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The salesman has completed his cleaning of the case. He is 
               in the act of placing it on the floor. He turns and again 
               glances out of the window.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Jeff quickly lowers the binoculars and edges back a few 
               inches. He watches a moment, then cautiously lifts the 
               binoculars again.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - SEMI-LONG SHOT - (DAY)

               The man is now moving out of the living room, and the 
               binoculars PAN him though to the small kitchen which is seen 
               through a side window.

               The man starts to busy himself in this kitchen with his back 
               to us, but the image is very unsatisfactory.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff lowers the binoculars and there is an expression of 
               exasperation on his face. He throws the binoculars down, and 
               then looks about him. He backs his chair up quickly toward 
               the main cabinet on his left. He leans down, opens a cupboard 
               door and takes out a long-focus lens. Then from a shelf above 
               he takes a small Exacta camera. He quickly takes off the 
               existing lens and puts on the telephoto lens in its place. 
               He wheels himself back to the window and raises the camera 
               to his eye.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - CLOSE SHOT

               Through the view-finder of the camera, we are now brought 
               into close proximity with the salesman in his little kitchen. 
               His back is still to us. He half-turns and takes a used 
               newspaper. He spreads it open, along the drainboard. From 
               the sink he takes out a large butcher's knife, and a long, 
               narrow saw. They disappear from sight as he lays them on the 
               newspaper and proceeds to wrap them up. Having completed his 
               job, he emerges from the kitchen carrying the newspaper-
               wrapped parcel.

               For a moment he is lost behind the wall that separates the 
               kitchen recess from the living room. He does not reappear 
               for a moment.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Jeff lowers the camera for a moment, and watches tensely. 
               Suddenly he puts it up to his eye again.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - CLOSE SHOT

               Half of a man's body is now seen in the living room.

               Then the salesman turns and moves to the center of the room. 
               He is not carrying anything. He sits down on a couch, with a 
               display of fatigue. He yawns and stretches out of sight at 
               full length on the couch.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Jeff lowers the camera. He watches the living room for a 
               moment. Then his eye travels briefly back to the kitchen; 
               then return to the living room. His brow knits a little as 
               we:

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               The thermometer outside of Jeff's window, registering 83 
               degrees. The CAMERA PANS OFF to the left until it comes to 
               rest on the song-writer's studio. He is dressed only in 
               bathing trunks, and is vigorously cleaning his rug with a 
               carpet sweeper. In the middle of his sweeping, he stops, 
               hurries a step or two to the piano. He plays a couple of 
               notes with one hand, while he stands.

               Listens, plays them again. Decides they are no good, and 
               returns to his carpet sweeping.

               THE CAMERA PANS FARTHER LEFT to the salesman's apartment. 
               There are no lights burning behind the drawn shade of the 
               bedroom, but the living room and the kitchen are lighted. 
               There is no sign of the salesman.

               THE CAMERA CONTINUES ITS PAN to the left, to include the 
               couple who sleep on the fire escape in the hot weather.

               We now get an opportunity to examine these people more 
               closely. The man is balding, and middle-aged. He is wearing 
               striped pajamas. He is in the act of laying out the mattress. 
               His wife is slightly younger, peroxided, faded show girl 
               type. Also wearing pajamas, with a fluffy handkerchief in 
               the left pocket, the wife is leaning over the railing holding 
               onto the rope which leads to the dog's basket now on the 
               floor of the courtyard. Having been a one-time siffleuse, 
               her call to the dog is clarion and melodic.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The little dog emerges reluctantly from the shadows, and 
               steps into the basket. It begins to move upward, and THE 
               CAMERA FOLLOWS it. When the basket reaches the fire escape, 
               THE CAMERA PANS ON to the apartment of Miss Torso. She is in 
               the bathroom brushing her long hair, while her thoughts seem 
               to be far away.

               THE CAMERA DROPS DOWN to the apartment below, occupied by 
               the elderly lady with the hearing aid. For the first time we 
               see something of her activities inside the apartment. She 
               wears a short smock, although her legs are still bare. She 
               is hard at work on a piece of abstract sculpture. It takes 
               the form of a piece of mahogany through which a simple hole 
               has been carved.

               THE CAMERA MOVES ON much farther to the left, and eventually 
               comes to rest on the newly-weds' apartment with the shade 
               still drawn.

               It MOVES ON and at last passes though Jeff's window, and 
               comes to rest on the two bid heads of Jeff and Lisa.

               Her lips are brushing lightly against his cheek as she speaks:

                                     LISA
                         How far does a girl have to go -- 
                         before you notice her?

               Jeff moves his eyes slightly to something outside the window.

                                     JEFF
                         If she's pretty enough, she doesn't 
                         have to go anywhere. She just has to 
                         "be".

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The salesman's apartment, just as we saw it a moment ago. 
               The shades drawn and lights out in the bedroom, the shade up 
               and lights on in the living room and kitchen. Still no one 
               in sight.

                                     LISA
                         Well, "ain't I?" -- Pay attention to 
                         me.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - TWO SHOT

               We are now able to see that Jeff's apartment is in darkness, 
               only faintly lit from the distant light of the neighbors' 
               window. By her position, Lisa is seated on Jeff's sound knee, 
               her arms around his neck.

                                     JEFF
                         I'm not exactly on the other side of 
                         the room.

                                     LISA
                         Your mind is. And when I want a man, 
                         I want all of him.

               She starts kissing him.

                                     JEFF
                         Don't you ever have any problems?

                                     LISA
                              (Murmurs, kissing him)
                         I have one now.

                                     JEFF
                         So do I.

                                     LISA
                              (Kissing)
                         Tell me about it.

                                     JEFF
                              (Slight pause)
                         Why would a man leave his apartment 
                         three times, on a rainy night, with 
                         a suitcase? And come back three times?

                                     LISA
                         He likes the way his wife welcomes 
                         him home.

                                     JEFF
                         Not that salesman's wife. And why 
                         didn't he go to work today?

                                     LISA
                         Homework. It's more interesting.

                                     JEFF
                         What's interesting about a butcher's 
                         knife and a small saw wrapped up in 
                         a newspaper?

                                     LISA
                         Nothing, thank heaven.

                                     JEFF
                              (Looking again)
                         Why hasn't he gone into his wife's 
                         bedroom all day?

                                     LISA
                         I wouldn't dare answer that.

                                     JEFF
                              (After pause)
                         Lisa -- there's something terribly 
                         wrong.

               She gives up trying to interest him in romance, and moves 
               back from the embrace. THE CAMERA PULL BACK.

                                     LISA
                         And I'm afraid it's with me.

               Lisa stands, straightens out her dress, stretches a little 
               then she turns to the divan, apparently not too interested 
               in his observation about the salesman's life.

                                     JEFF
                              (Looks at Lisa)
                         What do you think?

                                     LISA
                              (Without returning 
                              his look)
                         Something too frightful to utter.

               Jeff is thoughtful for a moment, then he relaxes and smiles 
               a little. He turns to the window to look out again. Lisa 
               exits the picture.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Lisa stretches herself out on the divan. Her head rest on 
               the cushion at the far end, and she instinctively falls into 
               an attractive pose. However, her expression is disturbed as 
               she watches Jeff.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               He stares intently out the window.

                                     JEFF
                         He went out a few minutes ago -- in 
                         his undershirt -- and he hasn't come 
                         back yet.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Lisa weighs this information, trying to make some sense out 
               of it.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff turns his eyes from the salesman's apartment, and looks 
               down reflectively. He looks up again, and then his eyes 
               catches sight of something. He leans forward slightly.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Miss Torso is lying, face down, on her divan bed. The only 
               light in the apartment is from a reading lamp. She is reading 
               a book held in one hand, while eating a sandwich in another.

               Her back is bare, and all she wears is a pair of brief dark 
               blue shorts. At one point, she lifts her torso up slightly 
               to brush crumbs out from beneath her.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               He looks away from Miss Torso, thoughtfully.

                                     JEFF
                         You know -- that would be terrible 
                         job to tackle.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Lisa leans forward and looks out the window to see what Jeff 
               is referring to. She turns back to him with a blank stare.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff turns and looks at her, quite unaware of her surprise 
               at his comment.

                                     JEFF
                         How would you begin to cut up a human 
                         body?

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Lisa sits bolt upright on the divan. She reaches back quickly 
               and pulls on the overhead light. At that moment the songwriter 
               returns to his composing. We can see him over Lisa's shoulder. 
               He is beginning his song again, and it has taken on new 
               fullness and melody.

               Although it is not complete, it is farther along then before, 
               and he plays his theme a number of different ways, trying to 
               move it note by note to its completion.

               Lisa just stares at Jeff for a moment.

                                     LISA
                         Jeff -- I'll be honest with you -- 
                         you're beginning to scare me a little.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff is staring out of the window again. Over this we hear 
               Lisa's voice:

                                     LISA
                              (Quietly insistent)
                         Jeff -- did you hear what I said? 
                         You're beginning to --

               Jeff puts out a restraining hand.

                                     JEFF
                              (Interrupting)
                         Be quiet! Shhh!
                              (Pause)
                         He's coming back!

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               At last the salesman is seen coming along the corridor.

               He does not wear shirt, but only an undershirt. Slung over 
               one shoulder, with his arm through is, is a large coil of 
               sturdy rope. He goes through the living room into the bedroom. 
               He does not put on the bedroom lights.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff reaches quickly for his binoculars, and trains them on 
               the salesman's apartment.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               As seen though the binoculars, the salesman comes out of the 
               bedroom, to the kitchen, where he gets a carving knife. He 
               turns around and goes back to the bedroom.

               The lights go on behind the draw shades, after a short moment. 
               The dim shadow of the salesman is seen moving around the 
               room.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Lisa, still stretched out on the divan looking at Jeff, 
               suddenly sits upright and then getting up from the divan, 
               mover over to Jeff, THE CAMERA GOING WITH her.

               In a sudden surprise move, she swings his chair completely 
               around so that his back is to the window. He drops the 
               binoculars into his lap in surprise. THE CAMERA MOVES IN as 
               Lisa leans over Jeff, gripping both sides of his chair

                                     LISA
                              (sharply)
                         Jeff -- if you could only see 
                         yourself.

                                     JEFF
                         Now, Lisa --

                                     LISA
                              (Abruptly)
                         Sitting around, looking out a window 
                         to kill time, is one thing -- but 
                         doing it the way you are -- 
                              (She gestures)
                         -- with, with binoculars, and with 
                         wild opinions about every little 
                         movement you see -- is, is diseased!

                                     JEFF
                         Do you think I consider this 
                         recreation?

                                     LISA
                         I don't know what you consider it -- 
                         but if you don't stop it, I'm getting 
                         out of here.

                                     JEFF
                         You'd better before you catch the 
                         disease!

                              (Insistent)
                         What is it you're looking for?

                                     JEFF
                         I want to find out what's wrong with 
                         the salesman's wife. Does that make 
                         me sound like a madman?

                                     LISA
                         What makes you think something's 
                         wrong with her?

                                     LISA
                         A lot of things. She's an invalid 
                         who needs constant care -- and yet 
                         the husband nor anyone else has been 
                         in there all day.

                                     LISA
                         Maybe she died.

                                     JEFF
                         Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?

                                     LISA
                         She could be under sedatives, 
                         sleeping.
                              (Looks up)
                         He's in the room now.

               Jeff tries to turn around, but she won't let the chair move.

                                     JEFF
                         Lisa, please!

                                     LISA
                         There's nothing to see.

                                     JEFF
                         There is -- I've seen things through 
                         that window! Bickering, family fights, 
                         mysterious trips at night, knives, 
                         saws, rope -- and since last evening, 
                         not a sight or sound of his wife! 
                         Now you tell me where she is and 
                         what she's doing!

                                     LISA
                         Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't 
                         know, and I don't care. Lots of people 
                         have saws, knives and ropes around 
                         their houses. Lots of men don't speak 
                         to their wives all day. Lots of wives 
                         nag, and men hate them, and trouble 
                         starts -- but very, very, very few 
                         of them end up in murder -- if that's 
                         what you're thinking.

                                     JEFF
                         It's pretty hard to stay away from 
                         that word isn't is?

                                     LISA
                         You could see all the things he did, 
                         couldn't you?

                                     JEFF
                         What are you getting at?

                                     LISA
                         You could see that he did because he 
                         had the shades in his apartment up, 
                         and walked along the corridor, and 
                         the streets and the backyard?

                                     JEFF
                         Yeah.

                                     LISA
                         Jeff, do you think a murderer would 
                         let you see all that? That he 
                         shouldn't keep his shades down and 
                         hide behind them?

                                     JEFF
                         That's where he's being clever. Acting 
                         nonchalant.

                                     LISA
                         And that's where you're not being 
                         clever. He wouldn't parade his crime 
                         in front of the open shades.

               She turns the wheelchair slightly to her left so that he can 
               see the newlyweds' apartment.

                              (Pointing)
                         For all you know -- there's something 
                         a lot more sinister going on behind 
                         those shades.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               The drawn shades of the newlyweds' apartment. A dim light 
               burning behind them.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff looks, turns back to her, trying to suppress a chuckle.

                                     JEFF
                         No comment.

                                     LISA
                         Don't you see how silly you're being?

                                     JEFF
                         Okay, Lisa -- probably you're right. 
                         He's probably in the bedroom now, 
                         entertaining his wife with the indian 
                         rope trick. I'll admit to criminal 
                         insanity. Now when do I start the 
                         cure?

               Lisa half looks up and out the window. She opens her mouth 
               to answer, but a new look overtakes her face. It is concern, 
               surprise, and a little shock. Jeff sees the change, is 
               sobered, and quickly turns the chair around.

               He looks out the window, using his binoculars.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The shades in the bedroom are now up. Both beds are empty, 
               and stripped of their linen, the mattresses thrown up over 
               the end of the beds. The salesman, sweating heavily, stands 
               over a large, square trunk in the center of the room. It is 
               stoutly bound by the heavy rope we previously saw him bring 
               into the apartment. He wipes one forearm across his brow, 
               and then heads for the kitchen. In the kitchen, he produces 
               a bottle, pours himself two or three straight drinks, then 
               leans with a display of exhaustion against the kitchen sink.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff lowers the glasses. His look is sober. Lisa stands behind 
               him, one hand on the back of the wheelchair. She, too, is 
               serious. THE CAMERA MOVES IN until Lisa's head fills the 
               screen. She says, slowly:

                         Let's start from the beginning again, 
                         Jeff. Tell me everything you saw -- 
                         and what you think it means.

               She is still staring out the window, as the scene

                                                                 FADES OUT:

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff is seated in the dark, his face lit by the faint glow 
               from the distant street. He is looking out of the window 
               tensely, as THE CAMERA MOVES IN, until he is in big profile.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - LONG SHOT

               From Jeff's viewpoint, all the windows are dark. The couple 
               are sleeping on the fire escape. The salesman's apartment is 
               dark as well. Suddenly a match flares, and we see the salesman 
               light a cigar. The flame of the match illuminates his face 
               for a moment. When is dies out, we see just the glow of the 
               cigar burning.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               The CAMERA is now facing Jeff. We see that his left hand 
               rests on the telephone receiver which is close to him. The 
               phone starts to RING, but makes only the slightest sound, as 
               he instantly picks it up. As he talks, in a low voice, he 
               keeps his eyes on the salesman's apartment.

                                     JEFF
                         Yeah?

               INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               We get an impression of Sixth Avenue behind Lisa at the phone. 
               Lisa also talks in a low, quiet voice.

                         mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, 
                         that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.

                                     JEFF
                              (Filter)
                         What's the apartment house number?

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff, still looks toward the salesman's apartment.

                                     JEFF
                         Thanks, Lisa.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Lisa smilingly says:

                         Okay, chief. What's my next 
                         assignment.

                                     JEFF
                         To get on home.

                         All right -- but what's he doing 
                         now?

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff is still looking toward the salesman's apartment.

                                     JEFF
                         Just sitting in the living room. In 
                         the dark. And he hasn't gone near 
                         the bedroom. Now get some sleep. 
                         Goodnight.

               He puts the receiver down, and resumes his vigil.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - LONG SHOT

               All we can see is the glow of the salesman's cigar.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff is seated by the window in his wheelchair. He is talking 
               on the telephone while his eyes are still on the neighborhood. 
               There is a touch of urgency in his voice.

                                     JEFF
                         Look, Doyle -- it's just one of those 
                         things I can't tell you on the phone. 
                         You have to be here, and see the 
                         whole set-up.

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK slightly as Stella emerges from the 
               kitchen. She is carrying a tray with breakfast on it. Eggs, 
               bacon, toast and coffee.

                                     JEFF
                         It's probably nothing important -- 
                         just a little neighborhood murder, 
                         that's all. As a matter of fact, I 
                         did say "murder".

               Stella squeezes past the right side of Jeff, and places the 
               food tray on a windowseat in front of him. She peers out 
               cautiously toward Thorwald's apartment for a moment. Then 
               she squeezes back, moving to the sideboard against which 
               leans a small table on an adjustable stand.

                                     JEFF
                         My only thought was to throw a little 
                         business your way. A good detective, 
                         I reasoned, would jump at the chance 
                         to detect.

               Stella returns with the table, and sets it up so that it is 
               across Jeff's lap. She gets the tray of food pausing to look 
               toward Thorwald's apartment. Then she places the breakfast 
               on the tray table in front of Jeff. He has moved back a little 
               to avoid getting the phone cable tangled in the food and 
               dishes.

                                     JEFF
                         Well, I usually took my best pictures 
                         on my day off.
                              (nods)
                         Okay, Doyle -- soon as you can.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               He hangs up. Stella takes the phone and puts it down for 
               him. He looks at the breakfast, reaches for a knife and fork.

                                     JEFF
                         Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a 
                         welcome sight this is. No wonder 
                         your husband's still in love with 
                         you.

                                     STELLA
                         Police?

                                     JEFF
                              (Pauses in cutting 
                              food)
                         Huh?

                                     STELLA
                         You called the police?

                                     JEFF
                         Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an 
                         official call. He's just a friend.
                              (Almost to himself)
                         An old, ornery friend.

               He begins eating, appreciatively. She moves behind his chair, 
               pausing to look toward Thorwald's apartment again. Jeff is 
               just lifting a piece of bacon to his lips when Stella speaks.

                                     STELLA
                              (Half to herself)
                         Now just where do you suppose he cut 
                         her up?

               The hand carrying the bacon to Jeff's mouth hesitates for a 
               moment.

                                     STELLA
                              (Answering herself)
                         Oh -- of course! In the bathtub. 
                         That's the only place he could wash 
                         away the blood.

               The hand holding the bacon moves back to the plate.

               Jeff just stares ahead. Stella turns and walks into the 
               kitchen. Jeff pushes the food away, and picks up the coffee 
               cup instead.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Jeff's eyes, over the coffee cup, are staring intently at 
               the backyard.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Thorwald's apartment. The shades up. No one moving.

               The rope-tied trunk still sits in the bedroom.

               To the left we see the basket lowering with the dog in it. 
               We HEAR the woman WHISTLING an aria.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               His eyes stray in an upward direction as he puts down the 
               coffee cup.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The CAMERA PANS UP past the woman lowering the dog, up to 
               the roof where one of the sunbathers can be seen sitting up, 
               rubbing her body with sun tan oil.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Jeff's eyes moves down again. Abstractedly his hand strays 
               toward the piece of bacon. He picks it up.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Thorwald's apartment. We are now aware that the salesman is 
               now in his living room, lying out of sight on the sofa, 
               because the smoke from a newly lighted cigar is starting to 
               ascend toward the ceiling of his room.

               Stella's voice is heard calling out from the kitchen:

                                     STELLA'S VOICE
                         He'd better get that trunk out of 
                         there before is starts to leak.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Again the bacon stops before is reaches Jeff's mouth.

               He puts it down on the plate again, as his eyes move slightly 
               toward the left.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Miss Torso, in ballet outfit, is hanging up a small wash on 
               a clothes line. It consists mostly of lingerie. She is doing 
               her inevitable leg practice at the same time.

               THE CAMERA PANS OVER SUDDENLY TO Thorwald's apartment, and 
               except for the smoke rising from the unseen sofa, there is 
               no activity.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Jeff seems to be getting a bit listless, or bored, by 
               constantly watching Thorwald's apartment. His eyes sort of 
               stray around the neighborhood, and end up looking toward:

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT

               The newlywed's apartment. Shade down, business as usual.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Jeff smiles affectionately, and starts to turn his eyes away; 
               but something startles him, and he looks quickly back.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT

               The shade suddenly going up in the newlywed's apartment.

               The young husband leans his hands on the windowsill, and 
               looks out. He is wearing only his pajama bottoms, because of 
               the heat, and we see that he is a well-muscled, attractive 
               young man. He looks around with some satisfaction. He turns 
               at the sound of a woman's voice behind him.

                                     GIRL'S VOICE
                         H-a-a-r-r-e-e...

               He turns his head, is thoughtful for a brief moment, then he 
               pulls down the shade.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               His smile almost becomes a private chuckle. Stella's abrupt 
               voice breaks in urgently:

                                     STELLA'S VOICE
                         Look! Look -- Mr. Jefferies!

               Jeff's head snaps toward the center of his window.

               Stella has appeared behind his wheelchair.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Two men wearing tan coveralls are standing outside Thorwald's 
               door. One of them carries a clipboard.

               Suddenly Thorwald is seen sitting up on the living room sofa. 
               His hair is disheveled and he is unshaved. He stands up, and 
               moves toward the door.

               He opens it, and after a short exchange of dialogue, he admits 
               the two men, leaving the door open behind them.

               He leads the two man across the living room to the bedroom.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Stella and Jeff watching intently. He is feeling down 
               alongside his wheelchair for his binoculars.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - BINOCULAR SHOT

               A close view shows the two man carrying the trunk across the 
               living room toward the corridor.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff lowers the binoculars quickly.

                                     JEFF
                              (Agitated)
                         I thought Doyle would get here before 
                         the trunk went -- or I'd have called 
                         the police.
                              (To Stella)
                         Now we're going to lose it.

               Stella moves toward the door quickly. Jeff turns quickly 
               over his shoulder to watch her. She is already going up the 
               steps.

                                     JEFF
                         Stella, don't do anything reckless!

               As Stella goes out the door, she calls back:

                                     STELLA
                         I'm just going to get the name of 
                         their truck!

                                     JEFF
                              (Up)
                         I'll watch the alleyway -- in case 
                         it goes that way.

               We hear nothing from Stella, but the sound of her heavy tread 
               down the hallway stairs. Jeff returns to Thorwald. He eases 
               himself back into the shadows a bit and then raises his 
               binoculars.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - BINOCULAR SHOT

               Jeff concentrates his attention on the alley-way that leads 
               to the street. Just normal traffic. The binoculars swing to 
               Thorwald apartment. The salesman is now at the telephone. He 
               has picked up the receiver, and proceeds to dial 221.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               The binoculars still up to Jeff's face. Under them his mouth 
               moves, as if he's talking to himself.

                                     JEFF
                         Long Distance.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - BINOCULAR SHOT

               The salesman speaks some words to the operator. Placing the 
               call. As he does this, he reaches with his other hand for a 
               nearly bottle, and working the cork out with one hand, he 
               pours a stiff drink into a tumbler. He drinks it as soon as 
               he finishes talking with the operator.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff lowers the binoculars a little, and takes a normal eye 
               sight on the alleyway.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - LONG SHOT

               Pulling across to the far side of the street we see the hood 
               and cab of a freight truck.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff quickly puts the glasses up.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - BINOCULAR SHOT

               By the time the binoculars are up, another truck has crossed 
               from the left. In momentarily blocks out the side of our 
               freight truck. By the time the two trucks part, we can only 
               see the back half of the freight truck before it pulls out 
               of sight. Jeff is only able to read the words "FREIGHT LINES". 
               The binoculars are held for a moment until we see a puffing 
               and blowing Stella arrive at the opening of the alleyway. 
               She looks toward the front of Thorwald's apartment house.

               And by her attitude we can see that there is no truck outside. 
               She looks about her for a moment.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Jeff lowers the binoculars, discouraged.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - LONG SHOT

               The figure of Stella is seen, looking up toward Jeff's 
               apartment, and arms outspread in a helpless gesture.

                                                           LAP DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               SHOOTING TOWARDS the big window, with the neighborhood beyond, 
               Jeff is as usual seated in his wheelchair on the left of the 
               window, but now turned toward a newcomer.

               The second man is standing near the divan looking out the 
               window with the binoculars. This newcomer is POLICE DETECTIVE 
               LIEUTENANT THOMAS J. DOYLE, the man Jeff phoned earlier in 
               the day. He is an intelligent-appearing, well-dressed modern 
               detective. He has a sense of humor. He lowers the glasses, 
               and turns to Jeff.

                                     DOYLE
                         You didn't see the killing, or the 
                         body? How do you know there was a 
                         murder?

                                     JEFF
                         Because everything that man's done 
                         has been suspicious. Trips at night 
                         in the rain, saws, knives, trunks 
                         with rope, and a wife that isn't 
                         there any more.

                                     DOYLE
                         I'll admit it all has a mysterious 
                         sound -- but is could mean a number 
                         of different things. Murder is the 
                         least likely.

                                     JEFF
                         Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an 
                         unemployed magician -- amusing the 
                         neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.

               Doyle paces a little.

                                     DOYLE
                         It's too stupid and obvious a way to 
                         murder -- in full view of fifty 
                         windows -- and then sit over there --
                              (He points)
                         -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for 
                         the police to pick him up.

                                     JEFF
                         Well, officer -- do your duty.

                                     DOYLE
                         You've got a lot to lean about 
                         homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed 
                         murder so shrewdly that it took a 
                         hundred trained police minds to catch 
                         them. That salesman wouldn't just 
                         knock off his wife after dinner, 
                         toss her in a trunk and put her in 
                         storage.

                                     JEFF
                         I'll bet it's been done.

                                     DOYLE
                         Almost everything's been done -- 
                         under panic. But this is a thousand 
                         to one shot. That man's still sitting 
                         around his apartment; he isn't 
                         panicked.

                                     JEFF
                              (A pause)
                         You think I made all this up?

                                     DOYLE
                         I think you saw something -- that 
                         probably has a very simple 
                         explanation.

                                     JEFF
                         For instance?

                                     DOYLE
                              (Shrugs)
                         His wife took a trip.

                                     JEFF
                         She -- was -- an -- invalid!

                                     DOYLE
                         You told me.
                              (Looks at watch)
                         I've got to run, Jeff.

                                     JEFF
                         All right -- you don't believe me.

               Doyle saunters toward steps, picking up his hat on the way. 
               Stops.

                                     DOYLE
                         I -- uh -- won't report it to the 
                         Department. Let me poke into a little 
                         on my own. No point in you getting 
                         any ridiculous publicity.

                                     JEFF
                              (Coldly)
                         Thanks.

                                     DOYLE
                         We know the wife is gone. I'll see 
                         if I can find out where.

                                     JEFF
                         Do that.

               He goes up the steps to the door, putting on his hat.

               He pauses his hand on the door knob.

                                     DOYLE
                         You have any headaches lately?

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff answers, showing only the slightest irritation.

                                     JEFF
                         Not 'til you showed up.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Doyle, still at the door:

                                     DOYLE
                         Uh-huh. Well, it'll wear off in time -- 
                         along with the hallucinations. See 
                         you around.

               He starts to go out the door, and closes it behind him.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               From Doyle's viewpoint. Jeff lifts his hand in a feeble 
               parting gesture.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Before the door has completely closed, Doyle opens it again, 
               and looks in.

                                     DOYLE
                         By the way  what happened to your 
                         leg?

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

                                     JEFF
                         I was jaywalking.

                                     DOYLE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Where?

                                     JEFF
                              (With nonchalance)
                         The Indianapolis Speedway.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               The door starts to close again, as if Doyle considered Jeff's 
               answer quite reasonable. Then the door pops open and Doyle's 
               head comes in, a surprised expression across his face.

                                     DOYLE
                         During the race?

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff answers with a straight face.

                                     JEFF
                         Yup. It sure stopped traffic.

               We don't see Doyle again, but only HEAR the sharp slam of 
               the DOOR off. Jeff chuckles. Then he turns back to the window.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Jeff's attention is drawn to something in the yard below.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The little dog is busily scratching away at Thorwald's pet 
               flower bed.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Jeff smiles mischievously. Suddenly his face changes as he 
               sees:

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Thorwald coming out of his basement door, carrying a watering 
               can. He fills it from a nearby faucet. He does not notice 
               the little dog's destructive activities.

               When the watering can is filled, he straightens up, turns 
               toward the flower bed. He stops for the briefest moment, 
               when he sees the dog. He walks to the dog, gently lifts him 
               out of the garden, and giving him a friendly little pat, 
               sends him off. He proceeds to patiently brush back the 
               disturbed earth, and then begins his watering.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff is frankly puzzled by the salesman's friendly attitude 
               toward the dog. He looks off in another direction, as he 
               catches of:

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - LONG SHOT

               Doyle, who has appeared, at the street opening. The detective 
               is surveying the front of the apartment building where 
               Thorwald lives. A paper seller behind him offers to sell him 
               a paper. Doyle isn't interested.

               As Doyle saunters forward toward the salesman house, the 
               scene:

                                                          LAP DISSOLVES TO:

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT

               Doyle is nonchalantly leaning up against the side board, 
               with a highball in one hand. Jeff has turned his chair around 
               from the window to face him.

                                     DOYLE
                         He has a six months lease, and has 
                         used up a little over five and a 
                         half months of it.
                              (Takes a sip of drink)
                         Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. 
                         Pays his bill promptly, with money 
                         earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- 
                         wholesale. Keeps to himself, and 
                         none of the neighbors got close to 
                         him, or his wife.

                                     JEFF
                         I think they missed their chance 
                         with her.

                                     DOYLE
                              (Studies drink)
                         She never left the apartment --

                                     JEFF
                              (Interrupting)
                         Then where is she -- in the ice box?

                                     DOYLE
                              (Continues)
                         -- until yesterday morning.

                                     JEFF
                              (Alert)
                         What time?

                                     DOYLE
                         Six ayem.

               Jeff looks thoughtful a moment, and then says, with a touch 
               of discouragement:

                                     JEFF
                         I think that's about the time I fell 
                         asleep.

                                     DOYLE
                         Too bad. The Thorwalds were just 
                         leaving the apartment house at that 
                         time.

               He puts down his drink, and strolls toward the window, looking 
               out. THE CAMERA MOVES IN slightly to tighten the shot.

                                     DOYLE
                         Feel a little foolish?

                                     JEFF
                         Not yet.

               Doyle becomes interested in watching something out the window. 
               Unconsciously he smooths out his coat and tie.

               He even smiles somewhat secretly to himself at what he sees.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Miss Torso, in ballet costume, practicing her dance on the 
               outside balcony. She is exciting and desirable.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - TIGHT TWO SHOT

               Jeff notices Doyle's interest.

                                     JEFF
                         How's your wife?

               Startled at being observed, Doyle moves quickly away from 
               the window, affecting nonchalance. THE CAMERA MOVES BACK as 
               Doyle returns to his drink. Jeff smiles at catching Doyle 
               enjoying Miss Torso.

                                     DOYLE
                         Oh -- oh, she's fine.
                              (Not too convincing)
                         Just fine.

               He tosses off the rest of the drink, and his movement is 
               almost a comment. Jeff's face grows serious.

                                     JEFF
                         Who said they left then?

                                     DOYLE
                         Who left -- where?

                                     JEFF
                         The Thorwalds -- at six in the 
                         morning?

               Doyle quickly collects his thoughts, and gets back to the 
               case at hand.

                                     DOYLE
                         The building superintendent, and two 
                         tenants. Flat statements -- no 
                         hesitation. And they all jibed to 
                         the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving 
                         for the railroad station.

                                     JEFF
                         Now how could anybody guess that? 
                         They had, perhaps, signs on their 
                         luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?

                                     DOYLE
                              (Sighs)
                         The superintendent met Thorwald coming 
                         back. He said Thorwald told him he 
                         had just put his wife on the train 
                         for the country.

                                     JEFF
                         A very convenient guy -- this 
                         superintendent. Have you checked his 
                         bank deposits lately?

                                     DOYLE
                         Jeff -- huh?

                                     JEFF
                              (Sharply)
                         Well -- what good is his 
                         information?!! It's a second-hand 
                         version of an unsupported statement 
                         by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! 
                         Anybody actually see the wife get on 
                         the train?

                                     DOYLE
                         I hate to remind you -- but this all 
                         started because you said she was 
                         murdered. Now did anyone, including 
                         you, actually see her murdered?

                                     JEFF
                         Doyle -- are you interested in solving 
                         a case, or making me look foolish?

                                     DOYLE
                         If possible -- both.

                                     JEFF
                         Well then do a good job of it! Get 
                         over there, and search Thorwald's 
                         apartment! It must be knee-deep in 
                         evidence.

                                     DOYLE
                         I can't do that.

                                     JEFF
                         I mean when he goes out for a paper, 
                         or a drink, or something. What he 
                         doesn't know won't hurt him.

                                     DOYLE
                         I can't do it even if he's gone.

                                     JEFF
                              (With sarcasm)
                         What's the matter? Does he have a 
                         courtesy card from the police 
                         department?

                                     DOYLE
                         Now don't get me mad! Even a detective 
                         can't walk in anybody's apartment 
                         and search it. If I were ever caught 
                         in there, I'd lose my badge inside 
                         of ten minutes!

                                     JEFF
                         Just make sure you're not caught. If 
                         you find something, you've got a 
                         murderer and nobody will care about 
                         a couple of house rules. If you find 
                         nothing -- he's clear.

                                     DOYLE
                         At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- 
                         I'll remind you of the Constitution, 
                         and the phrase "search warrant" issued 
                         by a judge who knows the Bill of 
                         Rights verbatim. He must ask for 
                         evidence.

                                     JEFF
                         Give him evidence.

                                     DOYLE
                         I can hear myself starting out. "Your 
                         Honor -- I have a friend who's an 
                         amateur sleuth, an one night, after 
                         a heavy supper --"
                              (He shakes his head 
                              "no")
                         He'd throw the New York State Penal 
                         Code right in my face. -- And it's 
                         six volumes.

                                     JEFF
                         By morning there might not be anything 
                         left to find in his apartment.

                         A detective's nightmare.

                                     JEFF
                         What do you need before you can search -- 
                         bloody footsteps leading up to the 
                         door?

                                     DOYLE
                              (Looking out window)
                         One thing I don't need is heckling! 
                         You called and asked me for help -- 
                         and now you're acting like a taxpayer!

                                     DOYLE
                              (Turns and look at 
                              Jeff)
                         How did we ever stand each other in 
                         that same plane for three years?

                                     JEFF
                         You know, every day for three years 
                         I asked myself that same question?

                                     DOYLE
                         Ever get an answer?

                                     JEFF
                         Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something 
                         like this: "Your request for transfer 
                         turned down --"

               He can't help smiling, and neither can Doyle.

                                     DOYLE
                         Sorry I had to turn it down.
                              (He checks his watch)
                         I'm going over to the railroad station 
                         and check Thorwald's story.

               He moves to the sideboard, picks up a felt hat.

                                     JEFF
                         Forget the story -- find the trunk. 
                         Mrs. Thorwald's in it!

                                     DOYLE
                         Oh -- I almost forgot!

               He pulls a slip of paper out of his pocket. Jeff watches him 
               intently.

                                     DOYLE
                              (Looking at Jeff)
                         There was a postcard in Thorwald's 
                         mailbox.
                              (Refers to paper)

                              pleasantly)
                         -- That's eighty miles north of here.
                              (Back to paper)
                         The message read "Arrived O.K. Already 
                         feeling better. Love, Anna."

               He looks at Jeff with some smugness.

                                     JEFF
                              (Slowly)
                         Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?

                         Mrs. Thorwald.

               He puts on his hat, and goes toward the door.

                                     DOYLE

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP

               Jeff is sober.

                                     JEFF
                         Yeah. A good detective.

                                                           LAP DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - CLOSEUP

               The sun has just set. THE CAMERA is concentrating on the 
               long-focus lens camera which fills the screen. Just beyond, 
               there is a plate on which a solitary sandwich.

               Jeff's hand comes in, picks it up. We PAN US with the sandwich 
               until Jeff's head fills the screen. (Except for a small light 
               in the kitchen, Jeff's apartment is in darkness.) As he 
               munches, he keeps his attention on the neighborhood.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Thorwald's apartment is darkness. THE CAMERA PANS slightly 
               to the left, as we see the dog being lowered in its basket. 
               We follow the basket down to the yard which brings Miss Lonely 
               Heart's apartment into view. She is wearing a Kelly Green 
               suit, and is seated at her dressing table. She seems to be 
               putting on the final touches of her make-up, prior to going 
               out.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - CLOSEUP

               Jeff looks down, he smiles to himself. He turns, and we see 
               him raise the long-focus camera to his eye.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - CAMERA SHOT

               The long-focus lens brings Miss Lonely Hearts into an enlarged 
               picture which reveals details we have not previously noticed.

               A pair of ill-fitting, horn-rimmed reading glasses rest half 
               way down her nose, and she has to tilt her head back slightly 
               as she applies lip-stick, with their aid.

               Satisfied, she takes off the glasses, and examines her face 
               as a whole, through squinting eyes. She has faded good looks, 
               has fairly nice clothes, but is badly in need of advice on 
               hair dressing. Her hair-do makes her seem middle-aged. She 
               reaches for a tall glass of liquor next to her, and takes a 
               long drink. Putting the glass down, she squints to see if 
               she has disturbed the lipstick. Unable to see clearly, she 
               puts on the glasses again, looks, and touches up her lips 
               slightly.

               She puts her glasses in a handbag, then stands to put out 
               the lights. She walks into the living room, finishing the 
               drink. The long-focus lens moves with her. She goes straight 
               for a bottle of liquor, and pours out a final neat slug, and 
               tosses it off. Then she leaves the apartment, with a show of 
               determination.

               She turns out the lights behind her.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff lowers the long-focus lens, and turns his head to the 
               right as he hears the first notes of the songwriter's melody 
               which we have heard him trying to complete.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT

               The songwriter is at the piano, poking out his melody, slowly, 
               note by note. He is in black tie, and from the looks of the 
               apartment he is preparing for guests. An attractive girl is 
               setting out trays of canapés, glasses, ice and liquor. She 
               pauses as she crosses the room carrying a tray of food. She 
               listens a moment to the songwriter's melody. Her expression 
               shows that it pleases her, and moves her romantically. She 
               comments on it to the songwriter, who starts from the 
               beginning again, playing it more fully.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               A new source of music comes in to interfere with the piano 
               playing. It is orchestral ballet music, in a modern style. 
               Jeff's head turns in this new direction.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Miss Torso, and a male partner whom we have not seen before, 
               are practicing a pas a deux. He is a tall flowing-haired 
               young man, lithe and graceful beyond normal masculine 
               capacity.

               They stop, at one point, to listen to a word of comment from 
               a woman who is watching. By her gestures, she is obviously a 
               professional choreographer.

               THE CAMERA PANS from this to the street beyond.

               Standing there, on the sidewalk, looking up and down the 
               street is a Kelly Green clad figure.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - CLOSEUP

               He quickly raises his long-focus camera to his eye.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - CAMERA SHOT

               We are now given a waist-high shot as the focus is adjustment 
               by Jeff. The figure is that of Miss Lonely Hearts. She seems 
               to be trying to figure out what to do, or where to go. She 
               nervously looks at a couple of men passers by. Getting no 
               reaction, she crosses the street, and seats herself at an 
               empty table in front of the cafe. She orders a drink.

               She is suddenly blotted out by a figure of a man who enters 
               the picture from the left side. He is much nearer the lens, 
               because he is on this side of the street. He is, therefore, 
               slightly out of focus. The lens suddenly sharpens. It is 
               Thorwald, carrying a light-weight cardboard box under his 
               arm. THE CAMERA PANS him over to the right until he is lost 
               behind the building.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               He lowers the lens, and we see Jeff's eyes travel across the 
               screen, as he imagines Thorwald's progression. Then sharpening 
               his look, he picks up the long-focus lens, and easing himself 
               back cautiously, begins watching Thorwald.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - CAMERA SHOT

               Thorwald comes up the corridor, and stands unlocking his 
               door. As he hesitates, we are able to see the cardboard box 
               he is carrying has the name of a laundry on it. He enters 
               the apartment turns on the living room lights.

               He proceeds to the bedroom, and the lights go on there.

               A number of suits and top coats are lying on an orderly pile 
               on the bed. He takes the laundry out of the box and puts in 
               on the bed next to the suits. Then he goes to the dresser, 
               and instead of putting the laundry away,

               he proceeds to take out the contents of the drawers -- 
               pajamas, shirts, sox, etc. He piles these on the beds.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff lowers the camera quickly. He picks up the phone and 
               dials a number, still keeping his eyes on Thorwald.

               The phone buzzes on filter, then is picked up and answered 
               by a woman:

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                              (Filter)
                         Hello.

                                     JEFF
                         Mrs. Doyle?

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         Yes.

                                     JEFF
                         Jeff again.
                              (A note of urgency)
                         Has Tom come in yet?

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         Not yet, Jeff.

                                     JEFF
                         You haven't even heard from him?

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         Not a word.

               For a moment, Jeff looks desperate. He doesn't know what to 
               say.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         It is something really important, 
                         Jeff?

                                     JEFF
                         I'm afraid it is, Tess.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         I'll have him call the moment I hear 
                         from him.

                                     JEFF
                         Tell him not to waste time calling. 
                         To get over here soon as he can. I 
                         think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         Who's Thorwald?

                                     JEFF
                         He knows.
                              (As an after-thought)
                         Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                              (She laughs)
                         Goodnight, you idiot.

                                     JEFF
                              (A slight smile)
                         Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.

               He hangs up. Then, his brows knit a little, as if he's puzzled 
               about something he sees across the neighborhood.

               He lifts up the long-focus lens.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT

               Early night. In the dresser Thorwald finds an alligator 
               handbag. He holds it up thoughtfully. We have previously 
               seen this handbag hanging from the bedpost when Mrs. Thorwald 
               was in bed. Thorwald takes the bag into the living room, 
               where he picks up the phone and dials.

                                     JEFF
                         Long distance again.

               Thorwald reaches his party. As he talks, thoughtfully, he 
               takes some jewelry from the handbag -- a couple of rings, 
               diamond wristwatch, brooch, pearls, etc. He discusses each 
               piece, apparently trying to make some decision. Then, 
               seemingly satisfied, he replaces them in the bag and hangs 
               up.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff lowers his camera lens and edges his chair forward in 
               an effort to hear what Thorwald is saying. But a sudden rise 
               in the SOUND coming from the song-writer's apartment, causes 
               him to turn his head toward the studio with exasperation.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               The first four of the song-writer's guests come through the 
               door, admitted by the song-writer's girl friend.

               There is a squeal from the woman who great each other, and 
               hearty "helloes" from the men. The song-writer dashes off a 
               LOUD VAMP of greeting on the piano, then gets up to offer 
               drinks.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff turns his attention back to Thorwald, but gives up any 
               attempt at listening. He lift the long-focus lens up to his 
               eyes again.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT

               Having completed his call, Thorwald returns to the bedroom 
               carrying the handbag. He goes to a pile of coats lying on 
               the bed. He lifts the top two coats slightly, and slides the 
               handbag under them and out of sight.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               There is the SOUND of footsteps coming down the corridor to 
               Jeff's apartment. He lowers the camera lens, and turns his 
               attention to his door.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The door opens, and Lisa stands silhouetted in the entrance, 
               black-lighted by the corridor lights. It's an attractive 
               picture.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff's head is turned toward her, his back more toward the 
               neighborhood.

                                     JEFF
                         Quick. Take a look. Thorwald's getting 
                         ready to pull out for good!

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff abruptly turns back to the window, as Lisa dashes into 
               the picture behind him, and looks out. Jeff's expression 
               changes a little, as they see:

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The lights are out in Thorwald's bedroom, and Thorwald is in 
               the act of pouring himself out a drink in the living room. 
               He comes to the window, glass in hand, and looks down into 
               the garden, nonchalantly. Over this, we HEAR Lisa's voice, 
               questioningly:

                                     LISA
                         It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.

                                     JEFF
                              (Stares out the window, 
                              exasperated)
                         He was just laying all his things 
                         out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, 
                         shirts, sox, even his wife's --

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               He stops, turns to her quickly.

                                     JEFF
                         That alligator bag his wife had on 
                         the bedpost --

                                     LISA
                         What about it?

                                     JEFF
                         He had it hidden in the dresser! 
                         Well, at least it was in there. He 
                         took it out, went to the phone and 
                         called somebody long distance. -- 
                         His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. 
                         And something about it worried him. 
                         He was asking somebody advice over 
                         the phone.

                                     LISA
                         Someone not his wife?

                                     JEFF
                         I never saw him ask her for advise 
                         before.
                              (Smiles)
                         But she volunteered plenty.

               Jeff turns back to the window.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Thorwald is standing at the window with his drink in his 
               hand. Then he turns, puts his unfinished drink down on a 
               table, and goes to the door. He puts the light out in the 
               living room and goes out the door. He walks briskly down the 
               corridor.

                                     LISA
                         I wonder where he's going now?

                                     JEFF
                         I don't know.

                                     LISA
                         Suppose he doesn't come back again?

                                     JEFF
                         He will. All his things are still 
                         piled on the bed.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Lisa moves toward a nearby lamp.

                                     LISA
                         Well, I guess it's safe to put on 
                         some lights now.

                                     JEFF
                              (Looking to left)
                         Not yet!

               He picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on the street 
               intersection, as Lisa moves back to him.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - CAMERA SHOT - NIGHT

               The street intersection. Some traffic, mostly pedestrian. 
               Miss Lonely Hearts still sitting at the cafe table, alone. 
               Drinking. There is no sign of Thorwald.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               He lowers the lens.

                                     JEFF
                         He must have gone somewhere to the 
                         right.

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK as Lisa starts around the apartment 
               turning on the lights. As she light increases, we see that 
               she is wearing another extravagantly beautiful dress. She 
               seems quite animated, moving gracefully, her skirt and hair 
               swinging with her movement. Jeff turns around to face the 
               room.

                                     LISA
                         All day long I've tried to keep my 
                         mind on work.

                                     JEFF
                         Thinking about Thorwald?

                                     LISA
                              (Nods yes)
                         And you, and you friend Doyle --
                              (Stops, to Jeff)
                         Did you hear from him again -- since 
                         he left?

                                     JEFF
                         Not a word. He was going to check on 
                         the railroad station, and the trunk. 
                         He must be still on it.

               As he talks, she seems to be thinking something over to 
               herself. He starts pacing, trying to distill her thoughts. 
               We see that she has brought an oversized handbag with her, 
               which lies prominently on the table.

               Jeff watches her.

                                     JEFF
                         Something on your mind, Lisa?

                                     LISA
                         It doesn't make sense to me.

                                     JEFF
                         What doesn't?

                                     LISA
                         Women aren't that unpredictable.

                                     JEFF
                              (Losing a little 
                              patience)
                         Lisa -- I can't guess what you're 
                         thinking.

               THE CAMERA CLOSES IN, Lisa stops, faces him. Her eyes sparkle, 
               and her body is tense with concentration.

                                     LISA
                         A woman has a favorite handbag -- it 
                         always hangs on her bedpost where 
                         she can get at it. Then she takes a 
                         trip and leaves it behind. Why?

                                     JEFF
                         Because she didn't know she was going 
                         on a trip -- and where she was going 
                         she wouldn't need a handbag.

               THE CAMERA eases back.

                         But only her husband would know that.
                              (Starts to pace again)
                         And the jewelry! Women don't keep 
                         all their jewelry in a purse, all 
                         tangled, getting scratched and twisted 
                         up.

                                     JEFF
                         Do they hide it in their husband's 
                         clothes?

                                     LISA
                         They do not! And they don't leave it 
                         behind them. A woman going anywhere 
                         but the hospital would always take 
                         makeup, perfume and jewelry.

                                     JEFF
                         Inside stuff?

                                     LISA
                         Basic equipment. You don't leave it 
                         behind in your husband's drawer in 
                         your favorite handbag.

                                     JEFF
                         I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective 
                         Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for 
                         that.

                                     LISA
                         That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem 
                         yesterday with her husband?

                                     JEFF
                         That's what the witnesses told him.

                                     LISA
                         Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. 
                         Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. 
                         Thorwald -- or I don't know women.

                                     JEFF
                         Still -- those witnesses.

                                     LISA
                         We'll agree they saw a woman -- but 
                         she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That 
                         is, yet.

               She comes over to Jeff. He reaches up, takes her hand.

                                     JEFF
                         Come here.

               He pulls her into his lap. She puts her arms around him. She 
               is very happy, and kisses Jeff's cheek.

                                     LISA
                         I'd like to see your friend's face 
                         when we tell him. He doesn't sound 
                         like much of a detective.

                                     JEFF
                         Don't be too hard on him. He's a 
                         steady worker. I wish he'd get there, 
                         though.

                         Don't rush me. We have all night.

               There's a pause. Then Jeff moves back a little to look her 
               straight in the eye.

                                     JEFF
                         We have all -- what?

                         Night. I'm going to stay with you.

                         You'll have to clear that through my 
                         landlord --

               She cuts him off with a kiss. When she pulls back

                                     LISA
                         I have the whole weekend off.

                                     JEFF
                         Well that's fine, but I only have 
                         one bed, and --

               Lisa smothers him with another kiss. She lets up.

                                     LISA
                         Say anything else, and I'll stay 
                         tomorrow night too.

                                     JEFF
                         Lisa, I won't be able to give you 
                         any --

               She smothers him with still another kiss. Then moves back.

                                     JEFF
                         -- pajamas.

               She laughs, gets up. Goes to the large handbag on the table. 
               Is is a Mark Cross ladies 'attache' case.

                         You said I'd have to live out of one 
                         suitcase
                              (Picks up case)
                         I'll bet yours isn't this small?

                                     JEFF
                         That's a suitcase?

                              (Starting to open it)
                         A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. 
                         Compact, but ample enough.

               She has opened it, and surprisingly enough, it is a compact 
               outfit of pajamas, slippers, toothbrush, toothpaste, and all 
               the general necessities for a comfortable overnight stay. 
               She comes to Jeff, sits in his lap again, displaying the 
               inside of the case

                                     LISA
                         I'll trade you -- my feminine

                                     JEFF
                              (Gives in smiling)
                         I'd be no better than Thorwald, to 
                         refuse.

               The SOUND from the party in the song-writer's apartment 
               becomes more noticeable as his party grows. And at this point 
               he begins playing the song he has been composing for the 
               past few days.

                                     LISA
                         There's that song again.

               She gets up from Jeff's lap, and puts the overnight case on 
               the table. Open. She goes to the window, and looks toward 
               the song-writers' apartment. Jeff turns with her.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The party at the song-writer's has grow considerably larger. 
               An assortment of well-dressed people have now crowded into 
               the studio. They are drinking, eating, etc. At the moment, a 
               number of them are crowded around the piano, listening to 
               the composer's newest song -- which isn't quite completed. 
               However, the melody has become more beautiful than ever. 
               During the following scene, we HEAR the melody being played 
               a number of different ways on the piano.

               Jeff watches her.

               She goes to the kitchen, humming with the song-writer's melody 
               which we can HER off. Jeff turns back to the window, looks 
               out.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               The shade is going up in the newlyweds apartment. The young 
               husband throws up the window an lights a cigarette. He takes 
               a deep and satisfying drag on the cigarette, glancing toward 
               the song-writer's party.

               Just as he starts to exhale the smoke, we HEAR his young 
               wife's voice off:

                         H-a-a-r-r-e-e-!

               He chokes on the smoke, sputtering and coughing. When he 
               recovers, he throws the cigarette down to the back-yard with 
               a show of irritation. Then slowly he pulls the shade down. 
               Behind us is SOUND of a door shutting

               Over Jeff's shoulder we see Doyle coming down the steps 
               slowly, and seemingly preoccupied. Jeff swings the chair 
               around so that his back is to us.

               SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Without looking at Jeff, Doyle comes into the apartment takes 
               off his hat and places it on the table. He runs a hand over 
               the side of his head and down the back of his neck, which 
               seems to indicate some fatigue.

               Doyle reaches for a cigarette on the table, and puts it to 
               his lips. While searching his pockets for a match, he HEARS 
               Lisa humming. His eyes turn upward.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Over the cabinet which divides the living room from the 
               kitchen, we can see a glimpse of Lisa's shadow on the ceiling.

               Jeff, has followed Doyle's look.

               SEMI CLOSEUP

               Doyle picks up cigarette lighter from table, and lights his 
               cigarette. As he is placing the lighter back on the table, 
               he sees:

               CLOSEUP

               From his viewpoint, Lisa's bag containing her lingerie and 
               overnight effects.

               Jeff. His eyes turn from the lingerie up to Doyle.

               CLOSEUP

               Doyle's look is completely noncommittal. His eyes turn at 
               the sound of the song-writer's party. He moves forward to 
               get a better view, as the CAMERA RETREATS in front of him. 
               He stops to glance out of the window.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               The party is now full progress. The room is overcrowded. And 
               some people are now sitting on the floor with their backs to 
               the window. Others are outside. A crowd hides the piano 
               player, but music can be head competing with the babble.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Doyle turns his head away, and looks straight out. His 
               expression hardens a little, as he sees:

               The window of Thorwald's apartment, completely dark.

               He also is looking toward Thorwald's apartment. He turns his 
               eyes anxiously back to Doyle. He seems to be trying to 
               penetrate Doyle's mind.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Doyle turns his head from the window, and looks down at Jeff. 
               He asks, quietly:

                         What else do you have on this man 
                         Thorwald?

               Jeff's tension eases off a little, by he is eager to talk.

                                     JEFF
                         Enough to scare me that you wouldn't 
                         get here in time, and we'd lose him.

                                     DOYLE
                              (Soberly)
                         You think he's getting out of here?

                                     JEFF
                         Everything he owns is laid out on 
                         the bedroom, ready for packing.

               Doyle looks back toward Thorwald's bedroom. We see the dark 
               apartment beyond him. Doyle nods thoughtfully. He turns his 
               head suddenly at the sound of Lisa coming out of the kitchen. 
               She holds two large brandy snifters containing some brandy. 
               They are cupped in her hand, the stem between her fingers. 
               She is rotating them gently toward the body to warm the 
               brandy. She is quite beautiful.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Doyle reacts to her appreciatively.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               She continues rotating the brandy.

                                     LISA
                         I'm just warming some brandy.

               She comes forward hands one snifter to Jeff. She offers the 
               second to Doyle. (NOTE: In the following set of scenes, 
               whenever anyone holds a brandy snifter, it is being rotated- 
               regardless of their attitudes.)

                                     LISA
                         Mr. Doyle? -- I presume.

               Doyle sort of smiles, and takes the snifter awkwardly.

                                     JEFF
                         Tom, this is Miss Lisa Fremont.

               Doyle bows his head slightly, but his eyes remain on her in 
               a fixed stare.

                                     DOYLE
                         How do you do?

               Lisa smiles in return.

                                     LISA
                         We think Thorwald's guilty.

               She turns around, and goes right back into the kitchen.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Doyle stares after her, ignoring her remark, still not 
               recovered from the fist sight of her attractiveness.

               Then quickly, his eyes move down and to the left.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               The open overnight case with its displayed lingerie.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Slowly Doyle's eyes travel back to Jeff.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Quickly guessing what's on Doyle's mind

                                     JEFF
                              (Cautiously)
                         Careful, Tom.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Doyle's eyes travel past Jeff to look out the window.

               He still holds the brandy snifter in one hand, and a cigarette 
               in the other. Absentmindedly he still rotates the brandy. 
               The SOUND of the phone ringing is heard.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff picks up the phone.

                                     JEFF
                         Hallo?

               He listens, and then looks up to Doyle.

                                     JEFF
                         Just a minute, please.

               Doyle crosses and stands behind Jeff, as Jeff hands him the 
               Phone. He juggles the cigarette, the brandy snifter and the 
               phone all at once. This is all done deadpan.

                                     DOYLE
                         Doyle speaking.
                              (He listens)
                         Uh-huh. -- Yeah. Mummmm -- Mmm. Hmm -- 
                         Okay. Thank you, and goodbye.

               He hands the receiver back to Jeff, who hangs up. Lisa comes 
               back in with her own brandy snifter, rotating it.

                                     LISA
                         The coffee will be ready soon.
                              (Urgent)
                         Jeff, aren't you going to tell him 
                         about the jewelry?

               Doyle looks suddenly interested. He asks tersely:

                                     DOYLE
                         Jewelry?

                                     JEFF
                         He has his wife's jewelry hidden in 
                         among his clothes over there.

                                     DOYLE
                         You sure it belongs to his wife?

               He turns his head to Lisa, who answers.

                                     LISA
                         It was in her favorite handbag -- 
                         And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to 
                         only one conclusion.

                                     DOYLE
                         Namely?

               His head snaps back to Jeff, who answers:

                                     JEFF
                         That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left 
                         with him yesterday morning?

                                     DOYLE
                         You figured that out, huh?

               His head moves back to Lisa as she answers with a touch of 
               pride in her voice.

                                     LISA
                         It's just that women don't leave 
                         jewelry behind when they go on a 
                         trip.

               Before Doyle can comment, Jeff asks impatiently:

                                     JEFF
                         Come on, Tom -- you don't really 
                         need any of this information, do 
                         you?

               Doyle smiles at Jeff, and then strolls over to the table 
               where he puts out his cigarette and puts down the brandy 
               snifter.

                                     DOYLE
                         As a matter of fact, I don't.

               Doyle goes to the window and looks out, as they watch him, 
               expectantly. He speaks without looking at them.

               His voice is flat and to the point.

                                     DOYLE
                         Lars Thorwald is no more a murderer 
                         than I am.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff and Lisa stare at him in astonishment. Then Jeff 
               recovers, and answers with some anger:

                                     JEFF
                         You mean you can explain everything 
                         that went on over there -- and is 
                         still going on?

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               He spins around, and his face has lost all its friendliness.

                                     DOYLE
                         No!

               He starts to place the room.

                                     DOYLE
                         And neither can you.
                              (Points out window)
                         That's a secret and private world 
                         you're looking into out there. People 
                         do a lot at things in private that 
                         they couldn't explain in public.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Lisa and Jeff. She replies with some sarcasm.

               Doyle breaks in, takes a step forward.

                         Did you ever own a saw?

                              (Interrupts)
                         And how many people did you cut up 
                         with the couple of with it? Or hundred 
                         knives you've probably owned in your

                         But I'm not a killer!

               Doyle starts to pace up and down, throwing out a hand in 
               careful explanation.

                         Look, Miss Fremont. That feminine 
                         intuition sells magazines -- but in 
                         real life, it's still a fairy tale. 
                         I don't know how many wasted years 
                         I've spent running down leads based

                         I take it you didn't find the trunk -- 
                         And this is just an old speech you

                         Of course, it's normal for a man to

                         Why -- when a woman only goes on a

                                     DOYLE
                         Let the female psychology department 
                         handle that one.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Lisa answers, but very coldly:

                                     LISA
                         I would say that is looked as if she 
                         wasn't coming back.

                                     DOYLE
                              (Off)
                         That's what they call a family 
                         problem.

                                     JEFF
                              (Persisting)
                         If his wife wasn't coming back -- 
                         why didn't he tell his landlord? -- 
                         I'll answer it for you -- because he 
                         had something to hide.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Doyle hesitates a moment, and lets his eyes wander, to:

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               The overnight case, with Lisa's lingerie.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               His eyes going back to Jeff.

                                     DOYLE
                              (Blandly)
                         Do -- uh -- you tell your landlord 
                         everything?

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff replies, pointedly:

                                     JEFF
                         I told you to be careful.

               Lisa looks down at Jeff, not comprehending.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Doyle points to one of the photographs on the wall.

                                     DOYLE
                         If I'd been careful piloting that 
                         reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't 
                         have taken the kind of pictures that 
                         got you a medal, a big job, fame, 
                         money --

                                     JEFF
                              (Expressionless)
                         All the things I hate.

               Doyle has a complete change of manner. He relaxes and smiles.

                                     DOYLE
                         Now -- what do you say we sit down 
                         to a quiet, friendly drink or two -- 
                         forget all about this, and tell lies 
                         about the old days in the war? Hmmm? 
                         He looks from one to the other.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Neither Jeff or Lisa display even the slightest friendliness. 
               Their faces are cold and set. Then Lisa speaks, icily:

                                     LISA
                         You're through with the case?

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Doyle is relaxed.

                                     DOYLE
                         There isn't any "case" to be through 
                         with, Miss Fremont. Now let's get 
                         down to that friendly drink.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff and Lisa remain unmoved.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               A little self-conscious, Doyle checks his watch, and says 
               with a pleasant laugh:

                                     DOYLE
                         Maybe you're right. I guess I'd better 
                         get home and get some sleep.

               He waits. No response comes across. His face sobers a little, 
               he reaches for his unfinished drink of brandy.

               He tries to toss it off like a straight shot of liquor.

               Part of it shoots out of the brandy snifter, down each side 
               of his face, and into his suit. He sputters a little, and 
               puts the glass down.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff and Lisa deadpan.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Doyle is wiping his coat lapels with a handkerchief. He looks 
               at them pleasantly.

                                     DOYLE
                         I'm not much of a snifter.

               He starts away toward the door.

                                     DOYLE
                         If you need any more help, Jeff -- 
                         consult the yellow pages of your 
                         telephone directory.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Lisa, still burning:

                                     LISA
                         I hate funny exit lines.

                                     JEFF
                         Who was the trunk addressed to?

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Doyle picks up his hat.

                                     DOYLE
                         Mrs. Anna Thorwald.

               He starts up the steps to the door.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff points out a challenging finger.

                                     JEFF
                         Let's wait and see who picks it up.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Doyle poises on the step. He snaps his fingers.

                                     DOYLE
                         Oh -- that phone call!
                              (To Jeff)
                         I gave them your number -- hope you 
                         don't mind.

                                     JEFF
                              (Off)
                         That depends on who "they" were.

                                     DOYLE
                              (Pleasantly)
                         The police Department at Merritsville. 
                         They called to report. The trunk was 
                         just picked up -- by Mrs. Anna 
                         Thorwald.

               He puts on his hat, smiles, and says.

                                     DOYLE
                         Don't stay up too late.

               He quietly closes the door behind him.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Lisa and Jeff. Jeff turns his chair around, and looks out to 
               the neighborhood. Lisa stands glumly behind him.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               The song-writer's party is now in full swing, and fairly 
               crowded. It is a happy, gay affair.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               None of the gaiety is reflected in Lisa and Jeff. Some new 
               music is heard coming across the courtyard and Jeff turns 
               toward it with some irritation.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Miss Torso's apartment has the door closed, and all that we 
               can see of her, as she is lying on the divan, is her legs 
               swinging in arcs as she exercise to record music.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Lisa is not looking in the same direction as Jeff. All during 
               this, she has been staring out at Thorwald's apartment. Now 
               her eyes are looking at the apartment underneath. She murmurs 
               to Jeff:

                                     LISA
                         Look.

               Jeff turns his eyes in the same direction as hers.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               A light has gone on in Miss Lonely Hearts' apartment.

               They look. Surprise of surprises, she has returned with a 
               lover hooked. He is much younger then she, and a little more 
               keyed up to the promise of an adventure still fresh to him. 
               Her actions are coy, and over-feminine.

               She slips away from his hasty embraces and exploratory kisses 
               with the proper flush of confusion and nervous giggle that 
               seems to say, "It's quite a surprise you find me so desirable, 
               but me mustn't do anything improper, you know. After all, 
               we're practically strangers -- and what would you think of 
               me?"

               She pours a drink for each of them with gestures over-genteel.

               As she sips her drink and look at him over the rim of the 
               glass, he tosses his off with nervous dispatch.

               He moves toward her, this time more cautiously. An embrace, 
               a long kiss. She puts her drink down on the edge of the chair. 
               It spills over onto the rug. He begins kissing her cheek, 
               her ear, her neck.

               Suddenly and fiercely she pushes him away. Slaps him across 
               the face. He moves back with shock as she loudly and 
               emphatically orders him out, out, out. He flushes with anger 
               and embarrassment, and his mouth twists into unpleasant shapes 
               as he slaps degrading words back at her, telling her what 
               she is. She screams at him to get out. He leaves, slamming 
               the door behind him.

               She goes back dumbly to the spilled liquor, makes a futile 
               effort to clean it up, and the collapses onto the rug sobbing 
               hard enough to shake her whole body.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Lisa turns away from Jeff's chair to get a cigarette from 
               the table. She lights it, as Jeff turns his chair back to 
               the room.

                                     JEFF
                         As much as I hate to give Thomas J. 
                         Doyle too much credit, he might have 
                         gotten a hold of something when he 
                         said this was pretty private stuff 
                         going on out there.

               He indicates the outside neighborhood with a movement of his 
               head. She doesn't answer, but studies the photographs on the 
               wall of his room.

                                     JEFF
                         Do you suppose it's ethical to watch 
                         a man with binoculars, and a long-
                         focus lens -- until you can see the 
                         freckles on the back of his neck, 
                         and almost read his mail -- do you 
                         suppose it's ethical even if you 
                         prove he didn't commit a crime?

                                     LISA
                         I'm not much on rear window ethics.

                                     JEFF
                         Of course, they have the same chance. 
                         They can look at me like a bug under 
                         glass, if they want to.

                                     LISA
                              (Turns to him)
                         Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I 
                         don't think they'd believe what they 
                         see.

                                     JEFF
                         Huh?

                                     LISA
                         You and me with long faces -- plunged 
                         into despair -- because we find out 
                         that a man didn't kill his wife. 
                         We're two of the most frightening 
                         ghouls I've ever known.

               Jeff starts to smile at the realization.

                                     LISA
                         You'd think we could be a little bit 
                         happy that the poor woman is alive 
                         and well.

               Jeff smile is broad, and he starts to chuckle. She relaxes 
               and joins him. She sits on his lap, her arms around his 
               shoulders.

                                     LISA
                         Whatever happened to that old saying 
                         "Love Thy Neighbor."

                                     JEFF
                         I think I'll start reviving it 
                         tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for 
                         a start?

               She gets up, goes to the blinds, and proceeds to lower them 
               one by on.

                                     LISA
                              (As she get up)
                         Not if I have to move into an 
                         apartment across the courtyard and 
                         do the dance of the seven veils once 
                         an hour.
                              (As she lowers the 
                              blinds)
                         Show's over for tonight.

               He smiles. She goes to the table, picks up he overnight case.

                                     LISA
                         Preview -- of the coming attractions.

               She goes to the kitchen entrance, pauses.

                                     LISA
                         Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this 
                         case.

                                     JEFF
                              (Mock seriousness)
                         No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.

               She shrugs, goes into the kitchen, the CAMERA PANNING her.

               Jeff is sitting on the wheelchair near the bar, a drink in 
               his hand. He starts to take a sip from the glass, when Lisa 
               comes out of the kitchen. She is an ethereal beauty, in sheer 
               peach nightgown, covered by a gossamer matching kimono. She 
               turns gracefully in front of Jeff.

               He lowers his drink.

                                     LISA
                              (Softly)
                         What do you think?

               Jeff puts his drink on the bar. He tries to decide how to 
               answer her question. He can't.

                                     LISA
                         I'll rephrase the question.

                                     JEFF
                         Thank you.

               Lisa holds out the folds of her kimono.

                                     LISA
                         Do you like it?

                                     JEFF
                              (Studying it)
                         Well, -- if there was one less thread 
                         this way --
                              (motions horizontally)
                         -- and two less that way --
                              (Motions vertically)
                         -- I might give up bachelorhood.

               Lisa turns playfully toward the kitchen.

                                     LISA
                         I'll be right back.

               Blood-curdling scream from the courtyard outside suddenly 
               cuts through the night.

               Startled, both Jeff and Lisa move quickly for the window -- 
               Lisa lifting the blinds up. The long scream subsides into 
               near-hysterical sobbing.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - LONG SHOT

               We get a high comprehensive view of all the apartments.

               Light are going on in some windows, shades are lifted on 
               others, people are beginning to lean out looking for the 
               source of the cream and sobbing. The song-writer's party 
               comes to a sudden halt, as his guest crowd to the window.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Lisa and Jeff at the window, looking out, startled.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The landlord, beneath the newlyweds, looks out. Tilting his 
               head up toward the center of the yard.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               A couple comes out on the high balcony to the right.

               Look down.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The newlywed's blinds come up, and for the first time we see 
               both of them at the window, the girl looking over the boy's 
               shoulder.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Some members of the song-writer's party move out to the patio-
               balcony, to get a better look down in the yard.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The bird woman comes to the window. Her white face looks 
               forward toward the center of the courtyard.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Miss Torso, pulling a around her, comes out onto her porch, 
               and looks to her left.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Miss Hearing aid comes quickly into her backyard.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The couple who own the dog are standing on their fire escape. 
               They are both looking down, but while the husband is quiet, 
               the wife is holding her hands to the side of her head, sobbing 
               loudly. We have heard her sobbing since the moment of the 
               scream which she uttered.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Lying near the sidewalk in the backyard below the couple's 
               fire escape, is the silent body of the little dog they own. 
               Miss Lonely Hearts comes running out of the basement door. 
               She goes directly to the dog, picks it up in her arms. Then 
               she slowly turns and looks up at the sobbing woman above 
               her.

                                     LONELY HEARTS
                              (Her voice clear)
                         It's dead! It's been strangled and 
                         the neck is broken!

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Instead of increasing her sobbing, this news quiets, 
               momentarily, the woman who owned the dog. Her hands go down 
               to the railing of the fire escape, gripping it fiercely. She 
               lifts her face to the neighborhood, her lips set and her 
               eyes burning. Her chest moves convulsively from the crying.

                                     SIFFLEUSE
                         Which one of you did it?
                              (Loud)
                         Which one of you killed my dog?
                              (No one answers; her 
                              voice is acid)
                         You don't know the meaning of the 
                         word "neighbor". Neighbors like each 
                         other -- speak to each other -- care 
                         if anybody lives or dies. But none 
                         of you do! You don't talk, you don't 
                         help, you -- you don't ---
                              (Fighting tears)
                         Even see. But I couldn't imagine any 
                         Even of you being so low that you'd 
                         kill a little helpless, friendly 
                         dog! The only thing in this whole 
                         neighborhood who liked anybody!

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The guests at the song-writer's party begin to move silently 
               back to the studio apartment.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The people move off their balcony into the apartment.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The woman almost screams at the people now, as she looks up 
               at the apartment.

                                     SIFFLEUSE
                         Did you kill him because he liked 
                         you? Just because he liked you?

               She breaks out sobbing anew, and returns to her apartment 
               and out of sight, the crying growing fainter with her retreat. 
               The husband leans over the fire-escape, and motions Miss 
               Lonely Hearts to place the dog in the basket, which is already 
               lowered.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Miss Lonely Hearts puts the dog in the basket, and watches 
               as the husband draws it slowly up.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The bathing beauties go inside their apartment.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The newlyweds draw their shades again.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The landlord moves away from the window.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The dog moves closer to the fire escape, slowly, the husband 
               pulling the rope in hand over hand.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Miss Torso goes back to her apartment.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Miss Hearing Aid turns down the volume of her hearing aid 
               and goes back to her apartment.

               SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The dog reaches the fire escape, and the husband tenderly 
               takes it out of the basket. He turns to carry it's into the 
               apartment.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff and Lisa are at the window. He is holding on of hands. 
               Jeff speaks without looking up.

                                     JEFF
                         For a minute, Doyle almost had me 
                         convinced I was wrong.

                                     LISA
                         But you're not?

                                     JEFF
                         In the whole courtyard, only one 
                         person didn't come to the window.
                              (He points)

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Thorwald's apartment. It is dark. The only light that can be 
               seen in it is the glowing end of a cigar in the center of 
               the room, back from the window -- as if Thorwald was sitting 
               quietly on his sofa, smoking.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Lisa looks down at Jeff.

                                     LISA
                         Why would Thorwald want to kill a 
                         dog?
                              (Almost a laugh)
                         Because it knew too much?

               He nods solemnly and then turns back to the window, as both 
               he and Lisa look again towards

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Thorwald's apartment. Still dark, and only the unmoving glow 
               of a cigar showing in the center of the apartment.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff, Stella and Lisa are grouped at the window, looking 
               out. THE CAMERA is behind them. Jeff holds the long-focus 
               lens to his eye.

               EXT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - CAMERA SHOT

               We wee the upper part of the bedroom window, belonging to 
               Thorwald.

               The lower part of the window is covered by a wall. In the 
               bathroom, Thorwald is wiping the enameled wall with a damp 
               cloth. He rubs at particular spots now and then.

               Over this we hear:

                                     JEFF
                         Do you think this was worth waiting 
                         all day to see?

                                     LISA
                         Is he cleaning house?

                                     JEFF
                         He's washing down the bathroom walls.

                                     STELLA
                         Must have splattered a lot.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT

               We now see their faces. Jeff lowers the camera with a long-
               focus lens. Neither he nor Lisa make any comment.

               Finally Stella blurts out:

                                     STELLA
                         Well, why not? That's what we're all 
                         thinking. He killed her in there, 
                         and he has to wipe up the stains 
                         before he leaves.

               Lisa turns away from the window.

                                     LISA
                         Stella, your choice of words --

               Stella also turns, interrupting her

                                     STELLA
                         Nobody's invented polite words yet 
                         for killing.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - CLOSEUP

               Jeff, who is still staring out the window, has a look of 
               sudden discovery on his face. He calls quickly:

                                     JEFF
                         Lisa -- Lisa -- on the shelf over 
                         there -- get me the small yellow box --

               He turns halfway around, and points. We see Lisa moving behind 
               him toward the shelf. He adds:

                                     JEFF
                         And that little viewer.

               He turns back to the window, holding out his right hand to 
               the side, waiting for the box and viewer. The CAMERA PULLS 
               BACK a little as Lisa comes up, and places the box and viewer 
               in his hand. He opens the box, which contains color slides, 
               and holds one or two of the slides up to the light. Lisa 
               looks down at him curiously and Stella comes forward from 
               the background.

                                     JEFF
                              (Half to himself as 
                              he searches slides)
                         These aren't more than two weeks old -- 
                         I hope I didn't take all leg art.
                              (Discovers the right 
                              slide)
                         I think this is the one.

               Puts the other slides to one side and puts the selected one 
               onto the viewer, with sounds of satisfaction. As he lifts 
               the viewer to his eyes Lisa asks impatiently:

                                     LISA
                         Jeff -- what are you looking for?

               He squints out through the viewer, then looks away a moment 
               without it.

                                     JEFF
                         Something -- that if I'm right -- 
                         might solve a murder.

               He looks back through the viewer.

                                     STELLA
                         Mrs. Thorwald?

                                     JEFF
                         Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now 
                         why Thorwald killed it.

               He takes the viewer from his eye, hands it to Lisa.

                                     JEFF
                         You take a look and tell me what you 
                         see.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - CLOSEUP

               Lisa raises the viewer to her eye.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - CLOSEUP

               Through the viewer we see the identical view out of the 
               window.

                                     JEFF
                              (Over)
                         Now take it away.

               The viewer moves away, and we are left with the identical 
               scene, but not quite so still, a slight breeze stirring the 
               foliage.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff looks up to a puzzled Lisa.

                                     JEFF
                         Well?

                                     LISA
                         It's just a picture of the backyard, 
                         that's all.

                         I know. But there's one important 
                         change. The flowers in Thorwald's 
                         pet flower bed.

                                     STELLA
                         You mean the one the dog was sniffing 
                         around?

                                     JEFF
                              (To Stella)
                         And digging in.
                              (Points out window)
                         Look at that flower bed.

               They all lean forward to look.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT

               The flower bed. The flowers have a slight dip in the center. 
               Jeff speaks off:

                                     JEFF
                         There's a dip at this end. And since 
                         when do flowers grow shorter in two 
                         weeks?

                                     STELLA
                         There's something buried there.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT

               All three ease back in awe. Lisa, still looking out, says:

                                     LISA
                              (Breathing it)
                         Mrs. Thorwald!

               Suddenly Stella begins to chuckle. They look around at her. 
               Her face sobers as she answers their unasked question:

                                     STELLA
                         You haven't spent much time in 
                         cemeteries, have you?
                              (they don't answer)
                         Mr. Thorwald could hardly put his 
                         wife into a plot of ground scarcely 
                         one foot square.

               Jeff and Lisa slowly turn their heads to look out at the 
               garden.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               The garden again with its small indentation of flowers over 
               this we hear the ghoulish voice of Stella:

                                     STELLA
                         Unless, he puts in standing on end -- 
                         which would be very original and not 
                         require the use of either a knife or 
                         a saw. My guess is she's scattered 
                         all over town. A leg in the East 
                         River -- an arm --

                                     LISA
                              (Cuts in)
                         Stella, please.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff looks at Stella.

                                     JEFF
                         Something's in there. Those flowers 
                         have been taken up, and put back 
                         again.

                                     LISA
                              (Has a hard time saying 
                              it)
                         It could be -- the knife, and the 
                         saw.

                                     STELLA
                              (Quickly)
                         Call Lieutenant Doyle!

                                     LISA
                         No -- let's wait. Let's wait until 
                         it gets dark. I'll go over and dig 
                         it up!

               Halfway through Lisa's speech, Jeff begins speaking.

                                     JEFF
                              (To Stella)
                         I'm not going to call Doyle until I 
                         show him the body of Mrs. Thorwald --
                              (To Lisa)
                         And you're not going to dig up 
                         anything, an get your neck broken 
                         too.

               THE CAMERA EASES BACK to allow Lisa to sit on the divan, and 
               Jeff turn his chair toward her. Stella still look out the 
               window, thinking.

                                     JEFF
                         What we've got to do is find some 
                         way to get in there, and --

               Stella's quiet voice brings him to a halt.

                                     STELLA
                         He's starting to pack.

               Jeff whips back to the window; Lisa turns to look.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Thorwald, in the bedroom, methodically folding a suit into a 
               suitcase. Another suitcase, unopened, is visible.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff is staring out, gripping his chair tightly. There is a 
               touch of desperation on his face. He looks down at the 
               flowers, briefly, then swings around abruptly. He wheels 
               away from the camera to the wall cabinet. We see him take a 
               piece of notepaper, a pencil and an envelope.

               He puts a name on the envelope, and then proceeds to write 
               something on the sheet of paper. Stella and Lisa edge up 
               behind him, and look down at what he is writing.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               THE CAMERA RUSHES DOWN over Jeff's shoulder, just in time to 
               catch the last word as he finishes writing the message. The 
               envelope is addressed to "LARS THORWALD."

               The massage reads, simply, "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HER?"

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff at the window, looking through the long-focus lens.

               We get a glimpse of Stella behind him. He is watching:

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT

               The alleyway and street. Just regular traffic.

               Suddenly Lisa comes into the picture from the left. She is 
               carrying a white envelope. She stops, waves her hands at 
               Jeff, smiles, and then hurries on. The lens slowly pans to 
               the right and stops on Miss Torso's apartment. She is standing 
               on a small stepladder, nailing curtains above her window. 
               Her legs are bare, though she wears high-heel shoes. We do 
               not see more than half-way up her thighs. The lens takes 
               this in for the briefest split-second of hesitancy then moves 
               on to await the arrival of Lisa along Thorwald's corridor.

               She does not appear yet. The lens moves back to get another 
               glimpse of Miss Torso, who is now descending the ladder. She 
               is wearing a leotard. Over this, we hear Stella's voice:

                                     STELLA
                         What are you going back for?

               The lens quickly swings back to Thorwald's corridor.

               Lisa is seen turning the corner, and approaching Thorwald's 
               door on tiptoe.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff lowers the long-focus lens to get a more comprehensive 
               view of Thorwald's apartment and corridor outside.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Lisa approaches the door of Thorwald's apartment. The salesman 
               comes into the living room. He finds a package of cigarettes, 
               extracts one, and lights it. Lisa kneels down, and carefully 
               slides the letter under the door.

               At this moment, Thorwald extinguishes the match, tosses it 
               into an ashtray, and turns toward the door. He freezes as he 
               sees the letter on the floor. This momentary hesitation allows 
               Lisa to straighten up, turn, and walk carefully but swiftly, 
               away. Thorwald moves rapidly toward the door. He bends down, 
               scoops up the letter, and examines it briefly. Lisa is just 
               turning out of sight at the end of the corridor, as Thorwald 
               throws open the door. He looks and sees no one. He takes a 
               few questioning steps down the corridor, then stops to examine 
               the letter again. Slowly he turns and makes his way back to 
               the apartment, tearing open the envelope.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff lifts the long-focus lens to his eyes again. His 
               expression is tense.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT

               Thorwald stops in front of his door to read the note.

               There is some curiosity on his face. As he reads, all movement 
               and emotion drain from his body. He stands there, frozen. 
               Jeff's voice is heard over:

                                     JEFF
                         You did it, Thorwald! You did it!

               Suddenly Thorwald turns and dashes down the corridor.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff whips the long-focus lens from his eye.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               As Thorwald dashes down the corridor, we hear Jeff's voice. 
               He cries out instinctively, but almost to himself:

                                     JEFF
                         Lisa! Look out! He's coming!

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Both Stella and Jeff frantic.

                                     STELLA
                              (Accusingly)
                         You shouldn't have let her do that! 
                         If he ever --

                                     JEFF
                              (Interrupting)
                         Look!

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Lisa suddenly appears at the ground floor door below 
               Thorwald's. She hides, pressing back against the wall tensely. 
               In the corridor above, Thorwald returns, frustrated. He comes 
               out onto the fire escape directly above Lisa. She is aware 
               of him, and immediately retreats into the doorway. She 
               disappears down the lower corridor, as Thorwald searches his 
               fire escape.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               There is a sigh of relief from both of them.

                                     STELLA
                         Thank heaven that's over!

                                     JEFF
                         I have a feeling we've just begun.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Thorwald is now passing through the living room into the 
               bedroom. He picks up a shirt and puts it on. He then returns 
               to packing his suitcases, moving unhurriedly.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff rubs his chin thoughtfully. Stella is scanning the 
               neighborhood. We hear a radio, or a television show, off; 
               and there is distant, rhythmic music coming from the cafe on 
               Thorwald's street.

                                     JEFF
                         No doubt of it. He's leaving. The 
                         question is -- when?

               Stella's brow knits a little as she sees something. She 
               reaches for the long focus lens.

                                     STELLA
                         Mind if I use the portable keyhole?

               Jeff hands it to her.

                                     JEFF
                         Not as long as you tell me what you're 
                         looking at.

               She lifts it to her eye.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT

               Miss Lonely Hearts' apartment. She has opened a small brown 
               bottle, and taken out four red capsules which she places on 
               the white table cloth of her little table.

               There is a candle burning in a holder, and other lamps also 
               light the apartment. She is dressed in sedate street clothes. 
               She sits at the table, and by the light of the candle proceeds 
               to open a black-covered book, and read it. The print is fine. 
               She bends over it a moment, looks up at the capsules, and 
               returns to the book. She seems quite at peace. Stella and 
               Jeff are heard over:

                                     STELLA
                         I wonder.

                                     JEFF
                         What?

                         Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out 
                         something that looks like sodium 
                         trieckonal capsules.

                                     JEFF
                         You can tell that from here?

                                     STELLA
                         I handled enough of those red pills 
                         to put everybody in New Jersey asleep 
                         for the winter.

                                     JEFF
                         Would four of them -- ?

                         No -- but it makes the rest easy to 
                         take. And she's reading the Bible.

                                     JEFF
                              (After a slight pause)
                         Then I wouldn't worry too much. But 
                         let's keep an eye on her.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Stella lowers the long-focus lens.

                                     STELLA
                         You know? You might not be too bad a 
                         bargain for Lisa after all.

                                     JEFF
                         You don't say! I might just take 
                         that compliment as an insult.

               The door bursts open, and they both turn quickly toward the 
               entrance.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Lisa comes in, panting and flushed. She stands a second at 
               the door, catching her breath, but smiling with the pleasure 
               of sampling danger and escaping unharmed.

                                     LISA
                         Wasn't that close?

                                     JEFF
                              (Off)
                         Too close.

               She comes down the stairs.

                                     LISA
                         What was his reaction? I mean when 
                         he looked at the note?

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               As Lisa comes up to the two of them.

                                     STELLA
                         Well, it wasn't the kind of expression 
                         that would get him a quick loan at 
                         the bank.

               Lisa comes close to Jeff, speaks warmly.

                                     LISA
                         Jeff -- how did I do?

               He takes her hands.

                                     JEFF
                         Real professional. Would have made a 
                         great layout for the Bazaar. The 
                         model pressed back against a brick 
                         wall, eyes wild, tense. Low cut 
                         bodice, in new suspicious black, 
                         with a --

               Some of the pleasure goes out of her face. Stella notices 
               it.

                                     STELLA
                              (Interrupts Jeff)
                         You'd make a good door prize at a 
                         wake.

               It relieves the slight friction, as both Jeff and Lisa laugh. 
               Lisa happens to look toward the window, and the laugh dies.

                                     LISA
                         Jeff -- the handbag.

               Jeff and Stella turn toward the window. Jeff grabs the long-
               focus lens, lifts it up.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT

               Thorwald has the new alligator bag belonging to his wife, in 
               his hand. He moves slowly across the bedroom, out of sight 
               behind the door. He doesn't appear in the living room. In a 
               moment he reappears, moving back to his packing. He puts the 
               handbag into one of the suitcases -- the one which he has 
               almost completed filling. He goes on with his packing.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff puts down the long-focus lens, and turns around toward 
               the room. The two women watch him expectantly.

                                     JEFF
                         Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring 
                         was among the jewelry he has in the 
                         handbag.
                              (Supporting his 
                              proposition)
                         During that phone conversation he 
                         held up three rings -- one with a 
                         diamond -- one with a big stone of 
                         some kind -- and one plain gold band.

                                     LISA
                              (Excited)
                         And the last thing she'd leave behind 
                         would be her wedding ring!
                              (To Stella)
                         Do you ever leave yours at home?

               Stella lifts her left hand, and looks fondly at her ring 
               finger.

                                     STELLA
                         The only way anybody could get that 
                         off would be to chop my finger -- 
                         Let's go down and find out what's 
                         buried in the garden.

                                     LISA
                         Why not? I always wanted to meet 
                         Mrs. Thorwald.

               Jeff looks at them aghast.

                                     JEFF
                         What are you two talking about?

                                     STELLA
                         Got a shovel?

                                     JEFF
                         No.

                                     STELLA
                         There's probably one in the basement.

                                     JEFF
                         Now wait a minute --

                                     LISA
                         Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't 
                         look.

                                     JEFF
                         Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish 
                         about what might be under those 
                         flowers -- but I don't care to watch 
                         two women end up like that dog --

               Stella grows a little uneasy. Her eyes drift toward Thorwald's 
               apartment.

                                     STELLA
                              (To Lisa)
                         You know, Miss Fremont -- he might 
                         just have something there.

                                     JEFF
                         There's no point in taking unnecessary 
                         chances.
                              (He points)
                         Give me the phone book, Lisa.

               Lisa moves for the phone book on the stand near the kitchen.

                                     LISA
                         What for?

                                     JEFF
                         Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the 
                         apartment.

               Lisa hands him the book.

                                     STELLA
                         We only need a few minutes.

               Jeff looks for Thorwald's number in the directory.

                                     JEFF
                         I'll try to give you at least fifteen 
                         minutes.

                                     LISA
                         How?

                                     JEFF

                         Chelsea 2-7099.
                              (He looks up, reaches 
                              for the phone)
                         We scared him once. Maybe we can 
                         scare him again.
                              (Picks up receiver; 
                              pauses)
                         I'm using that word "we" a little 
                         too freely, I guess. I don't take 
                         any of the chances.

                                     LISA
                         Shall we vote him in, Stella?

                                     STELLA
                         Unanimously.

               The two women smile. Jeff picks up the phone and dials Chelsea 
               2-7099. The women watch him tensely. He holds the receiver 
               away from his ear a little, and the buzzer is heard sounding 
               on filter. Lisa looks toward Thorwald's apartment; then 
               Stella; then Jeff.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Thorwald's apartment. He comes out of the bedroom toward the 
               phone. He wears a light summer coat and tie, despite the 
               heat. In the bedroom, everything is packed with the exception 
               of one open suitcase. We see another suitcase, his sample 
               case, and a couple of topcoats across the bed. He approaches 
               the phone hesitantly, undecided whether or not to answer it.

                                     JEFF
                              (Off, half-aloud)
                         Go ahead, Thorwald -- pick it up. 
                         You're curious. You wonder if it's 
                         your girl friend calling. The one 
                         you killed for. Pick it up, Thorwald!

               Quickly Thorwald does pick it up.

                                     THORWALD
                              (Cautiously, on filter)
                         Hello.

                              (Off)
                         Did you get my note?

               There is a pause as Thorwald gropes for an answer. We can 
               almost hear his breathing.

                                     JEFF
                         Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?

                                     THORWALD
                         Who are you?

                                     JEFF
                         I'll give you a chance to find out. 
                         Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- 
                         and do it right away.

                                     THORWALD
                         Why should I?

                                     JEFF
                         For a little business meeting -- to 
                         settle the estate of your late wife.

                                     THORWALD
                              (After a pause)
                         I don't know what you mean.

                                     JEFF
                              (Firmly)
                         Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or 
                         I'll hang up and call the police.

                                     THORWALD
                              (Breathing heavily)
                         I only have a hundred dollars or so.

                                     JEFF
                         That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort 
                         now. I'll be looking for you.

               He hangs up before Thorwald can reply. Thorwald looks at the 
               receiver a moment, then he slowly hangs up. He stands at the 
               phone thinking. He doesn't suspect he is being watched through 
               the window. Then he makes up his mind and starts for the 
               door. After he goes out he tests the door to make certain it 
               is locked.

                                     LISA
                              (Over)
                         Let's go, Stella.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff turns his wheelchair halfway around as Lisa and Stella 
               start quickly for the door, THE CAMERA PANNING THEM across 
               the room. They pause at the sound of Jeff's voice.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff calls after them:

                                     JEFF
                         One of you watch this window. If I 
                         see him coming back, I'll signal 
                         with a flashbulb.

               The door slams off and we hear the footsteps of the women 
               dying down the corridor as Jeff picks up the long-focus lens 
               and takes a sight on the alleyway.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT

               Thorwald goes past the alley opening.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff puts down the lens and wheels quickly to the wall 
               cabinet. He finds a box of flash bulbs and a reflector.

               He puts them in his lap and returns to the window, putting 
               the chair sideways. He leans out a little and looks down.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Lisa is in the courtyard directly below Jeff's window.

               She has reached the stairway leading up and to the right. 
               She looks, waves at Jeff as Stella comes up to her carrying 
               a shovel. The two women hurry up the stairs toward the iron 
               ladder they will use to climb the wall between Jeff's yard 
               and that of Thorwald's.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT

               Jeff picks up the phone and quickly dials. The buzzer sounds 
               on filter, then the phone is lifted. A woman's voice is heard 
               and Jeff seems a little puzzled at the sound of it.

                                     BABY SITTER
                         This is Doyle's house.

                         This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of 
                         Tom's. Who am I talking with?

               He squints out the window.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Lisa has climbed over the wall and is helping Stella down 
               into Thorwald's yard. The shovel is lying on the ground beside 
               Lisa. Jeff's conversation continues over the action of the 
               two women.

                                     BABY SITTER
                         This is the baby sitter.

                                     JEFF
                         Oh. When are they expected home?

                                     BABY SITTER
                         I'm hired 'til one. They went to 
                         dinner and maybe night-clubbing.

                                     JEFF
                         Well, if he calls in, tell him to 
                         get in touch with L. B. Jefferies 
                         right away. I might have quite a 
                         surprise for him.

                                     BABY SITTER
                         Does he have your number, Mr. 
                         Jefferies?

                                     JEFF
                         He has it. Thank you.

                                     BABY SITTER
                         Goodnight.

               Jeff hangs up. Stella is now beginning to dig, carefully 
               lifting the flowers off the center of the bed where they had 
               dipped down. She places the flower plants on the sidewalk. 
               Lisa stands facing Jeff's window and occasionally glances 
               over her shoulder uneasily at Stella's work.

               At this moment, the sounds of musical instruments begin to 
               be heard from the songwriter's apartment.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT

               A little annoyed at the interruption, Jeff turns to look at 
               the studio apartment.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               In the songwriter's apartment, several of his musician friends 
               have gathered. One plays a guitar, another a clarinet, and 
               so on. One by one they try out the theme of the songwriter's 
               new melody, running through it in turn to become familiar 
               with the notes. We, therefore, hear the melody played 
               informally in different ways with different instruments.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff shifts his eyes from the songwriter's apartment back to 
               the courtyard.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Stella is busy, expertly handling the shovel. Lisa has her 
               back to the nurse, but looks apprehensively over her shoulder. 
               She then looks up toward Jeff's apartment.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff gives her an encouraging little gesture with his hand. 
               Then his eyes lift a little as he looks up.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Miss Lonely Hearts is sitting on the sofa, writing a note 
               with a pad on her knee. Next to her, on the table, the pills 
               are still in evidence.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on the 
               alleyway.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT

               The alleyway and street intersection, with normal night 
               traffic, but no sign of Thorwald. THE CAMERA LENS PANS across 
               and down to the hole being dug by Stella. We get an impression 
               of Lisa's legs as we go by. The spade comes out of the hole 
               and rests on the side. THE CAMERA LENS PANS up just in time 
               to catch Stella turning up to Jeff. She throws out a helpless 
               hand and shakes her head. "Nothing."

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff lowers the lens and looks down at the two women with 
               evident disappointment.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Lisa glances up to Thorwald's apartment. She turns and 
               gestures some instructions to Stella. Then she looks up at 
               Jeff and gestures her intention to enter Thorwald's apartment. 
               She turns and dashes toward Thorwald's fire escape as Stella 
               makes a fruitless grab to restrain her.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff, shocked and alarmed, calls out:

                                     JEFF
                         Lisa -- no!

               He looks quickly toward the intersection and then right back 
               to Lisa. Apparently no sight of Thorwald.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               While Lisa starts up the fire escape, we see Stella running 
               toward the wall in the foreground to climb over it. Stella 
               has abandoned the shovel and left the flowers and dirt strewn 
               over the walk.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff, tense and wide-eyed, watches Lisa climb the fire escape.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Lisa climbs the fire escape to the second floor and the 
               outside of Thorwald's apartment.

               She tries, unsuccessfully, to get through the window which 
               opens into the kitchen from the fire escape. And then, with 
               some difficulty, stretches and succeeds in getting in through 
               the living room window, which is open. She goes directly to 
               the bedroom and we see her bending over one of the suitcases.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT

               Jeff quickly picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on 
               the salesman's apartment.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT

               Lisa turns from the suitcase with the alligator handbag in 
               her hand. There is an expression of triumph on her face. She 
               opens it and her expression changes to dismay. She looks 
               toward Jeff's apartment and, to communicate her dismay, she 
               turns the handbag upside down. Nothing falls out. Empty.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               He lowers the long-focus lens and he is sweating with anxiety. 
               He mutters, almost to himself:

                                     JEFF
                         Come on. Come on! Get out of there!

               His eyes turn quickly to the alleyway and back again to Lisa.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Lisa has dropped the bag on the bed and is now looking around 
               the bedroom, looking for some place to start searching for 
               the jewelry. She moves quickly to the dresser and begins 
               opening the drawers to check them.

               She finds nothing.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               As Jeff watches tensely, the door bursts open behind him and 
               Stella hurries into the apartment.

                                     STELLA
                         Ring Thorwald's phone the second you 
                         see him on the way back!

               Jeff swings toward Stella. He reaches for the phone.

                                     JEFF
                         I'm going to ring him now!

               As he picks up the receiver, Stella pushes his hand down 
               again.

                                     STELLA
                         Give her another minute -- She's 
                         doing this for you.

               Stella looks out the window and her face registers shock. 
               Jeff turns quickly to the window again, forgetting the phone 
               for the moment.

                                     STELLA
                         Miss Lonely Hearts!

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Miss Lonely Hearts is in the act of popping an envelope up 
               against the table lamp on the table next to the sofa.

               From the same table, she takes a pill bottle and empties the 
               contents into her left hand. Replacing the bottle, she picks 
               up a glass of water.

                                     STELLA
                              (Off)
                         Call the police!

               We hear the sound of the receiver picked up, and Jeff starting 
               to dial New York Police. At this moment, from the song-
               writer's apartment which has been quiet for a while, comes a 
               new burst of melody. It is the melody which the song-writer 
               has been composing during the past few days. Now it is rich, 
               and full, and completed, as the musical group plays it. Miss 
               Lonely Hearts lifts her head to listen, and slowly lowers 
               the pills and glass of water into her lap, her whole purpose 
               arrested by the beauty of what she hears.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff and Stella turn for a quick glimpse of the song-writer's 
               apartment.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               A quick flash of the song-writer's apartment, and his musical 
               group gathered around the piano.

                                     STELLA
                         Maybe that music will delay her taking 
                         the pills.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff and Stella look back to Thorwald's apartment. Jeff has 
               the receiver to his ear, and the buzzer can be heard on 
               filter.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               At the bottom of the picture, Miss Lonely Hearts is still 
               listening to the music, while in the apartment above Lisa 
               appears into the living room from behind the doorway that 
               leads to the bedroom. She looks across to the source of the 
               music. She is as arrested by the melody as Miss Lonely Hearts. 
               Then looking across to Jeff, she holds up her hands 
               triumphantly to show him the jewelry she has discovered. At 
               this point, Thorwald appears coming along the corridor of 
               his apartment house! Lisa is completely unaware of his 
               approach.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Stella is so shocked, she can only gasp for breath.

               Jeff, in near panic, shouts in anguish!

                                     JEFF
                         Lisa! Lisa!

               At this moment, the phone is picked up on filter, and a voice 
               speaks:

                                     POLICE
                         Precinct Six -- Sergeant Allgood.

               Jeff opens his mouth to speak, but no words come out, as his 
               attention is focused on:

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Thorwald at the door, unlocking it with his key. We see that 
               Lisa has heard the sound, and looks toward the door, all but 
               frozen with alarm. The Policeman on the phone repeats with 
               studied irritation:

                                     POLICE
                         Precinct Six -- Sergeant Allgood.

               Lisa dashes back into the bedroom just in time to avoid being 
               seen by Thorwald as he opens the door and enters the 
               apartment.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff, urgently into phone, with a serious and rapid voice:

               Phone is down on filter, and Jeff replaces his receiver.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Thorwald crosses the living room, and goes into the bedroom. 
               Suddenly he looks onto the bed. He picks up the open alligator 
               handbag. He turns, facing the window, looking down at the 
               bag. He looks up in the direction of the living room. Then 
               suddenly his whole frame stiffens, his head turns a little 
               further around to his right. He is looking directly at Lisa 
               who is out of our sight in the corner of the bedroom. He 
               holds out the bag, and without moving, starts to question 
               the unseen Lisa. He takes a little step forward, and his 
               head begins to turn slightly to the left as Lisa begins to 
               emerge into the living room, backing away slowly. By her 
               gestures, and nervous laughter, she appears to be offering a 
               lame excuse for being found in his apartment.

               He comes towards her, and enters the living room as well. 
               Lisa edging toward the door, points to it as she apparently 
               argues with him as to the way she came in.

               He points to the window. She makes one more step toward the 
               door, but Thorwald reaches out quickly and grabs her by the 
               wrist. He twists it brutally, and flings her sideways into 
               the sofa beneath the window. Her head snaps back against the 
               head rest. With his right hand he throws the handbag across 
               the room in anger, and with his left open-palmed he demands 
               something from Lisa.

               Slowly her right hand comes up and opens.

               He takes the jewelry from her, looks at it for a surprised 
               moment, puts it into his coat pocket. He reaches down with 
               both hands, and by the wrists jerks her to her feet. He is 
               talking viciously to her. We can hear Lisa calling out 
               faintly: "Jeff! Jeff!"

               Thorwald suddenly looks out at the neighborhood. He realizes 
               that somebody might be watching him. He drags her across the 
               room, reaches up with one arm, and the lights go off. The 
               faint light from the bedroom illuminates their struggle, but 
               not clearly.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               An angry Jeff is staring, and trying to penetrate the semi-
               darkness of Thorwald's room. Then he bends his head forward 
               in despair, and after a brief moment speaks:

                                     JEFF
                              (With deep sincerity)
                         Stella -- what can we do?

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Stella staring out, tense, frightened. Then her expression 
               changes sharply as she looks slightly to the left.

                                     STELLA
                         There they are.

               Jeff looks up quickly.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Two policemen move quickly and professionally up the corridor 
               toward Thorwald's apartment. They stop at the door, listen a 
               moment, and then push the buzzer insistently. Inside the 
               apartment, lights go on, and Thorwald is in the center of 
               the room looking toward the door. Lisa staggers away from 
               him, trying to rearrange her clothes and her hair. She is as 
               surprised at the interruption as Thorwald. He listens, looks 
               back questioningly toward Lisa, then goes to the door. He 
               passes into the kitchen.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff and Stella visibly relax. Jeff doesn't say anything, 
               but a gesture of rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand 
               gives an indication of how deep his tension was.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               After a moment's hesitation, Thorwald goes to the door and 
               opens it.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff quickly puts a hand out and takes up his long-focus 
               lens. He looks through the finder.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT

               Thorwald's head and shoulders fill the screen. For a moment 
               Thorwald is genuinely frightened by the sight of the police. 
               We see him listening to the policeman out of the picture. 
               Thorwald turns slowly and we see him lose much of his fright 
               and regain some control of his face. He completes his turn 
               and is looking at the girl a little puzzled. He then swings 
               back toward the police.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               A quick flash of Jeff and Stella looking. Jeff still has the 
               long-focus lens to his eye.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Thorwald is displaying indignation and complaint to the police 
               as he nods his head vigorously toward Lisa. At this the police 
               start to advance into the apartment, going directly for Lisa. 
               She flashes a quick look toward Jeff's window. She turns 
               back as the first policeman reaches her. He starts to question 
               her.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Stella turns away and goes quickly to the table for the 
               binoculars. Jeff still is using the long-focus lens.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - BINOCULAR SHOT

               We see Lisa start to excuse her presence in the same manner 
               she used with Thorwald previously, as if to say she came 
               into the apartment by mistake. Thorwald, listening, comes 
               quickly forward to contradict her, vigorously. He holds out 
               the jewelry in his hand, and then picks up and shows the 
               empty handbag. The policeman, impressed, looks back to Lisa 
               for an explanation. She has none. Over this we hear Stella 
               frantically asking:

                                     STELLA
                         What's she trying to do? Why doesn't 
                         she turn him in?

                                     JEFF
                         Smart girl.

                                     STELLA
                         Smart? She'll be arrested!

                                     JEFF
                         That'll get her out of there, won't 
                         it?

               The first policeman indicates that Lisa is to come along 
               with him. He pauses momentarily to tell the second policeman 
               to take a statement from Thorwald about the attempted 
               burglary. The second policeman reaches for the jewelry in 
               Thorwald's hand, and takes it for examination. In the brief 
               pause while the two policemen speak to each other, Lisa starts 
               to wave her left hand behind her back.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff looking through his camera.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT

               We get a closer view of the waving hand. She stops waving 
               and holds her fingers spread out. With her other hand she 
               points to the wedding ring on her left hand.

                                     STELLA
                         Mrs. Thorwald's ring!

               THE LENS PANS UPWARD AND ACROSS until it brings Thorwald's 
               profile into the picture. He is looking down directly at 
               Lisa's hands. His head slowly turns, and he looks right up -- 
               directly into the lens. Suddenly he becomes aware that Lisa 
               is signaling to someone who is watching him.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff and Stella. He drops the camera into his lap.

                                     JEFF
                         Stella! The lights! He'd seen us!

               Stella hurries from the window, turning off lights, as Jeff 
               backs his chair into the room.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               As Thorwald's attention is drawn back to the second policeman 
               to answer further questions, the first policeman takes Lisa 
               by the arm and leads her out of the apartment. He goes down 
               the corridor pushing the curious people away from the door.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               The last light out, Stella stops to catch her breath, and 
               turns to Jeff.

                                     STELLA
                         When you took your first snapshot -- 
                         did you ever think it would bring 
                         you to this?

                                     JEFF
                              (Urgently)
                         Stella -- how long do you think he'll 
                         stay there?

                                     STELLA
                              (Squinting out window)
                         Unless he's dumber than I think, he 
                         won't wait 'til his lease is up.

               Jeff points to a drawer in the wall cabinets.

                                     JEFF
                         My billfold! In the right hand drawer.

               Stella moves to get it.

                                     STELLA
                         What do you need money for?

                                     JEFF
                         To bail Lisa out of jail.

               She finds a billfold, hands it to Jeff. He takes it, extracts 
               some bills and begins counting them. As he counts, Stella 
               comments:

                                     STELLA
                         You know -- you could just leave her  
                         there until after next Tuesday -- so 
                         you could sneak away safely -- as 
                         planned.

               He looks up sharply at her, and then without comment goes 
               back to counting the money.

                                     JEFF
                              (With obvious 
                              disappointment)
                         One hundred and twenty-seven.

                                     STELLA
                         How much do you think you'll need?

                                     JEFF
                         First offense burglary --
                              (He shrugs)
                         -- probably two-fifty.
                              (Gets an idea, points)
                         The piggy bank.

               Stella, following his pointing finger, gets a piggy bank 
               down from a shelf on the sideboard. He takes it, cracks it 
               on the knee of his cast. It splits open, and some money comes 
               out. Mostly bills, a few silver halves.

               What he doesn't get, Stella picks up.

                                     STELLA
                         Ten here.

                                     JEFF
                         Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. 
                         Not enough.

                                     STELLA
                         I got twenty or so in my purse. Give 
                         me what you've got.

               Jeff does, as Stella gets her purse.

                                     JEFF
                         What about the rest?

                                     STELLA
                         When those cops get a look at Miss 
                         Fremont -- they'll even contribute.

               Stella goes up to the door. The phone RINGS. Jeff grabs it, 
               picks it up. Stella pauses.

                                     JEFF
                              (To phone)
                         Just a minute.
                              (To Stella)
                         I'll tell you who it is when you get 
                         back.

               Stella goes quickly out the door. He returns to the phone 
               call, glancing at the same time toward the courtyard.

                         My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's 
                         apartment, and he came back. The 
                         only way I could get her out was to 
                         call the police.

                         to get evidence, and she came out 
                         with it.

                         he had something buried in there.

                         went out half a dozen times with the 
                         metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his

                         me that all the calls Thorwald made 
                         were long distance! If he called his

                         arrived in Merritsville -- why did 
                         she need to send him a postcard saying 
                         she'd arrived?

                         Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it 
                         down, Jeff.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - LONG SHOT

               We see Thorwald leave his apartment and proceed down the 
               corridor.

                                     JEFF
                         Just don't dally. Thorwald knows 
                         he's being watched. He won't hang 
                         around long.

                         him an escort. So long.

               He hangs up, and just as he does, Jeff looks toward Thorwald's 
               apartment. He rolls forward to the window.

               He seems a little puzzled by what he sees.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Thorwald's apartment. Completely dark. No movement, or glow 
               of a cigar. The corridor outside lighted, but empty.

               Jeff scratches the side of his chin, studies Thorwald's 
               apartment as if he might see some small clue as to where the 
               salesman is. He looks toward the intersection to his left. 
               Apparently he sees nothing. He turns to look down into the 
               garden.

               Miss Lonely Hearts is standing in the yard outside her 
               apartment, looking up to the porch of Miss Torso. The ballet 
               dancer is in high heels and a fresh summer dress.

                                     MISS TORSO
                              (Faintly heard)
                         Have you heard that song he's been 
                         writing?

               She indicates the song-writer's apartment. Miss Lonely Hearts 
               turns, looks up at the studio apartment a moment, then looks 
               up at Miss Torso.

                                     MISS LONELY HEARTS
                              (Nods yes)
                         I'm glad I was here when he played 
                         it.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSE SHOT

               He sits quietly a moment, thinking. Suddenly he jumps a little 
               as the phone rings. He reaches for it, picks up the receiver.

                                     JEFF
                              (Still looks out window)
                         Hello.
                              (No answer)
                         Hello, Doyle? Tom? Tom, I think 
                         Thorwald's left. I don't see anything 
                         of --
                              (He looks at receiver, 
                              then:)
                         Hello.

               Slowly he looks up toward Thorwald's apartment. Then, back 
               to the receiver. On filter, a receiver can be heard carefully 
               being replaced. Jeff slowly lowers the phone into the cradle. 
               He looks once more toward Thorwald's apartment. Then he turns 
               his chair around quickly and looks toward the door to his 
               apartment.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               The door. Quiet in the apartment, and in the corridor.

               Light showing beneath the door from the hall light.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSE SHOT

               Jeff watching, waiting, nervous at first. He reaches for the 
               phone, changes his mind. He looks around for some kind of a 
               weapon, finds none to suit him. He hears the slightest squeak 
               of a floorboard, and looks quickly toward the door again.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               The door. Another squeak of a floorboard, so light and quickly 
               passing that at any other time it would have no significance, 
               even if it could be heard. Then the light beneath the door 
               disappears. Black.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSE SHOT

               Jeff squints at the door, blinks, squints again.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               The door. No doubt about it, black.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT

               He looks again for a weapon, and almost by instinct he 
               snatches up his flash holder and the small packet of bulbs 
               he had taken out to signal Lisa earlier. He tries to move 
               his wheelchair farther into the shadows. His eyes are glued 
               to the door of his apartment, and his senses are sharp as a 
               hunting dog's. He scarcely breathes.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Only the slightest sound is heard as the doorknob turns.

               The door slowly and carefully swings open, but the corridor 
               is too dark to tell at first who is entering.

               The door closes just as quietly. From the shadowed recess 
               comes a heavy voice. A threatening voice.

                                     THORWALD
                         What do you want from me?

               Jeff doesn't answer. Thorwald steps to the top of the stairs, 
               and is now somewhat visible. He looks tall and huge and 
               explosive.

                                     THORWALD
                         Your friend -- the girl -- could 
                         have turned me in. Why didn't she?

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff doesn't answer. His eyes watch Thorwald. He licks his 
               lip with nervous tension and grips the flash holder.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Thorwald comes down the two steps, pauses at the bottom.

                                     THORWALD
                         What is it you want? A lot of money? 
                         I don't have any money.

               Jeff doesn't answer.

                                     THORWALD
                         Say something!

               He moves forward a couple of steps.

                                     THORWALD
                              (Sudden loud anger)
                         Say something! Tell me what you want!

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff still doesn't speak. He grips the flash holder a little 
               more tightly, lifts it just the fraction of an inch as if he 
               is prepared to use it.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Thorwald has advanced to the middle of the room, his eyes on 
               Jeff and his hands clenching with the effort to control his 
               anger.

                                     THORWALD
                         Can you get me that ring back?

                                     JEFF
                              (Quietly)
                         No.

                                     THORWALD
                              (Loud)
                         Tell her to bring it back!

               He advances a step.

                                     JEFF
                         I can't. The police have it by now.

                                     THORWALD
                         Then if the police get me -- you 
                         won't be around to laugh!

               Thorwald starts to move threateningly for Jeff.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               From a three-quarter angle toward Thorwald. Jeff lifts the 
               flash holder to face level and closes his eyes. He explodes 
               the flash.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Thorwald's face fills the screen registering shock, confusion. 
               He throws up his hands for protection and recoils, making an 
               involuntary sound of surprise.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               A vision of Jeff and the apartment as seen by Thorwald.

               It is distorted and out of focus, filled with large twisting 
               balls of bright yellow color.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Thorwald blinking, trying to regain his sight.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Jeff ejects the used bulb and quickly inserts another.

               He works furiously, sweating. He gets the bulb in the flash 
               holder just in time to meet Thorwald coming at him. Jeff 
               closes his eyes and another bulb explodes in Thorwald's face.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Thorwald's face, full screen again, as he recoils from the 
               flash.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The apartment as seen by Thorwald again. Big, twisting balls 
               of blinding yellow.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Thorwald stumbles back against the side table, knocking 
               objects off onto the floor, struggling for balance and sight. 
               Jeff works rapidly to put a fresh bulb in the holder.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT

               Thorwald regains his equilibrium and some of his sight.

               Orienting himself, he starts for Jeff again. This time, when 
               the flash holder goes off, we see it from Jeff's angle. 
               Thorwald is lighted almost white, shockingly outlining every 
               detail of his face, clothes, hands. His rage and frustration 
               are fixed for a brief but terrifying moment. He stumbles 
               backward again, trying to brush the light away from his face 
               almost as if it were a solid enveloping substance.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT

               Jeff ejects a bulb, puts his last bulb into the flash holder. 
               He tries to move the wheelchair a little further away from 
               Thorwald. Then he raises the flash holder again.

               In b.g. we see: Doyle, Lisa, Stella and the detectives come 
               to Thorwald's door, try it. Locked.

               One of the men steps forward with a flat steel jimmy and 
               snaps the lock open. They move quickly into the darkened 
               apartment. Doyle hits the lights inside the kitchen. The 
               group goes into the living room. The lights go on. No sign 
               of Thorwald. Doyle, Lisa and Stella instinctively turn and 
               look toward Jeff's apartment.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               From Thorwald's apartment shooting at Jeff's window. A sudden 
               bright flash is seen as the last flash bulb goes off. And it 
               lights the scene of Jeff in the wheelchair and Thorwald diving 
               through the air at him. Darkness rushes in, blacker than 
               before.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Thorwald has finally reached Jeff, knocking the flash 
               equipment out of his hands and coming to grips with him.

               It is apparent that he is trying to pull Jeff out of the 
               wheelchair. Jeff fights him off.

               The wheelchair crashes over, spilling Jeff to the floor.

               Thorwald is on top of him, lifting, dragging him to the 
               window. Jeff grabs everything he can to keep himself away 
               from the window, but Thorwald is far too powerful for him. 
               He strains to raise Jeff to the windowsill.

                                     THORWALD
                         I'll give you a good look out the 
                         window.

               Slowly, inexorably, he raises Jeff to the windowsill.

               Jeff frantically grabs for the upright window frame, wrapping 
               his arms around it. Thorwald shoves the rest of his body 
               over the windowsill.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Doyle, Lisa, Stella and the two detectives, crossing 
               Thorwald's yard, see Jeff going out the window. Lisa is 
               panicked.

                                     LISA
                         Jeff! Jeff!

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

               From Doyle's viewpoint, Jeff hanging out the window and 
               Thorwald hammering at his hands and arms with bare fists.

               Doyle pushes Lisa to one side and starts to scale the wall, 
               preceded by the two detectives.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Thorwald fights to dislodge Jeff's grip.

               EXT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSE SHOT

               Looking down on Jeff's face, showing his strain and the pain 
               of Thorwald's attack. The brick floor of the patio seems a 
               hundred feet below.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Thorwald and Jeff struggling.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT

               Doyle pulling himself to the top of the wall. Lisa, Stella 
               and the two men below, looking up. Lisa is white-faced and 
               frightened.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Thorwald smashes at Jeff's arms and hands. Jeff's grip begins 
               to slip.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT

               Doyle reaches the top of the wall, looks up at Jeff.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

               Jeff, as seen from Doyle's angle, hanging, somehow weathering 
               Thorwald's insane attack.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT

               Doyle reaches for his service revolver. He doesn't have it! 
               He looks down, and calls one of the detectives back.

                                     DOYLE
                         Creel! Your Thirty-eight!

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT

               Looking down at the two detectives from Doyle's point of 
               view. Creel grabs for his gun expertly. The holster breaks 
               away. It is in his hand and with a deft movement he tosses 
               it upward.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT

               Doyle catches it, turns up to Jeff's apartment.

               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Thorwald still trying to loosen Jeff's grip. The salesman, 
               in a complete, wild, sweating rage, is beyond all reason. 
               His glasses hang from one ear, his coat is torn, his tie 
               pulled to one side.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

               Shooting over Doyle's shoulder as he steadies himself against 
               the wall, lifting the service revolver up for a shot at 
               Thorwald. His aim is careful, slow, painfully deliberate. 
               Jeff seems about to fall.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               The two detectives ahead of Doyle are moving up below the 
               window. Lisa stand looking up, her hands at the sides of her 
               head, frozen with panic.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               Two detectives appear behind Thorwald and grab him. The 
               startled Thorwald stops his attack on Jeff as he looks wildly 
               around to find the source of his new attack.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CLOSEUP

               Jeff, hanging from the window frame. He claws desperately 
               for a hold.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - COMPREHENSIVE SHOT

               People rush to their windows, looking out at the excitement. 
               Some people on the ground floor come out into the yard. Doyle 
               and the two detectives come into the patio beneath Jeff.

               Doyle directs them to improvise something to break Jeff's 
               fall -- leaves, greenery, their coats, cushions from the 
               patio furniture -- anything they can find. The four uniformed 
               policemen rush into the backyard. Lisa and Stella come over 
               the wall into the patio beneath Jeff. They look up at Jeff, 
               encouraging him to hold on.

               A detective goes into Jeff's cellar door, trying to reach 
               his apartment before Jeff loses his grip.

               The siffleuse and her husband are standing on the fire escape 
               in plain, almost somber clothes. They watch expressionlessly. 
               Beneath them the empty basket which once held their dog swings 
               silently in the night air.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT

               Jeff, hanging from his windowsill. He loses his grip and 
               plunges down into the patio below. Two detectives throw 
               themselves beneath him. They are knocked to the ground as 
               Jeff's fall tumbles both of them. After Jeff hits, he lies 
               still, twisted over to one side.

               Doyle and Lisa rush over to Jeff. There is an audible

               SOUND of shock in the neighborhood as Jeff has fallen -- 
               various oh's, ah's, and possibly a stifled scream or two.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT

               Lisa kneels down, cradles Jeff's head in her lap. There are 
               tears in her eyes. Her clothes are disheveled and her dress 
               torn. Her hair is disarranged. But withal, her face is as

               He opens his eyes. Winces with pain.

                         Don't move. Try to lie still.

                              (Affectionately)
                         Shut up. I'm all right.

                                     JEFF
                              (To Doyle)
                         Think you've got enough for a search 
                         warrant now?

                                     DOYLE
                         Oh sure. Sure. I can make it.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT

               At that moment, a man appears leaning out of Jeff's window. 
               He looks down to the patio.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Lieutenant Doyle?

                                     DOYLE (OFF)
                              (Looking up)
                         Yeah?

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Thorwald's ready to take us on a 
                         tour of the East River.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP

               Stella tugs at Doyle's arm and stands on tiptoe to whisper 
               something into his ear. Doyle then looks up to the detective.

                                     DOYLE
                         Did he say what was buried in the 
                         flower bed?

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Yeah. It's over in his apartment. In 
                         a hat box. Wanna look?

               Doyle turns quizzically at Stella.

                                     STELLA
                         Oh, no thanks -- I don't want any of 
                         part of her
                              (She pauses, then 
                              does a surprised 
                              take back to Doyle)
                         What did I say?

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - PAN SHOT

               Beginning on Jeff's window thermometer, the CAMERA PANS FROM 
               RIGHT TO LEFT around the neighborhood.

               In the songwriter's apartment we see the songwriter with a 
               guest -- Miss Lonely Hearts. Both in dress and manner she 
               seems quite happy and adjusted to life. The songwriter is 
               placing the first recording of his new song on a record player 
               for her to hear. It is a full symphonic arrangement which is 
               heard over. 

               CONTINUE TO PAN

               Thorwald's apartment is empty, stripped of its furnishings. 
               Two painters are repainting the walls.

               The siffleuse and her husband are on their fire escape, 
               training a new white dog to ride in their basket.

               Miss Torso is practicing her ballet again. She wears a white 
               leotard. The sound of someone at the door interrupts her. 
               She goes to the door, opens it an inch or two cautiously. 
               When she sees who is outside, she throws open the door. An 
               innocuous, unhandsome and somewhat shy army private enters 
               with a barracks bag slung over one shoulder. She kisses him 
               fondly after closing the door. He puts down the barracks 
               bag, tosses his hat into a chair and, with the attitude of a 
               man who belongs there, goes to the icebox to see what's to 
               eat.

               The newlyweds are arguing.

               The CAMERA PANS past Jeff who is asleep in his wheelchair 
               facing away from the window. CAMERA MOVES DOWN to the lower 
               part of his body and we see that both his legs are now in 
               casts. The CAMERA LIFTS SLIGHTLY to show Lisa sitting on the 
               sofa nearby. She wears Levis and a plaid cotton shirt. She 
               is reading a book on travel. She looks up briefly at Jeff. 
               When she realizes he is asleep, she puts down the travel 
               book and reaches for the latest copy of Harper's Bazaar. She 
               settles down to study it as we

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          FLAMES fill the SCREEN. Then: the gentle voice of an
          OLD WOMAN, barely more than a whisper...

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          I am a common woman. I was born
          in a common cottage in a common
          village. My life would likely be
          no different from yours, were it
          not for the most uncommon events
          that occurred during the winter of
          the Year of Our Lord Thirteen
          Hundred and Twenty-five. I
          learned many things that winter.
          About people. About love. But
          mainly, I learned about loss.
          A MAN tosses a piece of wood into the flames, which turns
          out to be a LARGE CAMPFIRE.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          To this day, I am the only person
          that I know to be living who knows
          the whole truth about that
          horrible time. This is my tale.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing THREE KNIGHTS, beleaguered,
          scarred, returning from the Crusades. Their armor is in
          disarray, adorned with souvenirs from the Middle East.
          They're camped in a clearing, their cart pulled to a
          nearby roadside. LIGHTNING flashes in the distance.
          One of them, a TEENAGE BOY who looks like his sword might
          weigh more than he does, hitches a nervous HORSE to a
          tree. He strokes the horse's neck, calming.
          Then: A WOLF HOWLS in the distance. The Boy suddenly
          looks nervous, too. He quickly joins the others at the
          campfire -- a FAT KNIGHT (30s) and an OLD KNIGHT.

                         TEENAGE BOY
          Did you hear that?

                         FAT KNIGHT
          Hear what?
          The wolf HOWLS AGAIN. The Boy shivers, fearful.

                         TEENAGE BOY
          The innkeeper told me --

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         CONTINUED:

                         FAT KNIGHT
          I know what he told you. He told
          you about the Wolf. The Beast of
          Villiers la CroisÃ©e.
          (off Boy's look)
          The people of that village have
          been spreading that nonsense since
          before you were a tickle in your
          daddy's prick. I'd give you a
          whipping for believing it if I
          thought it would do any good.
          The Old Knight stares into the fire, then speaks.

                         OLD KNIGHT
          I used to travel these woods.
          They told the same stories then
          that they do now. Only I heard
          them from a man who actually saw
          the beast with his own eyes.

                         FAT KNIGHT
          Half the people in these parts
          claim to have seen it.

                         OLD KNIGHT
          This man claimed it was the last
          thing he ever saw. The Wolf took
          his eyes. And half his face.
          (off their looks)
          I saw his scars and empty eye
          sockets. His skin looked like it
          was on inside-out. It didn't seem
          to me like the kind of thing a man
          would make up a story about.
          He shrugs. His companions exchange an unnerved look.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (LATER)

          It's raining now. The Knights sleep underneath the cart
          for shelter. Lightning FLASHES.
          Then, from O.S., the horse gives a series of frightened
          NEIGHS. The Boy stirs, but by the time he awakens, there
          is only the sound of the RAIN. Did he imagine it? He
          reluctantly decides to venture out to investigate.
          The Boy hurries over to where he tied the horse... but
          all he finds is the empty rope blowing in the wind. In a
          FLASH of lightning, he sees that the horse is gone.
          Then he hears something. A strange GNAWING sound.
          TEARING and POPPING. He slowly turns...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         CONTINUED:
          Not far away, he makes out a shape in the darkness. The
          horse is on its side, WHEEZING helplessly. And there's
          something crouched next to it. We can't make out what it
          is, only a MAN-LIKE SHAPE, shrouded in shadow.
          Whatever it is, it's eating the horse alive.
          The Boy steps away in horror, then hurriedly stumbles
          back to his companions and frantically shakes them awake.

                         FAT KNIGHT
          What the devil are you --?!

                         TEENAGE BOY
          Wait, wait! Be quiet!
          He raises a hand. He's heard something. They listen.
          FOOTSTEPS. Approaching through the mud. The Boy's hand
          clutches a dagger, but the Fat Knight reaches out and
          stays him, terrified. The Boy follows his look.
          We never get a good look at THE FIGURE walking toward
          them. But what the men see scares them shitless. It
          stops near the cart. The men huddle together, watching
          as it slowly starts to walk around the cart --
          -- then suddenly jumps atop it. The Figure is now above
          them. With each step it takes, the boards of the wooden
          cart CREAK and bend under its weight. A long beat.
          Then the Figure jumps down again, landing behind the men,
          startling them. It pauses. The men cower, shivering...
          Suddenly, the cart is flipped over as if it weighed
          nothing, revealing the terrified Knights beneath it.
          Lightning FLASHES. A shadow falls over them.
          The men scramble to their feet, but the Old Knight slips
          in the mud. The Boy stops to help him, but then the Old
          Knight starts screaming, something GROWLS, and the Boy
          stops short at what he sees. The Fat Knight runs.

                         TEENAGE BOY
          Wait! We have to help him!
          The Fat Knight ignores him. The Old Knight shrieks. We
          hear the same TEARING and POPPING that this thing made
          while eating the horse. The Boy quickly looks around...
          ... sees a curved Arabian scimitar lying in the mud,
          fallen from the overturned wagon. He grabs it and as the
          Fat Knight runs, the Boy stands his ground. He hefts the
          blade. He's young, but he has used this before. A lot.
          Rain beats down on his face and lightning FLASHES as he
          confronts the thing that is devouring the Old Knight.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          The Fat Knight runs through the forest without looking
          back. He hears a loud HOWL behind him and runs faster.
          Then he hears the Boy SCREAMING and blind panic sets in,
          his head filled with the sounds of his HEAVY BREATHING
          and RUNNING FOOTFALLS in the mud and crashing THUNDER.
          He's running so fast he nearly falls into the RUSHING
          RIVER that crosses his path. He quickly looks for a way
          to cross. The river is gorged and the water is moving
          fast. Then, in a flash of lightning, he spots it --
          A fallen tree spans the river. The Knight hurries to it.
          The bark is smooth and slick from the rain. He can't
          stand on it. He has to crawl. He edges out on his hands
          and knees, his eyes flicking nervously at the waters
          surging underneath him. He has almost made it across...
          ... when he hears a LOW SNARL. He freezes. Looks back.
          Lightning FLASHES. The Figure, still obscured to us,
          stands on the riverbank behind the Knight. It GROWLS.
          The Knight tries to crawl away, but slips and nearly
          falls in the river. Then suddenly, the tree beneath him
          begins to move. He hangs on for his life and looks back.
          The Figure is on the tree behind him, slowly closing in.
          He starts to crawl, slips again. No way he can get away.
          He looks down into the racing river waters. Then back at
          the Figure closing in. The choice is clear. The Fat
          Knight dives headfirst off the tree --
          -- but he never hits the water. Something grabs him by
          the legs and stops him short. He cries out and looks up
          at the thing that is dangling him helplessly above the
          water. He weeps. Then, abruptly --
          -- he is yanked up out of sight.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

          A BUTCHER quickly and expertly cuts the throat of a pig
          that has been hung upside down by its hind legs. It
          kicks and squirms as it bleeds out into a pan.
          VILLAGERS bustle along a muddy road. A MERCHANT sells
          his wares. Dogs run and BARK. A DISHEVELLED MAN locked
          up in the stockade. A BLACKSMITH's hammer CLANGS.
          On the surface, a typical medieval village. But
          something is wrong here. A pall hangs over the place.
          The people are subdued, beaten. A TITLE comes up:

                         FRANCE

                         CONTINUED:
          There's a SIGN in the village green. Hanging from it is
          a wood plank with a crude drawing of a moon on it, three-
          quarters full. The moon has a vaguely sinister face...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAY

          A tiny spider spins its web. CAMERA RACKS FOCUS to a
          pretty 17-year-old GIRL gazing up at it. Her name is
          ISABELLE. She scoops the spider up, watches it crawl
          around on her hand, fascinated.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          The home of a medieval peasant. Isabelle's mother,
          SUZETTE (late 30s), and sister, LUCIE (18, plain-
          looking), work in the garden. They look up as Isabelle
          emerges from the cottage, daintily carrying the spider.

                         LUCIE
          Honestly, Isabelle. Just kill it.

                         ISABELLE
          I can't. It's the fifth
          commandment. Thou shalt not kill.
          Lucie rolls her eyes. Isabelle crouches, letting the
          spider crawl off her hand. She watches it skitter away,
          then calls to Suzette, feigning nonchalance:

                         ISABELLE
          I'm going to take Father some
          water.

                         SUZETTE
          All right. Don't be long.
          Isabelle smiles, grabs a bucket and ladle, and anxiously
          heads toward the village. Lucie watches her go, dubious.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

          Isabelle struggles to draw water from a well. Even
          toiling and sweaty, Isabelle's beauty stands in stark
          contrast to her squalid surroundings.
          A CARPENTER building a timber-framed structure notices
          his TWO YOUNG APPRENTICES (late teens) casting distracted
          glances in her direction. He calls out to her, smiling.

                         CARPENTER
          Hey, there! Let one of these
          young lads get that for you.

                         ISABELLE
          I can do it myself.
          The Carpenter smiles. Of course she can.

          EXT. NEW FIELD - DAY

          The village WOODCUTTERS are chopping down trees and
          hauling away the lumber. A GROUP of them are in the
          midst of what looks like a serious conversation.
          Isabelle approaches them with the bucket of water. One
          of them turns and sees Isabelle. His name is CESAIRE
          (handsome, 40s). He hides his dour expression and gives
          Isabelle a big smile. She smiles back.

                         ISABELLE
          Mother thought you might be
          thirsty.

                         CESAIRE
          That was very thoughtful of her.
          He gives her a knowing look as he ladles a drink from the
          bucket. Isabelle's gaze drifts from him to another
          woodcutter, working off by himself. His name is PETER
          (21, darkly handsome, almost dangerous-looking).
          He makes eye contact with Isabelle for a moment, then
          wipes his brow and calls out to the WOODCUTTER BOSS.

                         PETER
          I'm taking a break.

                         WOODCUTTER BOSS
          A break? Does that mean you're
          going to start working?
          The other Woodcutters LAUGH. Peter walks away.
          Isabelle's gaze lingers on him too long. Cesaire
          notices, not entirely comfortable with what he sees...

          EXT. WOODS - PATH - DAY

          Not far from where the Woodcutters work, Peter waits,
          impatient. Soon Isabelle approaches, smiling. He takes
          her in his arms, kissing her. She holds him tight.

                         PETER
          I was afraid you weren't coming.

                         ISABELLE
          You should know better than that.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         CONTINUED:
          He kisses her again, nibbling her neck. Isabelle opens
          her eyes, smiles up at him. Touches his face.

                         ISABELLE
          I think my sister's starting to
          suspect something.

                         PETER
          Do you think she'll tell your
          father?

                         ISABELLE
          I don't care. I wish she would
          tell him. I want everyone to
          know. Besides, my father likes
          you.

                         PETER
          Of course he does. Right up until
          the point where he figures out
          what I'm doing with his daughter.
          Peter glances back and Isabelle follows his look.
          Through the trees, she sees her father and the group of
          grim Woodcutters, still in serious conversation.

                         ISABELLE
          What's going on?

                         PETER
          You haven't heard?
          (off her look)
          Three men. They found them this
          morning just off the Center Road.
          At least they think it was three
          men. There wasn't enough left to
          piece them back together.
          A long beat as Isabelle takes this in. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          Was it the Wolf?

                         PETER
          Could it have been anything else?
          Isabelle shudders. No, it couldn't have been.

                         PETER
          We should have killed that monster
          a long time ago.

                         ISABELLE
          I know. You say that every month.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          He gives her a grim smile, then kisses her. She kisses
          him back, then tries to stop kissing him. It's not easy.

                         ISABELLE
          I'd better go.

                         PETER
          Same time tomorrow?

                         ISABELLE
          Don't get used to this. I start
          my sewing lessons next week.

                         PETER
          You really think you can go all
          day without seeing me?

                         ISABELLE
          I'll manage somehow. Pride is a
          cardinal sin, by the way.

                         PETER
          I can think of worse sins I could
          be committing.
          She gives a cautioning look, then leaves with a smile.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

          The VILLAGE HERALD is changing the plank on the moon
          sign. He replaces the picture of the three-quarters moon
          with a picture of a half moon, its face indifferent.

                         HERALD
          Half full! Half full!

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAWN

          Suzette is putting bread and cheese into a basket.
          Isabelle pulls on a drab hooded cloak.

                         SUZETTE
          You mind your grandmother,
          understand? You're her student
          now, the same as the other girls.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, Mother.
          Suzette hands her the basket with a proud look.

                         SUZETTE
          My last baby has grown up.

          EXT. VILLAGE - CROSSROADS - MORNING

          Isabelle watches a DEAF BOY perform simple sleight of
          hand magic tricks. His name is CLAUDE (14). She
          applauds his performance and hands him a coin. He makes
          it 'disappear,' then smiles big and runs away.
          A crazy old woman, LUCRECE, shoots Isabelle a look.

                         LUCRECE
          You're only encouraging him.

                         ISABELLE
          I know.
          THREE GIRLS (ages 16-18) approach: ROXANNE (round-faced,
          cheery and instantly likable), PRUDENCE (practical,
          serious), and ROSEMARIA (pretty, arrogant, flirtatious).
          A playful PUPPY tags along. Prudence and Rosemaria look
          tired, but Roxanne greets Isabelle with a big smile.

                         ISABELLE
          You look happy.

                         ROXANNE
          Aren't you excited?

                         PRUDENCE
          It's too early to be excited.

                         ROXANNE
          I'm just trying to look on the
          bright side.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Well, stop it before somebody
          hurts you.
          The girls have a laugh at Roxanne's expense.

          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - MORNING

          The girls leave the village on a trail that leads through
          the dark forest. The puppy stops at the edge of the
          forest. Then it WHINES and refuses to follow.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - MORNING

          The trail stretches out in front of the girls as far as
          they can see. Rosemaria walks with Roxanne. Prudence
          hangs back with Isabelle, brimming with juicy gossip.

                         PRUDENCE
          Did you hear about her and the
          Darley brothers?

                         ISABELLE
          Oh, no! Which one?

                         PRUDENCE
          Both! On the same night!
          Isabelle gives an incredulous look and Prudence tries to
          contain her laughter. Rosemaria hears and looks back at
          them. She scowls at Isabelle.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Why does your grandmother have to
          live so far away?

                         ISABELLE
          What's the matter, Rosemaria?
          Having trouble walking?
          Prudence laughs. Roxanne frowns, disapproving.
          Rosemaria shoots Isabelle a dirty look.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          The girls cross a little wooden bridge that spans a
          BABBLING brook and follow the trail to a large cottage,
          well past its prime. Chickens CLUCK and peck around it.
          An OLD WOMAN opens the door and waves to them. She's
          stooped and withered, but her eyes are bright and
          beautiful. She wears a blue belted gown and a necklace
          with a crucifix on it. This is Isabelle's GRANDMOTHER.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Well, stop dawdling. Come on,
          come on.
          The girls hurry inside, but Grandmother stops Isabelle.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Your mother has warned you not to
          expect any special treatment from
          me?

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, ma'am.
          Grandmother eyes her a moment longer, then breaks into a
          smile and surreptitiously hands her a bright red apple.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Well, then your mother doesn't
          know me very well, does she?
          Isabelle smiles as Grandmother ushers her inside.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          Grandmother works a pair of knitting needles, casting
          loops of red wool yarn onto one of them, a BLACK CAT
          resting on her lap. Her bedchamber is hidden by a
          beautiful veil embroidered with palms and pomegranates.
          The girls sit facing her, watching as she knits. Then:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          There. This is going to be my
          foundation. Everything I do now
          will build off of this.
          She shows the row of stitches to Roxanne.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Roxanne, is this a good
          foundation?

                         ROXANNE
          I don't know.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Why not?

                         ROXANNE
          Well... you haven't told us what
          you're making.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          There's something else I haven't
          told you. I haven't told you why
          I'm making it. Before you begin
          any task, you must first always
          ask yourself why.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Why?
          The girls laugh. Grandmother gives her a patient smile.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Because understanding why you are
          doing something is the key to
          doing it successfully. So, before
          we begin today, let's be certain
          that we have a good foundation.
          Who can tell me why you are here?

                         (CONTINUED)

          To become seamstresses. To learn
          how to sew and mend clothes.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          That's what you are doing. But
          why are you doing it?
          Blank looks. None of them have ever considered this.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Isabelle, your sister studied with
          me last winter. What does she do
          now?

                         ISABELLE
          She works with the women.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Why don't you work with them?

                         ISABELLE
          I don't know how to yet.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          And how does that make you feel?
          Isabelle thinks for a moment, then has an insight.

                         ISABELLE
          Like a child.
          Grandmother gives her a smile, then continues.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You will be coming here every day
          for the next three months. During
          that time, I will teach you
          everything you need to know to be
          productive members of our
          community. But there is something
          far more important that will also
          be happening here.
          All the girls are paying close attention now, but
          Grandmother seems to be speaking directly to Isabelle.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You will be proving your worth and
          learning your place in the world.
          And I promise you, when you leave
          here for the last time, you will
          never feel like a child again.

          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - DUSK

          The four girls return to the village along the forest
          path. Waiting for them is Peter. Isabelle pretends to
          not notice him. As they pass, he calls out to her:

                         PETER
          I need to talk to you.
          Isabelle turns to face him, trying to stay nonchalant.

                         ISABELLE
          What about?
          Peter just looks at her for a beat. Isabelle turns and
          sees that the other girls have stopped to watch.
          Isabelle shoots them a look. The girls take the hint and
          leave. When they've gone, Peter walks up to Isabelle.

                         PETER
          When were you planning on telling
          me?

                         ISABELLE
          Telling you what?

                         PETER
          That you're engaged to be married
          to Henri Smith.
          Isabelle gapes at him, stunned and confused.

                         ISABELLE
          Henri Smith? Is this a joke?

                         PETER
          Look at me. Just look at me and
          tell me you didn't know.
          She looks at him and sees it in his eyes. He's serious.

                         ISABELLE
          Who told you this?

                         PETER
          Your father.
          Off Isabelle's look...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

          The family is gathered around the table. Isabelle and
          Lucie listen to their parents in stunned silence.

                         SUZETTE
          It's all been arranged. Your
          marriage to Henri will settle our
          debt to his father.
          Isabelle nods, shaken. Cesaire sees that she's upset.

                         SUZETTE
          We know that you and Peter have
          become friends. But you have
          adult responsibilities now. That
          means putting your family's
          interests ahead of your own.

                         ISABELLE
          So Henri Smith is in the family's
          interest and Peter is not?

                         CESAIRE
          Peter is a fine young man.

                         ISABELLE
          But what? He's poor? He's an
          orphan?

                         SUZETTE
          He's not one of us. His parents
          were outsiders.

                         ISABELLE
          Why? Because they hadn't lived
          here since Noah built the ark?

                         SUZETTE
          You mind your tongue.
          Isabelle is about to respond, when she notices something.
          Lucie is crying. A beat. Lucie looks up at her parents.

                         LUCIE
          Do you realize how this makes me
          look? I'm older than her by more
          than a year. If anyone should be
          getting married in the spring,
          it's me.
          Everyone is taken aback. Lucie storms out of the
          cottage, angrily wiping tears. Isabelle watches her go.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

          Cesaire smokes his pipe, troubled. Suzette sits nearby.

                         CESAIRE
          This was your idea. Now I have
          both of them hating me.
          In the loft, Isabelle and Lucie are in bed... but
          Isabelle only pretends to be asleep so she can eavesdrop.

                         SUZETTE
          We knew Isabelle was going to be
          stubborn. It wouldn't be like her
          to simply do as she's told. She's
          too much like her grandmother.

                         CESAIRE
          That she is. What about Lucie?

                         SUZETTE
          She's a good girl, but she's still
          a child. Talk to her. You're her
          father. She'll listen to you.
          Isabelle glances over at Lucie... and sees that she's
          been eavesdropping, too. Lucie turns away, embarrassed.
          Isabelle gives her a sad look.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          There's a knock at the door. Isabelle answers, revealing
          HENRI (18). He's tall and good-looking, but still
          awkward in his body. Isabelle eyes him, a little aloof.

                         HENRI
          Hello, Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          Hello, Henri.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - DAY

          Isabelle and Henri walk in awkward silence. Then:

                         HENRI
          So I suppose you've heard.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes. My parents are very pleased.

                         HENRI
          And you? Are you pleased?

                         ISABELLE
          It's a very generous arrangement.

          16.

                         CONTINUED:
          Not the answer he was hoping for. Another awkward beat.

                         HENRI
          Do you have any other feelings
          about it? About me?

                         ISABELLE
          I'm not sure. We've never really
          talked that much.

                         HENRI
          I know. That's why I asked you to
          walk with me. I wanted to talk.

                         ISABELLE
          What for?

                         HENRI
          Well... because we're going to be
          husband and wife soon.

                         ISABELLE
          Not until the spring festival.
          That's months away. A lot can
          happen in a few months.
          Henri seems disappointed. She sees this and reconsiders.

                         ISABELLE
          All right. What would you like to
          talk about?

                         HENRI
          I'm not really sure. I brought
          you this.
          He reaches into his pocket and offers Isabelle a flower.
          She takes it, suddenly blushing. But just then, she sees
          Peter walking toward them with another WOODCUTTER.

                         ISABELLE
          Well, I'm glad we had this
          conversation.
          Isabelle abruptly turns and walks away, leaving Henri
          surprised and a little hurt. She passes Peter, her eyes
          averted. He glances back at her as she and walks away...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle is helping Suzette prepare dinner, but she's
          purposefully ignoring her mother. Suzette notices.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SUZETTE
          You know, I had a sweetheart when
          I was your age, too.
          Isabelle looks up, intrigued in spite of herself.
          Suzette smiles slyly at her reaction.

                         ISABELLE
          What happened?

                         SUZETTE
          Nothing happened. My parents
          arranged for me to marry your
          father and that was the end of
          that.

                         ISABELLE
          Didn't you want to marry your
          sweetheart?

                         SUZETTE
          Of course, I did. But there's
          more to marriage than being in
          love. Love doesn't always last
          and it certainly doesn't fill your
          children's bellies in the winter.

                         ISABELLE
          You've never wished you could have
          married that other boy?

                         SUZETTE
          Not even once.
          Isabelle eyes her, still uncertain.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Isabelle prays in front of an altar with prayer candles
          on it. Peter kneels next to her and lights one of them.

                         PETER
          We need to talk.

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          Isabelle and Peter stand behind the church, out of sight.
          Peter looks off toward the woods, his back to Isabelle.

                         PETER
          You have to go through with it.
          You have to marry Henri.

                         CONTINUED:
          Isabelle takes a step toward him. She hesitates,
          gathering her nerve to speak. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          I don't care what my parents want.
          They don't own me. I love you.

                         PETER
          That doesn't matter.

                         ISABELLE
          It does to me. Doesn't it matter
          to you?

                         PETER
          It's not our decision to make.

                         ISABELLE
          You sound like my mother.

                         PETER
          Then maybe you should start
          listening to your mother.
          (off her look)
          It's over. They had to find out
          eventually. Don't turn this into
          something that it's not. We had
          our fun, but that's all it ever
          was.
          Isabelle looks up at him, shocked and confused.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't believe you.

                         PETER
          Go home, Isabelle. Go home and
          grow up.
          Isabelle gapes at him. Peter walks away.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't believe you!
          He doesn't look back. She watches him go, heartbroken.

          EXT. CREEK - DAWN

          Cesaire bathes in a cold stream. The sun is just barely
          rising, rays of light shining through the trees. He
          smiles. It looks like the start of a beautiful day.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

          The village is bustling with activity, but there's a
          palpable tension. The picture on the moon sign is of a
          three-quarters moon... but then the Herald changes it to
          a picture of a FULL MOON with a cruel, malevolent face.

                         HERALD
          Full moon! Full moon! Full moon!

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - MORNING

          Isabelle emerges from the cottage. Roxanne, Prudence,
          and Rosemaria are outside waiting on her. They all start
          toward the village, but then Isabelle sees something...
          In the shadows next to the cottage, Cesaire is giving
          Lucie a stern lecture. Lucie turns and sees Isabelle.
          Her face is ashen and there are tears in her eyes.
          Isabelle starts toward them, but Cesaire stops her.

                         CESAIRE
          This doesn't concern you,
          Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, Father.
          Isabelle reluctantly turns and walks away. The girls
          follow her. Roxanne gives Lucie a concerned look.

          EXT. VILLAGE - MORNING

          The girls walk through the village. Isabelle is lost in
          thought, stung by her father's brusk dismissal.

                         ROXANNE
          What's wrong with Lucie?

                         ROSEMARIA
          How would you feel if you were in
          love with your sister's fiancÃ©e?
          Isabelle stops short and gives Rosemaria a sharp look.

                         ISABELLE
          Lucie is not in love with my
          fiancÃ©e.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Really? So she's just had a crush
          on him since she was ten?

                         ISABELLE
          As if she would really tell you
          something like that.

                         ROSEMARIA
          She didn't. She told my sister.
          (off Isabelle's look)
          Did you honestly not know?
          Isabelle clearly had no idea, but tries to hide it. Just
          then, they walk by the blacksmith's shop where Henri
          works with his father, ADRIEN. Henri smiles at Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          Come on. We're going to be late.
          She turns away. Rosemaria gives her a smug look.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAWN

          The girls are walking down the path to Grandmother's
          cottage. Rosemaria lags behind, tired and grumpy.
          There's a fork in the path and Rosemaria stops at it. A
          SMALLER PATH branches off into the forest, overgrown and
          narrow. Rosemaria looks at it for a beat...
          Roxanne suddenly notices that Rosemaria isn't with them.
          She looks back and sees her start down the other path.

                         ROXANNE
          Rosemaria...?
          The other girls stop and hurry back to the fork, dismayed
          to find Rosemaria headed down the overgrown path.

                         ISABELLE
          What are you doing?

                         ROSEMARIA
          What does it look like?

                         ISABELLE
          You can't go that way. You have
          to stay on the path.

                         ROSEMARIA
          This way is faster.

                         PRUDENCE
          But it's not safe. My brother
          says the bridge is rotten.

                         ROSEMARIA
          I don't care. It's bad enough
          working all day in that smelly
          cottage. It's not reasonable for
          them to expect us to walk that far
          every day on top of that.
          She walks away, defiant. The girls look nervous. Then:

                         PRUDENCE
          If you get lost, nobody will come
          looking for you. Not tonight.
          This last part gives Rosemaria pause. She looks down the
          narrow path. It suddenly seems a little ominous.
          Grudgingly, she returns to the group. The other girls
          exchange quiet looks of relief. They continue on.
          The wind blows leaves across the abandoned path...

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          The girls are busy with sewing and knitting projects.
          Grandmother helps Roxanne at the spinning wheel. Then:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Everyone finish what you're
          working on. Your parents will be
          worried if you're not home before
          it starts to get dark.
          The girls begin packing up their work. Prudence sighs.

                         PRUDENCE
          I wish someone would just kill
          that stupid wolf.

                         ROXANNE
          You can't just kill it. It's not
          an ordinary wolf. It's a devil-
          wolf. A servant of Satan himself.
          Prudence rolls her eyes. Whatever.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Who cares what it is? It's only
          one night a month. You stay
          inside, lock up the animals, and
          you don't go into the forest.
          It's never killed anyone from the
          village and as long as we leave it
          alone, it never will.

          young people were so woefully
          uneducated these days.
          (off their looks)
          Our village was not always like
          this. When I was young, this was
          a very special place. Traders and
          merchants came here from lands I'd
          never heard of selling things I
          had never seen. King Philip the
          Bold even visited here once. But
          that, of course, was before the
          Wolf came.
          The girls listen attentively.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Your parents fear the Wolf because
          they remember when it did kill
          people from the village. Break
          down doors in the middle of the
          night and snatch children right
          out of their beds. Rumors began
          to spread that we were cursed.
          That was when our village began to
          die. And that was why my husband
          led a group of men into the woods
          to kill the Wolf. But instead, it
          killed him.
          Isabelle reacts. She has never heard this story before.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          After that, people here didn't
          have much stomach to go hunting
          for it anymore. But something had
          changed. The Wolf stopped killing
          in the village. Even our
          livestock were usually safe as
          long as they were brought inside.
          So we decided it was safer to
          compromise. We gave the Wolf its
          one night a month, the night of
          the full moon, and it has left us
          alone ever since.

                         ISABELLE
          People still die.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Yes, but nobody we know.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Everyone knows what should be
          done. But it's not always easy to
          do what you know is right.
          Sometimes it's easier to settle
          for being safe.
          Isabelle frowns, unsatisfied.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY

          Villagers hurriedly bring their sheep and pigs into their
          homes. Doors are shut and barricaded. Cesaire is
          outside the family cottage, nailing the shutters closed.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DUSK

          Isabelle's family sits at the dinner table in silence.
          Cesaire sets mugs of beer out for everyone. Lucie numbly
          picks at her food, doesn't touch her beer. Isabelle
          works up her nerve to say something and turns to Suzette:

                         ISABELLE
          You were right. About Peter. I
          was being childish.

                         (BEAT)
          But I'm not going to marry Henri.
          Cesaire and Suzette stop eating. Suzette levels a cold
          look at Isabelle.

                         SUZETTE
          You'll do as you're told. It's
          all been arranged.

                         ISABELLE
          The family gains the same no
          matter which one of us marries
          him. And I don't love Henri.
          Lucie does.
          Lucie looks up, surprised to be dragged into this.

                         ISABELLE
          She's right. It's not fair. I
          will gladly trade places with her.
          A beat. Then, without looking up, Lucie whispers:

                         LUCIE
          Shut up.
          Isabelle is stung, the smile wiped from her face.

          24.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          I'm sorry... I...

                         LUCIE
          Please. Just shut up and mind
          your own business.
          A tense beat. Isabelle looks away, hurt and confused.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - NIGHT

          Isabelle is fast asleep. Next to her, Lucie looks over
          at her. She's wide awake. She sneaks out of bed...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Lucie carefully sneaks down from the loft and quietly
          puts on a RED RIDING HOOD. She accidently kicks a pan on
          the floor and puts a hand down to silence it. She
          listens to hear if anyone has awakened. Nothing.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Lucie slips out of the house. She shivers in the cold,
          pulls the riding hood around her. FULL MOON in the sky.
          The village looks deserted, a ghost town. Eerie, still,
          dark. The moon-sign swings in the breeze, CREAKING on
          its rusty hooks. Lucie hurries away toward the woods...

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          Lucie nervously walks along the road leading away from
          the village. She startles at every sound. She looks up.
          The full moon is visible in the sky above her through the
          skeletal branches of the dark trees...
          She comes to the overgrown path that the girls stopped at
          earlier. Lucie takes a deep breath and starts down it...

          EXT. GULLY - NIGHT

          Lucie reaches an OLD ROPE BRIDGE. It spans a deep gully
          and a fast-moving river strewn with jagged rocks. Lucie
          gives the bridge a nervous look and starts across it...
          The boards CREAK loudly under her feet. The bridge sways
          in the wind. She carefully makes her way across, only
          breathing when she is safely on the other side.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

          EXT. WOODS - CLEARING - NIGHT

          Lucie comes to a grassy meadow bathed with moonlight.
          She stands in the middle of it, next to a large rock, and
          looks all around. She's alone, cold and afraid. Then...
          ... she takes off her riding hood, folds it, and places
          it on the rock. She begins to disrobe, folding her dress
          and her undergarments and stacking them in a neat pile.
          Soon she's standing naked, her arms clutched around her
          breasts, shivering with cold. And fear.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK from this lonely naked figure until the
          dark branches of the trees obscure her from view. Then,
          somewhere, a WOLF HOWLS in the night...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAWN

          Isabelle wakes up, groggy. Lucie's bed is empty.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY

          Children are playing, a BOY chasing several giggling
          GIRLS, growling and waving his hands like claws.

                         BOY
          I'm the Wolf! I'm going to eat
          you up!

          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - DAY

          One of the Girls runs into the meadow and sees something
          that makes her stop short. The other Children gather
          behind her, all frozen by what they see...
          CROWS are picking at a bloody carcass. All we can see of
          it is a human hand. A crow gnaws on one of the fingers.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          The girls are at their lessons. Suddenly, there's an
          urgent KNOCK at the door. Everyone stops, surprised.
          Grandmother answers it. It's a YOUNG MAN, sweaty and out
          of breath from running.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          What on earth --?
          The Young Man glances at Isabelle. Something about the
          look in his eyes makes Isabelle go pale...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - DAY

          Isabelle hurries into the clearing with Roxanne,
          Prudence, and Rosemaria trailing behind her. A crowd has
          gathered. She pushes through it, then stop short.
          Lucie is dead. We don't see what's been done to her, but
          Roxanne turns away and vomits. Cesaire and Suzette are
          already here. He holds her as she cries on his shoulder.
          Isabelle just stares at Lucie's body, shattered.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Isabelle is curled in a fetal ball on the bed, clutching
          Lucie's cloak to her chest. She's cried her eyes out.
          Grandmother sets down a cup of tea. As Isabelle watches,
          Grandmother sprinkles a pinch of dark herbs in the tea.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          It's my little secret. A pinch
          will help you rest. A little more
          and you'll sleep through the end
          of the world.
          Grandmother smiles. Isabelle smiles back, weak.

                         ISABELLE
          I think I'd like that.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

          Two men, the Merchant and the REEVE, gossip by the well.

                         MERCHANT
          She had it coming, if you ask me.
          What the hell was she doing out
          there?
          Then they notice that Isabelle is right behind them,
          drawing a water from the well. Both men shift
          uncomfortably, but she pretends she didn't hear.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          Lucie's body lies on the table. Isabelle watches as
          Suzette and Grandmother bathe the body. Suddenly,
          Grandmother stops. She's found something clutched in
          Lucie's hand. A troubled look comes over her...

                         ISABELLE
          What is it?

          Nothing.
          Grandmother curtly wraps what she's found in a washcloth.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Lucie's funeral. Cesaire and Suzette sit with Isabelle,
          who holds Grandmother's hand. The other girls are here,
          too. Roxanne sits with her mother, MARGUERITE, and
          Claude, the deaf boy we saw performing magic. The
          priest, FATHER AUGUSTE, conducts the service.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          Wherefore each man and woman that
          is wise, make him ready thereto;
          for we all shall die, and we know
          not how soon...

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          Villagers leave the church. Claude is playing in the
          cemetery. Father Auguste frowns, disapproving.
          Marguerite sees this and angrily pulls Roxanne aside.

                         MARGUERITE
          Take your brother home.
          Embarrassed, Roxanne quickly grabs Claude and drags him
          away, but he fights her, crying and kicking.
          Isabelle's family is met by Henri and his father, Adrien.

                         ADRIEN
          She was a good girl. We all loved
          her.
          He's looking at Cesaire and shakes his hand, but he
          briefly glances at Suzette. Isabelle notices the look,
          but then she spots Peter leaving the church. She makes
          brief eye contact with him before Henri interrupts.

                         HENRI
          I'm here for you, too.
          But her gaze follows Peter as he walks away...

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY

          ATTEWATER, the town bailiff, presides over a gathering of
          the Villagers. Isabelle, Suzette, and Grandmother sit
          with Cesaire, who is angrily addressing the crowded room.

                         CESAIRE
          A line has been crossed. The
          beast must be destroyed!

                         MERCHANT
          Your daughter crossed the line.
          She went into the woods.

                         CESAIRE
          She was taken. She must have
          been!

                         MERCHANT
          So the Wolf broke into your home
          and stole your daughter without
          waking anyone or leaving any sign
          at all?

                         REEVE
          It's been almost thirty years
          since someone here was killed by
          the Wolf. We've left it alone.
          Why would it suddenly come and
          take one of us now?
          Grandmother gathers her nerve and stands up.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I know something.
          Cesaire and Suzette give Grandmother surprised looks.
          She walks up to the table and hands Attewater the wadded
          up washcloth we saw her with earlier.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I found this. I believe it must
          belong to her attacker.
          Attewater unfolds the washcloth. There are a few strands
          of hair inside. He gives her a sharp look.

                         ATTEWATER
          This is not animal hair.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          No, it isn't. It's human.
          A stunned silence comes over the room.

                         ATTEWATER
          No man could have done the things
          that were done to your
          granddaughter. It must have been
          the Wolf.

          in her hand when she died.

                         ATTEWATER
          What are you suggesting?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          That the man and the Wolf may be
          one and the same.
          A low MURMUR works its way through the crowd.

                         ATTEWATER
          A werewolf.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          It would explain much. The Pope
          himself has declared that such
          creatures exist.
          The thought gives everyone pause.

                         MERCHANT
          Even if you're right, it doesn't
          help us. The woods are filled
          with hermits and strangers. If
          there's a werewolf among them, how
          will we find it?

                         ATTEWATER
          There are experts in these
          matters. Men who find and try
          witches and werewolves. We could
          request the Church to send
          someone.
          Grandmother gives him a sharp look.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Not someone. You're talking about
          Father Solomon.
          This sends a ripple of comment through the room.

                         ATTEWATER
          He is the Church's most successful
          werewolf hunter.

                         ADRIEN
          But what of his methods? The man
          once burned down an entire village
          just to root out one witch.

          Unsubstantiated rumors. The
          Church has appointed him the
          Witchfinder General of all
          Christendom.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          That is also unsubstantiated.
          Attewater eyes him, but Father Auguste stands his ground.

                         ATTEWATER
          I have the utmost confidence in
          the ability of the Witchfinder
          General to determine the nature of
          the beast and put an end to it. I
          will dispatch a messenger in the
          morning.

                         CESAIRE
          Even if Father Solomon agrees to
          help us, it will take weeks for
          him to get here. That means
          another full moon. Maybe two.
          We must defend ourselves.
          A long, silent beat. Then, Henri stands.

                         HENRI
          He's right. The beast broke the
          peace, not us.

                         (TO CESAIRE)
          I will help you kill it.
          Henri's father gives him a surprised look. But after
          another long beat, the Reeve stands up, too.

                         REEVE
          As will I. We all will.
          Henri is nervous, but tries to appear brave for Isabelle.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAWN

          Isabelle is about to leave when she sees Lucie's red
          riding hood. She gives it a solemn look.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAWN

          A light snow has fallen. The girls are walking to
          Grandmother's house, but Isabelle sadly lags behind, lost
          in thought. She's wearing Lucie's red riding hood.

          31.

                         CONTINUED:
          Roxanne waits for Isabelle and offers her hand. Isabelle
          smiles sadly and takes it. Prudence and Rosemaria let
          them catch up, then they continue on together...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle returns home. Suzette is making dinner, but
          stops short when she sees Isabelle in Lucie's red cloak.

                         SUZETTE
          Who gave you permission to wear
          that?

                         ISABELLE
          Nobody. I just --

                         SUZETTE
          Your Grandmother made that for
          Lucie. Take it off.
          Isabelle hesitates, then does as she's told. Suzette
          snatches the cloak away from her. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          It was folded when they found her.
          Her clothes, too. Did you notice
          that?

                         SUZETTE
          Someone must have folded them.
          A beat. Isabelle is reluctant to voice her thoughts...

                         ISABELLE
          She was so unhappy.
          Suzette turns, her eyes narrowing dangerously.

                         SUZETTE
          What are you saying?

                         ISABELLE
          Maybe she went into the woods on
          purpose. Maybe she wanted to die.
          Suddenly: Suzette slaps her across the face. Hard.

                         SUZETTE
          Lucie's soul is at peace with God.
          Don't you ever again suggest
          otherwise.
          Suzette turns away in tears. Isabelle is stunned
          speechless.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

          EXT. PETER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          Isabelle trudges through the mud toward a ramshackle
          cottage. If there had been train tracks in the
          fourteenth century, this place would have been on the
          wrong side of them.
          Isabelle gathers her nerve and knocks on the door. A
          long beat. The door opens. It's Peter. He gives her a
          surprised look. She looks up at him, choking back tears.

                         PETER
          Are you all right?

                         ISABELLE
          I'm sorry. I just need to talk to
          someone. Can I come in?
          Peter balks. Just then, a figure appears. Isabelle
          can't believe her eyes... It's Rosemaria. She's
          standing behind Peter, but it's clear that she's naked.

                         ROSEMARIA
          No. You can't.
          She wraps an arm around Peter's waist. Isabelle gives
          him a stricken look and runs away. Peter watches her go.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK

          Lessons are over. The girls are ready to leave except
          for Isabelle, who sits alone by the fire. Rosemaria
          gives her a sly look as she leaves. When the girls have
          gone, Grandmother sits down next to Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          I hate the cold. Why can't we
          have lessons in the summer?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I suppose that would be easier.
          But then that would defeat the
          purpose. People only change when
          things are difficult.
          Isabelle gives her a look, understanding, then turns
          away. Grandmother puts a hand on her shoulder and then
          leaves her alone. Isabelle stares into the fire...

          INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Roxanne comes home to a shocking scene: her mother,
          Marguerite, half-naked and wrapped in a blanket,

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         CONTINUED:
          viciously beating Claude with a switch. Roxanne
          hurriedly pulls her off of him and he runs away.

                         MARGUERITE
          I caught the little bastard
          watching us!

                         ROXANNE
          Watching what?
          Just then, the Merchant enters from the bedroom,
          adjusting his clothes. He hesitates when he sees
          Roxanne, then drops a handful of coins on the table and
          leaves. Marguerite puts the coins in a leather purse.
          Roxanne glares at her.

                         MARGUERITE
          It's money, isn't it? You could
          make twice this your first time.
          They pay more for virgins.
          Roxanne recoils in disgust and storms out in tears.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DUSK

          The full moon sign swings in the wind, a few flakes of
          snow whipping through the air around it.

          INT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - DUSK

          Adrien picks up a hammer and a pickaxe. He hands the
          hammer to Henri, fixing him with a serious look.

                         ADRIEN
          Don't do this for Isabelle. She
          can't marry you if you're dead.

                         HENRI

                         (LYING)
          I'm not doing it for her.

                         ADRIEN
          Your mother would be proud to see
          the man you've become.
          Henri is moved. He nods, at a loss for words.

          INT. TAVERN COTTAGE - DUSK

          Not so much a tavern as the home of someone who decided
          to brew some beer and sell it. Cesaire stands before a
          group of men. They've all had too much to drink.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         CONTINUED:

                         CESAIRE
          My father died trying to kill the
          Wolf. For forty years, we have
          lived in fear of it. But no more.
          And never again. We don't need a
          Witchfinder General to rid of us
          this hell-hated beast. Because by
          God and all that is holy, the
          Beast of Villiers la CroisÃ©e shall
          die tonight!
          The men CHEER.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DUSK

          Cesaire leads the drunken group through the streets. The
          rest of the Villagers line the streets, watching them go.
          Claude tries to join the hunters, thinking it's a game,
          but Roxanne quickly catches him. Peter shakes his head
          at the dubious spectacle. Henri sees him.

                         HENRI
          You're not coming with us?

                         PETER
          Are you joking? These fools are
          as likely to kill each other as
          they are anything else.
          Henri shoots him an angry look before moving on.
          Isabelle and Suzette say goodbye to Cesaire. Isabelle
          sees Peter through the crowd and quickly looks away.
          Just then, Henri and Adrien pass by. On impulse,
          Isabelle runs up and kisses Henri on the mouth. When
          she's sure that Peter has seen this, she quickly walks
          away. Henri gives Peter a gloating look. Peter scowls.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - DUSK

          The Men have taken up positions just inside the treeline,
          one of them every twenty feet, surrounding the village.
          They each have lit torches. CAMERA FINDS Henri crouched
          in the brush. Cesaire walks along the line of men.

                         CESAIRE
          Get that torch out.
          Henri douses his torch.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          The full moon is high in the night sky. Snow is falling.
          CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES over the anxious face of the hunters.
          Adrien, clutching his pickaxe. The Reeve. The Merchant.
          The Carpenter. Shivering from cold and jangled nerves,
          staring wide-eyed into the dark and silent woods...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle lies in bed, but still awake. Suddenly... a
          wolf HOWLS outside. Her eyes widen.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          The Reeve hears it. He clutches an old sword. Nearby,
          the Merchant cowers in the brush. Adrien listens as the
          wolf HOWLS over and over, louder each time. The
          Carpenter nervously peers out from his cover...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - NIGHT

          The HOWLING is getting closer. Isabelle goes to the
          window, opens the shutter, cautiously peers out... and is
          startled by a HORRIBLE SCREAM in the distance.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          The Carpenter hears the SCREAM, too. He runs toward it
          and finds an extinguished torch on the ground. There are
          footprints in the snow. And blood. The brush around him
          RUSTLES and he jumps to his feet, axe held at the ready --
          -- but it's just the other Men, led by the Reeve.

                         REEVE
          Who was that screaming?

                         CARPENTER
          I don't know.

                         MERCHANT
          Look.
          He's gone pale. The others follow his look. There's a
          LARGE PAW PRINT in the snow. The Men stare at it.
          Suddenly, the same SCREAM pierces the night, this time
          coming from deeper in the woods. The Men exchange a wary
          look, but then start after it.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         CONTINUED:
          They run into a still clearing where the snow-covered
          brush is as high as their waists. They pause and listen.
          Only silence. They carefully make their way in the
          direction of the screams, quiet. Frost-brittle leaves
          CRUNCH under their feet...
          Suddenly -- something is moving in the brush. All they
          can see is the snowy brush violently shaking as it darts
          off, almost faster than it can be followed with the eye.
          It races right by the Merchant, knocking him on his ass,
          but it's gone before he can get a look at it.
          He startles as the Reeve pulls him to his feet.

                         REEVE
          Which way did it go?
          The Merchant points a trembling finger. The Reeve
          plunges into the brush after it and the Men follow.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - HILLSIDE - NIGHT

          The Reeve leads the Men to the foot of a steep and rocky
          hill. It's a dead end. But then they hear the SCREAMS
          again. The Men look up at the hillside.

                         CARPENTER
          The caves. It's in the caves.

          INT. CAVE - NIGHT

          The Men stand in the mouth of a wide cave, relighting
          their torches. The SCREAMING echoes from inside. The
          Carpenter raises his torch. The cave is as deep and dark
          as a monster's throat. The Men crowd start inside...
          The SCREAMING continues, unnerving the Men as they
          approach. Then they come to a fork in the tunnel. The
          SCREAMS bounce off the stone walls. Impossible to tell
          where it's coming from.

                         REEVE
          Split up. Two groups.
          Half the Men take one fork, half the other. We follow
          the Reeve's group down a narrowing passageway. The Men
          crowd together, hunched low. The SCREAMS seem to be
          getting louder. The Reeve stops, listening.
          He turns toward a low crack in the cave wall. The
          SCREAMS are coming from inside. He shines his torch
          inside, lowers his head, and walks toward it. The cave

                         CONTINUED:
          floor takes a steep dip. He has to keep one hand on the
          wall to keep from falling...
          Then suddenly, his feet skid on a patch of loose pebbles
          and he loses his footing. He slides down the steep
          floor, drops his torch, hands flailing, unable to stop
          himself, and then --
          -- he finds himself falling off a low cliff into the
          darkness. He tumbles head over heels down a rocky slope
          and splashes hard in a shallow underground river. The
          torch rolls off the ledge above and falls on the shore
          amidst a shower of grit and pebbles.
          The Reeve gets up, grimacing in pain, grabs the torch.
          He shines it around... and sees Adrien. He's leaning
          against a rock, the ground beneath him wet with blood
          spreading from a dark wound between his legs.
          Reeve rushes to his side and crosses himself when he sees
          the wound. Then: a low, menacing, GROWL. He turns...
          There's a huge, SNARLING GRAY WOLF behind him. Adrien's
          pickaxe juts from between its shoulder blades.
          Reeve freezes, suddenly realizing that he's dropped his
          sword. He splashes around in the river, blindly feeling
          for it in the water. The wounded animal growls, blood
          bubbling from between its teeth. Reeve finds the sword --
          -- just as the wolf attacks.

          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - DAWN

          Silence. The sun is starting to light the sky, revealing
          a peacefully glistening blanket of snow on the village.
          The Men are returning from the woods. Isabelle and
          Suzette are among the Villagers breathlessly awaiting
          them. No way of telling whether they met with success or
          failure. But as they near...
          ... we can see Reeve leading the group, carrying a pike
          with the wolf's severed head on it. The Villagers CHEER,
          but the Men are weary and subdued. Suzette and Isabelle
          find Cesaire. He hugs them tight.
          Suddenly, a woman GASPS. Then they see: the Men are
          carrying Adrien's body on a travois. Suzette chokes back
          her reaction. Henri walks with the body, eyes red and
          cried out. He passes Isabelle without looking at her.

          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - DAY

          Henri hammers at a red-hot iron horseshoe. Isabelle
          enters. Henri doesn't seem to notice. A hesitant beat.

                         ISABELLE
          I heard your father wounded the
          beast. He was a brave man.

                         HENRI
          Did you hear what it did to him?
          It chewed off his private parts.
          Isabelle had not heard this. Henri doesn't stop working.

                         HENRI
          And I did nothing. I was too
          scared. I couldn't move. I just
          let my father be eaten alive.
          She moves toward him, but he shrugs her away.

                         HENRI
          No. I don't want you here.
          Isabelle gives him a sad look, then leaves. Henri just
          keeps hammering away on the anvil.

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          A coffin is lowered into a grave. Father Auguste blesses
          it. Henri stands at his side. Isabelle is here with
          Roxanne. Lucrece eyes Isabelle, then whispers to her:

                         LUCRECE
          I thought your mother would be
          here. They used to be quite
          close.
          Isabelle gives her a sharp look, but Lucrece says nothing
          more. Isabelle looks down at the coffin with a sudden
          realization...

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          Suzette is soaking clothes in a bucket of lye, crying as
          she works. Isabelle approaches. Suzette quickly wipes
          her eyes. A beat. Isabelle gathers her nerve, then:

                         ISABELLE
          You told me you had a sweetheart
          before you were married. It was
          Henri's father, wasn't it?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         CONTINUED:
          Suzette freezes. She faces Isabelle, but doesn't answer.

                         ISABELLE
          Lucie was in love with Henri. She
          could have married him.
          (off Suzette's look)
          Couldn't she have?

                         SUZETTE
          We arranged for you to marry him.

                         ISABELLE
          But you gained the same no matter
          which one of us married him. So
          why did it have to be me?

                         SUZETTE
          I think you know the answer to
          that question.

                         ISABELLE
          No. You say it.
          Suzette's eyes well up. Then:

                         SUZETTE
          Lucie was Henri's half-sister.
          She was not your father's
          daughter.
          Isabelle suddenly looks ill. Reluctant, she asks:

                         ISABELLE
          Am I? Do you even know?

                         SUZETTE
          Yes. I was already pregnant when
          your father and I married.

                         ISABELLE
          Does he know?

                         SUZETTE
          No. And he must never know.
          Tears spill down Isabelle's cheeks. She walks away.

                         SUZETTE
          Isabelle!

                         (BEAT)
          Promise me you won't tell him.
          Isabelle gives her a look that doesn't promise much. She
          leaves without answering.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Grandmother ladles soup into a bowl and brings it to
          Isabelle. Isabelle's eyes are red from crying.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I've found that there's no burden
          that doesn't at least seem a
          little lighter on a full stomach.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't know what to do. She
          wants me to pretend like I don't
          know. How am I supposed to go on
          living in that house?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You have a right to be angry with
          her. But try not to hate her.
          Too much hate will eat you alive.
          Isabelle nods and rests her head on Grandmother's
          shoulder.

          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

          As Isabelle enters the village, she hears LAUGHING and
          CAROUSING. Every cottage in the village is dark. Except
          one. Isabelle gathers her nerve and turns toward it...

          INT. TAVERN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Isabelle tentatively enters. There aren't many people
          here, just Marguerite and a few ROWDY MEN making a lot of
          noise. Isabelle instantly sees what she's here for:
          Cesaire is slumped in a corner, drunk and passed out.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Isabelle steers Cesaire through the doorway and drops him
          into the bed next to Suzette. He's already half-asleep.
          Suzette gives Isabelle a silent look, then turns away.
          Isabelle sighs. She sits next to Cesaire and kisses his
          forehead. As she stands, he clumsily takes her hand.

                         CESAIRE
          You're a good girl.
          Isabelle allows a sad smile, places his hand back on his
          chest, and leaves.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          The wolf's head has been placed atop a stake. Children
          throw rocks at it. Isabelle watches with Roxanne and
          Prudence.

                         PRUDENCE
          I heard there's going to be a
          festival on the night of the next
          full moon. To celebrate.

                         ROXANNE
          A festival? I've never been to
          one!

                         PRUDENCE
          My father says he hasn't seen one
          since he was a boy.

                         ROXANNE
          It's strange, isn't it? You think
          because things have been a certain
          way your whole life that they'll
          always be the same. Then
          overnight everything just changes.
          But Isabelle is distracted. Amidst the morning bustle,
          she sees Rosemaria laughing with Peter. Roxanne notices.
          Just then, they hear HORSES approaching. A lot of them.
          Everyone stops what they're doing, listening, suddenly
          apprehensive. The girls turn toward the sound and see...
          ... A DOZEN SOLDIERS in identical armor, silver helmets
          gleaming in the sun, riding into the square atop armored
          steeds. The Villagers gape at them in awe.
          The Soldiers ride escort to a WHITE COACH with a red
          cross on it, drawn by two horses: one white, one black.
          A FIGURE rides inside, cloaked in darkness. Isabelle
          gives it an uneasy look.
          Leading the Soldiers is the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD, his
          helmet adorned with a blood-red plume. He brings the
          caravan to a halt in front of the Merchant's shop.

                         CAPTAIN
          This is Villiers la CroisÃ©e?

                         MERCHANT
          Yes, my lord.

                         CAPTAIN
          Summon your bailiff. My master
          would speak with him at once.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         CONTINUED:

                         MERCHANT
          Of course, my lord. May I ask to
          what does he owe this honor?

                         CAPTAIN
          He requested the services of His
          Eminence, the Witchfinder General.
          You may tell him that he has
          arrived.
          All eyes turn to the figure in the coach. Only a
          bejeweled hand is visible, resting on the coach's window.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY (LATER)

          A Soldier places a wooden step next to the coach and
          another opens the door. The whole village has turned
          out, but they're keeping their distance. Even Attewater,
          standing front and center, seems uneasy.
          The figure emerges from the coach. A grizzled man with
          penetrating eyes and a black beard, wearing a strange
          amalgam of priestly white robes and decidedly un-priestly
          battle armor. A broadsword hangs from his hip, the hilt
          depicting Christ on the cross. With the sword sheathed,
          the cross is upside-down. This is FATHER SOLOMON.

                         ATTEWATER
          This is indeed an honor, Your
          Eminence.
          Solomon makes no response. His eyes are on the severed
          wolf's head on display. Attewater smiles proudly.

                         ATTEWATER
          As you can see, our werewolf
          problem has been dealt with.

                         SOLOMON
          That is no werewolf.
          Surprise and outrage ripple through the crowd. Isabelle
          and Roxanne exchange a shocked look.

                         SOLOMON
          When a werewolf dies, it returns
          to its human form. If what you
          killed was a werewolf, then you
          would have a human head skewered
          atop that pole.

                         REEVE
          And I suppose you've seen this? A
          wolf turning into a man?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         CONTINUED:
          Solomon levels a look at the Reeve and slowly walks
          toward him. The Reeve is taller, but Solomon is, without
          doubt, the bigger man. The Reeve's eyes flick nervously
          to the armored Soldiers and their swords. A beat.

                         SOLOMON
          My wife's name was PÃ©nÃ©lope. She
          was very pretty. And we were very
          happy.
          The Reeve tries to keep the confusion off his face.
          Attewater and Father Auguste exchange uncertain looks.

                         SOLOMON
          We lived in a village not unlike
          this place. And not unlike this
          place, our village was plagued by
          a werewolf. I went out with some
          men to hunt it. It never even
          occurred to me that we might
          actually find it. But we did.
          He has everyone's attention now. All eyes are on him.

                         SOLOMON
          It attacked me. All I saw were
          yellow teeth. I hacked at it with
          an axe and suddenly it was gone.
          There was blood on my axe. I had
          cut off one of its paws. I picked
          it up and put it in my sack.

                         (BEAT)
          When I returned home in the
          morning, I found my wife with a
          bloody rag tied around her left
          wrist. And when I opened my sack,
          the werewolf's paw was gone. This
          is what I found in its place.
          Solomon takes an old leather sack from his belt, reaches
          inside... and pulls out a WOMAN'S MUMMIFIED HAND wearing
          a wedding ring. There are gasps from the crowd.

                         SOLOMON
          Her name was PÃ©nÃ©lope. She was
          very pretty. And we were very
          happy. Until the day I killed
          her.
          Solomon turns and gives Attewater a hard look.

                         SOLOMON
          Your werewolf is still alive. And
          I promise you, it will kill again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

          Soldiers stand at every door. Solomon and Attewater sit
          in front of the gathered Villagers. Solomon's Captain
          stands behind him. Isabelle nervously notes that the
          Captain wears a spiked flail. The black iron ball is
          shaped like a skull with spikes coming out of it.

                         SOLOMON
          I have examined the body of your
          blacksmith. There were bruises on
          his neck from where the beast held
          him in its jaws, squeezing his
          throat so that he could not
          scream.

                         CESAIRE
          But he did scream. We all heard
          him.

                         SOLOMON
          Only when it wanted you to. It
          used him as bait to lure you into
          the bit of theater it had
          prepared.

                         HENRI
          Theater? My father is not
          playacting. He is dead.

                         REEVE
          And I killed the beast that did
          it.

                         SOLOMON
          That's what it wants you to think.
          It did kill your blacksmith. But
          the animal that you killed was not
          the werewolf.

                         REEVE
          There was blood dripping from its
          teeth.

                         SOLOMON
          The blood was its own. The
          werewolf most likely wounded it
          earlier in the evening and left it
          in the cave for you to find and
          kill.

                         CESAIRE
          'Most likely,' he says. Have you
          ever heard anything more unlikely
          in your lives?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         CONTINUED:
          The Villagers laugh. Lucrece eyes them, disapproving.

                         ATTEWATER
          Your Eminence, if what you say is
          true, that we were somehow fooled
          by this thing, it could not have
          done so without foreknowledge of
          our plan to hunt it.

                         SOLOMON
          That's correct. The werewolf does
          not live in the forest as you have
          rather naÃ¯vely assumed. It lives
          here in the village. Among you.
          There is a moment of shocked silence. Then mounting
          anger. Cesaire stands up and gestures to Henri.

                         CESAIRE
          You come here and tell us that
          this boy's father died for
          nothing. You accuse us and call
          us fools. Well, I believe what I
          can see with my own eyes. That
          wolf is dead. And I know it's
          dead because I was with the brave
          men who killed it.

                         MERCHANT
          And what of the festival?

                         ATTEWATER
          The festival was to celebrate the
          death of the Wolf.

                         MERCHANT
          And we say that it's dead! We've
          spent every full moon for the past
          forty years cowering in our homes.
          We've earned a celebration.

                         REEVE
          And paid for it in blood!
          Attewater gives Solomon a nervous look. Solomon shrugs.

                         SOLOMON
          Have your festival. I will stay
          on here until then to ensure that
          you have the celebration you all
          so richly deserve.
          The Villagers seem appeased, especially the smug
          Merchant. A look passes between Solomon and his Captain.
          Isabelle catches it... and finds it unsettling.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          The moon sign displays the angry full moon, but it has
          been decorated with ribbons and mistletoe. Despite the
          cold, the mood in the village is happy and excited.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Solomon is anointing each of his Soldiers with holy water
          from a basin held by Father Auguste...

                         SOLOMON
          Gloria Patri, et Filio, et
          Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in
          principio, et nunc, et sempter, et
          in saecula saeculorum. Amen.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAY

          Isabelle wears her best dress, her hair decorated with
          ribbons. Cesaire is asleep, a flask in his hand.
          Suzette knits.

                         ISABELLE
          I'm going to the festival.

                         SUZETTE
          All right then.
          She doesn't look up from her knitting. Isabelle leaves.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Solomon kneels in prayer, lit by flickering candlelight.
          He kisses the image of Christ on the hilt of his sword...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          The festival is in full swing. A bonfire ROARS. The
          Villagers sing and drink. A MAN in a wolf costume jumps
          out and startles the women and children. The children
          chase him with sticks and he comically runs away.
          Isabelle watches their antics with Roxanne and Prudence.
          Claude is laughing and chasing the man in the wolf
          costume, but an OLDER BOY purposefully trips him.
          Another BOY steals his cap and teases him. Marguerite is
          too busy carousing to notice. Roxanne frowns.

                         ROXANNE
          I'm sorry...

                         CONTINUED:
          She hurries to help Claude. Isabelle and Prudence watch.

                         PRUDENCE
          She acts more like a mother to him
          than a sister.

                         ISABELLE
          Someone has to look after him.

                         PRUDENCE
          I know. But who looks after her?
          Isabelle gives Roxanne a sad look.

          EXT. CHURCH - BELLTOWER - DUSK

          The Captain of Solomon's guard stands watch. The sounds
          of the FESTIVAL can be heard in the distance...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK

          Men play MUSIC and couples dance. Roxanne dances with
          Claude, Prudence with an OLDER BOY... but Isabelle sits
          alone, watching Peter dance with Rosemaria.
          Just then, Henri stumbles toward Isabelle with a beer,
          clearly the latest of many. He follows her look and sees
          that she's watching Peter. Henri glares at him...
          ... then abruptly pushes his way toward Peter and grabs
          him roughly by the shoulder, spinning him around. Peter
          is surprised, but ready to laugh it off.

                         PETER
          Take it easy, friend.

                         HENRI
          You didn't come with us. The
          night my father died.
          Peter's smile fades. Isabelle rushes to pull Henri away.

                         HENRI
          You stayed here and let real men
          do the work you didn't have the
          belly for.

                         ISABELLE
          Please, don't do this --
          Henri brushes her aside, but too hard and she stumbles.
          Peter instantly grabs hold of Henri's wrist. Henri

          48.

                         CONTINUED:
          overreacts and punches Peter in the eye. Peter falls on
          his ass, but the Villagers just laugh.
          Peter slowly stands, staring Henri down. He could easily
          lay Henri out... but decides against it. He leaves.
          Rosemaria reaches out to him, but he ignores her.
          Isabelle shoots Henri a look of contempt, then hurries
          off after Peter. Henri watches her go, ashamed.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - DUSK

          Peter storms off. Isabelle runs after him.

                         ISABELLE
          Peter! Wait!

                         PETER
          Why? So you can hit me, too?

                         ISABELLE
          I just want to make sure you're
          all right.
          Peter stops. He whirls on Isabelle, incredulous.

                         PETER
          Why can't you just leave me alone?

                         ISABELLE
          You're bleeding.

                         PETER
          So what? What's the matter with
          you? What do I have to do to make
          you stop caring about me?
          Isabelle is taken aback. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          You think I want to feel like
          this? You think I enjoy feeling
          like a fool every day because I
          can't stop loving you?
          Peter's bravado falters. He can't completely hide what
          her words do to him. She looks up at him, realizing...

                         ISABELLE
          Why are you with Rosemaria? You
          hate Rosemaria.

                         PETER
          I don't have to like her to get
          what I want from her.

                         ISABELLE
          You're a terrible liar.
          Isabelle takes a step closer and presses the palm of her
          hand against his chest. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          There. You're heart is starting
          to beat faster. And the little
          black circles in the middle of
          your eyes still get bigger when I
          touch you.
          She gazes up at him. He tries not to look in her eyes,
          but can't stop himself.

                         ISABELLE
          You can tell me you don't love me,
          but I know what you're really
          feeling. I can feel it with my
          hand and see it with my eyes.
          Peter hesitates, then covers her hand with his own.

                         PETER
          I thought being with Rosemaria
          would be the one thing you would
          never be able to forgive. I
          wanted you to hate me.
          (off her look)
          Isabelle, you are the best thing
          that could ever happen to me. And
          I am the worst thing that could
          ever happen to you.

                         ISABELLE
          How could you think that?

                         PETER
          I wasn't born here. You and I
          both know what that means. I will
          always be a stranger to these
          people. Your parents will never
          let us be together.

                         ISABELLE
          That means less to me now than
          ever. We can leave here. We can
          go someplace where we'll both be
          strangers.

                         PETER
          I can't let you do that. You have
          something here that I will never
          have. You have a place. You have

          a family. With Henri you have a
          future. I'm not going to let you
          ruin that over me.

                         ISABELLE
          The only life I want is with you.

                         PETER
          Isabelle... I'm wrong for you.

                         ISABELLE
          I know you are. I just don't
          care.
          She kisses him on the mouth, then quickly steps back, as
          if she did it before she could change her mind. Then he
          takes her in his arms and they kiss, long and hard.

          INT. BARN - DUSK

          A door opens and Peter and Isabelle enter, still kissing.
          He closes the door, pushes her against it with his body.
          He lowers her to pile of straw in an empty stall. She
          looks up at him, surprised, then pulls him tightly to
          her, kissing him hard. She grabs his hand and guides it
          to her breast. Now Peter looks surprised. He hesitates.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't want to wait.

                         PETER
          But not like this.

                         (A BEAT)
          I want to marry you.
          She searches his face and sees that he's serious.

                         PETER
          I can pack the cart tonight and we
          can leave in the morning.
          (off her look)
          Is that too soon?

                         ISABELLE
          It's not soon enough.
          She pulls him to her and kisses him.

          EXT. BARN - DUSK

          Peter looks outside. The coast is clear. He and
          Isabelle slip out and close the door behind them.

          You'd better get back before
          someone misses you.
          She gives him a lingering kiss. When she pulls away from
          him, he sees that she's crying.

                         PETER
          What's wrong?

                         ISABELLE
          This feels like a dream. I'm
          afraid if I leave you I might wake
          up.
          He kisses her and holds her tight. Neither of them
          notice Henri, angrily watching from the shadows...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - NIGHT

          Isabelle returns to the festival. She sits next to
          Roxanne, who notices a piece of straw in Isabelle's hair.
          Isabelle quickly brushes it away, embarrassed.
          Isabelle's eyes go to the sky. The sun has finally set.
          The moon has risen, silver and full. Isabelle gazes up
          at it, transfixed. Roxanne looks over at her, curious.

                         ISABELLE
          I've never seen it full before...
          Suddenly -- the CHURCH BELLS start to ring. Everyone
          falls silent. Confused looks all around. Then,
          somewhere in the dark...
          ... a WOLF HOWLS. The Villagers gasp. A WOMAN screams.
          People start to panic. Claude is knocked down.

                         ROXANNE
          Claude!
          Then something massive pushes its way through the surging
          crowd, bursting from the darkness...
          It's THE WOLF. The Villagers gape in horror. It makes
          the wolf that they killed look like a chihuahua. But
          there's something about its face that isn't canine at
          all, but ghoulishly human as it HOWLS at the moon.
          Suddenly, a group of Villagers throw off their cloaks,
          revealing themselves to be Solomon's armored Soldiers.
          Each of them draws a gleaming sword and points it at the
          Wolf. They've been lying in wait and now they have it
          surrounded. The Wolf SNARLS at them.

          52.

                         CONTINUED:
          A moment later, Father Solomon gallops into the square on
          his armored steed, wearing a helmet adorned with a golden
          eagle. He tugs the reins and his horse rears back.

                         SOLOMON
          Get to the church, you fools!
          The Wolf SNARLS up at him. Solomon gives a battle cry:

                         SOLOMON

          DIE, BEAST! AND LONG LIVE GOD'S

          HOLY LOVE!
          The Wolf ROARS. Solomon and his men charge toward it.
          The Villagers caught between them trample one another to
          get away. A MAN gets knocked into the bonfire. Flaming
          logs fall off the pyre and set a cottage ABLAZE.
          The Wolf swipes Solomon's Soldiers aside like rag dolls.
          They bravely press the attack, but they're no match for
          the beast. It swats one of them right through the wall
          of a nearby cottage. The ambush has backfired.
          The Carpenter sees Claude on the ground and picks him up,
          trying to help. Claude fights and screams, but the
          Carpenter carries him away. Roxanne starts toward him --
          -- and is bowled over by Solomon's horse. Solomon grabs
          the stake with the wolf's head atop it and charges at the
          Wolf, wielding the stake like a lance. The Wolf catches
          the stake in its jaws, throwing Solomon off his horse.
          Just as the Wolf is about to pounce on him, but more
          Soldiers join the fight. The Wolf sees them coming. It
          attacks Solomon's horse, biting its neck and dragging it
          to the ground. As the Soldiers close in --
          -- the Wolf spins around, hurling the injured horse at
          them, knocking them down like bowling pins. Another
          Soldier tries to attack the Wolf from behind, but it
          smacks him aside with its tail and then smashes him to
          the ground with one enormous paw.
          Isabelle hurriedly helps Roxanne to her feet and drags
          her away from the ongoing battle.

                         ROXANNE
          Where's Claude? Where is he?!

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          The Carpenter runs away with Claude in his arms, but
          Claude bites his hand and wriggles free. Claude falls to
          the ground and dashes back toward the square.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Roxanne runs through town like a rat in a maze, jostled
          by the fleeing Villagers. Isabelle races after her.

                         ROXANNE
          Claude! Claude!
          Roxanne spots Rosemaria and grabs her, begging for help.

                         ROXANNE
          Have you seen my brother? Please!
          But Rosemaria just pushes her aside, panicked. An
          instant later -- the Wolf appears out of nowhere, jumping
          on Rosemaria. She screams, then -- CRUNCH. The screams
          stop. Isabelle and Roxanne gape in horror, then run.

          EXT. CHURCH - BELLTOWER - NIGHT

          The Captain RINGS the church bell. People are fleeing
          the village and running toward the church.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          The few Villagers left hurry into their homes and bolt
          the doors behind them. TWO SOLDIERS search the nearly
          empty streets for the Wolf, swords drawn.
          Soldier #1 looks down... and sees bloody paw prints in
          the snow. He points them out to Solider #2. They follow
          the tracks to a corner, carefully peer around it...
          The Wolf is about ten feet away, loudly tearing meat from
          Rosemaria's body. Soldier #1 gestures for his companion
          to approach from the other side. They split up.
          Soldier #1 peers out at the Wolf... but it's gone. The
          street is empty. Only Rosemaria's body lying in the
          bloodstained snow. He ducks back around the corner...
          ... and we see that the Wolf is now right behind him.
          Meanwhile, Soldier #2 is stealthily making his way into
          position... when he suddenly hears Soldier #1 SCREAMING.
          Soldier #2 quickly ducks inside a nearby cottage...

          INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT

          ... and peers out the window. He sees Soldier #1
          painfully crawling through the snow, clutching a mangled
          and bloody wound on his shoulder.

          Soldier #2 ducks back from the window. No way. He's not
          going out there. Then: SNIFF. SNIFF.
          There's a shadow visible under the crack of the cottage
          door. And a big black snout pressed up against it,
          SNIFFING out its prey. Soldier #2 readies his sword...
          ... but then the Wolf moves away. A long beat. The
          Soldier edges toward the door. The shadow does not
          return. He slowly reaches out a hand to open the door...
          Suddenly, the door is blasted off its hinges and the Wolf
          bursts inside. It stands on top of the door, pinning the
          Soldier beneath it. The Soldier tries to raise his
          sword, but can't. The Wolf SNARLS down at him, drooling.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          The Wolf is dragging Soldier #2's body out of the cottage
          by the ankles when its ears suddenly prick up. It's
          heard something. It's being watched. It looks up...
          ... and sees Claude standing at the end of the street,
          paralyzed with fear. The Wolf GROWLS, blood dripping
          from its chin. Claude runs. The Wolf leaps after him.
          Claude turns a corner, looks back, sees the Wolf headed
          right for him. Claude ducks into an alley and the Wolf
          follows him...

          EXT./INT. BARN - NIGHT

          ... only to find Claude has disappeared. The Wolf
          follows Claude's tracks in the snow to the door of a barn
          and peers inside. The barn appears to be empty...
          ... but Claude is hiding in a hayloft. The Wolf SNIFFS
          the air. Pushes the door open with its nose and pads
          inside. Looks around. Claude shivers. But just then:

          ROXANNE (O.S.)
          Claude! Claude!!
          The Wolf cocks its ears toward the voice, listening...

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Isabelle and Roxanne are the last stragglers, Roxanne
          looking for Claude, Isabelle trying to stop her.

          55.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ROXANNE
          Claude! Where are you?!
          Isabelle drags her to the ground and covers her mouth.

                         ISABELLE
          You have to stop it. He can't
          hear you and you are going to get
          us killed. Do you understand me?
          Roxanne nods, crying. Isabelle helps her up -- and finds
          herself face-to-face with the Wolf. Roxanne screams.
          They run back the way they came, turn another corner --

          EXT. VILLAGE - ALLEY - NIGHT

          -- but the narrow alley is blocked by a high stone wall.

                         ISABELLE
          Come on!
          Isabelle climbs the wall, but Roxanne's not going to make
          it. Isabelle jumps down to help her...
          ... just as the Wolf's shadow falls over the alley. The
          girls watch helplessly as the Wolf slowly walks toward
          them, SNARLING and glaring at them with its strange, near-
          human eyes. Then, inexplicably... the Wolf speaks.

                         THE WOLF
          Well, well. You look very pretty
          this evening, my dear. Good
          enough to eat.
          The Wolf's voice is sonorous, seductive. The Devil's
          voice. Isabelle stammers, unable to believe her senses.

                         THE WOLF
          It's considered polite to thank
          someone when they pay you a
          compliment. Are you being
          impolite, Isabelle?

                         ISABELLE
          How do you know me? Who are you?

                         ROXANNE
          Isabelle...?
          The Wolf GROWLS, cutting her off, and turns back to
          Isabelle. It moves closer. Isabelle looks into its
          eyes. They suddenly seem very big and deep, almost
          hypnotizing. She seems to fall into them...

          56.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          What big eyes you have...

                         THE WOLF
          The better to see you with, my
          dear.

                         ISABELLE
          Are you going to kill us?

                         THE WOLF
          Kill you? Why would I kill you?

                         ISABELLE
          Then what do you want?

                         THE WOLF
          I want you, Isabelle.
          Isabelle gapes, dumbstruck and dismayed.

                         THE WOLF
          We are the same, you and I. We
          are both wild things. You show
          one face to the world, but there
          is another face that you hide. A
          fire burning inside you, waiting
          to be released.
          The Wolf sniffs her, starting at her feet and working its
          way up. It SNARLS with satisfaction, savoring her scent.

                         THE WOLF
          Yes. I can smell it on you even
          now.
          Suddenly, the Wolf jumps onto its hind legs, puts its
          forepaws on the wall on either side of Isabelle, its
          muzzle only inches from her face. She recoils.

                         THE WOLF
          Leave with me tonight. Run with
          me. The only shackles binding you
          are of your own making. Slip them
          and I can show you the world and
          every pleasure in it.
          Isabelle hesitates, then finds the strength to speak:

                         ISABELLE
          I don't know who you are, but we
          are not the same. I would rather
          die than go with you.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

                         THE WOLF
          What about your fat friend here?
          Do you think she would rather die?
          (off Isabelle's look)
          Come away with me. Or I will kill
          her. And I will keep killing
          until you agree to leave with me.
          Suddenly, the sound of MEN SHOUTING. The Wolf leans in,
          SNARLING. Isabelle turns away from its foul breath.

                         THE WOLF
          Choose now. Quickly.
          Isabelle trembles. She looks down at Roxanne's terrified
          face, torn. Isabelle closes her eyes. She can't do it.

                         THE WOLF
          Your silence has doomed them all.
          Just then, Solomon and two Soldiers turn the corner. The
          Wolf leaps atop the wall and growls down at Isabelle:

                         THE WOLF
          Come the next full moon, their
          blood will be on your hands.
          Then it jumps over the wall. Solomon scrabbles up after
          it, but the Wolf is already too far away. It looks back
          at him. A silent challenge passes between them. And
          then the Wolf is gone.

          INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

          Solomon and his Soldiers bring Isabelle and Roxanne
          inside. A crowd of panicked Villagers swarms to Solomon.

                         SOLOMON
          We are safe here. God protects
          his own house and those within it.
          Isabelle finds Prudence.

                         ISABELLE
          Is Peter here?

                         PRUDENCE
          Peter? I don't think so.

                         ISABELLE
          What about Claude? Or my parents?

                         PRUDENCE
          I haven't seen any of them.

          58.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          Would you look for them? Please?
          Prudence nods and rushes off. Roxanne slumps in a
          corner, a dazed look on her face. A beat.

                         ROXANNE
          You talked to it.

                         ISABELLE
          It talked to us.
          A chill runs down Roxanne's spine. A long beat.

                         ROXANNE
          No. It only growled.
          (off Isabelle's look)
          You heard it talk to you?
          Isabelle doesn't know what to say. She glances around to
          see if anyone has overheard. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          Do not speak of this to anyone.
          Roxanne nods, but eyes Isabelle warily. Isabelle turns
          away, afraid and confused.

          EXT. CHURCH - DAWN

          Silence. The door CREAKS open and the Merchant peers
          out. A blanket of new snow covers the village. It's as
          if the massacre of the night before never happened.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAWN

          Isabelle hurries inside. Embers burn in the fire pit. A
          chair has been overturned. The room is empty.

                         ISABELLE
          Mother! Father!

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAWN

          Isabelle bursts in to find Suzette lying in bed and
          Cesaire leaning over her, crying. Isabelle stops short.

                         ISABELLE
          Is she dead?

                         CESAIRE
          No, thank God.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         CONTINUED:
          He sits up, revealing Suzette's face, which has been
          horribly slashed from scalp to chin. Isabelle recoils.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

          The Villagers slowly gather. Dead bodies litter the
          snow. Roxanne clutches Prudence's arm. Henri joins
          them. Father Auguste crouches next to Soldier #1.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          This man is alive!

                         (TO HENRI)
          Bring me water! Hurry!
          Henri nods and quickly turns -- but is stopped cold by
          Solomon's iron grip on his arm. Solomon and his Captain
          go to Soldier #1. Solomon kneels at his side.

                         SOLOMON
          Are you bitten?
          Shivering, the Soldier nods. The Captain closes his
          eyes. Solomon stands and turns to Father Auguste.

                         SOLOMON
          Step back.
          Confused, Father Auguste does as he's told. Then, before
          anyone can react, Solomon draws his sword and plunges it
          into the Soldier's heart. Everyone startles.

                         SOLOMON
          The werewolf's bite is the same as
          death to a man.
          Stunned silence. Solomon turns to the Villagers.

                         SOLOMON
          The dark days have returned to
          your village. Your homes are no
          longer safe. The Wolf will
          return. Again and again. And it
          will not stop until it has sucked
          the marrow from all your bones.
          Unless you stop it.

                         (BEAT)
          But to kill a monster, you must
          become one yourself. A wolf
          caught in a trap will chew off its
          own leg to save itself. Will you
          do the same? What sacrifice will
          you make to save your families and
          your way of life? Will you do
          whatever it takes? Or will you

          cower in your beds and die like
          sheep?
          A long beat. The Villagers shiver and not just from the
          cold. But no one speaks. Solomon turns to Attewater.

                         SOLOMON
          It appears my expertise is not as
          appreciated as I was led to
          believe.
          He turns to leave. Suddenly, Attewater steps forward.

                         ATTEWATER
          Wait!
          Attewater drops to one knee. Solomon stops and gives him
          an appraising look. Then Solomon turns to the Villagers.
          After a moment, the Reeve drops to his knee. One by one,
          the Villagers kneel to Solomon. Henri and Father Auguste
          are among the last, but they reluctantly kneel as well.

                         ATTEWATER
          We will do what must be done.
          A beat. Then Solomon offers his hand. Attewater kisses
          Solomon's ring. Henri and Roxanne exchange uneasy looks.

          INT. PETER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          There's an urgent knock at the door. Peter quickly opens
          it. It's Isabelle. He ushers her inside. As soon as
          the door is shut, he takes her in his arms. She gives
          him a concerned look. He looks tired, drawn and pale.

                         PETER
          I was up all night worrying about
          you. Thank God you're safe.
          But something about her expression gives him pause. She
          looks up at him, struggling with what she has to say.

                         ISABELLE
          Peter... My mother's hurt. I
          can't leave. Not now.

                         PETER
          I thought you didn't want to wait.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't have any choice. It's not
          just my mother. Something else
          happened last night.

                         ISABELLE (CONT'D)
          I can't tell you about it. I just
          have to stay.
          Peter nods, but his face darkens. A long, tense beat.

                         ISABELLE
          I meant everything I said. This
          isn't what I wanted.

                         PETER
          Of course not. You'd better go
          home and see to your mother.
          She gives him a sad nod, then turns to go. She pauses at
          the door, but he doesn't look at her. She leaves.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

          Solomon places his silver sword on the table in front of
          Attewater and Father Auguste.

                         SOLOMON
          Silver. This is our most potent
          weapon. One blow will kill it.

                         (BEAT)
          That sword has tasted the blood of
          many such creatures. But never
          one as powerful as this.

                         ATTEWATER
          If it's that powerful, how can we
          possibly hope to stop it?

                         SOLOMON
          We must find it in its human form.
          Who among you do you suspect?
          Attewater and Father Auguste trade uncomfortable looks.
          Neither of them wants to speak up first.

                         SOLOMON
          It has not survived this long by
          being obvious. The signs will be
          subtle. Insomnia. Restlessness.
          Strange behavior. Strange smells.
          (off their looks)
          Well, none of them smell good, but
          we must start somewhere.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          What about the hair Madame
          Ordeville found on Lucie's body?
          It was dark. The person we are
          looking for must have dark hair.

          Perhaps. Unless it planted the
          hair to make us think that.

                         ATTEWATER
          Yes, it's trying to trick us
          again. This has been happening
          for forty years. It must be an
          old man by now. The hair should
          have been gray.

                         SOLOMON
          Not necessarily. It may be the
          child or grandchild of the
          werewolf that first struck here.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          The curse is hereditary?

                         SOLOMON
          It is. But it effects men and
          women differently. A man can
          inherit the curse. Or he can be
          turned simply by being bitten.
          Solomon turns toward the fire and stares into it.

                         SOLOMON
          But women are immune to the
          werewolf's bite. In order for a
          woman to be turned, she must
          inherit the curse. But even then
          it will lie dormant unless she
          eats human flesh. Only then will
          the bite of a male werewolf change
          her. Only then can she become a
          werewolf and capable of passing
          the curse on to her own children.

                         ATTEWATER
          But it could be a woman.

                         SOLOMON
          Of course. It could be any one of
          you.
          Attewater and Father Auguste exchange a wary look.

          EXT. VILLAGE - CROSSROADS - DAWN

          The mood of the village is grim. Isabelle meets Roxanne
          at the crossroads. Roxanne eyes her warily. A beat.

          63.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          Has Claude come home?

                         ROXANNE
          No. Nobody has seen him.

                         ISABELLE
          He's run away before. He'll be
          all right.
          Roxanne nods, unconvinced. Prudence joins them. They
          all exchange a sad look.

                         PRUDENCE
          Well. I suppose this is all of
          us.
          The three of them turn and start toward the woods...

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle and Grandmother sit by the fire.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          It talked to you. And you
          understood it?

                         ISABELLE
          As clearly as I do you now.
          Grandmother fixes her with a serious look. A beat.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Word of this cannot be allowed to
          spread. Do you understand me?

                         ISABELLE
          Roxanne will never speak of it.
          She won't even talk to me about
          it.
          A long beat. Isabelle is working up her nerve. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          I have to do what it wants.
          (off her look)
          I have communed with an unholy
          beast. What does that make me if
          not cursed?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I don't know. But I won't allow
          you to go with this devil and live
          as its concubine.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          But if it comes back for me and I
          don't go with it, then it will
          kill again. If I have the power
          to save even one life, aren't I
          compelled to do so?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          This is why it chose you. You're
          a good girl with a gentle heart.
          It's using that against you.

                         ISABELLE
          But how could it? Unless it
          really does know me?
          Isabelle and Grandmother exchange an anxious look...

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          Isabelle is walking home through the snow. Henri is
          waiting for her. A beat. Then:

                         HENRI
          I spoke with your father. I broke
          off our engagement.
          (off her look)
          I saw you with Peter. Don't
          worry, I didn't tell anyone.
          Isabelle can't hide her shock. She shifts anxiously.

                         ISABELLE
          What about my family's debt?

                         HENRI
          I have no interest in ruining your
          family. I will have you out of
          love or not at all.
          Isabelle is dumbfounded. Henri turns and walks away...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

          Isabelle is cooking, lost in thought. Suddenly, there's
          a KNOCK at the door. Isabelle opens it. It's Prudence.

                         PRUDENCE
          They've caught the werewolf!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Prudence leads Isabelle and Cesaire through the village.
          There are SHOUTING VOICES up ahead.

                         PRUDENCE
          He's been hiding in a hayloft.
          They caught him trying to steal
          food.

                         ISABELLE
          But who is it?
          An angry crowd has gathered. Solomon's Soldiers are all
          that's stopping it from turning into a lynch mob.
          Isabelle finds Roxanne in tears, trying to force her way
          through the crowd.

                         ISABELLE
          What's wrong? What's happening?
          Roxanne doesn't answer, just plunges into the crowd.
          Isabelle goes in after her. Cesaire tries to stop her.

                         CESAIRE
          Isabelle! Get away from there!
          She follows Roxanne to the front of the crowd, just as
          two Soldiers haul a figure out of a barn -- it's Claude.

                         ROXANNE
          Claude!!

                         ISABELLE
          It's not him! It can't be!

                         LUCRECE
          If he's not the werewolf, then why
          was he hiding? What's he afraid
          of?
          The Soldiers carry Claude off and Roxanne stumbles after
          them. Isabelle tries to follow, but Cesaire stops her.
          She can only watch helplessly as Claude is dragged away.

          EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DAY

          Villagers are gathering. The whole town must be here.
          As Attewater approaches the entrance:

          GRANDMOTHER (O.S.)
          Salus populi suprema est lex.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         CONTINUED:
          He turns and sees Grandmother walking toward him. She
          nods to the inscription above the entrance. 'SALUS

          POPULI SUPREMA EST LEX.'

                         GRANDMOTHER
          The good of the people is the
          chief law.

                         ATTEWATER
          You read Latin.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          And write. I was studying to be a
          nun when I met my husband.

                         ATTEWATER
          He must have been some man.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          He was a priest.
          She grins. Is she being serious? Attewater bristles.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You know the boy is innocent.
          He's being tried because he's
          different. Because Father Solomon
          knows he can turn us against him.

                         ATTEWATER
          Father Solomon is here to protect
          us.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          A wolf hunting sheep picks off the
          weakest ones first.
          (off his look)
          This is just the beginning.
          She enters the manor hall. Attewater watches her go.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY

          The room is crammed with Villagers. Isabelle sits with
          Cesaire and Grandmother. Attewater sits behind the
          table. Claude is shackled and guarded by Soldiers. He
          looks afraid, confused. Solomon questions Lucrece. A
          SCRIBE records the proceedings.

                         SOLOMON
          You say you saw the accused
          perform magic?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         CONTINUED:

                         LUCRECE
          In broad daylight with my own
          eyes. Everyone here has seen it.

                         SOLOMON
          So it was common knowledge that
          the accused was a conjurer?

                         LUCRECE
          Yes, Your Eminence. I saw it for
          the Devil's work, but they laughed
          at me and paid him money.
          Isabelle and Grandmother exchange a concerned look.
          Through a SERIES OF CUTS, more witnesses are questioned:

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          shifts uncomfortably as Solomon interrogates him...

                         SOLOMON
          Are you aware that it is the
          custom of witches and devil
          worshippers to hold their black
          sabbaths in cemeteries?

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          Yes, Your Eminence.

                         SOLOMON
          And do you know of their practice
          of dancing with invisible devils
          during these rituals?

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          I have heard it said so, yes.

                         SOLOMON
          Is there one here today who you
          have seen dancing in your
          cemetery?

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          (hesitant; a beat)
          Yes. But I don't believe he meant
          anything by it. It was in jest.

                         SOLOMON
          So you consider the black mass to
          be a jest?
          There are suspicious WHISPERS among the Villagers.
          Father Auguste eyes them nervously. A beat.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         CONTINUED:

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          No, of course not.

                         SOLOMON
          Then point him out.
          Father Auguste reluctantly points to Claude.

                         MARGUERITE
          Roxanne weeps as her mother testifies against Claude.

                         SOLOMON
          What is your relationship to the
          accused?

                         MARGUERITE
          I am his mother.

                         SOLOMON
          And where is his father?

                         MARGUERITE
          I don't know, sir.

                         SOLOMON
          Well, what is his name?
          She pauses. The crowd eyes her, disapproving. A beat.

                         MARGUERITE
          I never learned his name, sir.

                         SOLOMON
          You say a man whose name you
          cannot recall is the father of
          your child? What can you tell us
          about him?

                         MARGUERITE
          Not much, sir.
          She lowers her eyes, ashamed. Solomon considers her.

                         SOLOMON
          Almost as if it were a dream?
          (off her look)
          Certain devils called incubi can
          collect human semen and then
          transfer it to women as they
          sleep. A woman who unwittingly
          conceives in this manner would not
          be a whore. She would be
          blameless in the eyes of God.

          69.

                         CONTINUED:
          Marguerite's eyes spark, suddenly hopeful...

                         SOLOMON
          You remember almost nothing of the
          man who impregnated you. Is it
          not possible that there was no
          man? That the accused is not the
          product of your own sin, but the
          foul offspring of a werewolf whose
          semen was placed in you by an
          incubus while you slept?

                         MARGUERITE
          Yes! Yes, I remember now! He
          came to me in my sleep! It wasn't
          my fault! God save me, it wasn't
          my fault!
          Roxanne buries her face in her hands.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY (LATER)

          Solomon addresses the gathered Villagers.

                         SOLOMON
          We have proven here today that
          behind this veil of feigned idiocy
          is the fiend that has plagued your
          village. However, in order for
          the sentence of death to be
          carried out, the Church requires
          either a confession or the
          testimony of a witness who has
          seen the accused in his
          transformed state. Since the
          accused has refused to confess,
          this court calls upon its final
          witness. Isabelle Ordeville.
          Isabelle is stunned. All eyes turn toward her.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY (TIMECUT)

          Isabelle stands before Solomon. Claude waves. She
          ignores him.

                         SOLOMON
          On the night of the last full
          moon, you were attacked by the
          Wolf. You looked it in the eye.
          And the one thing a werewolf can
          never change is its eyes.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         CONTINUED:
          He gestures to the Soldiers. They grab Claude and force
          him to look at her.

                         SOLOMON
          Look into his eyes, my child. Do
          you see the beast in them?
          Isabelle gives Claude a pitying look. Solomon watches,
          expectant. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          It isn't him. It can't be. He
          was with us when the Wolf
          attacked.
          Solomon is taken aback. Surprised MURMURS in the room.

                         SOLOMON
          Is this true? Is there another
          here who can speak to this?

                         ROXANNE
          I can! It's true! I saw him!

                         LUCRECE
          She's his sister! She'll say
          anything!
          The suspicious Villagers agree. Roxanne gives Isabelle a
          desperate look. Then Isabelle spots the Carpenter.

                         ISABELLE
          He was there! He carried Claude
          away! He saved his life!
          Suddenly, all eyes are on the Carpenter. He shrinks
          back. He glances at his WIFE. She stares at him. Hard.

                         CARPENTER
          She is mistaken. I did no such
          thing.
          Isabelle is shocked. She looks to the other Villagers,
          but no one will speak up. Solomon frowns.

                         SOLOMON
          Very well. Since no one here can
          bear witness, we must extort a
          confession. This court shall
          reconvene tomorrow at dawn.
          Solomon leaves. Claude is dragged out of the room by
          Soldiers. Isabelle gives Grandmother a helpless look.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DUSK

          Isabelle and Grandmother sit at the table. Cesaire is in
          the other room feeding Suzette.

                         ISABELLE
          Why wouldn't Father Solomon listen
          to me? Doesn't he care that
          Claude isn't guilty?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          He'd rather let an innocent boy
          die than risk letting the Wolf go
          free.

                         ISABELLE
          But the Wolf is free. And the
          moon will be full in two days.
          The full weight of this hits home. Grandmother leans
          close, lowers her voice.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          We both know it will be coming for
          you. You must leave here tomorrow
          and never return.
          A long beat. Isabelle reluctantly shakes her head.

                         ISABELLE
          I cannot leave.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You have no choice. The
          alternative is unthinkable.

                         ISABELLE
          What is unthinkable is that I
          should be responsible for the
          deaths of everyone that I love.
          I'd rather spend a lifetime of
          misery than let that happen.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          The Wolf's sins are on its own
          twice-damned soul, not yours.

                         ISABELLE
          But what if it was you it wanted?
          Would you go with it to save me?
          Or would you leave me to die?
          Grandmother doesn't have a fast answer for that.
          Suddenly, a HIDEOUS, INARTICULATE SCREAM echoes in the
          night. Isabelle and Grandmother exchange a grave look.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Grandmother and Isabelle step outside, followed by
          Cesaire. The SCREAMING can be heard more clearly.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Father Solomon. Extorting his
          confession.
          Claude's screams sending chills down their spines.

                         CESAIRE
          You should have condemned him
          today. At least it would have
          been quick.
          Cesaire turns and goes back inside. Isabelle and
          Grandmother continue to listen.

          INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Roxanne weeps with her hands clamped around her ears,
          trying to block out the SCREAMING. Her mother sits by
          the fire as if nothing unusual is going on.

                         ROXANNE
          How can you just sit there and
          listen to this?
          Marguerite ignores her. Furious, Roxanne stands up and
          grabs Marguerite's coin purse.

                         MARGUERITE
          Where are you going with that?
          Roxanne doesn't answer, just pulls on her cloak.
          Marguerite grabs her, but Roxanne turns and shoves her to
          the ground. Marguerite starts to get up, but Roxanne
          snatches a knife from off the table and points it at her.

                         ROXANNE
          Don't you touch me again. Ever.
          Roxanne angrily throws the knife aside and leaves.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON - NIGHT

          A fire burns underneath a 'Brazen Bull,' a hollow, life-
          size bull made of brass. The fire heats the metal to
          almost red-hot. Claude's screams come from inside it.
          Solomon glowers, frustrated. Attewater looks sick.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON
          Enough of this. Let's eat.
          He gestures to the Scribe, who hands Attewater a
          document.

                         ATTEWATER
          What is this?

                         SOLOMON
          A statement declaring that you
          heard the boy confess. All it
          requires is your signature. Or
          your mark, if you cannot write.

                         ATTEWATER
          But he has not confessed. How
          could he have?
          Solomon studies Attewater. A beat. Solomon shrugs.

                         SOLOMON
          Very well. Listen more carefully
          this time.
          He gestures for the Soldiers to throw more wood on the
          fire. The FLAMES leap higher. Attewater goes pale. All
          he hears are screams. Solomon stands next to the bull.
          The flames gleam off the brass, casting him in hellfire.

                         SOLOMON
          Listen to how he sings of his love
          of Satan. How he despairs that he
          will never again copulate with the
          dead or sink his teeth into the
          flesh of pregnant women and eat
          their unborn children.
          Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look, suddenly
          realizing. Father Solomon is insane.

                         ATTEWATER
          Stop this.

                         SOLOMON
          No. You stop it.
          (off his look)
          We both know he is guilty. But I
          cannot legally execute him without
          a witness or a confession. Sign
          this and we have a confession.
          Attewater glares at Solomon, then angrily signs the
          document. Solomon gestures to his Soldiers, who open the
          bull and pull Claude out. Attewater has to look away.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Suddenly, Solomon grabs Attewater by his collar, drags
          him across the room, and forces him to look at Claude.
          Thankfully, we do not see him, except in deep f.g. His
          naked flesh is actually smoking. Attewater cringes.

                         SOLOMON
          This is the business of werewolf
          hunting and you had best develop a
          stomach for it. Because where
          there is one werewolf, there are
          two. And where there are two,
          there are more.

                         (BEAT)
          This is only the beginning.
          Solomon throws him to the floor and leaves. Attewater
          trembles helplessly as Claude is dragged out of the room.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

          Solomon is eating dinner. The Captain enters.

                         CAPTAIN
          A girl to see you.

                         SOLOMON
          Well, I've yet to come across a
          girl I wouldn't at least look at.
          The Captain ushers Roxanne inside. She meekly steps
          forward. A beat.

                         SOLOMON
          I assume you came here with a
          purpose.
          She hurriedly empties Marguerite's purse on the table in
          front of Solomon. A mere handful of coins.

                         ROXANNE
          I would like to bargain for the
          release of my brother.

                         SOLOMON
          Your brother has just confessed.

                         ROXANNE
          What? That's not possible!

                         SOLOMON
          It has been witnessed and
          notarized. He will hang in the
          morning.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         CONTINUED:
          Roxanne stands frozen, gathering her courage for what she
          is about to say. Realizing that she has no choice.

                         ROXANNE
          I have more than money to offer
          you.
          She raises a trembling hand and starts to open her
          bodice, but Solomon interrupts.

                         SOLOMON
          What do you think you are doing?
          (off her look)
          Do you have any idea who I am? I
          am the Witchfinder General. I
          have fought in the Holy Land. I
          have waded hip deep in blood and
          resisted all the temptations of
          the infidels. And you seek to
          stay the hand of justice with such
          a tawdry bribe? Leave here, girl,
          before I have you whipped.
          Solomon gestures for the Soldiers and they forcibly drag
          her away. Roxanne struggles against them.

                         ROXANNE
          Wait! I have something else! I
          know the name of a witch!
          Solomon looks up sharply. The Soldiers stop. Solomon
          crosses the room and stands glaring down at Roxanne. She
          cringes. This is the hardest decision of her life...

                         ROXANNE
          Spare my brother and I will tell
          you her name.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          SMASH! Isabelle and her parents are jolted from their
          sleep by Soldiers barging into their home. One of them
          climbs into the loft and yanks Isabelle out of bed.
          Cesaire leaps to his feet, but is viciously beaten down.
          Suzette screams. The Soldiers drag Isabelle away.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - NIGHT

          Isabelle is thrown to the floor, the door SLAMMED behind
          her. She huddles against the wall, shivering.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         CONTINUED:
          Then: A low MOAN in the dark. Isabelle startles. She
          looks up, her eyes going wide in disgust and horror...
          It's Claude. He's locked in a man-shaped cage, his body
          covered with hideous burns. He moans again. Isabelle
          chokes back her disgust and goes to him. She lightly
          takes his hand, shaken to her soul at the sight of him.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY

          The chamber is full again. Cesaire, Grandmother,
          Prudence, and Henri are here. Peter sits in the last
          row. Isabelle is in the seat of the accused. Roxanne
          stands witness. She's trying not to look at Isabelle.

                         SOLOMON
          How are you acquainted with the
          accused?

                         ROXANNE
          We were friends.

                         SOLOMON
          And how long did this friendship
          last?

                         ROXANNE
          All my life.

                         SOLOMON
          And in this time, have you ever
          known the accused to converse with
          devils?

                         ROXANNE
          Yes, Your Eminence. On the night
          of the last full moon, she talked
          to the werewolf. And later she
          told me that it also talked to
          her.
          Isabelle gives Grandmother a frightened look. Cesaire
          clenches his fist. Solomon turns to Isabelle.

                         SOLOMON
          What of this? Do you deny having
          conversed with a werewolf?
          She looks to Roxanne, who trembles with emotion. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          No. I do not deny it.
          The crowd REACTS. Solomon quiets them with a look.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON
          Describe this encounter.

                         ISABELLE
          It spoke, just as a man speaks.

                         SOLOMON
          And what was the nature of your
          conversation with it?
          Isabelle hesitates. Grandmother holds her breath.

                         ISABELLE
          It told me... It promised to
          leave here and never return. But
          only if I leave with it.
          Roxanne gives her a stunned look. A heavy silence falls
          over the room. Even Solomon is surprised. Then:

                         REEVE
          But who is it? Make her tell us
          who the werewolf is!

                         ISABELLE
          I don't know! I swear I don't
          know!

                         MERCHANT
          It doesn't matter who it is
          anymore. It wants her, not us.
          Let's just give it what it wants.
          A long, tense beat. Heavy silence. Nobody speaks.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          We should not allow ourselves to
          even consider this.

                         REEVE
          I think we already are.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          What's the matter with you? You
          know her. You all know her.

                         REEVE
          Do we? Did we know she could talk
          to werewolves?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          She could have run away. She
          could saved herself, but she
          stayed here because she cares more
          about you than she does herself.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Peter reacts. He and Isabelle exchange a look. Now he
          understands...

                         MERCHANT
          If she stayed, she did so because
          she is in league with it. Let
          this be her punishment.
          The crowd loudly AGREES. Solomon considers. Grandmother
          gives Attewater a dark look. Then:

                         SOLOMON
          Very well. Isabelle Ordeville, in
          light of your willing confession,
          it is the decision of this court
          that on the night of the next full
          moon, you be left to the mercy of
          the werewolf.
          Cesaire silently buries his face in his hands.

                         HENRI
          No!
          Henri bursts to his feet, turning heads. Isabelle is led
          away. Roxanne can only watch, helpless and ashamed.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          Lucrece has drawn a small crowd around the well.
          Prudence pauses to hear what she's saying...

                         LUCRECE
          The first victim was her sister.
          The second was her fiancÃ©e's
          father. Then Rosemaria, who
          everyone knows she hated. And
          don't forget her mother, with half
          her face missing. All this death
          around one girl...
          Prudence has heard enough. She turns away.

          EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DUSK

          Roxanne approaches. The Captain eyes her, questioning.

                         ROXANNE
          I'm here for my brother.
          He gestures. Roxanne turns... and sees Claude's body
          dangling from a makeshift gallows. He's been hanged.

          79.

                         CONTINUED:
          Roxanne falls to her knees. The rope around Claude's
          neck CREAKS as his body sways in the wind.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - NIGHT

          Isabelle stands at the barred door. Grandmother is on
          the other side. They speak in furtive whispers.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I'm not going to let these
          worthless shits sacrifice you to
          save themselves. We have to find
          the real werewolf before tomorrow
          night.

                         ISABELLE
          That's impossible. Even Father
          Solomon doesn't have the first
          clue.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Father Solomon doesn't know the
          things that I know.
          (off Isabelle's look)
          I am the oldest person in this
          village who was here when the Wolf
          first came. I remember the old
          days. And what is happening now
          is much worse.

                         ISABELLE
          What was it like in the old days?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          The Wolf never used to attack in
          the open like it did at the
          festival. It's a coward at heart.
          It would kill whole families in
          their homes, but it always stayed
          in the shadows. It never would
          have shown itself in the old days.

                         ISABELLE
          It's grown bold.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Or perhaps it made a mistake.

                         (BEAT)
          You're at the center of this. At
          least two of the victims can be
          tied to you. What if it had to
          kill so many at the festival to
          hide the fact that the first two
          killings weren't random?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         CONTINUED:
          Isabelle considers this. A beat as she realizes...

                         ISABELLE
          But who would want to kill Lucie?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Your parents said that the Wolf
          broke into the house and took
          Lucie. We both know that's not
          true. What really happened?
          Isabelle hesitates, reluctant.

                         ISABELLE
          My mother made me swear I would
          never speak of it.

                         (BEAT)
          Lucie went to the Wolf willingly.
          Grandmother reacts, horrified.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Why would you think such a thing?

                         ISABELLE
          She was in love with Henri.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          She took her own life over a boy?

                         ISABELLE
          What other explanation is there?
          Grandmother thinks. The pieces are fitting together...

          EXT. STABLE - NIGHT

          Grandmother knocks on a door. Henri answers.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Hello, Henri.

          INT. STABLE - NIGHT

          Henri is in the midst of shoeing a horse. Grandmother
          stands by the door, watching him.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You spoke up very loudly in
          Isabelle's defense today. That
          was very brave.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         HENRI
          I just said what I felt.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You're under no obligation to
          stand in her defense. You broke
          off your engagement to her.

                         HENRI
          I never stopped caring about her.
          I would do anything for Isabelle.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          As her sister would have done
          anything for you.
          (off his look)
          Lucie was in love with you. But
          you knew that, didn't you?

                         HENRI
          I had no control over the way she
          felt.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          She kept it secret from almost
          everyone. Even Isabelle didn't
          know. Did you tell anyone?

                         HENRI
          Never.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Not even your father?

                         HENRI
          I didn't have to tell him.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          So he knew your secrets, did he?
          Henri picks up a hammer and goes back to work. Angrily
          nailing a shoe to the horse's foot. BANG! BANG! BANG!

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You were the only one who could
          have lured Lucie out on the Wolf's
          night. And none of the men who
          went hunting for the Wolf remember
          seeing you after the sun set on
          the night your father died.
          Henri faces her, clutching the hammer...

                         HENRI
          Why are you doing this?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Because I want you to confess.
          You killed Lucie. And your
          father. And God only knows how
          many others. And if you won't
          admit it, then I will tell Father
          Solomon and we will lock you up
          until the moon rises tomorrow
          night and you can no longer hide
          your guilt.
          As she says this, a slow look of dawning realization
          comes over him. Realization and horror.

                         HENRI
          It's you.
          Henri steps closer to her, menacing. Grandmother steps
          back and finds herself bumping against the closed door.

                         HENRI
          My God, it's you. You're the
          Wolf. I can smell it on you now.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Smell what? What are you talking
          about?

                         HENRI
          The night my father died. I saw
          the Wolf pass by, dragging him by
          the neck. I was so terrified I
          couldn't move or make a sound. I
          remember every detail of that
          moment. The way the moonlight
          gleamed off the Wolf's coat. The
          soundless way it moved. I even
          remember the way it smelled. A
          thick, greasy, musky stink.

                         (BEAT)
          And I can smell it on you right
          now.
          A beat. They stand frozen. Glaring at one another.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You accuse me and I'll bring you
          down with me. All they can do is
          take my life. You have more to
          lose.

                         HENRI
          But who do you think they'll
          believe? I'm the blacksmith.

                         HENRI (CONT'D)
          They know me. You're the crazy
          old woman who lives in the woods.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Then I'll have to prove it.

                         HENRI
          Unless you can, you'd best keep
          your mouth shut.
          Another beat. A stand-off. Grandmother's hand finds the
          door handle. She turns it, stumbling outside --

          EXT. STABLE - NIGHT

          -- and practically runs right into Cesaire. She
          startles, gives him a surprised, flustered look.

                         CESAIRE
          Are you ready for me to take you
          home?
          She looks back. Henri stands in the doorway, still
          holding the hammer. She eyes him, measuring, suddenly
          hesitant. Cesaire gives them both an uncertain look.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Cesaire and Grandmother ride in a horse-drawn cart. The
          moon is almost full. Up ahead, Grandmother sees Prudence
          with a group of Villagers listening to Lucrece.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Stop the cart.
          Cesaire pulls the reins. Grandmother calls out:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Prudence, come with me. I have
          some blankets I want you to mend
          for Father Auguste.
          Prudence sighs and climbs up into the cart.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          The cart stops out front. Grandmother turns to Prudence.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You take these blankets to Father
          Auguste the moment you're
          finished. Understand?

          Cesaire helps Grandmother out of the cart.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Grandmother hands Cesaire a stack of knitted blankets.
          He has tears in his eyes.

                         CESAIRE
          Will you want a ride into town
          tomorrow? To say goodbye to her?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Yes. First thing in the morning.
          He nods shakily and leaves. She closes the door behind
          him and lets the faÃ§ade of calm fall from her face. She
          puts a trembling hand to her mouth, mind racing...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

          The Villagers go about their daily activities, but nobody
          speaks. The Herald hangs the full moon sign.

                         HERALD
          Full moon! Full moon! Full moon!

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAWN

          Morning sunlight glints off the frozen brook. A flock of
          CROWS are startled from their roosts and take flight.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAWN

          Grandmother sits at the table, writing a letter in Latin
          with a quill. She doesn't notice the veil that separates
          her bedchamber rippling, as if in a gentle breeze...
          Suddenly, she hears MOVEMENT. She looks up. The veil is
          still. She stands and pokes the ashes of the fire with
          her cane, her back to the veil...
          ... and changes her grip on the cane. To wield it as a
          weapon. Glancing back, she sees the veil move again...
          Suddenly, she whirls around and swings her cane at the
          veil, sweeping through it three times without hitting
          anything. A beat.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Show yourself! Coward!
          Another beat. The veil settles and is still. Then:
          A FIGURE lunges out of the veil with its arms reaching
          out at us. It grabs Grandmother's throat in one hand and
          wrestles the cane from her grip with the other.
          She struggles, but she's far too weak for her attacker.
          The Figure whips out a knife. Grandmother sees it, but
          can do nothing. The knife flashes.
          Fat drops of blood splash on the floor. Then the Figure
          drops Grandmother and she crumples, lifeless. A pool of
          blood slowly spreads out from underneath her.
          The Figure steps over the widening pool and picks up the
          letter Grandmother was writing. He quickly scans it and
          angrily tosses it in the fire...
          Then he hears something. FOOTSTEPS, crunching through
          the snow. He hurries to the window and peers out...
          It's Roxanne and Prudence. Roxanne looks like hell, but
          here for lessons as usual. The Figure ducks out of
          sight. A moment later, they're KNOCKING on the door.
          Their feet are visible under the crack.
          The Figure sidles alongside the door, BREATHING heavily.
          Another KNOCK. On the floor inside, the pool of blood is
          expanding toward the door...
          The Figure sees it. He puts a hand on the hilt of his
          knife... then whispers to the girls through the door,
          disguising his voice with a dry, old woman's rasp:

                         THE FIGURE
          Go away.
          Outside, Roxanne and Prudence exchange a curious look.

                         PRUDENCE
          Are you all right?

                         THE FIGURE
          I'm sick. You can't come in.

                         PRUDENCE
          You sound awful. Would you like
          us to make you something?

                         THE FIGURE
          No. You mustn't come in. Go
          home, now. I want to sleep.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          The blood is flowing right toward the door. In about
          thirty seconds, the girls will be standing in it.
          Outside, Prudence and Roxanne exchange a look...
          ... then turn and walk away. The Figure breathes a sigh
          of relief and takes his hand away from the knife.
          But then Roxanne stops. And looks back. The Figure
          secretly watches from the window.
          Roxanne walks back to the cottage. The blood is about to
          run under the door. The Figure grabs the door handle and
          readies the knife. Roxanne stands on the doorstep.

                         ROXANNE
          Are you sure you don't want us to
          bring you something?

                         THE FIGURE
          No, my dear. Come back tomorrow.
          The blood is seconds away from hitting her feet. The
          Figure stands poised to throw open the door... but at the
          last instant, Roxanne turns and walks away. She doesn't
          see the blood pour outside under the door behind her.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - DAY

          Isabelle has fallen asleep on the bed of straw. She's
          startled awake by the sound of her CELL DOOR opening.
          It's Father Auguste.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          I've come to hear your final
          confession.
          Isabelle nods shakily and sits up. He enters.

                         ISABELLE
          Has there been any word from my
          grandmother?

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          None that I have heard. Why?
          Isabelle doesn't answer. She turns away, troubled...

          EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DAY

          Peter anxiously waits outside, half-hidden in a copse of
          trees. A SERVANT BOY runs up to him from the house.

          She's still in the dungeon.
          They're going to move her at
          sunset.
          Peter tosses the Boy a coin. The Boy runs off. Peter
          looks at the stone house, his eyes hard and determined...

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY

          Attewater walks with Father Solomon.

                         ATTEWATER
          We've hanged the werewolf. Why
          not let the girl go free?

                         SOLOMON
          I told you, Bailiff. Where there
          is one werewolf, there are more.
          And the girl is the bait for our
          trap.
          Father Solomon strides off. Attewater watches him go...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          Villagers are already gathering. The Merchant looks up
          at the sun. It's now dipping beneath the rooftops...

          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - DAY

          Peter knocks on the door. Henri opens it. He eyes Peter
          dubiously.

                         PETER
          I need your help.
          Off Henri's look...

          INT. TAVERN HOUSE - DAY

          Attewater hurriedly enters and looks around. Nobody here
          except the BARMAN and Cesaire slumped in a chair, a jug
          of beer in his hand. Attewater goes to Cesaire.

                         ATTEWATER
          Where is your mother?

                         CESAIRE
          I don't know. I went to pick her
          up this morning and she was gone.

          88.

                         CONTINUED:
          Attewater reacts, concerned. Cesaire takes another
          drink. Attewater angrily knocks it out of his hand.

                         ATTEWATER
          Stop pouring that swill down your
          gullet listen to me!
          Cesaire emerges from his drunken fog and shoots him a
          dangerous look, but Attewater doesn't shy from it.

                         ATTEWATER
          She was trying to find the
          werewolf. If she figured out who
          it is, I need to know now.
          Suddenly, the door bursts open and the Captain enters,
          flanked by Soldiers. They drag Cesaire to his feet.

                         ATTEWATER
          Wait! What has he done?

                         CAPTAIN
          It's just a precaution. Father
          Solomon doesn't want the girl's
          family interfering.
          Suddenly, Cesaire pulls a club out of his boot and hits
          the Captain across the back, knocking him to his knees.
          Cesaire hits him again, then he's wrestled to the ground.
          The Captain kicks Cesaire in the face and knocks him out.
          The Soldiers drag him away. Attewater watches them go...

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - DAY

          Soldiers haul Cesaire's unconscious body downstairs.
          Isabelle watches as they throw him in another cell.

                         ISABELLE
          What have you done to him?!
          Then: Isabelle's cell is opened. The Captain is holding
          iron manacles. Isabelle looks at them, horrified. The
          Soldiers clap her in irons. This is really happening...

          CESAIRE (O.S.)
          Isabelle...
          He's coming to. Isabelle breaks away from the Soldiers,
          runs to his cell, and holds his hands through the bars.

                         ISABELLE
          I love you so much. Tell Mama and
          Grandmother that I love them.

                         CESAIRE
          I love you, my angel. You don't
          know how much.
          The Soldiers pull Isabelle away and lead her up the
          stairs. Cesaire shakes his cell door with impotent rage.

                         CESAIRE
          Bastards!

          EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DUSK

          Isabelle is chained to the back of Solomon's coach. The
          Captain approaches with a 'humiliation mask': an iron
          mask that locks in place over the head with only tiny
          holes to see out of. This one is shaped to look like a
          wolf's head. Isabelle goes pale at the sight of it...
          ... then the Captain puts it over her head. Inside the
          mask: almost total darkness. The Captain locks it on.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - DUSK

          Solomon's coach lurches through the snow and slush.
          Isabelle trudges along behind it. The Villagers line the
          road to watch as she is dragged stumbling through the
          streets in her horrific iron wolf mask. Lucrece sneers.

                         LUCRECE
          Not so pretty now, is she?
          The Villagers do not answer. Henri is here, silently
          fuming. Prudence stands next to him. She looks around.

                         PRUDENCE
          Where's Peter?

                         HENRI
          I haven't seen him.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK

          Solomon, Attewater, and Father Auguste stand next to the
          stocks. As a crowd of anxious Villagers watches,
          Isabelle is placed in the stocks with the mask still on.

                         SOLOMON
          We, Bailiff Attewater, Father
          Auguste, and Father Solomon of

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON (CONT'D)
          Flour, by your own confession,
          have committed acts of vulgar
          heresy, convict you of the sins of
          witches and condemn you to the
          mercy of werewolf. This is the
          sentence given.
          Solomon walks away and Attewater reluctantly follows.
          Through the holes in the mask, Isabelle sees Father
          Auguste make the sign of the cross and sadly turn away.

                         ISABELLE
          Help...
          Father Auguste stops. The Villagers shift uncomfortably
          as her helpless voice calls out from inside the mask.

                         ISABELLE
          Help me... Please... Help me...
          The Villagers start to leave, ashamed. Isabelle sees
          them going... and suddenly SCREAMS.

                         ISABELLE

          HELP ME! PLEASE! WHY WON'T

          SOMEBODY HELP ME?!
          The Villagers startle. She SCREAMS again, struggling
          against the stocks. But no one comes to her aid.

          INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DUSK

          Isabelle's SCREAMS can be heard from here. Roxanne lies
          in her bed, sobbing her heart out...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK (LATER)

          Almost everyone has left. Isabelle slumps in the stocks,
          silent and exhausted. Father Auguste sadly walks away,
          leaving only Prudence. She nervously approaches.

                         PRUDENCE
          Isabelle? Can you hear me?

                         ISABELLE
          I can hear you.

                         PRUDENCE
          Roxanne wanted you to know how
          sorry she is. She only said those
          things to save her brother.

          Of course.

                         (BEAT)
          I wanted to say... I don't know
          what to say.

                         ISABELLE
          You don't have to say anything.

                         PRUDENCE
          I want to.

                         (BEAT)
          I want you to know that you may
          have fooled Roxanne, but you don't
          fool me. Not anymore. You were
          always too good. Too pretty.
          Nobody could be as perfect as you.
          You tricked us. And now you're
          going to get what you deserve.
          A beat. Isabelle responds, surprisingly gentle:

                         ISABELLE
          I think you'd better go now.
          Prudence looks up. The sun has almost set.

                         PRUDENCE
          Yes. It won't be long now.

          ACROSS THE SQUARE
          The Captain crouches in the shadows of a nearby barn. He
          watches Prudence leave. Solomon and Attewater join him.

                         SOLOMON
          No one shoots until I give the
          order.
          Attewater glances outside and sees Soldiers armed with
          longbows hidden all around the square. The Captain draws
          an arrow from his quiver. It's tip is made of silver.

          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

          The streets are empty. The FULL MOON has risen...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Isabelle is now alone. The streets are empty. Around
          the square, Soldiers stand in tense silence, ready with
          arrows strung on their bows. Attewater shifts nervously.
          Suddenly: a long, ululating HOWL. Isabelle gasps. The
          Soldiers ready their bows. Attewater shrinks back.
          Another HOWL. Closer now. Isabelle tries to pull her
          hands out of the stocks. Then: Solomon spots something.

                         SOLOMON
          There.
          The Captain and Attewater follow his look. A BLACK SHAPE
          is stealing through the shadows toward Isabelle...

                         SOLOMON
          Hold your fire...
          Isabelle frantically tries to free herself, her wrists
          torn and bleeding, but it's no use. Then, suddenly --
          -- something SLAMS into the stocks. BANG! She can't see
          what it is. The stocks are hit again. Isabelle screams.
          Suddenly, the Shape moves into her field of view:

          HENRI (O.S.)
          Hey! Stop it! It's me!
          Isabelle's eyes go wide. The Black Shape crouches and
          looks in at Isabelle through the eyeholes. It's Henri.

                         ISABELLE
          Get away from me!

                         HENRI
          I'm not the Wolf! The moon is
          out! Look, I haven't turned!
          Isabelle realizes. He's right. It couldn't be him.

                         HENRI
          I'm trying to get you out of this.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes! Yes, please hurry!
          Solomon and his men watch as Henri uses a hammer and
          chisel to break open the stocks. BANG! BANG!

                         CAPTAIN
          He's going to free her.
          Then: another HOWL. Almost on top of them.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         SOLOMON
          Patience. It's close now...
          Henri brings the hammer down again and again and -- BANG!
          The lock is cleaved in two. Henri throws the stock open
          and helps Isabelle out of the mask. She looks like hell.

                         HENRI
          Can you stand?
          Isabelle nods. In the loft:

                         SOLOMON
          Kill him.
          Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look. The Captain
          strings an arrow and draws it back, taking aim...
          Suddenly, Attewater pushes him aside, spoiling the shot.
          The arrow whizzes by Henri's head. Attewater calls out:

                         ATTEWATER

          RUN!
          Isabelle and Henri see him -- just as Solomon plunges a
          dagger into his back. Henri drags Isabelle to her feet
          and they run away, arrows ZIPPING all around them.
          Solomon scowls as he watches them escape.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Henri leads Isabelle as they run through the village.

                         HENRI
          We have to get to the stable.
          Peter left his cart for us.

                         ISABELLE
          Peter? Where is he --?

                         HENRI
          It doesn't matter. Come on!

          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

          The Captain and his Soldiers have picked up a few
          followers. They're raising the alarm. A MOB is forming.

                         CAPTAIN
          The witch has escaped! The witch
          has escaped!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          EXT. STABLE - NIGHT

          Henri leads Isabelle around the back and helps her into a
          cart that is waiting for them and unhitches the horse.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Henri and Isabelle take off through the village in the
          cart... but then they hear a HOWL behind them.
          They look back. The Wolf emerges from the darkness,
          chasing after them. Henri whips the horse, urging it to
          go faster. They start to pull away from the Wolf, but
          then it veers off into the village and disappears.

                         HENRI
          It's gone.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't think so...
          Just then, they pass by the Reeve and a group of
          Villagers. The Villagers start to give chase, but
          Isabelle and Henri quickly leave them behind.
          Meanwhile, the Wolf is shortcutting through the village,
          racing after the cart. It comes to a sheep pen and
          smashes through it. It comes to a large barn and leaps
          onto its roof, then leaps off again --
          -- and lands within striking distance of the cart. Henri
          drives the horse, but it's no use. The Wolf lunges,
          wrestling the horse to the ground. The horse cries out,
          its body twisting as it falls, sending the cart flying.
          Isabelle falls out and lands hard. Henri lies on his
          side, clutching his wrist. Isabelle pulls herself
          together and goes to him. She looks at his arm. It's
          visibly broken. She helps him to his feet --
          -- just as the overturned cart is SMASHED apart. The
          Wolf bursts through it, breaking it to pieces. It glares
          at them with bloodthirsty eyes.
          Isabelle and Henri back away from it, but their escape is
          blocked -- the Villagers have caught up. They freeze at
          the sight of the Wolf, but stand their ground. Isabelle
          and Henri are trapped. The Reeve shouts:

                         REEVE
          Take her! Take her and leave us
          in peace!
          The Wolf SNARLS at him and turns to Isabelle.

                         CONTINUED:

                         THE WOLF
          You can't outrun me, my dear. And
          there is no place you can hide
          that I cannot smell you out.

                         (BEAT)
          So what is your decision? Will
          you take your place with me?

                         ISABELLE
          My place will never be with you.

                         THE WOLF
          Where do you belong then? Here?
          With the cowards who so gladly
          sacrificed you to save themselves?

                         ISABELLE
          They're still good people.

                         THE WOLF
          They are sheep. We are not like
          them. Let me show you what you
          are.
          The Wolf steps closer... but suddenly, Henri pushes
          Isabelle aside, pulls his hammer from his belt, and
          raises it to hit the Wolf.

                         HENRI
          Get away from her!
          The Reeve quickly grabs him. Henri struggles futilely,
          but Isabelle seizes the distraction. She snatches a
          Villager's torch and jabs it into the Wolf's side. The
          Wolf leaps back with an eerily human YELP of pain.
          Before it can react, Isabelle waves the torch at the
          Villagers, grabs Henri and they run away.
          The mob chases after them. Three Soldiers appear and
          join the mob. Figures silhouetted against the snow,
          angry faces lit by torchlight. It's like a nightmare.
          Suddenly, a cottage in front of the mob EXPLODES into
          pieces and the Wolf bursts out of it. It turns on the
          Villagers and Soldiers. It picks up a fallen roof beam
          in its powerful jaws, clenches them, trembling with rage,
          and snaps the wooden beam in half like a twig.
          The Villagers run away in fear, but the Soldiers stand
          their ground and the Wolf attacks.
          Meanwhile, Isabelle and Henri escape... but there are
          more Soldiers up ahead. Isabelle and Henri quickly hide.

                         HENRI
          I need to tell you something. In
          case I die.
          (off Isabelle's look)
          Your grandmother is the Wolf.
          Isabelle recoils in disbelief. She shakes her head.

                         ISABELLE
          The Wolf is a man. It told me.

                         HENRI
          You believe it?
          Isabelle hesitates. He has a point. Henri peers out.
          The Soldiers are closing in on them...

                         HENRI
          They're coming.

                         ISABELLE
          Follow me.
          She takes his hand and leads him away.

          EXT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle knocks at the door. Roxanne answers. She gives
          Isabelle a stunned look.

                         ISABELLE
          We need to come inside. Quickly.

          INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle and Henri enter. Roxanne shuts the door.
          Marguerite gasps when she sees Isabelle.

                         MARGUERITE
          Have you lost your mind? If they
          find her here, they'll kill us,
          too!

                         ROXANNE
          Then shut up so they don't find
          her.

                         HENRI
          We have to get out of town.

                         ROXANNE
          You'll never make it. You can
          hide here until morning.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          They're searching everywhere. We
          have to keep moving.

                         ROXANNE
          You might make it to the church.
          Even the king cannot violate the
          protection of sanctuary.

                         HENRI
          And the Wolf cannot cross onto
          holy ground.
          The three exchange a look. Sounds like a plan.

                         ISABELLE
          Can we go out your back window?
          Roxanne nods. They hurry toward the window, but then:

                         ROXANNE
          Wait! I have an idea.

          EXT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          A group of Villagers walks by. As they do, the Reeve
          hears something coming from behind the cottage...

          HENRI (O.S.)
          Come on!
          The Reeve follows the voice and sees two figures that
          look like Henri and Isabelle climb out the back window.

                         REEVE
          They're here! Over here!
          The two figures run and the Villagers chase after them.

          EXT. VILLAGE - FIELD - NIGHT

          Henri and Isabelle hide behind a shed, just as the
          Villagers appear and spread out, trying to find them.
          Henri turns to Isabelle... only it's not Isabelle. It's
          Roxanne wearing Isabelle's clothes.

                         HENRI
          Can you keep going?

                         ROXANNE
          I can if you can.
          They run off, chased by the Villagers.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          EXT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle climbs out the back window undetected, dressed
          in Roxanne's clothes. The coast is clear. She runs off.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Isabelle can see the church steeple over the rooftops and
          races toward it. But then she hears a low GROWL ahead of
          her. Dark eyes peer from an open barn door. She turns
          and runs down an alley. The Wolf chases after her.
          As Isabelle nears the end of the alley, the Wolf suddenly
          appears in front of her, blocking her path. She races
          back the way she came, then darts into a gap between two
          outbuildings, barely big enough for her to pass through,
          too narrow for the Wolf to follow.
          But as she runs, she hears a LOUD CLAMORING above her.
          The Wolf is chasing her on the roof of one of the
          buildings. It's right over her. It shoves its head
          through the narrow space above her, SNAPPING its jaws,
          but can't quite reach her. Then suddenly --
          -- the gap between the buildings closes further and the
          Wolf is stopped short, choking, its head caught in the
          narrow space. But Isabelle slips through, emerges from
          between the buildings, and is startled by a VOICE:

          CAPTAIN (O.S.)
          There!
          The Captain is pointing at her. He has another Soldier
          with him. Isabelle runs. They chase after her...
          ... just as the Wolf frees itself. From the rooftop, it
          sees the Soldiers chasing Isabelle. It races after them,
          running across roofs and jumping from cottage to cottage.
          Isabelle runs into an alley that dead-ends at a low wall.
          There's firewood piled against the wall and Isabelle
          quickly scrabbles up it, but at the last second --
          -- the Captain reaches out and grabs her ankle. She
          grabs a log and hits him over the head until he lets go.
          Then she jumps down to the other side.
          The other Soldier starts to climb after her, but is
          suddenly lifted right off his feet. The Captain looks
          up. The Wolf is standing on the adjacent roof and has
          picked the Soldier up in its jaws. It glares down at the
          Captain. It flings the Soldier in its mouth away like a
          dirty sock. The Captain gapes up at it in fear for a
          moment too long and then the Wolf is on him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - NIGHT

          Isabelle's route has taken her right back to where she
          started. She spots the steeple and starts toward it...
          But there is someone here. Father Solomon. He's holding
          his silver sword. Isabelle freezes. For a moment, they
          just stand there, looking at one another. Then --
          Isabelle turns to run. Solomon is on her in an instant.
          He grabs a fistful of her hair and throws her to the
          ground. She tries to get away, but he puts a knee in her
          back and ties her hands together with a length of rope.

                         SOLOMON
          At least you won't die alone now.
          Your friends will all hang with
          you.
          Suddenly... a long, hideous SNARL. Behind them. Father
          Solomon turns. Isabelle cranes her neck and sees... the
          Wolf emerge from the alley she just came out of. Solomon
          picks up his sword and stands to face it.

                         SOLOMON
          If you come for her, you come
          through me.
          The Wolf GROWLS and raises its hackles. Solomon raises
          his sword. Just then, Henri and Roxanne run into the
          square, followed by a group of Villagers.

                         SOLOMON
          Stay back!
          Henri hurries to Isabelle's side. The Villagers watch,
          breathless, as Solomon and the Wolf circle one another.
          Solomon's sword starts to tremble. Sweat breaks out on
          his brow. The Wolf SNARLS with an almost mocking leer.
          Then, with a loud battle cry, Solomon charges. The Wolf
          leaps at him. Solomon raises his sword...
          ... and the Wolf's jaws clamp onto his wrist. Solomon
          screams. The Villagers watch, horrified, as the Wolf
          twists back and forth, like a dog with a chew toy --
          -- biting off Solomon's hand. The hand falls into the
          snow, still clutching the silver sword. Solomon cries
          out in agony. The Wolf turns toward Isabelle and SNARLS.

                         THE WOLF
          There is your mighty werewolf
          hunter. Who will save you now?

          100.

                         CONTINUED:
          Isabelle trembles. The Wolf slowly steps toward her,
          menacing... and is struck in the head with a rock. The
          Wolf stops, surprised to find Henri standing in its way.
          Henri picks up another rock and throws it.

                         HENRI
          You bastard! You killed my
          father!

                         ISABELLE
          Henri, what are you doing?

                         HENRI
          I'm not letting it take you.
          He throws another rock and another. One hits the Wolf in
          the eye, tearing a gash in its face. The Wolf GROWLS.

                         HENRI
          Look! It bleeds! We can kill it
          if we stand together!
          The Villagers waver. Henri beseeches them:

                         HENRI
          Father Solomon was one man. His
          soldiers were mercenaries. But we
          are a village!
          The Wolf SNARLS at him, but comes no closer.

                         ISABELLE
          He's right. It's a coward at
          heart. Look at it. Why doesn't
          it attack?
          The Wolf SNARLS louder and takes a step toward her... but
          then the Merchant picks up a rock and throws it.

                         MERCHANT
          You killed my daughter!
          Then another Villager joins them. The Wolf looks around.
          Villagers are emerging from the shadows all around it.
          It's surrounded. And not by a dozen soldiers, but by a
          solid wall of angry, determined men and women.
          The Wolf raises its hackles, trying to scare them, but
          they start closing in, jabbing at it with weapons and
          farm implements. It snaps and SNARLS at its attackers,
          but there are too many of them.
          Someone drives a spear into the Wolf and it screams in
          agony. It lurches around, biting at the spear, but can't
          reach it. Then Henri sees something in the snow...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Solomon's sword. He pries it out of Solomon's severed
          hand and turns to face the Wolf, the angry Villagers
          gathered behind them. The Wolf trembles, blood dripping
          from its many wounds... then it turns to Isabelle.

                         THE WOLF
          I will come for you again.
          And with that, it turns and flees into the night. The
          Villagers CHEER. The Reeve chases after it and the rest
          of the angry mob follows him. Henri turns to Isabelle.

                         HENRI
          Are you all right?
          Isabelle nods, shaky. Then...

          SOLOMON (O.S.)
          This isn't over.
          They turn. Solomon kneels, holding his bloody stump.

                         SOLOMON
          I am bitten.
          Henri and Isabelle exchange a look. A long beat. Henri
          walks over to Solomon, sword in hand. Solomon crosses
          himself and closes his eyes, unafraid. Roxanne turns
          away. Isabelle doesn't.
          Then Henri swings the sword. There is a soft THUMP as
          Solomon's head hits the snow. Henri throws the sword
          aside. Isabelle puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAY

          Isabelle awakens in her bed. She looks around. She's
          still dressed in Roxanne's clothes from the night before.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAY

          Isabelle enters to find Suzette putting food in a basket.
          Suzette stops when she sees Isabelle and gives her a hug.

                         ISABELLE
          It's past noon.

                         SUZETTE
          I know. I didn't want to wake
          you.
          Isabelle smiles up at her. The wounds on Suzette's face
          are still bad, but healing. She's scarred for life.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          Where's Father?

                         SUZETTE
          He'll be home soon. They have no
          reason to hold him any longer.

                         ISABELLE
          Did they catch the Wolf?

                         SUZETTE
          No. They lost it in the forest.
          This gives Isabelle pause. A beat. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          What about Grandmother?
          Suzette hesitates. Isabelle is suddenly concerned.

                         SUZETTE
          Roxanne came by. She said your
          grandmother has fallen ill. I was
          hoping you could look in on her.
          Off Isabelle's troubled look...

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY

          Isabelle walks through the village wearing Lucie's red
          riding hood and carrying a basket of food. People lower
          their eyes as she passes. She spots Prudence gossiping
          with Lucrece. Prudence sees her, then looks away.
          The same pup we saw at the beginning is now a grown dog.
          It playfully follows Isabelle along the path, but stops
          as she enters the dark, fog-shrouded forest...

          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAY

          Isabelle walks through the snow. A thick fog gives the
          forest a strange, dream-like feeling. A cold wind blows.
          Soon Isabelle becomes aware of FOOTSTEPS behind her. She
          stops and turns. Slowly, a figure appears. It's Peter.

                         PETER
          Thank God you're all right.
          He tries to take her hand, but she pulls away. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          I'm fine. You sent Henri to help
          me.

          103.

                         CONTINUED:

                         PETER
          What did he tell you?
          Isabelle gives him a hurt look.

                         ISABELLE
          Those people back there. I know
          they mean well, but they're just
          people. I didn't expect anything
          from them. I expected something
          from you.

                         PETER
          I just need to talk to you.

                         ISABELLE
          I'm going to see my Grandmother.
          She's sick. Please don't follow
          me.
          Isabelle starts walking again. Peter just stands there,
          watching her go. When she looks back, he's gone. She
          sighs, wiping tears from her eyes. She continues on...
          Then: FOOTSTEPS behind her again. She stops and looks
          back. Listens. Nothing. She keeps walking. But then
          she HEARS them again. Looks back. A dark figure follows
          her in the fog. She walks faster.
          She reaches the fork in the path. She pauses. The
          FOOTSTEPS are still behind her. She makes a decision.
          She breaks off a tree branch and backs toward the
          abandoned path, using the branch to sweep away her tracks
          in the snow. When she's far enough away from the main
          path, she throws the branch aside...
          ... and turns to face the abandoned path. It looks
          ominous. She gives it a wary look, then starts walking.

          EXT. GULLY - DAY

          Isabelle reaches the rope bridge. More of the rotten
          boards have fallen out during the winter. Isabelle looks
          down. It's a long drop to the river below. She edges
          out, stepping carefully on the snow-covered boards,
          holding onto the rope with both hands...
          Suddenly -- CRACK! A board SNAPS under her weight. At
          the last instant, she regains her balance. The broken
          board SPLASHES into the water. She takes a moment to
          catch her breath before continuing...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK

          Isabelle crosses the little bridge and knocks on the
          front door. The fog still hangs over everything. She
          doesn't notice the dark stain under her feet...

                         ISABELLE
          Grandmother? Are you awake?
          She listens at the door. A long beat. Then:

          THE FIGURE (O.S.)
          Pull the bobbin. The latch will
          open.
          We recognize the thin, raspy voice. Isabelle hesitates,
          then pulls the bobbin and opens the door...

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON - DUSK

          The Reeve and a GUARD examine something O.S.

                         REEVE
          You're certain nobody has seen him
          since last night?

                         GUARD
          The Wolf must have taken him.
          What else could have done that?
          They're looking at the cell where Cesaire was locked up.
          The metal door has been ripped off its hinges...

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK

          Isabelle closes the door. A pot is cooking over the
          fire. The cat lounges in its heat, grooming itself. It
          looks up at Isabelle as she enters. Isabelle stops.
          The veil that has always been closed is now open. Beyond
          it, we see Grandmother propped up in bed. The light is
          too dim to see her very well, just a candle by her bed.
          She's wearing a nightgown and cap. She doesn't move.

                         THE FIGURE
          I've been expecting you.
          Isabelle starts toward the bedroom with the basket...

                         ISABELLE
          Mother sent some food. There are
          cakes and a pot of butter --

                         CONTINUED:

                         THE FIGURE
          Don't come in here.
          Isabelle stops short. Grandmother's face is cloaked in
          darkness. Isabelle gives her a questioning look.

                         THE FIGURE
          I'm not hungry right now.

                         ISABELLE
          Are you sure? You sound so weak.

                         THE FIGURE
          I just made myself a stew. I left
          it over the fire for you.
          Isabelle glances back at the pot BUBBLING over the fire.

                         ISABELLE
          I came here to take care of you.
          Not the other way around.

                         THE FIGURE
          Don't be silly, my dear. You've
          been through so much. Sit down.
          Isabelle considers for a beat, then places the basket on
          the table, next to a ball of yarn with Grandmother's
          knitting needles sticking out of it.

                         THE FIGURE
          There's no burden so heavy that it
          doesn't seem a little lighter on a
          full stomach.

                         ISABELLE

                         (SMILES)
          You always say that.
          She ladles some soup into a bowl and sits down. The cat
          looks up from its grooming, watching her...

                         THE FIGURE
          That's right. Eat up, my dear.
          Eat up.
          Isabelle takes a bite of the hot soup. The cat jumps up
          on the table and lies down next to her, licking its paw.

                         ISABELLE
          I've been worried about you. When
          you didn't come back yesterday, I
          was afraid...

                         (BEAT)
          You were wrong about Henri.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         THE FIGURE
          Was I now?

                         ISABELLE
          Yes. He saved my life.
          Isabelle takes another bite of soup, then pauses. She
          puts the bowl down and loosens her collar...

                         ISABELLE
          I feel hot all of a sudden.

                         THE FIGURE
          It's just the stew warming you.
          Isabelle hesitates, but keeps eating. Then she takes a
          closer look at the cat. There's blood on its paw.
          That's what it has been licking this whole time.
          Suddenly, Isabelle feels faint. She breaks out in a
          sweat. She looks at the soup. A thick broth with chunks
          of white meat...

                         ISABELLE
          What is this...?

                         THE FIGURE
          If you don't like it, there's wine
          on the table to wash it down.
          Isabelle reaches for the bottle with an unsteady hand and
          pours herself a cup. She takes a sip... and freezes.
          It's not wine. It's blood. She gags and drops the cup,
          spilling blood everywhere. The cat jumps away.
          She looks at the bottle, turns it over. More blood pours
          out. Isabelle screams and throws it, knocking over the
          pot and spilling the soup. The Figure laughs.

                         THE FIGURE
          Oh, what pretty red lips. Come
          and give your Granny a kiss, my
          dear.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't think I want to.

                         THE FIGURE
          Then I will come to you.
          And with that -- Grandmother slowly starts to move. She
          groans. She's hurt. She stands up. She's much taller
          now than she was. As Isabelle watches in mute dread, the
          Figure pulls off Grandmother's nightgown and cap, hobbles
          into the firelight, revealing its face...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         CONTINUED: (3)
          It's Cesaire. Isabelle quickly stands, startled.

                         ISABELLE
          What is this? Where's
          Grandmother?

                         CESAIRE
          I'm afraid I ate most of her.

                         (BEAT)
          You ate the rest.
          Isabelle gives the spilled stew on the floor a horrified
          look. For a moment, she looks like she may pass out.

                         CESAIRE
          I didn't want to kill her. But
          she finally realized what I was.

          EXT. CREEK - DAWN (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire bathes in a cold stream...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          The hardest thing to hide has
          always been the smell. The
          werewolf musk is strong,
          especially close to the full moon.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          The night of the wolf hunt. Henri crouches in the woods,
          clutching his hammer... then freezes with terror. He
          sees the Wolf slink by in the dark, dragging Adrien along
          by his throat. It happened just as Henri said it did.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Henri smelled it the night he saw
          me. And he recognized the smell
          later.

          EXT. STABLE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

          Grandmother's confrontation with Henri. She stumbles
          outside and practically runs right into Cesaire...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          He thought it was your
          Grandmother. He didn't know he
          was smelling me. But she did.
          She'd lived with the smell her
          whole life, she just had no way of
          knowing what it was.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Grandmother hands Cesaire a stack of knitted blankets.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Once she realized what it was, of
          course, she knew the truth. She
          tried to sneak a message to Father
          Auguste last night.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire carries the blankets back to the cart. He
          quickly looks inside them and finds a note: 'MEUS FILIUS
          EST LUPUS.' Subtitle: 'My son is the wolf.'

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Luckily, she'd taught me how to
          read.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Isabelle shakes her head, tears streaming down her face.

                         ISABELLE
          You're not the Wolf. You can't
          be...

                         CESAIRE
          Look into my eyes. The one part
          of me I can never change.
          Isabelle looks into his eyes... and recoils in horror.

                         ISABELLE
          Oh, dear God... You killed Lucie?
          You killed my sister?

                         CESAIRE
          I did more than that to her.
          Isabelle steps away from him, mind reeling. He snarls.

                         CESAIRE
          I only wish your mother could have
          known what I did to her. The girl
          she passed off as my daughter.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          The night of the festival. SCREAMS can be heard coming
          from the village square. Suzette runs outside...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I was made a cuckold by your
          mother. But I paid her back.
          She hears a LOW GROWL. She turns, startled. It's the
          Wolf. It lunges at her, raking her face with its claws.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          The wolf hunt. Adrien hears SOMETHING move in the brush.
          He looks toward it... and sees the Wolf staring at him
          from the darkness.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I paid her lover back, too.

          BACK TO SCENE
          To Isabelle's dismay, Cesaire has tears in his eyes.

                         CESAIRE
          Lucie was the joy of my life. But
          she wasn't mine.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, she was. In every way that
          matters, she was.

                         CESAIRE
          No. Not in every way that
          matters. My father sired me. I
          am a werewolf because it was in
          his blood. Because I was his.

                         ISABELLE
          Did Grandmother know?

                         CESAIRE
          No. And neither does your mother.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

          The night Lucie died. Cesaire pours mugs of beer, but
          this time we see him sprinkle something in the beer
          before serving it -- Grandmother's sleeping herb.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I put an herb in the beer to make
          you sleep whenever the moon was
          full. One of your Grandmother's
          old remedies.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

          Many years ago. Grandmother is in her 40s, asleep in a
          chair, holding an empty cup. Isabelle's GRANDFATHER
          takes the cup from her hand and quietly leaves.
          Grandmother sleeps peacefully by the fire...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          That's how my father got away with
          it. Your grandmother never
          learned the truth. Until last
          night.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Still many years ago. A werewolf runs through the
          woods... followed by a smaller werewolf.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I began to turn when I was
          fourteen. My father and I ran
          together. We hunted freely.
          Killing at will.
          The two werewolves are chasing a FRIGHTENED PEASANT,
          moving in for the kill...

          EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          The mangled body of the Peasant has been discovered. A
          group of MEN stands around it.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Our only mistake was that we
          gorged ourselves too often on the
          fat flesh of the villagers.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          The two werewolves are running through the woods again,
          this time chased by VILLAGERS with torches and weapons.

                         CESAIRE
          They killed my father.
          Suddenly, the larger werewolf falls into a pit filled
          with sharp stakes. It CRIES OUT in agony. The smaller
          werewolf looks down and WHIMPERS...

          By the time the Villagers reach the pit, what they find
          is Grandfather's naked body skewered on the stakes. The
          smaller werewolf GROWLS at them and runs away.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          The fools thought my father had
          been thrown in the pit by the
          Wolf. They never suspected that
          he was the Wolf.

          SERIES OF SHOTS (FLASHBACK)
          Cesaire labors in a field. He goes to church. He
          thatches the roof of his cottage in the hot sun...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I tried to live as my father did,
          but I came to realize that I did
          not belong here. The Wolf was my
          true self. It wasn't something to
          be hidden. It was a gift. I had
          to leave here and never return.

          EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire stands in the cemetery, looking down at his
          father's grave...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          But I did not want to go alone.
          My father and I were part of a
          long and powerful bloodline. It
          was up to me to see that it did
          not die out. I had hoped for a
          son to pass my gift on to.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire mends a fence, but keeps glancing at something...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Instead, God gave me daughters.
          He's looking at Lucie and Isabelle. They help Suzette
          hang clothes to dry. He smiles as he watches them...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          But female werewolves are not
          born. They are made. And I chose
          my eldest.
          Lucie catches him watching. She waves. He waves back.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Another day. Cesaire is giving Lucie a stern lecture.
          Lucie's face is ashen and there are tears in her eyes.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          When I finally decided to leave, I
          told Lucie the truth. And I gave
          her a choice. She could come with
          me. Or I would take you instead.
          Lucie turns and sees Isabelle approaching. We realize
          that we've seen this moment before.

                         CESAIRE
          This doesn't concern you,
          Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, Father.
          Isabelle walks away. Cesaire watches her go...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          She agreed to come with me. She
          did it to protect you.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Isabelle is fast asleep. Lucie sneaks out of bed...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          We arranged to meet on the night
          of the next full moon.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Lucie stands naked, arms clutched around her breasts.
          Then, a NOISE in the brush. She turns and sees...

                         CESAIRE
          She was not a werewolf yet. I had
          to turn her.
          ... the Wolf emerge from the forest with a scrap of
          bloody meat dangling from its jaws.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Later. Lucie weeps as she forces herself to eat the raw
          meat scraps. The Wolf watches, panting...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          First, she had to eat human flesh.
          I fed her from a kill I had made
          the month before. But the ritual
          was not yet complete. She had to
          be bitten by a male werewolf.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle looks like she's going to be ill.

                         CESAIRE
          The bite should have changed her.
          It should have made her like me.
          But it didn't. That's when I
          knew. There was no werewolf blood
          in her. I was not her father. I
          was so angry. I killed her before
          I even realized I was doing it.

          INT. TAVERN COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire sits slumped in a corner, too drunk to move. A
          hand reaches in to help him. It's Isabelle.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Afterwards, I thought about
          killing myself. The only thing
          that kept me alive was you.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Isabelle helps drunk Cesaire into bed...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          You were so beautiful. So kind.
          And I knew you were mine. That's
          why you could understand me when
          no one else could. You were mine.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Cesaire takes Isabelle's hand and won't let it go. She
          backs into the wall. He looms over her...

                         CESAIRE
          Do you see now? This is your
          heritage. This is what you are.
          Everything I have done has been to
          insure the future of our
          bloodline. We will run together

                         CESAIRE (CONT'D)
          like my father and I once did.
          You are the next generation. You
          have had your first taste of human
          flesh. Now one bite from me is
          all that is needed to change you.
          It will only hurt for a moment.
          And then you will be as I am.

                         ISABELLE
          There must indeed be a God. For
          you are surely the Devil...

                         CESAIRE
          I will give you a choice. Come
          with me now. Or refuse me and let
          your friends suffer in your place.
          I will kill them one by one. Your
          mother. Roxanne. Peter.
          Isabelle shudders. She slowly pulls away and he releases
          her. She walks over to the table, her back to him. She
          eyes the ball of yarn with Grandmother's knitting needles
          in it. A long beat. Isabelle chokes back tears.

                         ISABELLE
          Father...?
          He approaches her. Stands behind her and places his hand
          on her shoulder. Her skin crawls.

                         CESAIRE
          Yes, my dear?

                         ISABELLE
          You gave me two choices.
          She turns to face him. Looks up at him.

                         ISABELLE
          But I have thought of a third.
          Suddenly -- CRUNCH! Isabelle drives something hard into
          Cesaire's jaw. He gasps, choking. He puts his had to
          his throat. Blood spills out through his fingers.
          CAMERA FINDS Grandmother's ball of yarn on the table.
          The knitting needles aren't sticking out of it anymore...
          They're sticking out of Cesaire's neck. He falls to his
          knees, gagging. Then he flops over dead. Eyes open.
          Isabelle gazes down at him. She looks like she might
          have just lost her mind. Then she sits on the floor,
          staring at his body... and screams. An eruption of
          rage, betrayal, and heartbreak. She screams.

          The cottage is dark and quiet.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          It's pitch black in here. There's a KNOCK at the door.

          PETER (O.S.)
          Hello?
          No response. The door CREAKS open. It's Peter. As he
          opens the door, moonlight spills inside to reveal
          Isabelle huddled and trembling in the corner. She's
          screamed and cried herself out. All that's left is anger
          and a grim resolve. She did what she had to do.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)

          Isabelle and Peter sit at the table. A dim candle
          provides the only light. A long beat.

                         ISABELLE
          People should know what he was.

                         PETER
          We can't tell anyone. If they
          don't believe you, they'll hang
          you for this. And if they do
          believe you, they'll hang you for
          being the daughter of the Wolf.

                         ISABELLE
          Then I'll run away. I was ready
          to run away last night.

                         (BEAT)
          Why didn't you come for me?
          Peter gives her a long look. But instead of speaking, he
          rolls up his sleeve. Isabelle's eyes go wide. There's a
          huge scar on his arm. In the shape of a bite mark.

                         PETER
          I was bitten at the festival. I
          spent last night in the woods
          because I was afraid of what might
          happen...

                         (A BEAT)
          I changed. I'm like him now.

                         ISABELLE
          No, you're not. You could never
          be like him.

                         CONTINUED:
          Isabelle's tears fall, the full implications of what he's
          saying starting to sink in. He takes her hand.

                         PETER
          I can't stay here.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, you can. We can still be
          together. My father lived here.
          My grandfather lived here.

                         PETER
          Your father and your grandfather
          killed people. They couldn't help
          themselves. If I stay here, I
          won't be able to control myself.
          (off her look)
          I have to be alone.
          Isabelle rests her head on his and they just sit like
          that, leaning against one another in the candlelight...

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)

          Isabelle and Peter crouch next to Cesaire's body. The
          candle is on the floor, casting weird shadows.

                         PETER
          We could take him to the river.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't want him ever found.

                         PETER
          We'll weight him with rocks.

                         ISABELLE
          No. We'll put the rocks inside
          him.
          (off his look)
          Cut him open. I will sew the
          rocks inside him.
          Peter is taken aback. She's serious.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)

          Peter and Isabelle have placed several heavy rocks next
          to Cesaire's body. Peter opens Cesaire's shirt and takes
          out a hunting knife. Isabelle gives Peter a nod. Peter
          somewhat reluctantly lowers the knife, his shoulder
          moving up and down as he goes about his unseen task...

                         CONTINUED:
          Moments later, Isabelle threads a needle and coldly
          stitches begins stitching. We don't see what she's
          doing, but there's blood on her needle and thread.
          There's a spot of blood on her cheek, too.

          EXT. RIVER - FERRY DOCK - NIGHT

          Low mist hugs the ground. There's a wooden A-frame
          pontoon raft tied to a ferry dock. A guy-rope runs
          through the A-frame to a pier on the opposite shore.
          Isabelle and Peter nervously approach. He pushes a
          wheelbarrow onto the raft, its contents wrapped in
          burlap. Peter unties the moorings and is about to shove
          off, but Isabelle stops him:

                         ISABELLE
          Wait.
          She pulls back the burlap, revealing Cesaire's dead body.
          His belly is lumpy and misshapen, an ugly red line in his
          torso stitched together with black thread. The knitting
          needles still jut out of his jaw. Isabelle yanks them
          out, then pulls the burlap back over Cesaire's body.
          Peter gives her a questioning look.

                         ISABELLE
          These belonged to my grandmother.
          The knitting needles are covered in blood. Peter takes
          out a rag and wipes the blood off for her. And as he
          does... something begins to shine through in the
          moonlight. Peter gives Isabelle a stunned look.

                         PETER
          They're silver.

          EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

          Peter uses a long pole to push the raft across the water.
          Isabelle gazes out at the moonlit mist. They stop the in
          the middle of the river. They exchange a look...
          ... then each take a side of the wheelbarrow and dump the
          body into the water. It sinks instantly and is gone.

                         PETER
          Death was too good for him.

                         ISABELLE
          I can live with it.

          EXT. RIVER - OPPOSITE BANK - NIGHT

          Isabelle and Peter stand on the shore. He kisses her and
          she holds his face in her hands, wanting the kiss to last
          forever. When they part, she gives him an aching look.

                         ISABELLE
          Where will you go?

                         PETER
          I don't know. I need to
          understand what I've become.
          Maybe I can learn to control it.
          (off her look)
          I'll take my own life before I
          take another's.

                         ISABELLE
          I know.

                         PETER
          I'm not coming back. I don't want
          you to wait for me. This is the
          last time you'll ever see me.

                         ISABELLE
          No, it isn't. You'll be in my
          dreams until the day I die.
          Peter turns and starts to walk away. But then he pauses.

                         PETER
          You know, Henri is a good man.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, he is.
          Then Peter continues on until he vanishes in the fog.
          CAMERA PUSHES IN on Isabelle as she watches him go...

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          I never saw him again.

          SPRINGTIME. The leaves have returned to the forest with
          explosions of green. Crops grow in the fields. Flowers

                         CONTINUED:

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          end, the Wolf did not return. And
          that was answer enough for most.

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          Isabelle and Henri stand before Father Auguste. They're
          getting married. Roxanne, Suzette, and other friends and
          neighbors watch as Isabelle and Henri exchange rings.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          Henri and I were married. He was
          a good man and a good father. I
          loved him very much. But I never
          loved him the same way that I
          loved Peter. That was the one
          secret in our marriage.

          EXT. FIELD - DAY

          Isabelle laughs as she watches Henri run around, playing
          with their three young children -- TWIN GIRLS and a BOY.
          Isabelle gives Henri a warm, loving smile.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          I only tell you now because he is
          dead. And if he knows now, I
          believe that he forgives me, for
          he must also know that I never
          loved him falsely.

          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle's Girls are in bed asleep. Isabelle enters,
          carrying the sleeping Boy. She gently places him in bed
          next to the girls and covers them with a blanket.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          This is my story, not that I
          expect you will believe it. In my
          own village, the events of that
          awful winter have already passed
          into legend. Parents tell their
          children to be good or else the
          Wolf will come and gobble them up.
          Isabelle smiles as she watches them sleep.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          They've already forgotten. A
          simple children's story is all
          that remains.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          120.

          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle opens the door and strolls outside, looking up
          at the sky. The moon is full.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          But sometimes, when the moon is
          full, my thoughts still turn to
          Peter. He promised me that I
          would never see him again. And I
          never have.
          Somewhere, a wolf HOWLS. Isabelle smiles.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          But I often wonder if I hear him.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          High on a hilltop, CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a WOLF
          staring down at the distant village. It's hard to tell
          in the moonlight whether it's a normal wolf...
          Or something else.
          It looks up at the bright full moon and HOWLS as we

          FADE OUT.

  Caption-- September 5th.  Sunday.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  TOMOKOS ROOM - NIGHT

  CLOSEUP on a TELEVISION SET.  Theres a baseball game on, but the sound 
  is turned completely down.  Camera PANS to show two cute high school 
  girls, MASAMI and TOMOKO.  Masami is seated on the floor at a low coffee 
  table, TEXTBOOK in front of her. Tomoko is at her desk.  There are SNACKS 
  all over the room, and its obvious there hasnt been much studying going 
  on. Masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly.

				MASAMI
		They say that some elementary school 
		kid spent the night with his parents 
		at a bed and breakfast in Izu.  The kid
		wanted to go out and play with everybody, 
		right, but he didnt want to miss the 
		program he always used to watch back in 
		Tokyo, so he records it on the VCR in 
		their room.  But of course the stations 
		in Izu are different from the ones in 
		Tokyo.  In Izu, it was just an empty 
		channel, so he shouldve recorded
		nothing but static.  But when the kid 
		gets back to his house and watches the 
		tape, all of a sudden this woman comes 
		on the screen and says--

  Masami points so suddenly and dramatically at her friend that Tomoko 
  actually jumps in her seat.

				MASAMI (contd)
		One week from now, you will die.

  Short silence as Masami pauses, relishing the moment.

				MASAMI (contd)	
		Of course the kids completely 
		freaked, and he stops the video.  
		Just then the phone rings, and when he 
		picks it up a voice says--

  Her voice drops voice almost to a whisper.

				MASAMI (contd)	
		You watched it, didnt you?  That 
		same time, exactly one week later... 
		hes dead!

  Masami laughs loudly, thoroughly enjoying her own performance.  
  Tomoko, however, is completely silent.  She begins looking more 
  and more distressed, until finally Masami notices.

				MASAMI
		What is it, Tomoko?

  Tomoko comes out of her chair and drops onto the floor next to her 
  friend.  Her words are quick, earnest.

				TOMOKO
		Who did you hear that story from?

				MASAMI
		Who?  Its just a rumor.  Everybody 
		knows it.

				TOMOKO
		Youko told you?	

				MASAMI	
		No, it wasnt Youko...

  Tomoko looks away, worried.  Masami slaps her on the knee, 
  laughing.

				MASAMI
		Whats up with you?

  Tomoko speaks slowly, still looking away.

				TOMOKO
		The other day, I... I watched this 
		strange video.
		
				MASAMI
		Where?

				TOMOKO	
		With Youko and them.

				MASAMI	
			(excited) 
		So thats what Ive been hearing 
		about you doing some double-date/
		sleepover thing!  So, you and that 
		guy Iwata, huh? 

				TOMOKO	
		No, its not like that.  Nothing 
		happened!

  Their eyes meet and Tomoko half-blushes, looks away again.  Her 
  expression becomes serious as she resumes her conversation.

				TOMOKO
		Iwata... he found this weird video.  
		Everyone was like, Whats that? so 
		he put it on and we all watched it.

				MASAMI
			(quietly) 
		And?  What kind of video was it?

				TOMOKO
		Just... weird, I cant really explain 
		it.  Anyway, right after we finished 
		watching it, the phone rang.  Whoever
		it was didnt say anything, but still...

  Silence.  Masami curls up on herself, thoroughly spooked.  

				MASAMI	
		Jesus.

				TOMOKO
  		It's cuz, you know, we'd all heard the 
		rumors.

Tomoko looks seriously over at her friend.

				TOMOKO (cont'd)
		That was one week ago today.

  There is a long, heavy silence as neither of them says anything.

				MASAMI  	
		Waaait a minute.  Are you faking me 
		out?

  Tomokos face suddenly breaks into a smile. 

				TOMOKO	
		Busted, huh?

  They both crack up laughing. 

				MASAMI
		Oh, my... I cant believe you!  

  Masami reaches out, slaps her friend on the knee.

				MASAMI (contd)
		Youre terrible!

				TOMOKO
		Gotcha!

				MASAMI	
			(thinking) 
		But hang on... you really stayed
		the night with Youko and Iwata, 
		right?

  Tomoko nods, uh-huh.  Masami dives forward, pinching her friends 
  cheeks and grinning wildly.

				MASAMI	
		So, how far did you and he get?

				TOMOKO 	
		Oh... I cant remember.

				MASAMI	
		You cant remember, huh?

  Masami laughs, then slaps Tomoko on the knee again as she remembers 
  the trick her friend played on her.

				MASAMI	
		Man, you had me freaked me out. 
		I--

  Just at that moment, the phone RINGS.  They are both suddenly, 
  instantly serious.  Tomokos eyes go off in one direction and she 
  begins shaking her head, -No-.  Masami looks over her shoulder, 
  following her friends gaze.  

  Tomoko is looking at the CLOCK, which currently reads 9:40.

  The phone continues to ring.  Tomoko is now clutching tightly onto her 
  friend, looking panicked.

				MASAMI
			(softly) 
		Was it true?

  Tomoko nods her head, still holding on tightly.  Masami has to 
  forcibly disengage herself in order to stand.  The phone is downstairs, 
  so Masami opens the bedroom DOOR and races down the STAIRS.  Tomoko 
  calls out to her from behind.

				TOMOKO
		Masami!

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  STAIRCASE - NIGHT  

  Tomoko and Masami run down the staircase, through the hallway towards 
  the kitchen.  Tomoko cries out again just before they reach the kitchen.

				TOMOKO	
		Masami!

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - NIGHT  

  Masami has come to a halt before a PHONE mounted on the wall.  She 
  pauses, looking slowly at her friend, then back to the phone.  She 
  takes it tentatively from its cradle, answers it wordlessly.  The 
  tension continues to mount as nothing is said. Masami suddenly breaks 
  into a huge grin.

				MASAMI	
		Ill put her on.

  Still grinning, she hands the phone to Tomoko.  Tomoko snatches it 
  quickly.

				TOMOKO
			(softly) 
		Yes?

  She is silent for a moment, then smiling widely.  

				TOMOKO
		Oh, man!

  She is so relieved that all the strength seeps out of her and she 
  sinks to the kitchen floor.  Masami, equally relieved, slides down 
  the wall and sits down next to her.

				TOMOKO
			(on the phone) 
		Yeah, Ive got a friend over now.  
		Yeah.  Yeah, OK.  Bye.

  Tomoko stands to place the phone back in its wall cradle, and then 
  squats back down onto the kitchen floor.

				TOMOKO	
		The games gone into overtime, so 
		theyre gonna be a little late. 

  They burst out laughing with relief again, and are soon both 
  clutching their stomachs.

				TOMOKO	
		Jeeezus, my parents...

				MASAMI	
		Oh man, Im tellin everybody about 
		this tomorrow!

  Tomoko shakes her head, -Dont you dare-.

				MASAMI	
		Im gonna use your bathroom.  Dont 
		go anywhere.

				TOMOKO	
		K.

  Masami walks out of the kitchen. Alone now, Tomoko stands and walks 
  toward the SINK, where she takes a GLASS from the DISH RACK.  She 
  then goes to the FRIDGE and sticks her face in, looking for something 
  to drink.  Suddenly there is the SOUND of people clapping and 
  cheering.  Tomoko, startled, peers her head over the refrigerator 
  door to check for the source of the sound.  

  She begins walking slowly, following the sound to the DINING ROOM 
  adjacent the kitchen. 

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DINING ROOM - NIGHT  

  The lights are off, and there is no one in the room.  Tomoko pauses a 
  moment, bathed in the garish LIGHT from the TV, which has been switched
  on.  Playing is the same baseball game they had on the TV upstairs; the 
  same game that Tomokos parents are currently at.  The VOLUME is up 
  quite high.

  A puzzled look on her face, Tomoko takes the REMOTE from the coffee 
  table and flicks the TV off.  She walks back to the kitchen.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - NIGHT  

  A bottle of SODA that Tomoko had earlier taken from the fridge is on 
  the kitchen table.  She picks the bottle up, pours herself a drink.  
  Before she can take a sip, however, the air around her becomes suddenly 
  charged, heavy.  Her body begins to shiver as somewhere out of sight 
  comes a popping, crackling SOUND underscored by a kind of GROANING.  
  Trembling now, Tomoko spins around to see what she has already felt 
  lurking behind her.  She draws in her breath to scream.

  The screen goes white, and fades into:

  CAMERA POV 

  The screen is filled with the visage of a nervous-looking YOUNG GIRL.  
  She is being interviewed by ASAKAWA, a female reporter seated offscreen.

				ASAKAWA (O.S.)
		There seems to be a popular rumor 
		going around about a cursed 
		videotape.

				YOUNG GIRL	
		Uh-huh.

				ASAKAWA (O.S.) 
		Have you heard what kind of video 
		it might be?

				YOUNG GIRL	
		Uh-huh.

  The girl looks directly at the camera, her mouth dropping into an O 
  as shes suddenly overcome by a kind of stage fright.  She continues 
  staring, silently, at the camera.

  INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY  

  KOMIYA, the cameraman, has lowered his camera. We can now see that 
  the young girl being interviewed is seated at a table between two 
  friends, a SHORT-HAIRED GIRL (GIRL#2) and a LONG-HAIRED GIRL (GIRL #3).  
  They are all dressed in the UNIFORMS of junior high school students.  
  Opposite them sits Komiya and Asakawa, a pretty woman in her mid-
  twenties.  A BOOM MIKE GUY stands to the left.
 
				KOMIYA	
		Uh, dont look right at the camera, 
		OK?

				YOUNG GIRL	
		Sorry.

				ASAKAWA	
		Lets do it again.

  Asakawa glances over her shoulder, makes sure that Komiya is ready.

 
				ASAKAWA
		Have you heard what kind of video 
		it might be?

				YOUNG GIRL
		What I heard was, all of a sudden 
		this scaaarry lady comes on the
		screen and says, In one week, you
		will die.


				GIRL #2	
		I heard that if youre watching TV 
		late at night itll come on, and
		then your phonell ring.

				ASAKAWA
		Watching TV late at night... do you
 		know what station?

				GIRL #2	
		Mmmm... I heard some local station, 
		around Izu.

				ASAKAWA	
		Izu?

				GIRL #2	
		Mmm-hmm.	

				ASAKAWA
		And, do you know if anyones really 
		died from watching it?

  The girl flashes a look at her two friends.

				YOUNG GIRL
		Well, no one that we know, right?

  Girl #2 nods her head. Girl #3 nods slowly, opens and closes her 
  mouth as if deciding whether to say something or not.  The 
  reporter notices. 

				ASAKAWA	
		What is it?


				GIRL #3
		I heard this from a friend of mine 
		in high school.  She said that there 
		was this one girl who watched the 
		video, and then died a week later.  
		She was out on a drive with her 
		boyfriend.

				ASAKAWA
		They were in a wreck?

				GIRL #3
		No, their car was parked, but they 
		were both dead inside.  Her 
		boyfriend died because hed watched 
		the video, too.  Thats what my 
		friend said.

  Girl #3 grows suddenly defensive.

				GIRL #3 (contd)	
		Its true!  It was in the paper two 
		or three days ago.

				ASAKAWA
		Do you know the name of the high 
		school this girl went to?

				GIRL #3
		No... I heard this from my friend, 
		and it didnt happen at her school.  
		She heard it from a friend at a 
		different school, she said.

  INT. NEWS STATION  DAY

  Asakawa is seated at her DESK.  The station is filled with PEOPLE, 
  scrabbling to meet deadlines.  Komiya walks up to Asakawas desk 
  and holds out a MANILA FOLDER.

				KOMIYA	
		Mrs. Asakawa?

				ASAKAWA
		Hm?

				KOMIYA	
		Here you are.

				ASAKAWA
			(taking the folder) 
		Thanks.

  Komiya has a seat.

				KOMIYA	
		This same kind of thing happened 
		about ten years ago too, didnt it?  
		Some popular young singer committed 
		suicide, and then suddenly there was 
		all this talk about her ghost showing
		up on some music show.

				ASAKAWA	
		But I wonder what this rumors all 
		about. Everyone you ask always 
		mentions Izu.

				KOMIYA	
		Maybe thats where it all started.  
		Hey, where was that Kuchi-sake
		Onna * story from again?


  >* Literally Ripped-Mouth Lady, a kind of ghastly spectre from 
  >Japanese folk stories who wears a veil to hide her mouth, which 
  >has been ripped or cut open from ear to ear. She wanders the 
  >countryside at night asking men Do you think Im beautiful? then 
  >lowering her veil to reveal her true features.


				ASAKAWA	
		Gifu, but there was some big 
		accident out there, and that ended
		up being what started the rumor. 

				KOMIYA
		A big accident?

				ASAKAWA	
		Mmm-hmm.  Something terrible like 
		that is going to stay in peoples 
		minds.  Sometimes the story of what 
		happened gets twisted around, and 
		ends up coming back as a rumor like 
		this one. Thats what they say, at 
		least.

				KOMIYA
		Dyou think something like that 
		happened out at Izu?

				ASAKAWA
		Maybe. Well, anyway, Im off.  See you
		tomorrow.
   
				KOMIYA
		See you.

  Asakawa gets up from her desk and begins walking towards the exit.  
  She takes only a few steps before noticing a RACK of recent DAILY 
  EDITIONS.  

  She takes one from the rack, sets it on a nearby TABLE.  She begins 
  flipping the pages, and suddenly spies this story:  

    STRANGE AUTOMOBILE DEATH OF YOUNG COUPLE IN YOKOHAMA

    The bodies of a young man and woman were discovered in their 
    passenger car at around 10 A.M. September 6th.  The location was a 
    vacant lot parallel to Yokohama Prefectural Road.  Local authorities 
    identified the deceased as a 19-year old preparatory school student 
    of Tokyo, and a 16-year old Yokohama resident, a student of a 
    private all-girls high school. Because there were no external 
    injuries, police are investigating the possibility of drug-induced 
    suicide...

  Just then two men walk by, a GUY IN A BUSINESS SUIT and a youngish 
  intern named OKAZAKI.  Okazaki is carrying an armload of VIDEOTAPES.

				GUY IN SUIT
		OK, Okazaki, Im counting on you.

				OKAZAKI	
		Yessir.

  The guy in the suit pats Okazaki on the shoulder and walks off.  

  Okazaki turns to walk away, spots Asakawa bent over the small table 
  and peering intently at the newspaper article.


				OKAZAKI	
		Miss Asakawa?  I thought you were 
		going home early today.

  Asakawa turns around and begins speaking excitedly.

				ASAKAWA
		Okazaki, can I ask you a favor?

				OKAZAKI
		Sure.

  Asakawa points to the newspaper.

				ASAKAWA
		Could you check out this article 
		for me?  Get me some more info.?	

				OKAZAKI
		I guess...

				ASAKAWA	
		Good.  Call me as soon as you know 
		more, OK?

				OKAZAKI	
		Maam.

  Asakawa walks off.  Okazaki, still carrying the videotapes, leans 
  forward to take a look at the article.
   
  EXT. APARTMENT PARKING LOT - DAY  

  Asakawa drives her car into the lot and parks quickly.  She gets 
  out, runs up the STAIRCASE to the third floor.  She stops in front 
  of a door, sticks her KEY in the lock, and opens it.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM  DAY

  A BOY of about 7 is sitting in an ARMCHAIR facing the veranda.  We 
  can see only the back of his head.

				ASAKAWA (O.S.) 
		Yoichi!

  Hearing his name, the boy puts down the BOOK he was reading and 
  stands up, facing the door.  He is wearing a white DRESS SHIRT with 
  a brown sweater-type VEST over it.  He sees Asakawa, his mother, 
  run in the door.  She is panting lightly.

				ASAKAWA
		Sorry Im late.  Oh, youve already 
		changed.

				YOICHI
		Yup. 

  He points over to his mothers right.

				YOICHI (contd)
		I got your clothes out for you.

  Asakawa turns to see a DARK SUIT hanging from one of the living 
  room shelves.  She reaches out, takes it.

				ASAKAWA
		Aargh, weve gotta hurry!

  She runs into the next room to change.

  INT.  BEDROOM  DAY

  Asakawa has changed into all-black FUNERAL ATTIRE.  Her hair is 
  up, and she is fastening the clasp to a pearl NECKLACE.  Yoichi is 
  still in the living room.

				ASAKAWA	
		Did grandpa call?

				YOICHI (O.S.) 
		Nope.

  Yoichi walks into the room and faces his mother.

				YOICHI	
		Why did Tomo-chan die? *


  >* -chan is a suffix in Japanese that denotes closeness or affection.  
  >It is most often used for young girls, though it can also be used for 
  >boys.


				ASAKAWA	
		Well... it looks like she was really, 
		really sick.

  She takes a seat on the bed.

				ASAKAWA	
		Will you do me up?

  Yoichi fastens the rear button of his mothers dress and zips her up.  

				YOICHI	
		You can die even if youre young?

				ASAKAWA
		If its something serious... well, yes.

  Asakawa turns to face her son, puts an arm around him.

				ASAKAWA	
		As hard as it is for us, what your 
		auntie and uncle are going through 
		right now is even harder, so lets 
		not talk about this over there, OK?

  Yoichi nods.

				ASAKAWA
			(remembering)
		You and her used to play a lot 
		together, didnt you?

  Yoichi says nothing.

  EXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT  

  RED PAPER LANTERNS mark this place as the site of a wake.  Several 
  GIRLS in high school uniforms are standing together and talking in 
  groups. Asakawa and Yoichi, walking hand in hand, enter the house.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT 

  There are many PEOPLE milling about, speaking softly.  A MAN seated 
  at a counter is taking monetary donations from guests and entering 
  their information into a LEDGER.  Asakawa and Yoichi continue walking, 
  down a hallway.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT 

  Mother and son halt before the open DOOR to the main wake room, where 
  guests may show their respects to the departed.  The room is laid in 
  traditional Japanese-style tatami, a kind of woven straw mat that 
  serves as a carpet. Two GUESTS, their shoes off, are kneeling upon 
  zabuton cushions.  

  Kneeling opposite the guests is KOUICHI, Asakawas father.  The two 
  guests are bowing deeply, and Kouichi bows in response.

				ASAKAWA	
		Dad.

  Kouichi turns to see her.

				KOUICHI
		Ah!

				ASAKAWA
		How is sis holding up?

				KOUICHI
		Shes resting inside right now.  
		Shes shaken up pretty badly, you 
		know.  Its best she just take 
		things easy for a while.

  Asakawa nods.

				ASAKAWA
		Ill go check on auntie and them, 
		then.

				KOUICHI
		OK.  Ah, Yoichi.  Why dont you sit 
		here for a little while?

  He grabs the young boy and seats him on a cushion next to the two guests.  
  As the guests resume their conversation with Asakawas father, Yoichis 
  eyes wander to the ALTAR at the front of the room set up to honor the 
  deceased.  It is made of wood, and surrounded by candles, flowers, and 
  small paper lanterns.  At the center is a PICTURE of the deceased, a 
  teenage girl.  A small wooden PLAQUE reads her name: Tomoko Ouishi. It 
  is the same Tomoko from the first scene.

  Yoichi continues to stare at Tomokos picture.  He makes a peculiar 
  gesture as he does so, rubbing his index finger in small circles just 
  between his eyes.

  INT. HALLWAY  NIGHT

  Asakawa walks down the hallway, looking for her aunt.  She walks until 
  finding the open doorway to the kitchen.  There are a few people in 
  there, preparing busily. Asakawa sees her AUNT, who rushes into the 
  hallway to meet her, holds her fast by the arm.  The aunt speaks in a 
  fierce, quick whisper.

				AUNT		
		Have you heard anything more about 
		Tomo-chans death?

				ASAKAWA	
		No, I...

				AUNT		
		But the police have already finished 
		their autopsy!

				ASAKAWA	
		Well, they said there was no sign of 
		foul play.

				AUNT	
			(shaking her head) 
		That was no normal death.  They havent 
		once opened the casket to let us see
		the body.  Dont you think thats 
		strange?
 
  Asakawa looks away, thinking.

  INT. HALLWAY  NIGHT

  Yoichi has wandered off by himself.  He stops at the foot of the 
  steps, looking up-- and catches a glimpse of a pair of BARE FEET 
  running up to the second floor.  

  A guarded expression on his face, Yoichi walks slowly up the 
  stairs.  

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - TOMOKOS BEDROOM - NIGHT  

  Yoichi has wandered into Tomokos bedroom.  The lights are all off, 
  and there is an eerie feel to it.  Yoichis eyes wander about the 
  room, finally coming to rest on the TELEVISION SET.  Suddenly, he 
  hears his mothers voice from behind him.

				ASAKWAWA (O.S.) 
		Yoichi?

  Yoichi turns to face her as she approaches, puts an arm around him.

				ASAKAWA	
		What are you doing up here?  You
		shouldnt just walk into other 
		peoples rooms.

  Without replying, Yoichis gaze slowly returns to the television 
  set.  Asakawa holds him by the shoulders, turning him to meet 
  her.

				ASAKAWA	
		You go on downstairs, OK?

				YOICHI	
		OK.

  He turns to leave, and Asakawa follows.

  INT. OUSHI HOUSEHOLD - TOP OF THE STAIRS  NIGHT

  Just as Yoichi and Asakawa are about to descend the steps, 
  Asakawas CELL PHONE rings.  She opens the clasp to her PURSE.

				ASAKAWA	
			(to Yoichi) 
		You go on ahead.

				YOICHI	
		K.

  He walks down the steps.  Asakawa brings out her cell phone, 
  answers it.

				ASAKAWA	
		Hello?

				OKAZAKI	
		Uh... this is Okazaki.  Ive got 
		some more info on that article for
		you.  The girl was a student of 
		the uh, Seikei School for Women in 
		Yokahama City.

  Asakawa blinks at this, looks disturbed.


				ASAKAWA	
			(softly) 
		Thanks.

  She hangs up the phone.

  EXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT  

  Asakawa stands now at the entrance of the house.  Dazedly, she 
  walks toward a large, hand-painted PLACARD.  The placard reads 
  that the wake is being held for a student of the Seikei School 
  for Women. 

  Asakawa stares at that placard, making the mental connections.  
  She turns abruptly, walks towards a nearby TRIO of HIGH SCHOOL 
  GIRLS.

				ASAKAWA	
		Excuse me.  This is, um, kind of a
		strange question, but by any chance 
		were you friends of that young girl
		that died in the car as well?

  The three girls turn their faces to the ground.

				ASAKAWA	
		Please.  If you know anything...

				GIRL RIGHT	
		They all died the same day.  Youko.  
		Tomoko.  Even Iwata, he was in a
		motorcycle accident.

				GIRL LEFT	
		Because they watched the video.

				ASAKAWA	
		Video?

				GIRL LEFT	
		Thats what Youko said.  They all
		watched some weird video, and 
		after that their phone rang.

				ASAKAWA	
		Tomoko-chan watched it, too?  
		Where?

  Girl Left shakes her head.

				GIRL LEFT	
		She just said they all stayed 
		somewhere.

				GIRL RIGHT	
		There was a girl with Tomoko when 
		she died.  Shes had to be 
		hospitalized for shock.

				GIRL MIDDLE
		They say she wont go anywhere 
		near a television.


  INT. NEWS STATION - VIEWING BOOTH  DAY

  Asakawa and YOSHINO, another news reporter, are watching scenes 
  from the Yokohama car death.  In the footage there are lots of 
  POLICEMEN milling about, one of them trying to pick the door to 
  the passenger side.  Yoshino is giving Asakawa the blow-by-blow.

				YOSHINO
		The bodies of those found were 
		Tsuji Youko, age 17, a student of 
		the Seikei School for Women, and 
		Nomi Takehiko, age 19, preparatory 
		school student.  Both their doors 
		were securely locked.

  Onscreen, the policeman has finally picked the lock.  The door opens, 
  and a girls BODY halffalls out, head facing upwards.  Yoshino flicks 
  a BUTTON on the control panel, scans the footage frame by frame.  He 
  stops when he gets a good close-up of the victim. 

  Her face is twisted into an insane rictus of fear, mouth open, eyes 
  wide and glassy. Yoshino and Asakawa lean back in their seats.

				YOSHINO
		This is the first time Ive -ever- 
		seen something like this.

				ASAKAWA
		Cause of death?

				YOSHINO
		Couldnt say, aside from sudden 
		heart failure.

				ASAKAWA	
		Drugs?

				YOSHINO	
		The autopsy came up negative.


  Yoshino takes the video off pause.  Onscreen, a policeman has caught 
  the young girls body from completely falling out, and is pushing it 
  back into the car.  As the body moves into an upright position, we 
  can see that the girls PANTIES are mid-way around her left thigh.

				YOSHINO
		These two, about to go at it, 
		suddenly up and die for no 
		apparent reason. 

  He sighs.

				YOSHINO (contd)
		Do -you- get it?


  EXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DAY  

  Asakawas CAR is already halted before a modest-sized, two-story HOUSE 
  with a small covered parkway for a garage.  She gets out of her car, 
  closes the door.  She stares at the house, unmoving.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - DAY  

  Asakawa stands before her SISTER RYOMI, who is seated at the kitchen 
  TABLE.  Ryomi is staring blankly away, making no sign of acknowledging 
  her sister.  The silence continues unabated, and Asakawa, pensive, 
  wanders idly into the adjoining dining room.  She takes a long look at 
  the television, the same television that had puzzled Tomoko by suddenly 
  switching itself on, sitting darkly in one corner.  Her reflection in 
  the screen looks stretched, distorted.


				RYOMI	(O.S.) 
		They tell me that Yoichi came to 
		the funeral, too. 

  Asakawa steps back into the kitchen.  She addresses her sister, who 
  continues to stare out at nothing.

				ASAKAWA
		Mmm-hmm.

				RYOMI
		They used to play a lot together, didnt they?  Upstairs.

				ASAKAWA	
		Yeah...

  Ryomi lapses back into a silence.  Asakawa waits for her to say more, 
  but when it is clear that nothing else is forthcoming, she quietly gives 
  up and exits the kitchen.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  STAIRCASE - DAY  

  Asakawa climbs the steps to the second floor.  She makes her way down 
  the hall.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - TOMOKOS ROOM - DAY  

  As if intruding, Asakawa walks slowly, cautiously into Tomokos room.  
  The window to the room is open, and a single piece of folded white PAPER 
  on Tomokos desk flutters in the breeze.  Asakawa walks towards it, picks 
  it up.  It is a RECEIPT from a photo shop.  The developed photos have yet 
  to be claimed.  

  Asakawa senses something, spins to look over her shoulder.  Her sister 
  has crept quietly up the stairs and down the hall, and stands now in the 
  doorway to Tomokos room.  She appears not to notice what Asakawa has in 
  her hands, as her gaze has already shifted to the sliding closet door.  
  She regards it almost druggedly.

				RYOMI
			(haltingly) 
		This... this is where Tomoko died.

  FLASHBACK
				RYOMI (O.S.)
		Tomoko!

  Ryomis hands fling aside the CLOSET DOOR.  Within, she finds the pale 
  blue CARCASS of her daughter, curled up into an unnatural fetal position.  
  Tomokos mouth yawns gaping, her eyes glassy and rolled up into the back 
  of her head.  Her hands are caught in her hair, as if trying to pull it 
  out by the roots.  It is a horrific scene, one that says Tomoko died as 
  if from some unspeakable fear.

  PRESENT

  Ryomi sinks to her knees, hitting the wooden floor hard.  She puts her 
  face into her hands and begins sobbing loudly.  Asakawa says nothing.

  EXT. CAMERA SHOP  DAY

  Asakawa leaves the camera shop clutching Tomokos unclaimed PHOTOS.  She 
  walks out onto the sidewalk and begins flipping through them.  We see 
  Tomoko standing arm-in-arm with Iwata, her secret boyfriend. Tomoko and 
  her friends eating lunch.  The camera had its date-and-time function 
  enabled, and the photos are marked

    97 8 29.

  The next shot is of Tomoko, Iwata, and another young couple posing in 
  front of a SIGN for a bed and breakfast.  The sign reads:

    IZU PACIFIC LAND

				ASAKAWA	
		Izu...

  Asakawa continues looking through the photos, various shots of the 
  four friends clowning around in their room.  Suddenly she comes to a 
  shot taken the next day, at check out.  The friends are lined up, arms 
  linked-- and all four of their faces are blurred, distorted as if 
  someone had taken an eraser to them and tried to rub them out of 
  existence.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  KITCHEN - DAY

  Asakawa wears an APRON, and is frying something up on the STOVE.  Yoichi 
  stands watching.

				ASAKAWA	
		Look, Im probably going to be late
		coming home tonight, so just stick 
		your dinner in the microwave when 
		youre ready to eat, OK?

				YOICHI	
		K... Mom?

				ASAKAWA	
		Hmm?

				YOICHI	
		Tomo-chan watched some cursed video!


  Asakawa leaves the food on the stove, runs over to Yoichi and grabs him 
  by the shoulders.  She shakes him roughly.

				ASAKAWA	
		What did you say?  You are not to 
		speak of this at school, do you 
		hear me?

				YOICHI	
			(utterly unfazed) 
		I wont.  Im going to school now.

  Yoichi walks off.  Asakawa goes back to the stove, but stops after only 
  a few stirs, staring off and thinking.

  Caption-- September 13th.  Monday.

  EXT. ROAD  DAY

  Asakawa drives her car speedily along a narrow country road, LEAVES 
  blowing up in her wake.

  INT. ASAKAWAS CAR - DAY  

  Asakawa mutters to herself, deep in thought.

				ASAKAWA	
		Theres no way...

  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD  DAY

  Asakawas car drives past a sign reading:

	IZU PACIFIC LAND

  EXT. IZU PACIFIC LAND - DRIVEWAY  DAY

  Asakawa has left her car and is walking around the driveway of what is 
  less a bed and breakfast and more like a series of cabin-style rental 
  COTTAGES. 

  She wanders about for a while, trying to get her bearings.  She pauses 
  now in front of a particular cottage and reaches into her PURSE.  She 
  withdraws the PICTURE from the photomat, the one that showed Tomoko and 
  her friends with their faces all blurred.  The four are posing in front 
  of their cottage, marked in the photograph as B4.  Asakawa lowers the 
  photo to regard the cottage before her.

    B4

  She walks to the door, turns the handle experimentally.  Its open.  
  Asakawa walks in.

  INT. PACIFIC LAND - COTTAGE B4  DAY

  Asakawa lets her eyes wander around the cottage.  It looks very modern, 
  all wood paneling and spacious comfort.  

  Her eyes rest on the TV/VCR setup at the front of the room.  Crouching 
  before the VCR now, she presses the eject button.  Nothing happens.  
  She fingers the inside of the deck, finds it empty, then reaches behind 
  to the rear of the VCR, searching.  Again, there is nothing.  Asakawa 
  presses the power button on the television, picks up the REMOTE, and 
  takes a seat on the SOFA.  She runs through a few channels but theyre 
  all talk shows, no clues whatsoever.  She flicks the TV off and leans 
  back in the sofa, sighing.

  Just then, she spies a LEDGER on the coffee table.  These things are 
  sometimes left in hotels in Japan, so that guests can write a few 
  comments about their stay for others to read.  Asakawa picks the 
  ledger up, begins thumbing through it.  She stops at a strange PICTURE
  obviously drawn by a child, that shows three rotund, almost entirely 
  round personages.  She reads the handwritten MESSAGE.

				ASAKAWA	
		"My dad is fat.  My mom is fat.  
		Thats why Im fat, too."

  She smiles in spite of herself.  

  Asakawa flips through the rest of the ledger, but theres nothing else 
  of any import.  

  She tosses it back onto the coffee table and, sighing again, leans into 
  the sofa and closes her eyes.

  EXT. OUTDOOR CAFÉ - DUSK  

  Asakawa eats silently, alone.

  INT. PACIFIC LAND - FRONT RECEPTION - NIGHT  

  Asakawa has returned to the bed and breakfast.  As she walks in the 
  door, the COUNTER CLERK rises out of his chair to greet her.

				CLERK
		Room for one?

				ASAKAWA	
		Um, actually Im here on business.

  She passes the clerk a picture of Tomoko and her three other friends.  
  He stares at it for a moment.



				ASAKAWA
		They would have stayed here on 
		August 29th, all four of them.  
		If theres any information you 
		might have...

				CLERK
		Uh, hang on just a minute.  

  The clerk turns his back to her, begins leafing through a guest log.

				CLERK	
			(to himself) 
		August 29th...

  While she waits, Asakawas eyes start to wander around the room.  
  Behind the desk is a sign reading Rental Video, and a large wooden 
  BOOKSHELF filled with VIDEOTAPES. They are all in their original boxes, 
  and she lets her eyes glance over the titles.  Raiders of the Lost Ark, 
  48 Hours--

  --and then, suddenly, she spies a VIDEOTAPE in a plain, unmarked 
  sleeve, tucked away in the back of the very bottom shelf.  She feels 
  the hairs on the back of her neck rise.

				ASAKAWA	
		That...

  The clerk looks up.

				CLERK
		Hmm?

  Asakawa stabs a finger excitedly towards the shelf.


				ASAKAWA
		That!  What tape is that?

  The clerk reaches out for it, grabs it.

				CLERK	
		This?  Hmm...

  The clerk pulls the tape out of its SLEEVE and checks for a label.  
  Its unmarked.

				CLERK
		Maybe one of the guests left it behind

  INT. PACIFIC LAND  COTTAGE B4 - NIGHT 

  Asakawa flips on the TV.  Its on channel 2, and there is nothing but 
  static. She kneels down to slide the tape into the deck and pauses a 
  moment, framed in the vaguely spectral LIGHT from the television 
  screen.  Steeling her nerves, she puts the tape into the machine, picks 
  up the remote, and presses play.


  NOTE: This next scene is entirely visual.  If you are reading this 
  translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; STOP 
  reading this now and watch the scene for itself.  Afterwards, you can 
  come back here to check the meaning of the Japanese characters 
  displayed.


  THE VIDEOTAPE

  At first it looks like nothing has happened-- then Asakawa realizes that 
  she is now viewing recorded static instead of broadcast static.  She 
  watches, waiting, but the static continues unbroken.  Asakawa looks 
  down at the remote, is about to press fast forward, when suddenly the 
  picture on the screen clears and for a moment she thinks shes looking 
  at the moon.

  Its not the moon at all, she realizes.  The shape is round like a full 
  moon, but it seems to be made up of thin RIBBONS of cloud streaking 
  against a night sky.  And theres a FACE, she sees, a face hidden in 
  shadows, looking down from above.  

  What is this?

  The scene changes now, and Asakawa notes that the tape has that kind of 
  grainy quality one sees in 3rd or 4th generation copies.  The scene is of 
  a WOMAN brushing her long hair before an oval-shaped MIRROR.  The nerve-
  wracking grating as if of some giant metallic insect sounds in the 
  background, but the lady doesnt seem to notice.  The mirror the lady is 
  using to brush her hair suddenly changes position from the left part of 
  the wall before which she stands, to the right.  Almost instantly the 
  mirror returns to its original position, but in that one moment in its 
  changed location we see a small FIGURE in a white GOWN.  The woman turns 
  towards where that figure stood, and smiles.

  The screen next becomes a twitching, undulating impenetrable sea of the 
  kanji characters used in the Japanese language.  Asakawa can pick out 
  only two things recognizable:

    local     volcanic eruption

  Now the screen is awash in PEOPLE-- crawling, scrabbling, shambling 
  masses, some of them moving in reverse.  A sound like moaning accompanies 
  them.
  -

  A FIGURE stands upon a shore, its face shrouded.  It points accusingly, 
  not towards the screen, but at something unseen off to one side.  The 
  insect-like screeching sounds louder. 
  --

  Close up on inhuman, alien-looking EYE.  Inside that eye a single 
  character is reflected in reverse:  SADA, meaning "chastity."

  The eye blinks once, twice.  The symbol remains.
  ---

  A long shot of an outdoor, uncovered WELL.
  ----

  Sudden loud, blinding STATIC as the tape ends.

  Asakawa turns the TV off, looking physically drained.  She sighs shakily 
  and slumps forward, resting on her knees.  Just then, she glances at the 
  television screen.  She sees, reflected, a small FIGURE in a white gown 
  standing at the rear of the room.  Shocked, Asakawa draws in breath, 
  spins around.

  The room is empty.  Asakawa runs to the sofa to collect her jacket--

  --and the RINGING of the telephone stops her dead in her tracks.  Zombie-
  like, she walks towards the telephone, picks it up wordlessly.  

  From the other end comes the same metallic, insectoid SQUEAKING heard on 
  the video.  Asakawa slams the phone down and glances up at the CLOCK.  
  Its about seven minutes after 7 P.M.

				ASAKAWA	
			(to herself) 
		One week

  Asakawa grabs her coat, pops the tape out of the deck, and runs out the 
  door.

  EXT. STREET  DAY

  It is dark and raining heavily.  Yoichi, Asakawas son, is walking to 
  school, UMBRELLA firmly in hand.  The sidewalk is quite narrow, and Yoichi 
  comes to a halt when a second PERSON comes from the opposite direction, 
  blocking his way. Yoichi slowly raises his umbrella, peers up to look at 
  this other pedestrian.  It is a MAN, a BAG slung over one shoulder.  He 
  has a beard; unusual for Japan where clean-shaven is the norm.  

  The two continue looking directly at each other, neither moving nor 
  speaking.  Yoichi then walks around the persons left and continues on his
   way.  The man resumes walking as well.

  Caption-- September 14th.  Tuesday.

  EXT. OUTSIDE AN APARTMENT DOOR - DAY  

  The bearded man, whose name is RYUJI, reaches out to press the DOORBELL, 
  but the door has already opened from within.  Asakawa leans out, holding 
  the door open for him.  Neither of them speaks.  Wordlessly, Ryuji enters 
  the apartment.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - DAY  

  Ryuji puts his bag down, looks around the apartment.  The interior is dark, 
  ominous somehow.  He takes his JACKET off and wanders into the living room.  
  Asakawa is in the kitchen behind him, preparing TEA.  Ryuji spies the 
  collection of FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS in living room.

				RYUJI
		Yoichis in elementary school 
		already, is he?

				ASAKAWA	
		His first year.  What about you, 
		Ryuji?  How have you been 
		recently?

				RYUJI		
		Same as always.

  She takes a seat next to him, serves the tea.  On the coffee table 
  before them is a VIDEOTAPE in a plain, unmarked case.

				ASAKAWA
		And money is...?

				RYUJI
		Im teaching at university.

  Ryuji picks up his cup of tea but stops, grimacing, before it is to his 
  lips.  He rubs his forehead as if experiencing a sudden headache.  Ryuji 
  shakes it off and quickly regains his composure.

				RYUJI
		Anyway.  You said that the phone rang?

				ASAKAWA
		Thats right.

				RYUJI		
		So if I watch it too, that phone over 
		there--

  He gestures with his mug 

				RYUJI (contd)
		--should ring.

				ASAKAWA
		Ryuji, four people have already 
		died.  On the same day!

				RYUJI
			(flippant) 
		Well, why dont you try calling 
		an exorcist?

  He takes a sip of his tea.  Asakawa reaches quickly, grabs something 
  from the bookshelf behind her-- a POLAROID CAMERA.    She shoves it 
  into Ryujis hands, then turns to look down at the floor.

				ASAKAWA	
		Take my picture.

  Ryuji raises the camera to his eye.

				RYUJI		
		Turn this way.


				ASAKAWA	
			(unmoving) 
		Hurry up and take it.

  Ryuji snaps off a shot.  It comes out the other end and he takes it, 
  waits impatiently for an image to appear.  When it does, all he can 
  do is pass it wordlessly over to Asakawa.  Her face is twisted, 
  misshapen.  

  Just like the picture of Tomoko and her friends.

  Asakawa stares at it, horrified.  By the time she finally looks up, 
  Ryuji has already risen from his seat and slid the videotape into the 
  VCR.  Again, the screen is filled with static, only to be replaced 
  with what looks like the moon.  Asakawa slams the Polaroid on the 
  coffee table and goes outside onto the veranda.  

  EXT. VERANDA - DAY  

  Asakawa stares out at a view of the houses shaded in cloud and rain. 
  There is a knock on the glass door behind her.  A moment later, 
  Ryuji slides the door open.

				RYUJI		
		Its over.

  Asakawa re-enters her apartment.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

				RYUJI		
		Well, it looks like your phones not 
		ringing.

  Ryuji pops the tape from the deck, hands it to Asakawa.

				RYUJI	
		Make me a copy of this, will you?  
		Id like to do a little research
		of my own. Theres no reason to 
		write us off as dead just yet. 

  He dramatically takes a seat.

				RYUJI	(contd)
		If theres a video, that means that 
		somebody had to make it.

				ASAKAWA	
		Theres the guest list from the 
		cottage to look into... and the 
		possibility of someone hacking 
		into the local stations broadcast 
		signals.

  Asakawa pulls a NOTEPAD from her purse and begins busily scribbling 
  away.


  INT. NEWS STATION - DAY  

  Okazaki putters around.

  Caption- September 15th.  Tuesday.

  INT. NEWS STATION - VIEWING BOOTH  DAY

  Asakawa sits by herself, reviewing the videotape.  She is replaying 
  the very last scene, an outdoor shot of a well.  She stares at it 
  carefully, and notices...

  The tape ends, filling the screen with static.  A split-second 
  afterwards, there is a KNOCK on the door and Okazaki enters, holding 
  a FILE.  Asakawa momentarily forgets about the video.

				OKAZAKI	
			(handing her the file)
		Heres that guest list you wanted.

				ASAKAWA	
		Oh, thanks.

				OKAZAKI	
		What are you gonna do with this?

				ASAKAWA	
		Uh... sorry, Im working on 
		something personal.

  EXT. IN FRONT OF A TRAIN STATION - DAY  

  Some quick shots of a FOUNTAIN gushing water, PIGEONS flapping away 
  looking agitated.  CUT to Ryuji sitting on a BENCH.  Hes deep in 
  thought, writing in a NOTEPAD. There are multitudes of PEOPLE about 
  him, and we can hear the sounds of their coming and going.  A PAIR 
  OF LEGS attached to a woman in white dress, hose, and pumps appears, 
  heading directly for Ryuji.  Her pace is slow, rhythmical, and as 
  that pace progresses all other sounds FADE into the background, so 
  that all we can hear is the CLOMP, CLOMP as those legs walk to stand 
  just before Ryuji.  The pumps are scuffed, dirtied with grime.  

  A gust of WIND rips by.  Ryuji fights the urge to look up as in his 
  ears rings the same hollowed, multi-voiced BABBLING heard on the 
  videotape.  The sound grows stronger.

				RYUJI (VO)
 		So, it was you.  You did it.

  The babbling fades, disappears as slowly the worlds normal 
  background sounds return.  Ryuji looks up, but the woman in white 
  is nowhere to be seen.

  EXT. OUTSIDE RYUJIS APARTMENT  AFTERNOON

  Ryuji rides up on a BICYCLE. He turns the corner towards his 
  apartment and finds Asakawa seated on the steps, waiting for him.

				RYUJI		
		Hey.

  Asakawa notes in his face that something is wrong.

				ASAKAWA
 		What happened to you?

				RYUJI
			(gruffly)
		Nothing.

  He enters the building, carrying his bicycle.  Asakawa follows.

  INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON  

  The two walk down the hallway towards the FRONT DOOR to Ryujis 
  apartment.  He unlocks the door and they enter.

  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  AFTERNOON

  Ryuji and Asakawa enter the living room.

				RYUJI
		So, whatd you come up with?

				ASAKAWA
		I dont think any of the guests on 
		the list brought the tape with them.  
		I couldnt confirm it face-to-face 
		of course, but even over the phone I 
		got the feeling they were all being 
		upfront with me.

 				RYUJI
		How about the other angle?  Pirate 
		signals or...

  Asakawa shakes her head.

				ASAKAWA
		Therere no traces of any illegal 
		television signals being broadcast 
		around Izu. 

  She reaches into her purse, pulls out a large white ENVELOPE.


				ASAKAWA
		Heres that copy of the videotape 
		you wanted.

  Ryuji tears the package open.  He squats down on the tatami in 
  frontof his TV and slides the tape in.  Asakawa sits on the 
  tatami as well, but positions herself away from the TV and keeps 
  her eyes averted.  Ryuji glares over his shoulder at her.

				RYUJI
			(sternly) 
		Asakawa.

  She reluctantly scoots closer, looks up at the screen.  Ryuji 
  fast-forwards the tape a bit, stopping at the scene where the 
  woman is brushing her long hair before an oval mirror.  He puts 
  the video on frame-by-frame. 

				RYUJI
		Have you ever seen this woman?

  Asakawa regards the screen intently.

				ASAKAWA
 		No...

  The tape advances to the scene where the mirror suddenly changes 
  positions.  When it does, we can again see the small figure in the 
  white gown, a figure with long black hair. When Ryuji sees this 
  his body stiffens, becomes tense.  Asakawa notices but says nothing.  
  She also notices something else.

				ASAKAWA
			(excitedly) 
		Theres something strange about 
		this shot.

  She takes the remote from Ryuji, rewinds it a ways.  Onscreen, the 
  woman begins coming her long hair again.

				ASAKAWA	
		From this angle, the mirror should 
		be reflecting whoevers filming.

				RYUJI		
		So, what does that mean?

  Asakawa lets out a short sigh.

				ASAKAWA	
		Well, if the person who made this 
		is a pro, thered be a way around 
		that, I guess, but still...

  The screen changes, showing the mass of squiggling kanji characters 
  again.

				RYUJI		
			(reading) 
		Volcanic eruption... Eruption where?

  He pauses the screen, trying to make sense of what is written.


				ASAKAWA	
		This is gonna be impossible to figure 
		out on just a regular TV screen, 
		dont you think?

  They are both still staring at the screen when from behind them comes 
  the SOUND of someone opening the front door.  Ryuji turns off the TV, 
  ejects the tape from the deck.

				RYUJI	
		Come on in.

  Asakawa flashes a look at Ryuji and then turns her head back towards 
  the front door to see who has entered.  A cute, nervous-looking young 
  GIRL with short hair approaches slowly.  She is carrying a PLASTIC BAG 
  filled with groceries.

				RYUJI	
		Asakawa, meet my student, Takano Mai.

  He turns, addresses Mai.

				RYUJI	(contd)	
		This is Asakawa, my ex-wife.

  Ryuji gets up and walks conveniently away.

				MAI		
		Nice to meet you.  Im Takano.

				ASAKAWA	
		Asakawa. *


  > * As you may already be aware, Japanese name order is the 
  >opposite of Englishs, and even close friends may continue to
  >address one another by their last names.  Incidentally, Asakawas
  >first name is Reiko.  In this scene, Mai deferentially refers
  >to Ryuji as sensei, meaning teacher.


  Mai sets the bag of groceries down and chases after Ryuji.  He is 
  putting on his jacket and getting ready to leave.

				MAI	
		Sensei, the people from the 
		publishing company called about 
		the deadline on your thesis again. 

				RYUJI		
			(brusquely) 
		Whatre they talkin to you 
		about it for?

				MAI		
		Because they can never get a 
		hold of you.

  Ryuji picks up his keys, video firmly in hand.

				RYUJI		
		Ask them to wait another week.

				MAI		
		Sensei, ask them yourself, 
		please.

  Ryuji is already headed for the door.  His back is to her as he 
  responds.

				RYUJI	
		OK, OK.

  Asakawa walks after him.  They leave.

  Mai pouts unhappily a bit, and then breaks into a smile as an idea 
  crosses her mind.  She walks across the room to where Ryuji has set 
  up a large BLACKBOARD filled with mathematical equations.  Grinning, 
  Mai rubs out part of one equation with her sleeve and writes in a 
  new value.

  INT. NEWS STATION  HALLWAY - NIGHT  

  Asakawa and Ryuji stride purposefully.  They stop before a DOOR to 
  the right, which Asakawa unlocks.  They both walk in.

  INT. NEWS STATION - VIEWING BOOTH - NIGHT 

  Asakawa and Ryuji sit in a completely darkened room, their eyes 
  glued to the television MONITOR.  They are again watching the scene 
  with the fragmented kanji characters, but despite their efforts have 
  been able to identify only one additional word, bringing the total 
  to three:

	volcanic eruption	  local	     residents

				RYUJI		
		This is impossible.

  Ryuji fast forwards, stopping at the scene with the kanji reflected
  inside an alien-looking EYE.  He reads the kanji aloud. 

				RYUJI
		Sada... 

  Ryuji moves to make a note of this, notices the time.

				RYUJI
		Is Yoichi gonna be all right?

				ASAKAWA	
			(sadly) 
		Hes used to it...

  Short silence.  Ryuji breaks it by gesturing towards the screen. 


				RYUJI
		Whoever made this had to have left 
		some kind of clue behind.  Theyre 
		probably waiting for us to find it.

  Asakawa turns a DIAL to bring up the volume, which up until now has 
  been  on mute.  The room is filled with an eerie, metallic GRATING, 
  and Asakawa spins the dial again, shutting it off.  Just as she does, 
  Ryujis eyes widen.

				RYUJI	
		Wait a minute.

  He turns the dial again, punches a few buttons as if searching for 
  something.  He listens carefully, and when he hears that strange 
  something again he stops, looks at the screen.

  It is paused at the scene with the figure, pointing, a CLOTH draped 
  over its head.  The figure now looks oddly like a messenger.

  Ryuji and Asakawa exchange glances.  This could be it.  Ryuji flips 
  some more switches, setting the sound for super-slow mo.  What follows 
  is a strange, labored sort of speech- a hidden message-- framed in 
  the skittering distortion of the tape in slow motion. 

				TAPE	
		Shoooomonnn bakkkkkarrri toou...  
		boooouuuukonn ga kuuru zouuu...

				RYUJI	
			(repeating) 
		Shoumon bakkari, boukon ga kuru 
		zo.  Did you hear that, too?

  Asakawa nods.  Ryuji is already writing it down excitedly.

				ASAKAWA	
		What does that mean?

  Ryuji tears the sheet of paper off the notepad, folds it, and tucks 
  it into his shirt pocket.

				RYUJI		
		Im gonna check it out.

  EXT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT COMPLEX - MORNING  

  Yoichi is walking to school.  He looks back over his shoulder, just 
  once,then resumes walking.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - MORNING

  All the lights are turned off, and she is sitting on the living room 
  couch watching the footage of her café interview with the junior high 
  school girls.  

  Caption-- September 16th.  Thursday.

  Just when the girl in the interview mentions that whomever watches 
  the video is supposed to afterwards receive a phone call, Asakawas 
  own phone RINGS, startling her. She runs to answer it.

				ASAKAWA	
		Hello?

				RYUJI (O.S.)
		Ive got it.  Its a dialect, just 
		like I thought.  SHOUMON means 
		playing in the water and BOUKON
 		means monster. *


  >* Translated from standard Japanese, the phrase from the videotape 
  >would initially have sounded like, "If only SHOUMON then the 
  >BOUKON will come."  These two capitalized words, later identified to 
  >be dialectical, were at the time completely incomprehensible to Ryuji 
  >and Asakawa.  Dialect can vary dramatically from region to region in 
  >Japan, to the point of speakers of different dialect being unable to
  >understand one another.  

  >The phrase on the tape can now be rendered, "If you keep playing in 
  >the water, the monster will come for you."


				ASAKAWA	
		But, dialect from where?

				RYUJI	
		Oshima.  And the site of our 
		eruption is Mt. Mihara.

  INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT  

  Ryuji and Asakawa are seated at cubicles, looking through bound 
  ARCHIVES of old newspaper articles.  Asakawa sneaks a look at Ryuji, 
  stands up and walks off a little ways.  She has already pulled out her 
  cell phone.

				ASAKAWA	
			(whispering, on phone) 
		Yoichi?  Im gonna be a little 
		late tonight, honey. 

  Ryuji looks over his shoulder at her, scowls.

				ASAKAWA
		You can do it yourself, right?  OK.  
		Sorry.  Bye.

  She hangs up, returns to her seat at the cubicle.  She resumes her 
  scanning of the newspaper articles, and Ryuji shoots her another scowl.  
  Asakawa turns a page and then stops, frowning.  She has spied an article 
  that looks like...

  Nervously, Asakawa puts the thumb and forefinger of each hand together, 
  forming the shape of a rectangle.  Or a screen.  She places the rectangle
  over the article she has just discovered, its headlines reading:

    Mount Mihara Erupts 	Local Residents Urged to Take Precautions

  Ryuji notices her, leans forward excitedly.

				ASAKAWA	
		Ive got it!  This old article...

  The two scan the remainder of the page, and find a smaller, related 
  article.	

    Did Local Girl Predict Eruption?
    A young lady from Sashikiji prefecture...

  The two read over both articles, absorbing the details.  Ryuji stands 
  suddenly, gathering his things.

				ASAKAWA
		What are you doing?

				RYUJI		
		Has your newspaper got someone out 
		there at Oshima?

				ASAKAWA	
		I think so.  There should be a 
		correspondent out there.

				RYUJI	
		I need you to find out, and let me 
		know how to get hold of him.
		Tonight.

  He begins walking briskly away.  Asakawa chases after him.

				ASAKAWA	
		What do you think youre--?

				RYUJI	
			(angrily) 
		Youve only got four days left, 
		Asakawa!  Your newspaper contact 
		and I can handle this from here 
		on out.  You just stay with Yoichi.

  Ryuji strides off.  Asakawa stands motionless.

  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY  

  A car speeds along.  CUT to a gravel DRIVEWAY leading up to a wooden, 
  traditional-style HOUSE.  Kouichi, Asakawas father, is standing before 
  the entrance and puttering around in his GARDEN.  The car from the 
  previous shot drives up, comes to a halt.  The passenger door opens and 
  Yoichi hops out, running towards the old man.  Asakawa walks leisurely 
  after her son.


				YOICHI	
		Grandpa!

				KOUICHI	
		Whoa, there!  So, you made it, huh?

  Caption-- September 17th.  Friday.

				ASAKAWA
		Yoichi says hes looking forward to 
		doing some fishing with you.

				KOUICHI	
		Is that so?

  Yoichi begins tugging excitedly at his grandfathers arm.

				YOICHI	
		Cmon grandpa, lets go!

				KOUICHI	
		OK, OK.  Well get our things 
		together and then we can go.


  EXT. RIVER  DAY  

  Asakawa stands on a RIVERBANK while her father and Yoichi, GUMBOOTS on, 
  are ankle-deep in a shallow river.  Yoichi holds a small NET, and 
  Asakawas dad is pointing and chattering excitedly. 

				KOUICHI
		There he is!  Cmon, there he is, 
		dont let him go!

  Yoichi tries to scoop up the fish his grandfather is pointing out.

				KOUICHI
		Oh, oh!  Ah... guess he got away, 
		huh?

				YOICHI	
		That was your fault, grandpa.

  Asakawas father laughs.

				KOUICHI	
		Well, whaddya say we try again?

  He begins sloshing noisily out to the center of the stream, Yoichi in 
  tow.

				KOUICHI
		Well get im this time.

  Asakawa looks away, pensive.

  INT. KOUICHIS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT  

  Yoichi is passed out asleep on the tatami mats.  A TELEVISION looms 
  inone corner of the living room, but it is switched off.  The 
  SLIDING DOORS to the adjacent guest room are open and we can see 
  futons set out, ready for bed.

  Asakawa enters the living room and, seeing Yoichi, scoops him up in
  her arms and carries him over to the guest room.

				YOICHI
			(sleepily) 
		How was work, mommy?

  Asakawa tucks him into the futons and walks silently off.

  INT. KOUICHIS HOUSE - STAIRCASE  NIGHT  

  Asakawa stands at the foot of the staircase, telephone RECEIVER in 
  hand.  The phone rests on a small STAND by the staircase.

				ASAKAWA	
		Hello?

				RYUJI (O.S.)
		Yeah.  Your Oshima contact came 
		through.  It looks like the woman 
		who predicted the Mihara eruption 
		is the same woman from the video.

  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  NIGHT

  Ryuji is crouched in front of the TV, REMOTE in hand.  The screen is 
  paused on the scene of the woman brushing her long hair.

				RYUJI
		Her name is Yamamura Shizuko.  She 
		committed suicide forty years ago 
		by throwing herself into Mt. Mihara.

  INT. KOUJIS HOUSE  STAIRCASE - NIGHT  

				ASAKAWA
		Have you got anything else?

				RYUJI (O.S.) 
		Im gonna have to check it for 
		myself.  Ill be leaving for 
		Oshima tomorrow morning.

				ASAKAWA
		Oshima?  Ive only got three days 
		left!

				RYUJI (O.S.)
		I know.  And Ive got four.

  Short silence.

				RYUJI (O.S.)
		Ill be in touch.

  Ryuji hangs up.  Asakawa, deep in thought, slowly places the phone 
  back in its CRADLE.  She turns around to walk back down the hallway 
  only to find her father standing there, face full of concern.

				KOUJI
		Whats happened?

  Asakawa shakes her head.

				ASAKAWA
		Nothing.  I just had some things 
		left over from work.

  She walks past her father, who glances worriedly after her over his 
  shoulder.

  INT. KOUJIS HOUSE - GUEST ROOM  NIGHT

  The lights are all off and Asakawa is asleep in her futon.  Her eyes 
  suddenly fly open as a VOICE sounding eerily like her deceased niece 
  Tomoko calls out to her.


				TOMOKO (O.S.) 
		Auntie?

  Asakawa looks around the room, gets her bearings.  Her eyes fall on 
  the futon next to hers.

				ASAKAWA
		Yoichi?

  There is a BODY in that futon, but it is full-grown, dressed all in 
  black.  It is curled into a fetal position and has its head turned 
  away.

  Suddenly, the IMAGE from the video of the figure with its face 
  shrouded springs to Asakawas mind.  Just an instant, its pointing 
  visage materializes, and then disappears.  It reappears a moment 
  later, pointing more insistently now, and disappears again.  

  Asakawa blinks her eyes and realizes that the futon next to hers is 
  empty.  Yoichi is nowhere to be seen.

  Just then, she hears that high-pitched, metallic SQUEAKING from the 
  video.  Eyes wide with horror, she flings the sliding doors apart--
  --and there, seated before the television, is Yoichi.

  He is watching the video.

  It is already at the very last scene, the shot of the outdoor well. 
  CLOSEUP on the screen now, and for just an instant we can see that 
  something is trying to claw its way out of the well.  The video cuts 
  off, and the screen fills with static.  

  Shrieking, Asakawa races over to Yoichi, covers his eyes though it is 
  already too late.  She scoots over to the VCR, ejects the tape and 
  stares at it uncomprehendingly.  She is then at Yoichis side again, 
  shaking him roughly.

				ASAKAWA
		Yoichi!  You brought this with you, 
		didnt you?  Why?!?

				YOICHI	
		Tomo-chan...

  Asakawa freezes, her eyes wide.

				YOICHI	
		Tomo-chan told me to watch it.

  EXT. OCEAN  DAY
  
  WAVES are being kicked up by a large PASSENGER SHIP as it speeds on 
  its way.  CUT to Asakawa and Ryuji standing on deck, looking out over 
  the waves.

				RYUJI	
		I shouldve been more careful.  
		When I was at your place that 
		day, I could feel something 
		there.  I thought it was just 
		because of the video... 

				ASAKAWA	
		You mean that Tomoko

				RYUJI		
		Thats not Tomoko.  Not anymore.



				ASAKAWA	
		Yoichi... he can see them too, 
		cant he?

  Ryuji nods his head, lowers it sadly.

				ASAKAWA	
		Its all my fault.  First Tomoko 
		died, then those three others.  It 
		should have stopped there, but it 
		didnt.  Because of me.

				RYUJI	
		I wonder...

  Asakawa turns to Ryuji suddenly.

				ASAKAWA
		How did the rumors about the 
		video even start in the first 
		place?


				RYUJI	
		This kind of thing... it doesnt 
		start by one person telling a 
		story.  Its more like everyones 
		fear just takes on a life of its 
		own.

				ASAKAWA	
		Fear...

				RYUJI
		Or maybe its not fear at all.  
		Maybe its what we were 
		secretly hoping for all along.

  EXT. PORT  DAY  

  The ship has docked, its GANGPLANK extended.  Ryuji and Asakawa walk 
  the length of the gangplank towards the shore.  A man named MR. 
  HAYATSU is already waiting for them.  He holds up a white SIGNBOARD 
  in both hands.
 
				ASAKAWA	
		Mr. Hayatsu?

				HAYATSU	
		Aah, welcome!  You must be tired 
		after your long trip.  Please, 
		this way.

  Mr. Hayatsu leads Asakawa and Ryuji to an awaiting minivan.

  Caption-- September 18th.  Saturday.

  INT. HAYATSUS MINIVAN - DAY  

  Ryuji and Asakawa sit in the back.  Mr. Hayatsu is behind the wheel, 
  chattering away.

				HAYATSU	
		Back in the old days, the Yamamuras
		used to head fishing boats out in 
		Sashikiji, though they dont much 
		anymore.  You know, one of Shizukos 
		cousins is still alive. Hes just an 
		old man now.  His son and his 
		daughter-in-law run an old-fashioned 
		inn.  I went ahead and booked 
		reservations for yall, hope thats 
		alright...

  Asakawa gives the briefest of nods in reply, after which the 
  minivan lapses into silence.  Asakawa looks dreamily out at the 
  mountain-studded landscape, then suddenly snaps to.

				ASAKAWA
			(to Ryuji) 
		Why did Yamamura Shizuko commit 
		suicide?

				RYUJI	
		She was taking a real beating 
		in the press, being called a 
		fraud and all sorts of names.  
		After a while she just lost it. 

  CUT to a scene of the minivan speeding along a country road.

  INT. HAYATSUS MINIVAN  DAY 

				RYUJI
		Shizuko was getting a lot of 
		attention around the island after
		predicting the eruption of Mt. 
		Mihara.  Seems that for some time 
		shed had a rather unique ability:
		precognition. It was around then
		that she attracted the attention 
		of a certain scholar whom you may 
		have heard of; Ikuma Heihachiro.   

				ASAKAWA
		He was driven out of the university, 
		wasnt he?

  Ryuji nods.

				RYUJI
		This Professor Ikuma convinces 
		Shizuko to go to Tokyo with him, 
		where he uses her in a series of 
		demonstrations meant to prove the 
		existence of ESP.  At first shes 
		the darling of the press, but the 
		next thing you know theyre 
		knocking her down, calling her a 
		fraud.  Hmph.  Forty years later,
		the media still hasnt changed that
		much.

  Asakawa continues, ignoring Ryujis barb.

				ASAKAWA
		Ive heard this story.  But... Im 
		sure I remember hearing that somebody 
		died at one of those demonstrations.

  A strange look crosses Ryujis face.  He looks away, ignores her 
  for a moment.

				RYUJI
		After getting kicked out of 
		university, Ikuma just vanished, 
		and no ones been able to get hold 
		of him since.  Hes probably not 
		even alive anymore.

				ASAKAWA
		But, why even try looking for him?

				RYUJI
		Because hes supposed to have had a 
		child with Shizuko.  A daughter.

  Asakawa freezes.  In her mind, she sees a small FIGURE dressed in 
  white, its face hidden by long, black HAIR.  It is the figure from 
  the video.

  EXT. OUTSIDE YAMAMURA VILLA - DAY  

  Mr. Hayatsu leads Asakawa and Ryuji to the entrance.

				HAYATSU	
		Hello?

  The INKEEPER, a middle-aged lady named KAZUE wearing a traditional 
  KIMONO, comes shuffling up.  She addresses Mr. Hayatsu.

				KAZUE	
		Thank you.

  She turns to Asakawa and Ryuji.

				KAZUE (contd)
		Welcome.

				HAYATSU
		Well, Ill be off then.

  He gives a little bow and is off.  Kazue, meanwhile, has produced 
  two pairs of SLIPPERS, which she offers to Ryuji and Asakawa.

				KAZUE
		Please.

  Ryuji and Asakawa begin removing their shoes. 

  INT. YAMAMURA VILLA  STAIRCASE - DAY  

  Kazue leads Ryuji and Asakawa up a shadowed, wooden STAIRCASE.

				KAZUE
		And for your rooms, how shall we...? 

				RYUJI
		Separate, please.

				KAZUE
		Sir.

  INT. YAMAMURA VILLA - 2ND FLOOR  DAY

  Kazue gives a little bow.

				KAZUE
		This way.

  Kazue turns to the right.  Almost immediately after reaching the 
  top of the steps, however, a strange look crosses Ryujis face.  
  He heads down the opposite end of the corridor, Asakawa close 
  behind.

				KAZUE
			(alarmed) 
		Sir!

  Ryuji flings open the SLIDING DOOR to one of the older rooms.  There, 
  hanging from one of the walls, is the oval-shaped MIRROR from the 
  video, the one used by the mysterious lady to brush her long hair.  
  Ryuji stares at the mirror, almost wincing.  He turns around as if 
  to look at Asakawa,but continues turning, looks past her.  Asakawa 
  follows his gaze, as does Kazue.  Standing at the end of the corridor 
  is an old man, MR. YAMAMURA. 

  Yamamura regards them silently, balefully.  Breaking the silence, 
  Kazue gestures for Asakawa and Ryuji to follow.

				KAZUE
			(softly) 
		Please, this way.

  Asakawa races past the innkeeper towards the old man.  He keeps his 
  back turned towards her.

				ASAKAWA
		Please!  If you could just answer 
		a few questions, about Shizuko...

				YAMAMURA
		I got nuthin to say.

				ASAKAWA
		Its about Shizukos daughter.

  The old man says nothing.

				ASAKAWA
		She did have a daughter, didnt she?

  Yamamura regards her for a moment, then turns to walk away.

				YAMAMURA	
  		Youre wasting your time.

  INT. YAMAMURA VILLA - DINING ROOM  NIGHT

  The TABLE is laid out with an elaborate-looking DINNER.  Asakawa 
  sits alone, knees curled up to her chin, eyes wide and frightened.  
  She is whimpering softly to herself.  Just then, the DOOR slides 
  open and Ryuji walks in.  He sits at the table and picks up a 
  pair of CHOPSTICKS.

				RYUJI		
		Arent you gonna eat?

				ASAKAWA	
		Umm...

				RYUJI		
		Hm?

				ASAKAWA	
		Youll stay with me wont you?  
		When its time for me to die.

				RYUJI		
		Oh, stop it.

  Asakawa scoots across the tatami mats towards the table, grabs 
  Ryuji fiercely by the arm.

				ASAKAWA
		Youll stay, wont you?  If you 
		stayed, maybe youd learn something
		that could help Yoichi--

				RYUJI
		I said stop it!  Have you forgotten 
		There was a girl with Tomoko when 
		she died?  That girls now in a 
		mental institution.  Who knows what 
		could happen. 

				ASAKAWA	
		But you could stay with me, Ryuji.  
		Youd be OK.


				RYUJI
			(angrily)
		Why, because Im already not 
		right in the head?

  Asakawa releases her hold on Ryujis arm, lowers her head.  Ryuji 
  slams his chopsticks down angrily.

				RYUJI	
		If thats the case, why not just
		let things run its course, get rid
		of father -and- son?  Yoichi was a
		mistake, anyway.

				ASAKAWA
		Stop it!

  Short silence.  When Ryuji speaks up again, his voice is soft, 
  reassuring.

				RYUJI	
		We still have two days left...

  Just then the VOICE of the innkeeper calls tentatively out from 
  the other side of the sliding door.

				KAZUE (O.S.) 
		Excuse me?

				RYUJI	
		Come in.

  Kazue slides the door open.  She stands hesitantly in the doorway, 
  something tucked under one arm.


				KAZUE	
		Its about Miss Shizuko.  

  Ryuji shoots a glance at Asakawa and stands up from the table, 
  walks towards the innkeeper.

				KAZUE	
		This is all that there is...

  Kazue produces an old black and white PHOTOGRAPH.  The photo shows a 
  WOMAN, seated, dressed in a KIMONO.  A MAN in a Western-style SUIT 
  stands beside her.  

				RYUJI	
		Is this Professor Ikuma?

  Hearing this Asakawa leaps up, walks over to examine the picture for 
  herself.

				KAZUE
		...yes.  This picture is from before 
		Id entered the household.  

  She pauses a moment.

				KAZUE (contd)
		I should go now.

  The innkeeper scuttles off, leaving Asakawa and Ryuji alone with the 
  photograph.  Unbidden, the VOICE from the video enters their 
  thoughts.

				VOICE
		Shoumon bakkari... boukon ga kuru zo...


  EXT. IZU SEASHORE - DAY

  Asakawa watches Ryuji stride down the shore.

  Caption-- September 19th.  Monday.

  Ryuji strolls up to find old man Yamamura sitting alone, staring 
  out at the sea.  Yamamura glances up to see Ryuji approaching.  
  Ryuji takes a seat next to the old man, but its Yamamura who speaks 
  first.  The deep basso of his voice emphasizes the drawl of his 
  accent.

				YAMAMURA	
		Yalld do best to be off soon.  
		Seas probably gonna be rough 
		tonight.

				RYUJI		
		What kind of a child was Shizuko?

				YAMAMURA 
		Shizuko was... different.  Shed come 
		out here by herself everday an just
		stare out at the ocean.  The fishermen 
		all took a dislikin to her.  Oceans 
		an unlucky place for us, ysee: every 
		year it swallows up more of our own. 
		You keep starin out at somethin 
		ike that... 

				RYUJI
      		Shoumon bakkari shiteru to, boukon ga 
		kuru zo.  If you keep playing in the 
		water, the monster will come for you.

  Yamamura looks at Ryuji, surprised.  

				RYUJI
		Shizuko could see inside people, 
		couldnt she?  Down to the places 
		theyd most like to keep hidden.  It 
		must have been difficult for her...

  Yamamura rises unsteadily to his feet, features twisted angrily.

				YAMAMURA
 		Please leave!  Now!

  Ryuji stands, takes hold of Yamamuras arm.

				RYUJI
		Ive got a little of that ability 
		myself.  It was you who spread the 
		word about Shizuko, wasnt it?  
		And you who first contacted 
		Professor Ikuma?

				YAMAMURA	
		Whatre you--?

				RYUJI
		You thought youd be able to make 
		some money off her.  You even got 
		some, from one of the newspapers.

				YAMAMURA		
		Leave me the hell alone!

  Mr. Yamamura strides angrily off.  Both Ryuji and Asakawa take 
  pursuit, Ryuji calling out from behind Yamamuras back.


				RYUJI		
		Tell us about Shizukos daughter.  
		Who was she?

				YAMAMURA	
		I dont know!

				RYUJI		
		She was there, with Shizuko. She 
		had to be.

  Yamamuras pace, which has become increasingly erratic, finally 
  causes him to stumble and fall.  Ryuji comes up behind him, 
  grasping him firmly.  At their touch Ryujis power awakens, and as 
  he peers into the old mans mind there is a sudden blinding

  FLASH

  The setting is a large MEETING HALL.  A number of people are seated 
  in folding chairs before a STAGE, on which are a four MEN in BUSINESS 
  SUITS and a WOMAN in a KIMONO.  A BANNER hangs above the stage, which 
  reads PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION ON THE EXISTENCE OF CLAIRVOYANCE.  

  FLASH

  Ryuji eyes widen as he realizes he is seeing Shizukos demonstration 
  before the press.  He also realizes--

				RYUJI
			(to Yamamura)
		You were there!

  FLASH

  YAMAMURA SHIZUKO, the woman in the kimono, is sitting at a TABLE 
  onstage. Her face is calm and expressionless.  Standing off to one 
  side and peering from behind the curtains is a young Mr. Yamamura.

				RYUJI	(O.S.) 
		You stood there and watched the 
		demonstration.

  CUT back to the beach.  Asakawa comes running up toward Ryuji and the 
  prone Mr. Yamamura.  Suddenly there is another

  FLASH

  Asakawa, her eyes wide, finds herself inside the scene, reliving it 
  as if she had actually been there.  She watches as Shizuko receives 
  a sealed clay POT in both hands.  Shizuko regards the pot a moment 
  and then places it gently on the table before her.  She takes a 
  calligraphy STYLUS from the table, begins writing on a thin, 
  rectangular sheet of RICE PAPER.  The members of the press talk 
  excitedly, craning their necks for a better look.

  Onstage, a JUDGE holds up the phrase written by Shizuko and the 
  folded sheet of paper taken from the sealed pot.  The phrase on both 
  sheets is identical.

				JUDGE		
		Match.

  Cameras begin FLASHING excitedly.  Shizukos features melt into a soft 
  smile. 

  The experiment is performed again, and again the phrase written by 
  Shizuko corresponds to the sealed sheet of paper.

				JUDGE
		Match.

  Again and again, Shizuko unerringly demonstrates her power to see 
  the unseen.  Finally, a bearded REPORTER explodes from his chair, 
  begins striding angrily towards the stage.

				REPORTER	
		Faker!  This is nothing but trickery, 
		and the lowest form of trickery at 
		that. 

  The reporter stops at the foot of the stage, points his finger 
  accusingly at Shizuko.

				REPORTER	
		What are you trying to pull, woman?

  A SECOND REPORTER sitting in the front row also rises to his feet.

				REPORTER #2	
		Thats right!  Professor Ikuma, 
		youre being fooled!

  By now most of the press has risen from their chairs, pointing and 
  shouting angrily. Onstage, Shizuko backs away, eyes wide and 
  frightened.  She covers both ears, trying to block out the increasing 
  din.  Professor Ikuma holds her protectively by the shoulders.  The 
  first reporter is still shouting angrily, his voice rising above the 
  others.  Suddenly, a pained look crosses his face and he collapses to 
  the floor.  The crowd, and Asakawa as well, see that the reporters 
  face is contorted into a grotesque mask of fear.

				REPORTER #3	
		Whats happened?

				REPORTER #4	
		Hes dead!



				REPORTER #5	
			(to Shizuko) 
		Witch!

  Professor Ikuma begins leading Shizuko offstage.  They stop as someone 
  unseen steps up, blocking their passage.  Shizukos eyes widen, her 
  head shaking in disbelief.

				SHIZUKO
		Sadako?  Was it you?

  CUT to Ryuji on the beach.  He looks up excitedly.

				RYUJI		
		Sadako?!

  He recalls the image from the video, the alien eye with the single 
  character SADA reflected in reverse. *


  >* The majority of girls' names in Japanese end in either -mi ("beauty") 
  >or -ko ("child").  Thus, Sadako means "Chaste child."  Sadako is, of 
  >course, the mysterious daughter of Shizuko and Professor Ikuma.


				RYUJI
		Sadako killed him?  She can kill 
		just with a thought?

				YAMAMURA	
		Shes... a devil spawn.

  CUT back to the demonstration hall.  Sadako, her face completely hidden 
  by her long hair, runs offstage... and heads directly for Asakawa.  
  Asakawa instinctively raises her arm, and Sadako grasps it fiercely.  
  All the nails on Sadako hand are stripped away; her fingers are raw, 
  bloody stumps.

  CUT back to the beach.  Asakawa, still caught in the throes of the 
  vision, has begun to swoon.  Finally her legs give out and she crumples 
  to the beach.  Ryuji grabs hold of her supportively.  He glances down at 
  her wrist, sees an ugly, purple BRUISE already beginning to form.  

  The bruise is in the shape of five long, spindly fingers.

  Mr. Yamamura slowly rises to a sitting position, and together the three 
  watch the approach of ominous, dark STORM CLOUDS.

  INT. MR. HAYATSUS HOUSE  DUSK

  Asakawa is on the phone, her voice almost frantic.

				ASAKAWA
		Thats right. After Yamamura Shizuko 
		committed suicide, Professor Ikuma
		took the daughter and ran.  No, no one
		knows where they went.  Thats why I 
		need -you- to find out where they are.  
		Even if the professors dead, Sadako 
		should still be in her forties.  Ill 
		explain it all later, but right now 
		just hurry!

  Asakawa slams the phone down.  PAN to show Ryuji slumped in one corner 
  of the room, his back to the wall.

				RYUJI	
		Sadakos probably already dead.  She
		could kill people with just a thought, 
		remember?  Her mother wasnt even 
		close to that.


				ASAKAWA	
			(flustered) 
		Well, what about that video?  If 
		Sadakos dead then who made it?

				RYUJI	
		Nobody made it. It wasnt made at 
		all. That video... is the pure, 
		physical manifestation of Sadakos 
		hatred.

  Ryuji turns to regard Asakawa, his eyes blank.

				RYUJI
		Weve been cursed.

  There is a moment of silence before Mr. Hayatsu slides the door open, 
  almost falling into the room.  He is out of breath, and speaks rapidly.

				HAYATSU	
		Its no good.  With the typhoon 
		coming in, all ships are 
		temporarily staying docked.

				RYUJI	
		What about the fishing boats?  
		Tell their captains Ill pay.

				HAYATSU
		Fishing boats?  Sir, without knowing 
		whether this typhoon is going to hit 
		us or not, I think itd be better to 
		wait and see how things turn--

  Ryuji interrupts him, slamming both palms on the table.  Glasses 
  rattle wildly.

				RYUJI	
		Fine!  Ill try searching myself!

  Ryuji stands and races past Mr. Hayatsu out into the rain.  Hayatsu 
  takes pursuit, calling after him.

				HAYATSU	
		Mr. Takayama!?  Mr. Takayama...

  Asakawa, left alone, stares down at the tatami mats.

  EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT  

  White-capped waves roll angrily in a black sea.

  INT. MR. HAYATSUS HOUSE  NIGHT

  Asakawa sits at a table, alone, her hands clasped as if in prayer.  Her 
  eyes are wide and glassy.  The phone RINGS suddenly and Asakawa dives 
  for it, wrenching it from the cradle before it can ring a second time.

				ASAKAWA	
		Hello?

				OKAZAKI (O.S.) 
		Mrs. Asakawa?  Im sorry.  I tried, 
		but I couldnt come up with any 
		leads at all.

  A look of abject fear crosses Asakawas face.  She begins retreating 
  into herself.


				OKAZAKI (O.S.) 
		Hello?

				ASAKAWA
			(softly) 
		Thank you...

  Asakawa slowly places the phone back in its cradle.  Almost immediately, 
  her face begins to crumple.  She falls to her knees, sobbing into the 
  floor.

				ASAKAWA	
		Yoichi...

  She cries a while longer but suddenly stops.  Her face, eyes streaked 
  with tears, shoots suddenly up, stares directly at the telephone.

				ASAKAWA	 
			(softly) 
		Izu...

  EXT. IZU WHARF  NIGHT

  Asakawa stands looking down on the wharf, scanning. 

  Several FISHING BOATS are docked.  The wind whips her hair crazily 
  around.   She continues scanning, and suddenly she spies--

				ASAKAWA	
			(calling) 
		Ryuji!

  Asakawa runs down onto the wharf, heading towards Ryuji.  He is 
  in mid-conversation with Mr. Hayatsu.

				ASAKAWA	
		Ryuji!  The phone in my apartment 
		never rang!  It only ever rang at
		the rental cottage!  Professor 
		Ikuma mustve...

				RYUJI	
		And weve got no way of going back.

				HAYATSU	
		Its too dangerous!  The thought of 
		anybody going out in this weather...

  The three fall into silence as they realize the powerlessness of their 
  situation.  Suddenly, a deep VOICE booms from behind them.

				YAMAMURA (O.S.) 
		Ill take you out.

  The three spin around to see Mr. Yamamura, his ROBES flapping in the 
  gusty night air. He begins walking towards them.

				YAMAMURA	
		Sadako is callin yall, reckon.  
		Mayhap to drag you down under the 
		water.

  Short silence.  Ryuji shoots a short questioning glance at Asakawa, 
  turns back to face Mr. Yamamura.

				RYUJI	
		Please.  Take us out.



  EXT. OCEAN  NIGHT

  A tiny FISHING BOAT is tossed about on the waves.  Mr. Yamamura stands 
  at the wheel, his face expressionless.

  INT. MR. YAMAMURAS FISHING BOAT  NIGHT

  Ryuji and Asakawa are crouched close together in the cabin.  Asakawas 
  expression is dreamy, faraway.

				ASAKAWA
		Its funny.  Im not afraid at all.  

  Ryuji leans over, rubs her hand comfortingly.  Suddenly he switches 
  back into analytical mode.

				RYUJI	
		Sadako probably died back out there
		at Izu, before the rental cottages 
		were ever built.

				ASAKAWA	
		So, Sadako was Professor Ikumas 
		daughter?

				RYUJI
			(nodding) 
		Ikuma smuggled her out in secret.  
		His relationship with Shizuko was 
		already a scandal, and one of the 
		reasons he got drummed out of the 
		university... Weve gotta find 
		Sadakos body.



				ASAKAWA
			(excitedly) 
		Is that going to break the curse?  
		Will Yoichi be all right?

				RYUJI	
		Its all weve got left to try.

				ASAKAWA	
		Just one more day...

  Ryuji puts his arm around Asakawa.

  EXT. MR. YAMAMURAS FISHING BOAT - DAWN  

  Ryuji stands on deck, looking out over the water.  He heads down 
  below toward the captains area.  Mr. Yamamura is at the wheel.

				RYUJI	
		We made it.  Maybe Sadako doesnt 
		have it out for us after all.

  Long pause as Mr. Yamamura says nothing.

				YAMAMURA
		Shizuko... she used to -speak- to 
		the ocean, just ramble away.  One 
		time I hid, listenin to one of her 
		conversations.

  Mr. Yamamura pauses again.

				YAMAMURA (contd)	
		And it werent in no human language.


  EXT. MR. YAMAMURAS FISHING BOAT  DAWN

  Asakawa has climbed out on deck and is looking up towards the sunrise.

  Caption-- September 20th.  Monday.

  EXT. HARDWARE STORE  DAY

  Ryuji races out of the store, loaded down with supplies.  He holds a 
  pair of BUCKETS in one hand and a CROWBAR and SHOVEL in the other.  A 
  length of ROPE is coiled over his left shoulder.  He runs towards a 
  RENTAL CAR, passing by Asakawa who stands at a PAYPHONE, receiver in 
  hand.

				YOICHI (O.S.) 
		Hello?

				ASAKAWA	
		Yoichi?  Its mommy.  I just called 
		to say Ill be coming home tomorrow.

  Ryuji shoots a look at her over his shoulder.

				YOICHI (O.S.) 
		Im tired of it here, mom!  I wanna
		go back to school.

				ASAKAWA
			(smiling) 
		Yoichi, its rude to your grandpa 
		to talk like that.

				YOICHI (O.S.) 
		Hes laughing.  You wanna talk to him?

				ASAKAWA	
		No, thats...

  Asakawa pauses, her voice hitching.  She seems about to lose 
  her composure.

				ASAKAWA	
		Im sorry, Yoichi.  Ill... Ill 
		see you tomorrow.  

				YOICHI (O.S.)	
		Whats wrong?

  Asakawas face scrunches up in an effort to hold back tears.

				ASAKAWA	
		Mommys got something she has to do.  
		Say hello to grandpa for me, OK?

  Ryuji stands by the car, scowling over at Asakawa.  He shuts the DOOR 
  just short of a slam.  CUT to Asakawa hanging up the phone.  She half-
  runs towards the rental car and enters the passenger side, staring 
  blankly into space.  Ryuji slides into the drivers seat, buckles his 
  SEATBELT.  

				RYUJI		
		What time was it when you first 
		watched the video?

  Asakawa glances at her watch.

				ASAKAWA	
		Seven or eight minutes past 
		seven.  PM.  No more than ten 
		minutes past.
 		
				RYUJI
		If the rumors are true, that 
		time is gonna be our deadline.

  Asakawa buckles up as Ryuji steps on the gas.

  INT. RENTAL CAR  DAY

  Asakawa sits in the passenger side.  Her face is almost angelic, 
  with the faintest hint of a smile.  Ryuji shoots a questioning look 
  at her.

  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD  DAY

  The white rental car tears past the SIGN reading Izu Pacific Land.  
  The car continues into the LOT, screeching around corners before 
  coming to an abrupt halt.  Asakawa, her face still oddly expressionless, 
  gets out of the passenger side.  Ryuji exits as well, the hint of a 
  shudder running through him as he regards the series of rental cabins.

				RYUJI		
		-Here-.

  CUT to Asakawa and Ryuji walking up the gravel PATH towards the rental 
  cabins.  Ryuji looks back over his shoulder as both he and Asakawa stop 
  before cabin B4.  The cabin is on STILTS, its underbelly fenced off by 
  wooden LATICEWORK.  Ryuji drops most of his supplies to the ground, but 
  keeps hold of the PICK.  He raises the pick over one shoulder and begins 
  smashing away at the latticework.  When he has cleared enough space for   
  passage, he begins picking up supplies and tossing them hastily within.  
  When finished, he holds a hand out for Asakawa.  The two enter the 
  earthen basement.


  UNDER COTTAGE B4 - DAY  

  Ryuji pulls a FLASHLIGHT out, flicks it on.  The BEAM arcs outwards, 
  illuminating what looks more like an old mine shaft than a modern 
  rental cottage.  The beam halts when it suddenly encounters an old 
  STONE WELL.  The well is badly chipped on one side, and sealed off 
  with a solid-looking stone LID.  Ryuji rushes quickly towards it.

				RYUJI
		I knew it!  The well.

  He squats down beside the well, setting the flashlight on the 
  lid.  Asakawa sinks slowly down beside him.

				ASAKAWA
		The well...

  Ryuji reaches out and takes Asakawas hand.  He sets their enclasped 
  hands onto the lid, and together they begin lightly tracing the 
  surface of the lid with their free hands.  Asakawa closes her eyes in 
  concentration... and suddenly, as with the incident on the beach, 
  Asakawa finds herself drawn into Ryujis psychometric VISION.

  FLASH

  The picture is black and white, grainy like old film.  A YOUNG GIRL in 
  a WHITE GOWN walks slowly towards an open well. She places her hand on 
  the LIP of the well, peers curiously down.  

  FLASH

  Asakawa looks up, her eyes wide open.

  FLASH
  
  There is now a second person in the vision, an ELDERLY MAN in an old-
  fashioned tweed SUIT standing behind the young girl.  He suddenly 
  produces some BLADED OBJECT, and strikes the girl savagely across the 
  back of the head.  

  The girl falls forward. The man drops to the ground, grabbing the girl 
  behind the knees and hoisting her limp BODY over the lip and into the 
  well.  The body falls into its depths.

  Panting heavily, the man leans forward and grasps the lip of the well 
  with both hands, looking down.  He flashes a guilty look in either 
  direction, checking that his crime has gone unnoticed, and as he does 
  so Asakawa realizes that she knows this face.  The image from the 
  videotape, like a face in the moon: it had been Sadako inside the well, 
  looking up to see this man staring back down at her.

  This man whose name is Professor Ikuma Heihachiro.

  FLASH

				ASAKAWA
		Her own father!

  The energy seems to drain out of Asakawa in a rush, and her body 
  crumbles.  Ryuji catches hold of her.

				RYUJI		
		It was Ikuma who put this lid on.  
		And Sadakos still inside.

  Ryuji stands quickly, takes hold of the crowbar.  He inserts it under 
  the lid and begins trying to pry it off, face scrunched with effort.  
  Asakawa digs her fingers in and lends her own strength as well. Slowly,
  the lid begins to move.  Ryuji tosses the crowbar aside and the two 
  lean the combined weight of their bodies into it.  The lid slides off, 
  dropping to the earth with a dull THUD.  Ryuji sits to one side, winded 
  with effort, as Asakawa takes hold of the flashlight.  She shines it 
  down into the well, but it only seems to intensify the gloom. What 
  WATER she can see looks fetid and brackish.  Ryuji sees her expression 
  and begins removing his JACKET.

				RYUJI
		Ill go.

  He walks off, leaving Asakawa alone.

  CUT to an overhead shot of the well.  A ROPE is fastened to one side, 
  and Ryuji has already begun lowering himself down.  His eyes wander 
  overthe grime-smeared WALLS, and with a shudder he begins to pick out 
  human FINGERNAILS.  Torn loose and spattered with blood, countless 
  fingernails line the sides of the well. 

				RYUJI
 		Sadako was alive!  Shed tried to 
		climb her way out.

  Ryujis face twists into a grimace as if momentarily experiencing 
  Sadakosterrible agony.  He waits a moment longer before edging his 
  way down the rope again, finally SPLASHING to rest at the bottom of 
  the well.  He holds his flashlight above the brackish water, calls up 
  to Asakawa.

				RYUJI
		Lower the buckets!

  Asakawa nods and lowers two plastic BUCKETS fastened to a rope.  Ryuji 
  grabs one and scoops up a bucketful of water, tugging on the rope when 
  finished.

				RYUJI
		Take it up!

  Asakawa hoists the bucket up to the rim of the well.  She walks a small 
  distance and tosses the contents out onto the ground.  She happens to 
  glance through the wooden lattice to the outside, and with a start 
  realizes that the sun has already started to set.  A nervous glance at 
  her WATCH later and she is back at the well, lowering the empty bucket 
  to find another full one already awaiting her.

				RYUJI
		Take it up!

  In the well, Ryuji glances at his watch.  He looks at it for a long 
  moment, the expression on his face saying Were not going to make it.  
  Time passes as Asakawa pulls up bucketload after bucketload, her 
  strength beginning to fade.  She half-stumbles, glances up... and is 
  shocked to realize that NIGHT has fallen.

  CUT to Asakawa slowly pulling up yet another bucket, her strength 
  almost gone.  She looks at her watch and sees that it is now past 
  6:00.  She calls frantically down to Ryuji.

				ASAKAWA
		Its already six!

				RYUJI
			(explosively) 
		I know!  Hurry up and TAKE IT UP!!

  The bucket slowly jerks into motion.  Asakawa pulls it up to the rim 
  of the well, holds it unsteadily.  She takes one faltering step and 
  falls, spilling the buckets contents onto the ground.  

  CUT to Ryuji in the well, standing ready with another bucketful.


				RYUJI
 		Take it up!

  Nothing happens.  

				RYUJI
		Asakawa!

  The bucket begins moving, even slower than before.  CUT to Asakawa, 
  her body trembling with effort. By now its all she can do to simply 
  keep her body moving.  She glances behind her, sees through the wooden 
  lattice that it is now pitch black.  A look of resignation crosses her 
  face and she releases her hold on the bucket, her body crumpling and 
  falling in on itself. 
  
  CUT to the bucket splashing back into the well, narrowly missing 
  Ryuji.

				RYUJI	
			(fuming) 
		What the hell are you doing?  Trying 
		to get me killed?

  CUT back to Asakawa, her face dead.  Ryuji calls out from the well.

				RYUJI (O.S.) 
		Hey!

  Asakawa falls backward onto the ground, arms splayed. CUT to the rim 
  of the well.  Ryuji pulls himself up over the rim, catches sight of 
  Asakawa.

				RYUJI
		Asakawa!

  She lifts her head up but says nothing as Ryuji walks over to her.

				RYUJI
		Well change.  Youre in no condition 
		to keep this up.

  Asakawa suddenly springs into life.  Her voice is frantic, fearful.

				ASAKAWA:	
		No!

				RYUJI
		Who do you expect to pull up these 
		buckets, then?

				ASAKAWA
		But, we dont even know if its doing 
		any good...

  Ryuji strides forward and slaps Asakawa painfully across the cheek.  
  He begins shaking her roughly for good measure.

				RYUJI
		And what about Yoichi, huh?  Is his
		mother not coming to pick him up 
		after all?

  He releases his hold on her.  The two stare at each other a long time, 
  saying nothing.
 
  CUT to an overhead shot of Asakawa being lowered into the well. CUT 
  now to Asakawa inside the well, her face and clothes covered with 
  grime, body simultaneously limp with exhaustion and tense with fright.  
  Unable to resist the impulse, Asakawa slowly looks over her shoulder 
  and down into the well.  The dankness, the claustrophobia seeps in 
  and she draws in her breath in the first signs of panic.

				RYUJI
		Dont look down!

  She returns her gaze, cranes her neck upward.  CUT to Ryuji leaning 
  over the rim of the well, peering down at her.  For an instant, 
  everything becomes monochrome. Its not Ryuji looking down at her at 
  all; its Professor Ikuma, checking to see if shes still alive or 
  if the blow to the back of her head has finished her off.  CUT to 
  Asakawa, her eyes wide with fright.

  Asakawa comes to rest at the bottom of the well.  A FLASHLIGHT hangs 
  from another rope, but its beam has almost no effect on the darkness.  
  Asakawa crouches forward, hands moving searchingly through the water.  
  She calls out pleadingly.

				ASAKAWA
		Where are you?  Please, come out.

  Asakawa straightens, unties herself from the rope.  A full bucket 
  already awaits.  She tugs on the rope and Ryuji pulls it up.  

  She scoops up a second bucket, but something stops her from sending 
  it up.  Instead, she begins running her arms through the water again, 
  her voice close to tears.

				ASAKAWA
		Please.  Where are you?

  Asakawa continues her blind fumbling, which sends up little splashes 
  of stagnant water.  With a start, she realizes that her fingers have 
  caught something.  Seaweed?  Asakawa draws her hands close for a 
  better look... and sees that is HAIR.  A thick clump of long, black 
  hair.

  Suddenly a pale, thin ARM shoots out from beneath the water, catching 
  Asakawa just below the wrist.  Asakawas ears are filled with a SOUND 
  like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber.  It 
  is a GIRL, her face completely hidden by long, black hair.  CUT to a 
  shot of Asakawas face.  Far from being frightened, her features are 
  oddly placid.  She regards the fearsome thing before her with an 
  almost tender look.  Asakawa reaches out, lightly strokes that long 
  hair.  

				ASAKAWA
		Its you...

  She strokes the hair again, and abruptly it peels right off the head 
  with a loud SQUELCH. Revealed is not a face at all but a SKULL.  Its 
  sockets are at first menacingly empty, but then begin to ooze the 
  green SLUDGE it has pulled up from the bottom of the well.  Like a 
  mother comforting a frightened child, Asakawa pulls the skeletal 
  remains to her breast, strokes the bony head comfortingly. Her eyes 
  begin to glaze.

  CUT to Ryuji racing up to the rim of the well, leaning down intently.

				RYUJI
		Hey!  Asakawa!  Its already 10 
		minutes past seven!  We did it!

  Down in the well, Asakawa continues staring blankly ahead.  Her body 
  suddenly falls forward, limp.

  EXT. OUTSIDE COTTAGE B4  NIGHT

  Three POLICE CARS are parked outside the rental cottages, crimson 
  headlights flashing.   A few COPS walk by, two of them carrying 
  something off in white PLASTIC BAGS.  CUT to Ryuji and Asakawa 
  sitting on the curb.  Asakawa is staring off at something, a BLANKET 
  draped over her shoulder.  

				ASAKAWA	
		Why would Ikuma have killed her?  
		His own daughter...

				RYUJI
		Maybe she wasnt his daughter at all.  

				ASAKAWA
		What?

				RYUJI
		Maybe her father... wasnt even human.

  The two exchange glances.  Ryujis gaze falls to Asakawas WRIST, 
  which he suddenly takes and holds close to his face.  The ugly 
  bruise where Sadako had grabbed her has disappeared.

				RYUJI
		Its gone...  

  He shakes his head, clearing his analytical mind of their ordeal.

				RYUJI
		Enough, already.  Its over.  Cmon.  
		Ill take you home.

  Ryuji stands, pulls Asakawa to her feet.

  EXT. OUTSIDE ASKAWAS APARTMENT - NIGHT  

  Ryujis white CAR pulls up into the parking lot.  He and Asakawa 
  get out, regard each other from opposite sides of the car. There is 
  a long moment where neither of them says anything.

				RYUJI	
		Get some rest.  

  He flashes her the slightest of grins. 

				RYUJI (contd)
		I still have a thesis to finish. 

  CUT to a shot of Ryuji and Asakawa, the car creating an almost 
  metaphoric distance between them. 

				ASAKAWA
		...thank you.

  Ryuji nods silently by way of reply.  He gets into his car and 
  drives off.  Asakawa watches him go, and then walks towards the 
  entrance of her apartment.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  BEDROOM  MORNING

  Asakawa walks into her room, sits on the edge of her bed.  It is 
  now morning, and she sits dazedly watching the sun come up.

  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  MORNING

  Ryuji sits busily scribbling into a NOTEBOOK.  He stops writing a 
  moment to regard his notes while taking a sip of COFFEE.  He 
  glances over at his BLACKBOARD for confirmation when a small scowl 
  crosses his brow.  Its gone a moment later as he chuckles wryly 
  to himself.

				RYUJI
		That girl...

  Ryuji stands, walks over to the blackboard.  He fixes Mais little 
  prank with a single chalk stroke. 

  EXT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  VERANDA  MORNING

  Asakawa emerges, taking in the dawn.  At first her face is calm and 
  tranquil... but her features change as the sun almost noticeably 
  darkens and a WIND begins to kick up her hair.  She now looks very 
  anxious.

  NOTE: This next scene is entirely visual.  If you are reading this 
  translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; STOP 
  reading this now and watch the scene for itself.


  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  MORNING

  Ryuji is busy scribbling away at his notes again.  His hand suddenly 
  ceases, eyes dancing worriedly as he hears a faint...

  No.

  Breath rattling fearfully in his throat, Ryuji spins around to face 
  the TELEVISION SET.  He gets out of his seat for a better look, 
  falling to his knees on the tatami. 

  The image that fills the screen is the last scene from the videotape; 
  the shot of the well.  

  The SOUND from before comes louder now, more insistent, a metallic 
  screeching that both repulses and beckons him closer. Ryuji crawls on 
  all fours towards the SCREEN, stares at its unchanging image with 
  terrible foreboding.

  There is a flash of MOTION as something shoots out of the well. A 
  hand. First one, and then another, as Sadako, still in her grimy white 
  dress, face hidden beneath long, oily strands of hair, begins slowly 
  pulling herself out.  The television screen jumps unsteadily, fills 
  with static as if barely able to contain her image.  

  CUT back and forth between Ryuji, who is beginning to visibly panic, 
  and the television, which shows Sadako lurching ever closer.

				RYUJI
			(almost frantic) 
		Why?!

  The TELEPHONE rings, and Ryuji spins round towards it, breath catching 
  in his throat.  He looks at the phone, over his shoulder at the 
  television, back to the phone.

				RYUJI
		Thats it!  Asakawa...

  Ryuji scrambles wildly towards the phone.  He takes the receiver but 
  is unable to do more than clutch it fearfully as his gaze is drawn 
  inexorably back to the television.  Sadakos shrouded face has filled 
  the entire screen... and then, television popping and crackling, she 
  jerks forward and emerges from the television onto the floor of 
  Ryujis apartment.  Ryuji backs away, screaming in terror.

				RYUJI
		Aaargh!

  Sadako lies prone, collapsed, hair splayed out like a drowned corpse.  
  Only her FINGERS are active, crawling, feeling.  The TIPS of her 
  fingers are little more than bloodied stumps, not a single fingernail 
  on them.  She uses the strength in those fingers to pull herself 
  forward, coming jerkily to her feet.  The joints of her body twist 
  unnaturally, more insect-like than human.

  Ryuji flings the phone aside and begins scrambling about the apartment 
  as if looking for cover.  The strength has already begun to fade from 
  his body, however, and his movements are clumsy, exaggerated. He falls 
  to the floor, panting heavily.  

  Sadako turns to regard him, and for just an instant we can see beneath 
  her impenetrable shroud of hair; a single EYE burns with manic, 
  unbridled hatred.   

  Its gaze meets Ryujis, and his face twists into a grimace as he 
  SCREAMS loudly.

  FLASH

  EXT. KOUJIS HOUSE - FRONT YARD  DAY

  Yoichi sits on the lawn, doodling into a large SKETCHPAD.  He 
  suddenly stops, eyes registering that he has somehow felt his fathers 
  death.
  
  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  DAY

  Asakawa clutches the RECEIVER to her ear.  She can still hear the 
  sounds of metallic SCREECHING coming from the video, though they are 
  now becoming softer.

  EXT. OUTSIDE RYUJIS APARTMENT BUILDING  DAY

  Asakawa comes running down a side street, turning the corner and 
  making for the entrance to Ryujis apartment building.  There is a 
  single GUARD posted at the entrance. He reaches out, catches Asakawa 
  lightly by the arm.


				GUARD
		Are you a resident here, maam?

				ASAKAWA
		Im Takayama Ryujis wife!

  The guard drops his hand, and Asakawa makes for the entrance.

				GUARD
		Im sorry maam, but theyve already 
		taken the body away.

  Asakawas spins around, eyes wide.  Body?

  INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE RYUJIS APARTMENT  DAY

  Mai is there, slumped against one wall. Asakawa comes running up, 
  dropping to her knees and grasping Mai by the shoulders.

				ASAKAWA
		What happened?

  Mai shakes her head dreamily.

				MAI
		When I got here he was just 
		lying there...

				ASAKAWA	
		Did he say anything to you?  About 
		a videotape?

  Mai shakes her head again, shakes it harder until the breath 
  catches in her throat.


				MAI
		His face...

  Mai falls into silence, curls up on herself.  Asakawa leaves her 
  and crosses toward the door to Ryujis apartment.

  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT - DAY  

  The front DOOR opens wildly, noisily forward.  Asakawa comes 
  rushing in, eyes darting about the apartment.  She thinks 
  frantically to herself.

				ASAKAWA (VO)
		Ryuji... why?  Does this mean that
		Yoichi will die, too?  Is the curse 
		not broken yet?

  Her gaze falls to the television set.  She dives forward, presses 
  the eject button on the VCR.  Sure enough, the TAPE is still in 
  the deck.  She takes the tape and leaves.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

  Asakawa walks slowly, dreamily forward.  She drops the videotape 
  loudly onto the coffee table and slouches into a CHAIR.  Her eyes 
  fall to the framed photographs of Yoichi on one of the shelves.  
  This snaps Asakawa out of her daze and she begins whispering 
  intently to herself, thinking.

				ASAKAWA
		I was the only one to break 
		Sadakos curse.  Ryuji... why...?  
		Something I did that you didnt...  
		Something I did that you didnt...  

  Asakawa gives up, lowers her face into her hands.  When she looks 
  up again, she happens to glance at the television screen-- and 
  its GLARE reveals that there is someone ELSE in the room with her.  
  It is the figure from the videotape, the silent accuser with the 
  cloth draped over its face.  With a start, Asakawa realizes that 
  the figure is wearing Ryujis clothes.

				ASAKAWA
		Ryuji?!

  She spins around, but the room is empty.  Asakawas mind races.  
  The figure had been pointing towards her BAG.  She stands, 
  rummages in her bag to produce her copy of the cursed videotape.  
  She takes Ryujis COPY in her other hand, her eyes darting 
  between the two tapes.

				ASAKAWA
		Something I did that you didnt...

  It suddenly clicks home as Asakawa looks full-on at Ryujis 
  version of the tape, plainly marked COPY.

				ASAKAWA
		What broke the curse was that I copied 
		the tape and showed it to someone else!

  CUT to Asakawa slowly pulling her VCR from the television stand.  
  A look of almost frightening resolve etches her face.

  EXT. HIGHWAY  DAY

  ARIAL SHOT of Asakawas car.  We hear her VOICE on the cell 
  phone.

				ASAKAWA (O.S.)
  		Dad?  Its me.  Im on my way over.
  		Look, dad, Ive got something to ask. 
		Its for Yoichi...

  INT. ASAKAWAS CAR  DAY

  CLOSEUP on the VCR in the passenger side.  CUT to Asakawa at the 
  wheel as time spirals forward, the decisions of the present 
  already become rumor of the future.

				GIRL A (VO) 
		They say theres a way you can stay 
		alive after you watch the video.  
		Youve gotta make a copy of it, and 
		show it to somebody else inside a week.

				GIRL B (VO) 
		But what about the person you show it 
		to?

				GIRL A (VO) 
		Well, then they make a copy and show it 
		to somebody else.  Again, inside a week.

				GIRL C (VO) 
			(laughing)
		Then theres no end to it.

				GIRL A (VO) 
		Thats just it.  There -is- no end.  But 
		if it meant not dying... youd do it, 
		wouldnt you?

  Asakawas eyes begin to well.  Her car speeds along the highway, 
  to the direction of menacing-looking STORM CLOUDS.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  TOMOKOS ROOM - NIGHT

  CLOSEUP on a TELEVISION SET.  Theres a baseball game on, but the sound 
  is turned completely down.  Camera PANS to show two cute high school 
  girls, MASAMI and TOMOKO.  Masami is seated on the floor at a low coffee 
  table, TEXTBOOK in front of her. Tomoko is at her desk.  There are SNACKS 
  all over the room, and its obvious there hasnt been much studying going 
  on. Masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly.

				MASAMI
		They say that some elementary school 
		kid spent the night with his parents 
		at a bed and breakfast in Izu.  The kid
		wanted to go out and play with everybody, 
		right, but he didnt want to miss the 
		program he always used to watch back in 
		Tokyo, so he records it on the VCR in 
		their room.  But of course the stations 
		in Izu are different from the ones in 
		Tokyo.  In Izu, it was just an empty 
		channel, so he shouldve recorded
		nothing but static.  But when the kid 
		gets back to his house and watches the 
		tape, all of a sudden this woman comes 
		on the screen and says--

  Masami points so suddenly and dramatically at her friend that Tomoko 
  actually jumps in her seat.

				MASAMI (contd)
		One week from now, you will die.

  Short silence as Masami pauses, relishing the moment.

				MASAMI (contd)	
		Of course the kids completely 
		freaked, and he stops the video.  
		Just then the phone rings, and when he 
		picks it up a voice says--

  Her voice drops voice almost to a whisper.

				MASAMI (contd)	
		You watched it, didnt you?  That 
		same time, exactly one week later... 
		hes dead!

  Masami laughs loudly, thoroughly enjoying her own performance.  
  Tomoko, however, is completely silent.  She begins looking more 
  and more distressed, until finally Masami notices.

				MASAMI
		What is it, Tomoko?

  Tomoko comes out of her chair and drops onto the floor next to her 
  friend.  Her words are quick, earnest.

				TOMOKO
		Who did you hear that story from?

				MASAMI
		Who?  Its just a rumor.  Everybody 
		knows it.

				TOMOKO
		Youko told you?	

				MASAMI	
		No, it wasnt Youko...

  Tomoko looks away, worried.  Masami slaps her on the knee, 
  laughing.

				MASAMI
		Whats up with you?

  Tomoko speaks slowly, still looking away.

				TOMOKO
		The other day, I... I watched this 
		strange video.
		
				MASAMI
		Where?

				TOMOKO	
		With Youko and them.

				MASAMI	
			(excited) 
		So thats what Ive been hearing 
		about you doing some double-date/
		sleepover thing!  So, you and that 
		guy Iwata, huh? 

				TOMOKO	
		No, its not like that.  Nothing 
		happened!

  Their eyes meet and Tomoko half-blushes, looks away again.  Her 
  expression becomes serious as she resumes her conversation.

				TOMOKO
		Iwata... he found this weird video.  
		Everyone was like, Whats that? so 
		he put it on and we all watched it.

				MASAMI
			(quietly) 
		And?  What kind of video was it?

				TOMOKO
		Just... weird, I cant really explain 
		it.  Anyway, right after we finished 
		watching it, the phone rang.  Whoever
		it was didnt say anything, but still...

  Silence.  Masami curls up on herself, thoroughly spooked.  

				MASAMI	
		Jesus.

				TOMOKO
  		It's cuz, you know, we'd all heard the 
		rumors.

Tomoko looks seriously over at her friend.

				TOMOKO (cont'd)
		That was one week ago today.

  There is a long, heavy silence as neither of them says anything.

				MASAMI  	
		Waaait a minute.  Are you faking me 
		out?

  Tomokos face suddenly breaks into a smile. 

				TOMOKO	
		Busted, huh?

  They both crack up laughing. 

				MASAMI
		Oh, my... I cant believe you!  

  Masami reaches out, slaps her friend on the knee.

				MASAMI (contd)
		Youre terrible!

				TOMOKO
		Gotcha!

				MASAMI	
			(thinking) 
		But hang on... you really stayed
		the night with Youko and Iwata, 
		right?

  Tomoko nods, uh-huh.  Masami dives forward, pinching her friends 
  cheeks and grinning wildly.

				MASAMI	
		So, how far did you and he get?

				TOMOKO 	
		Oh... I cant remember.

				MASAMI	
		You cant remember, huh?

  Masami laughs, then slaps Tomoko on the knee again as she remembers 
  the trick her friend played on her.

				MASAMI	
		Man, you had me freaked me out. 
		I--

  Just at that moment, the phone RINGS.  They are both suddenly, 
  instantly serious.  Tomokos eyes go off in one direction and she 
  begins shaking her head, -No-.  Masami looks over her shoulder, 
  following her friends gaze.  

  Tomoko is looking at the CLOCK, which currently reads 9:40.

  The phone continues to ring.  Tomoko is now clutching tightly onto her 
  friend, looking panicked.

				MASAMI
			(softly) 
		Was it true?

  Tomoko nods her head, still holding on tightly.  Masami has to 
  forcibly disengage herself in order to stand.  The phone is downstairs, 
  so Masami opens the bedroom DOOR and races down the STAIRS.  Tomoko 
  calls out to her from behind.

				TOMOKO
		Masami!

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  STAIRCASE - NIGHT  

  Tomoko and Masami run down the staircase, through the hallway towards 
  the kitchen.  Tomoko cries out again just before they reach the kitchen.

				TOMOKO	
		Masami!

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - NIGHT  

  Masami has come to a halt before a PHONE mounted on the wall.  She 
  pauses, looking slowly at her friend, then back to the phone.  She 
  takes it tentatively from its cradle, answers it wordlessly.  The 
  tension continues to mount as nothing is said. Masami suddenly breaks 
  into a huge grin.

				MASAMI	
		Ill put her on.

  Still grinning, she hands the phone to Tomoko.  Tomoko snatches it 
  quickly.

				TOMOKO
			(softly) 
		Yes?

  She is silent for a moment, then smiling widely.  

				TOMOKO
		Oh, man!

  She is so relieved that all the strength seeps out of her and she 
  sinks to the kitchen floor.  Masami, equally relieved, slides down 
  the wall and sits down next to her.

				TOMOKO
			(on the phone) 
		Yeah, Ive got a friend over now.  
		Yeah.  Yeah, OK.  Bye.

  Tomoko stands to place the phone back in its wall cradle, and then 
  squats back down onto the kitchen floor.

				TOMOKO	
		The games gone into overtime, so 
		theyre gonna be a little late. 

  They burst out laughing with relief again, and are soon both 
  clutching their stomachs.

				TOMOKO	
		Jeeezus, my parents...

				MASAMI	
		Oh man, Im tellin everybody about 
		this tomorrow!

  Tomoko shakes her head, -Dont you dare-.

				MASAMI	
		Im gonna use your bathroom.  Dont 
		go anywhere.

				TOMOKO	
		K.

  Masami walks out of the kitchen. Alone now, Tomoko stands and walks 
  toward the SINK, where she takes a GLASS from the DISH RACK.  She 
  then goes to the FRIDGE and sticks her face in, looking for something 
  to drink.  Suddenly there is the SOUND of people clapping and 
  cheering.  Tomoko, startled, peers her head over the refrigerator 
  door to check for the source of the sound.  

  She begins walking slowly, following the sound to the DINING ROOM 
  adjacent the kitchen. 

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DINING ROOM - NIGHT  

  The lights are off, and there is no one in the room.  Tomoko pauses a 
  moment, bathed in the garish LIGHT from the TV, which has been switched
  on.  Playing is the same baseball game they had on the TV upstairs; the 
  same game that Tomokos parents are currently at.  The VOLUME is up 
  quite high.

  A puzzled look on her face, Tomoko takes the REMOTE from the coffee 
  table and flicks the TV off.  She walks back to the kitchen.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - NIGHT  

  A bottle of SODA that Tomoko had earlier taken from the fridge is on 
  the kitchen table.  She picks the bottle up, pours herself a drink.  
  Before she can take a sip, however, the air around her becomes suddenly 
  charged, heavy.  Her body begins to shiver as somewhere out of sight 
  comes a popping, crackling SOUND underscored by a kind of GROANING.  
  Trembling now, Tomoko spins around to see what she has already felt 
  lurking behind her.  She draws in her breath to scream.

  The screen goes white, and fades into:

  CAMERA POV 

  The screen is filled with the visage of a nervous-looking YOUNG GIRL.  
  She is being interviewed by ASAKAWA, a female reporter seated offscreen.

				ASAKAWA (O.S.)
		There seems to be a popular rumor 
		going around about a cursed 
		videotape.

				YOUNG GIRL	
		Uh-huh.

				ASAKAWA (O.S.) 
		Have you heard what kind of video 
		it might be?

				YOUNG GIRL	
		Uh-huh.

  The girl looks directly at the camera, her mouth dropping into an O 
  as shes suddenly overcome by a kind of stage fright.  She continues 
  staring, silently, at the camera.

  INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY  

  KOMIYA, the cameraman, has lowered his camera. We can now see that 
  the young girl being interviewed is seated at a table between two 
  friends, a SHORT-HAIRED GIRL (GIRL#2) and a LONG-HAIRED GIRL (GIRL #3).  
  They are all dressed in the UNIFORMS of junior high school students.  
  Opposite them sits Komiya and Asakawa, a pretty woman in her mid-
  twenties.  A BOOM MIKE GUY stands to the left.
 
				KOMIYA	
		Uh, dont look right at the camera, 
		OK?

				YOUNG GIRL	
		Sorry.

				ASAKAWA	
		Lets do it again.

  Asakawa glances over her shoulder, makes sure that Komiya is ready.

 
				ASAKAWA
		Have you heard what kind of video 
		it might be?

				YOUNG GIRL
		What I heard was, all of a sudden 
		this scaaarry lady comes on the
		screen and says, In one week, you
		will die.


				GIRL #2	
		I heard that if youre watching TV 
		late at night itll come on, and
		then your phonell ring.

				ASAKAWA
		Watching TV late at night... do you
 		know what station?

				GIRL #2	
		Mmmm... I heard some local station, 
		around Izu.

				ASAKAWA	
		Izu?

				GIRL #2	
		Mmm-hmm.	

				ASAKAWA
		And, do you know if anyones really 
		died from watching it?

  The girl flashes a look at her two friends.

				YOUNG GIRL
		Well, no one that we know, right?

  Girl #2 nods her head. Girl #3 nods slowly, opens and closes her 
  mouth as if deciding whether to say something or not.  The 
  reporter notices. 

				ASAKAWA	
		What is it?


				GIRL #3
		I heard this from a friend of mine 
		in high school.  She said that there 
		was this one girl who watched the 
		video, and then died a week later.  
		She was out on a drive with her 
		boyfriend.

				ASAKAWA
		They were in a wreck?

				GIRL #3
		No, their car was parked, but they 
		were both dead inside.  Her 
		boyfriend died because hed watched 
		the video, too.  Thats what my 
		friend said.

  Girl #3 grows suddenly defensive.

				GIRL #3 (contd)	
		Its true!  It was in the paper two 
		or three days ago.

				ASAKAWA
		Do you know the name of the high 
		school this girl went to?

				GIRL #3
		No... I heard this from my friend, 
		and it didnt happen at her school.  
		She heard it from a friend at a 
		different school, she said.

  INT. NEWS STATION  DAY

  Asakawa is seated at her DESK.  The station is filled with PEOPLE, 
  scrabbling to meet deadlines.  Komiya walks up to Asakawas desk 
  and holds out a MANILA FOLDER.

				KOMIYA	
		Mrs. Asakawa?

				ASAKAWA
		Hm?

				KOMIYA	
		Here you are.

				ASAKAWA
			(taking the folder) 
		Thanks.

  Komiya has a seat.

				KOMIYA	
		This same kind of thing happened 
		about ten years ago too, didnt it?  
		Some popular young singer committed 
		suicide, and then suddenly there was 
		all this talk about her ghost showing
		up on some music show.

				ASAKAWA	
		But I wonder what this rumors all 
		about. Everyone you ask always 
		mentions Izu.

				KOMIYA	
		Maybe thats where it all started.  
		Hey, where was that Kuchi-sake
		Onna * story from again?


  >* Literally Ripped-Mouth Lady, a kind of ghastly spectre from 
  >Japanese folk stories who wears a veil to hide her mouth, which 
  >has been ripped or cut open from ear to ear. She wanders the 
  >countryside at night asking men Do you think Im beautiful? then 
  >lowering her veil to reveal her true features.


				ASAKAWA	
		Gifu, but there was some big 
		accident out there, and that ended
		up being what started the rumor. 

				KOMIYA
		A big accident?

				ASAKAWA	
		Mmm-hmm.  Something terrible like 
		that is going to stay in peoples 
		minds.  Sometimes the story of what 
		happened gets twisted around, and 
		ends up coming back as a rumor like 
		this one. Thats what they say, at 
		least.

				KOMIYA
		Dyou think something like that 
		happened out at Izu?

				ASAKAWA
		Maybe. Well, anyway, Im off.  See you
		tomorrow.
   
				KOMIYA
		See you.

  Asakawa gets up from her desk and begins walking towards the exit.  
  She takes only a few steps before noticing a RACK of recent DAILY 
  EDITIONS.  

  She takes one from the rack, sets it on a nearby TABLE.  She begins 
  flipping the pages, and suddenly spies this story:  

    STRANGE AUTOMOBILE DEATH OF YOUNG COUPLE IN YOKOHAMA

    The bodies of a young man and woman were discovered in their 
    passenger car at around 10 A.M. September 6th.  The location was a 
    vacant lot parallel to Yokohama Prefectural Road.  Local authorities 
    identified the deceased as a 19-year old preparatory school student 
    of Tokyo, and a 16-year old Yokohama resident, a student of a 
    private all-girls high school. Because there were no external 
    injuries, police are investigating the possibility of drug-induced 
    suicide...

  Just then two men walk by, a GUY IN A BUSINESS SUIT and a youngish 
  intern named OKAZAKI.  Okazaki is carrying an armload of VIDEOTAPES.

				GUY IN SUIT
		OK, Okazaki, Im counting on you.

				OKAZAKI	
		Yessir.

  The guy in the suit pats Okazaki on the shoulder and walks off.  

  Okazaki turns to walk away, spots Asakawa bent over the small table 
  and peering intently at the newspaper article.


				OKAZAKI	
		Miss Asakawa?  I thought you were 
		going home early today.

  Asakawa turns around and begins speaking excitedly.

				ASAKAWA
		Okazaki, can I ask you a favor?

				OKAZAKI
		Sure.

  Asakawa points to the newspaper.

				ASAKAWA
		Could you check out this article 
		for me?  Get me some more info.?	

				OKAZAKI
		I guess...

				ASAKAWA	
		Good.  Call me as soon as you know 
		more, OK?

				OKAZAKI	
		Maam.

  Asakawa walks off.  Okazaki, still carrying the videotapes, leans 
  forward to take a look at the article.
   
  EXT. APARTMENT PARKING LOT - DAY  

  Asakawa drives her car into the lot and parks quickly.  She gets 
  out, runs up the STAIRCASE to the third floor.  She stops in front 
  of a door, sticks her KEY in the lock, and opens it.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM  DAY

  A BOY of about 7 is sitting in an ARMCHAIR facing the veranda.  We 
  can see only the back of his head.

				ASAKAWA (O.S.) 
		Yoichi!

  Hearing his name, the boy puts down the BOOK he was reading and 
  stands up, facing the door.  He is wearing a white DRESS SHIRT with 
  a brown sweater-type VEST over it.  He sees Asakawa, his mother, 
  run in the door.  She is panting lightly.

				ASAKAWA
		Sorry Im late.  Oh, youve already 
		changed.

				YOICHI
		Yup. 

  He points over to his mothers right.

				YOICHI (contd)
		I got your clothes out for you.

  Asakawa turns to see a DARK SUIT hanging from one of the living 
  room shelves.  She reaches out, takes it.

				ASAKAWA
		Aargh, weve gotta hurry!

  She runs into the next room to change.

  INT.  BEDROOM  DAY

  Asakawa has changed into all-black FUNERAL ATTIRE.  Her hair is 
  up, and she is fastening the clasp to a pearl NECKLACE.  Yoichi is 
  still in the living room.

				ASAKAWA	
		Did grandpa call?

				YOICHI (O.S.) 
		Nope.

  Yoichi walks into the room and faces his mother.

				YOICHI	
		Why did Tomo-chan die? *


  >* -chan is a suffix in Japanese that denotes closeness or affection.  
  >It is most often used for young girls, though it can also be used for 
  >boys.


				ASAKAWA	
		Well... it looks like she was really, 
		really sick.

  She takes a seat on the bed.

				ASAKAWA	
		Will you do me up?

  Yoichi fastens the rear button of his mothers dress and zips her up.  

				YOICHI	
		You can die even if youre young?

				ASAKAWA
		If its something serious... well, yes.

  Asakawa turns to face her son, puts an arm around him.

				ASAKAWA	
		As hard as it is for us, what your 
		auntie and uncle are going through 
		right now is even harder, so lets 
		not talk about this over there, OK?

  Yoichi nods.

				ASAKAWA
			(remembering)
		You and her used to play a lot 
		together, didnt you?

  Yoichi says nothing.

  EXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT  

  RED PAPER LANTERNS mark this place as the site of a wake.  Several 
  GIRLS in high school uniforms are standing together and talking in 
  groups. Asakawa and Yoichi, walking hand in hand, enter the house.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT 

  There are many PEOPLE milling about, speaking softly.  A MAN seated 
  at a counter is taking monetary donations from guests and entering 
  their information into a LEDGER.  Asakawa and Yoichi continue walking, 
  down a hallway.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT 

  Mother and son halt before the open DOOR to the main wake room, where 
  guests may show their respects to the departed.  The room is laid in 
  traditional Japanese-style tatami, a kind of woven straw mat that 
  serves as a carpet. Two GUESTS, their shoes off, are kneeling upon 
  zabuton cushions.  

  Kneeling opposite the guests is KOUICHI, Asakawas father.  The two 
  guests are bowing deeply, and Kouichi bows in response.

				ASAKAWA	
		Dad.

  Kouichi turns to see her.

				KOUICHI
		Ah!

				ASAKAWA
		How is sis holding up?

				KOUICHI
		Shes resting inside right now.  
		Shes shaken up pretty badly, you 
		know.  Its best she just take 
		things easy for a while.

  Asakawa nods.

				ASAKAWA
		Ill go check on auntie and them, 
		then.

				KOUICHI
		OK.  Ah, Yoichi.  Why dont you sit 
		here for a little while?

  He grabs the young boy and seats him on a cushion next to the two guests.  
  As the guests resume their conversation with Asakawas father, Yoichis 
  eyes wander to the ALTAR at the front of the room set up to honor the 
  deceased.  It is made of wood, and surrounded by candles, flowers, and 
  small paper lanterns.  At the center is a PICTURE of the deceased, a 
  teenage girl.  A small wooden PLAQUE reads her name: Tomoko Ouishi. It 
  is the same Tomoko from the first scene.

  Yoichi continues to stare at Tomokos picture.  He makes a peculiar 
  gesture as he does so, rubbing his index finger in small circles just 
  between his eyes.

  INT. HALLWAY  NIGHT

  Asakawa walks down the hallway, looking for her aunt.  She walks until 
  finding the open doorway to the kitchen.  There are a few people in 
  there, preparing busily. Asakawa sees her AUNT, who rushes into the 
  hallway to meet her, holds her fast by the arm.  The aunt speaks in a 
  fierce, quick whisper.

				AUNT		
		Have you heard anything more about 
		Tomo-chans death?

				ASAKAWA	
		No, I...

				AUNT		
		But the police have already finished 
		their autopsy!

				ASAKAWA	
		Well, they said there was no sign of 
		foul play.

				AUNT	
			(shaking her head) 
		That was no normal death.  They havent 
		once opened the casket to let us see
		the body.  Dont you think thats 
		strange?
 
  Asakawa looks away, thinking.

  INT. HALLWAY  NIGHT

  Yoichi has wandered off by himself.  He stops at the foot of the 
  steps, looking up-- and catches a glimpse of a pair of BARE FEET 
  running up to the second floor.  

  A guarded expression on his face, Yoichi walks slowly up the 
  stairs.  

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - TOMOKOS BEDROOM - NIGHT  

  Yoichi has wandered into Tomokos bedroom.  The lights are all off, 
  and there is an eerie feel to it.  Yoichis eyes wander about the 
  room, finally coming to rest on the TELEVISION SET.  Suddenly, he 
  hears his mothers voice from behind him.

				ASAKWAWA (O.S.) 
		Yoichi?

  Yoichi turns to face her as she approaches, puts an arm around him.

				ASAKAWA	
		What are you doing up here?  You
		shouldnt just walk into other 
		peoples rooms.

  Without replying, Yoichis gaze slowly returns to the television 
  set.  Asakawa holds him by the shoulders, turning him to meet 
  her.

				ASAKAWA	
		You go on downstairs, OK?

				YOICHI	
		OK.

  He turns to leave, and Asakawa follows.

  INT. OUSHI HOUSEHOLD - TOP OF THE STAIRS  NIGHT

  Just as Yoichi and Asakawa are about to descend the steps, 
  Asakawas CELL PHONE rings.  She opens the clasp to her PURSE.

				ASAKAWA	
			(to Yoichi) 
		You go on ahead.

				YOICHI	
		K.

  He walks down the steps.  Asakawa brings out her cell phone, 
  answers it.

				ASAKAWA	
		Hello?

				OKAZAKI	
		Uh... this is Okazaki.  Ive got 
		some more info on that article for
		you.  The girl was a student of 
		the uh, Seikei School for Women in 
		Yokahama City.

  Asakawa blinks at this, looks disturbed.


				ASAKAWA	
			(softly) 
		Thanks.

  She hangs up the phone.

  EXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT  

  Asakawa stands now at the entrance of the house.  Dazedly, she 
  walks toward a large, hand-painted PLACARD.  The placard reads 
  that the wake is being held for a student of the Seikei School 
  for Women. 

  Asakawa stares at that placard, making the mental connections.  
  She turns abruptly, walks towards a nearby TRIO of HIGH SCHOOL 
  GIRLS.

				ASAKAWA	
		Excuse me.  This is, um, kind of a
		strange question, but by any chance 
		were you friends of that young girl
		that died in the car as well?

  The three girls turn their faces to the ground.

				ASAKAWA	
		Please.  If you know anything...

				GIRL RIGHT	
		They all died the same day.  Youko.  
		Tomoko.  Even Iwata, he was in a
		motorcycle accident.

				GIRL LEFT	
		Because they watched the video.

				ASAKAWA	
		Video?

				GIRL LEFT	
		Thats what Youko said.  They all
		watched some weird video, and 
		after that their phone rang.

				ASAKAWA	
		Tomoko-chan watched it, too?  
		Where?

  Girl Left shakes her head.

				GIRL LEFT	
		She just said they all stayed 
		somewhere.

				GIRL RIGHT	
		There was a girl with Tomoko when 
		she died.  Shes had to be 
		hospitalized for shock.

				GIRL MIDDLE
		They say she wont go anywhere 
		near a television.


  INT. NEWS STATION - VIEWING BOOTH  DAY

  Asakawa and YOSHINO, another news reporter, are watching scenes 
  from the Yokohama car death.  In the footage there are lots of 
  POLICEMEN milling about, one of them trying to pick the door to 
  the passenger side.  Yoshino is giving Asakawa the blow-by-blow.

				YOSHINO
		The bodies of those found were 
		Tsuji Youko, age 17, a student of 
		the Seikei School for Women, and 
		Nomi Takehiko, age 19, preparatory 
		school student.  Both their doors 
		were securely locked.

  Onscreen, the policeman has finally picked the lock.  The door opens, 
  and a girls BODY halffalls out, head facing upwards.  Yoshino flicks 
  a BUTTON on the control panel, scans the footage frame by frame.  He 
  stops when he gets a good close-up of the victim. 

  Her face is twisted into an insane rictus of fear, mouth open, eyes 
  wide and glassy. Yoshino and Asakawa lean back in their seats.

				YOSHINO
		This is the first time Ive -ever- 
		seen something like this.

				ASAKAWA
		Cause of death?

				YOSHINO
		Couldnt say, aside from sudden 
		heart failure.

				ASAKAWA	
		Drugs?

				YOSHINO	
		The autopsy came up negative.


  Yoshino takes the video off pause.  Onscreen, a policeman has caught 
  the young girls body from completely falling out, and is pushing it 
  back into the car.  As the body moves into an upright position, we 
  can see that the girls PANTIES are mid-way around her left thigh.

				YOSHINO
		These two, about to go at it, 
		suddenly up and die for no 
		apparent reason. 

  He sighs.

				YOSHINO (contd)
		Do -you- get it?


  EXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DAY  

  Asakawas CAR is already halted before a modest-sized, two-story HOUSE 
  with a small covered parkway for a garage.  She gets out of her car, 
  closes the door.  She stares at the house, unmoving.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - DAY  

  Asakawa stands before her SISTER RYOMI, who is seated at the kitchen 
  TABLE.  Ryomi is staring blankly away, making no sign of acknowledging 
  her sister.  The silence continues unabated, and Asakawa, pensive, 
  wanders idly into the adjoining dining room.  She takes a long look at 
  the television, the same television that had puzzled Tomoko by suddenly 
  switching itself on, sitting darkly in one corner.  Her reflection in 
  the screen looks stretched, distorted.


				RYOMI	(O.S.) 
		They tell me that Yoichi came to 
		the funeral, too. 

  Asakawa steps back into the kitchen.  She addresses her sister, who 
  continues to stare out at nothing.

				ASAKAWA
		Mmm-hmm.

				RYOMI
		They used to play a lot together, didnt they?  Upstairs.

				ASAKAWA	
		Yeah...

  Ryomi lapses back into a silence.  Asakawa waits for her to say more, 
  but when it is clear that nothing else is forthcoming, she quietly gives 
  up and exits the kitchen.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  STAIRCASE - DAY  

  Asakawa climbs the steps to the second floor.  She makes her way down 
  the hall.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - TOMOKOS ROOM - DAY  

  As if intruding, Asakawa walks slowly, cautiously into Tomokos room.  
  The window to the room is open, and a single piece of folded white PAPER 
  on Tomokos desk flutters in the breeze.  Asakawa walks towards it, picks 
  it up.  It is a RECEIPT from a photo shop.  The developed photos have yet 
  to be claimed.  

  Asakawa senses something, spins to look over her shoulder.  Her sister 
  has crept quietly up the stairs and down the hall, and stands now in the 
  doorway to Tomokos room.  She appears not to notice what Asakawa has in 
  her hands, as her gaze has already shifted to the sliding closet door.  
  She regards it almost druggedly.

				RYOMI
			(haltingly) 
		This... this is where Tomoko died.

  FLASHBACK
				RYOMI (O.S.)
		Tomoko!

  Ryomis hands fling aside the CLOSET DOOR.  Within, she finds the pale 
  blue CARCASS of her daughter, curled up into an unnatural fetal position.  
  Tomokos mouth yawns gaping, her eyes glassy and rolled up into the back 
  of her head.  Her hands are caught in her hair, as if trying to pull it 
  out by the roots.  It is a horrific scene, one that says Tomoko died as 
  if from some unspeakable fear.

  PRESENT

  Ryomi sinks to her knees, hitting the wooden floor hard.  She puts her 
  face into her hands and begins sobbing loudly.  Asakawa says nothing.

  EXT. CAMERA SHOP  DAY

  Asakawa leaves the camera shop clutching Tomokos unclaimed PHOTOS.  She 
  walks out onto the sidewalk and begins flipping through them.  We see 
  Tomoko standing arm-in-arm with Iwata, her secret boyfriend. Tomoko and 
  her friends eating lunch.  The camera had its date-and-time function 
  enabled, and the photos are marked

    97 8 29.

  The next shot is of Tomoko, Iwata, and another young couple posing in 
  front of a SIGN for a bed and breakfast.  The sign reads:

    IZU PACIFIC LAND

				ASAKAWA	
		Izu...

  Asakawa continues looking through the photos, various shots of the 
  four friends clowning around in their room.  Suddenly she comes to a 
  shot taken the next day, at check out.  The friends are lined up, arms 
  linked-- and all four of their faces are blurred, distorted as if 
  someone had taken an eraser to them and tried to rub them out of 
  existence.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  KITCHEN - DAY

  Asakawa wears an APRON, and is frying something up on the STOVE.  Yoichi 
  stands watching.

				ASAKAWA	
		Look, Im probably going to be late
		coming home tonight, so just stick 
		your dinner in the microwave when 
		youre ready to eat, OK?

				YOICHI	
		K... Mom?

				ASAKAWA	
		Hmm?

				YOICHI	
		Tomo-chan watched some cursed video!


  Asakawa leaves the food on the stove, runs over to Yoichi and grabs him 
  by the shoulders.  She shakes him roughly.

				ASAKAWA	
		What did you say?  You are not to 
		speak of this at school, do you 
		hear me?

				YOICHI	
			(utterly unfazed) 
		I wont.  Im going to school now.

  Yoichi walks off.  Asakawa goes back to the stove, but stops after only 
  a few stirs, staring off and thinking.

  Caption-- September 13th.  Monday.

  EXT. ROAD  DAY

  Asakawa drives her car speedily along a narrow country road, LEAVES 
  blowing up in her wake.

  INT. ASAKAWAS CAR - DAY  

  Asakawa mutters to herself, deep in thought.

				ASAKAWA	
		Theres no way...

  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD  DAY

  Asakawas car drives past a sign reading:

	IZU PACIFIC LAND

  EXT. IZU PACIFIC LAND - DRIVEWAY  DAY

  Asakawa has left her car and is walking around the driveway of what is 
  less a bed and breakfast and more like a series of cabin-style rental 
  COTTAGES. 

  She wanders about for a while, trying to get her bearings.  She pauses 
  now in front of a particular cottage and reaches into her PURSE.  She 
  withdraws the PICTURE from the photomat, the one that showed Tomoko and 
  her friends with their faces all blurred.  The four are posing in front 
  of their cottage, marked in the photograph as B4.  Asakawa lowers the 
  photo to regard the cottage before her.

    B4

  She walks to the door, turns the handle experimentally.  Its open.  
  Asakawa walks in.

  INT. PACIFIC LAND - COTTAGE B4  DAY

  Asakawa lets her eyes wander around the cottage.  It looks very modern, 
  all wood paneling and spacious comfort.  

  Her eyes rest on the TV/VCR setup at the front of the room.  Crouching 
  before the VCR now, she presses the eject button.  Nothing happens.  
  She fingers the inside of the deck, finds it empty, then reaches behind 
  to the rear of the VCR, searching.  Again, there is nothing.  Asakawa 
  presses the power button on the television, picks up the REMOTE, and 
  takes a seat on the SOFA.  She runs through a few channels but theyre 
  all talk shows, no clues whatsoever.  She flicks the TV off and leans 
  back in the sofa, sighing.

  Just then, she spies a LEDGER on the coffee table.  These things are 
  sometimes left in hotels in Japan, so that guests can write a few 
  comments about their stay for others to read.  Asakawa picks the 
  ledger up, begins thumbing through it.  She stops at a strange PICTURE
  obviously drawn by a child, that shows three rotund, almost entirely 
  round personages.  She reads the handwritten MESSAGE.

				ASAKAWA	
		"My dad is fat.  My mom is fat.  
		Thats why Im fat, too."

  She smiles in spite of herself.  

  Asakawa flips through the rest of the ledger, but theres nothing else 
  of any import.  

  She tosses it back onto the coffee table and, sighing again, leans into 
  the sofa and closes her eyes.

  EXT. OUTDOOR CAFÉ - DUSK  

  Asakawa eats silently, alone.

  INT. PACIFIC LAND - FRONT RECEPTION - NIGHT  

  Asakawa has returned to the bed and breakfast.  As she walks in the 
  door, the COUNTER CLERK rises out of his chair to greet her.

				CLERK
		Room for one?

				ASAKAWA	
		Um, actually Im here on business.

  She passes the clerk a picture of Tomoko and her three other friends.  
  He stares at it for a moment.



				ASAKAWA
		They would have stayed here on 
		August 29th, all four of them.  
		If theres any information you 
		might have...

				CLERK
		Uh, hang on just a minute.  

  The clerk turns his back to her, begins leafing through a guest log.

				CLERK	
			(to himself) 
		August 29th...

  While she waits, Asakawas eyes start to wander around the room.  
  Behind the desk is a sign reading Rental Video, and a large wooden 
  BOOKSHELF filled with VIDEOTAPES. They are all in their original boxes, 
  and she lets her eyes glance over the titles.  Raiders of the Lost Ark, 
  48 Hours--

  --and then, suddenly, she spies a VIDEOTAPE in a plain, unmarked 
  sleeve, tucked away in the back of the very bottom shelf.  She feels 
  the hairs on the back of her neck rise.

				ASAKAWA	
		That...

  The clerk looks up.

				CLERK
		Hmm?

  Asakawa stabs a finger excitedly towards the shelf.


				ASAKAWA
		That!  What tape is that?

  The clerk reaches out for it, grabs it.

				CLERK	
		This?  Hmm...

  The clerk pulls the tape out of its SLEEVE and checks for a label.  
  Its unmarked.

				CLERK
		Maybe one of the guests left it behind

  INT. PACIFIC LAND  COTTAGE B4 - NIGHT 

  Asakawa flips on the TV.  Its on channel 2, and there is nothing but 
  static. She kneels down to slide the tape into the deck and pauses a 
  moment, framed in the vaguely spectral LIGHT from the television 
  screen.  Steeling her nerves, she puts the tape into the machine, picks 
  up the remote, and presses play.


  NOTE: This next scene is entirely visual.  If you are reading this 
  translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; STOP 
  reading this now and watch the scene for itself.  Afterwards, you can 
  come back here to check the meaning of the Japanese characters 
  displayed.


  THE VIDEOTAPE

  At first it looks like nothing has happened-- then Asakawa realizes that 
  she is now viewing recorded static instead of broadcast static.  She 
  watches, waiting, but the static continues unbroken.  Asakawa looks 
  down at the remote, is about to press fast forward, when suddenly the 
  picture on the screen clears and for a moment she thinks shes looking 
  at the moon.

  Its not the moon at all, she realizes.  The shape is round like a full 
  moon, but it seems to be made up of thin RIBBONS of cloud streaking 
  against a night sky.  And theres a FACE, she sees, a face hidden in 
  shadows, looking down from above.  

  What is this?

  The scene changes now, and Asakawa notes that the tape has that kind of 
  grainy quality one sees in 3rd or 4th generation copies.  The scene is of 
  a WOMAN brushing her long hair before an oval-shaped MIRROR.  The nerve-
  wracking grating as if of some giant metallic insect sounds in the 
  background, but the lady doesnt seem to notice.  The mirror the lady is 
  using to brush her hair suddenly changes position from the left part of 
  the wall before which she stands, to the right.  Almost instantly the 
  mirror returns to its original position, but in that one moment in its 
  changed location we see a small FIGURE in a white GOWN.  The woman turns 
  towards where that figure stood, and smiles.

  The screen next becomes a twitching, undulating impenetrable sea of the 
  kanji characters used in the Japanese language.  Asakawa can pick out 
  only two things recognizable:

    local     volcanic eruption

  Now the screen is awash in PEOPLE-- crawling, scrabbling, shambling 
  masses, some of them moving in reverse.  A sound like moaning accompanies 
  them.
  -

  A FIGURE stands upon a shore, its face shrouded.  It points accusingly, 
  not towards the screen, but at something unseen off to one side.  The 
  insect-like screeching sounds louder. 
  --

  Close up on inhuman, alien-looking EYE.  Inside that eye a single 
  character is reflected in reverse:  SADA, meaning "chastity."

  The eye blinks once, twice.  The symbol remains.
  ---

  A long shot of an outdoor, uncovered WELL.
  ----

  Sudden loud, blinding STATIC as the tape ends.

  Asakawa turns the TV off, looking physically drained.  She sighs shakily 
  and slumps forward, resting on her knees.  Just then, she glances at the 
  television screen.  She sees, reflected, a small FIGURE in a white gown 
  standing at the rear of the room.  Shocked, Asakawa draws in breath, 
  spins around.

  The room is empty.  Asakawa runs to the sofa to collect her jacket--

  --and the RINGING of the telephone stops her dead in her tracks.  Zombie-
  like, she walks towards the telephone, picks it up wordlessly.  

  From the other end comes the same metallic, insectoid SQUEAKING heard on 
  the video.  Asakawa slams the phone down and glances up at the CLOCK.  
  Its about seven minutes after 7 P.M.

				ASAKAWA	
			(to herself) 
		One week

  Asakawa grabs her coat, pops the tape out of the deck, and runs out the 
  door.

  EXT. STREET  DAY

  It is dark and raining heavily.  Yoichi, Asakawas son, is walking to 
  school, UMBRELLA firmly in hand.  The sidewalk is quite narrow, and Yoichi 
  comes to a halt when a second PERSON comes from the opposite direction, 
  blocking his way. Yoichi slowly raises his umbrella, peers up to look at 
  this other pedestrian.  It is a MAN, a BAG slung over one shoulder.  He 
  has a beard; unusual for Japan where clean-shaven is the norm.  

  The two continue looking directly at each other, neither moving nor 
  speaking.  Yoichi then walks around the persons left and continues on his
   way.  The man resumes walking as well.

  Caption-- September 14th.  Tuesday.

  EXT. OUTSIDE AN APARTMENT DOOR - DAY  

  The bearded man, whose name is RYUJI, reaches out to press the DOORBELL, 
  but the door has already opened from within.  Asakawa leans out, holding 
  the door open for him.  Neither of them speaks.  Wordlessly, Ryuji enters 
  the apartment.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - DAY  

  Ryuji puts his bag down, looks around the apartment.  The interior is dark, 
  ominous somehow.  He takes his JACKET off and wanders into the living room.  
  Asakawa is in the kitchen behind him, preparing TEA.  Ryuji spies the 
  collection of FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS in living room.

				RYUJI
		Yoichis in elementary school 
		already, is he?

				ASAKAWA	
		His first year.  What about you, 
		Ryuji?  How have you been 
		recently?

				RYUJI		
		Same as always.

  She takes a seat next to him, serves the tea.  On the coffee table 
  before them is a VIDEOTAPE in a plain, unmarked case.

				ASAKAWA
		And money is...?

				RYUJI
		Im teaching at university.

  Ryuji picks up his cup of tea but stops, grimacing, before it is to his 
  lips.  He rubs his forehead as if experiencing a sudden headache.  Ryuji 
  shakes it off and quickly regains his composure.

				RYUJI
		Anyway.  You said that the phone rang?

				ASAKAWA
		Thats right.

				RYUJI		
		So if I watch it too, that phone over 
		there--

  He gestures with his mug 

				RYUJI (contd)
		--should ring.

				ASAKAWA
		Ryuji, four people have already 
		died.  On the same day!

				RYUJI
			(flippant) 
		Well, why dont you try calling 
		an exorcist?

  He takes a sip of his tea.  Asakawa reaches quickly, grabs something 
  from the bookshelf behind her-- a POLAROID CAMERA.    She shoves it 
  into Ryujis hands, then turns to look down at the floor.

				ASAKAWA	
		Take my picture.

  Ryuji raises the camera to his eye.

				RYUJI		
		Turn this way.


				ASAKAWA	
			(unmoving) 
		Hurry up and take it.

  Ryuji snaps off a shot.  It comes out the other end and he takes it, 
  waits impatiently for an image to appear.  When it does, all he can 
  do is pass it wordlessly over to Asakawa.  Her face is twisted, 
  misshapen.  

  Just like the picture of Tomoko and her friends.

  Asakawa stares at it, horrified.  By the time she finally looks up, 
  Ryuji has already risen from his seat and slid the videotape into the 
  VCR.  Again, the screen is filled with static, only to be replaced 
  with what looks like the moon.  Asakawa slams the Polaroid on the 
  coffee table and goes outside onto the veranda.  

  EXT. VERANDA - DAY  

  Asakawa stares out at a view of the houses shaded in cloud and rain. 
  There is a knock on the glass door behind her.  A moment later, 
  Ryuji slides the door open.

				RYUJI		
		Its over.

  Asakawa re-enters her apartment.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

				RYUJI		
		Well, it looks like your phones not 
		ringing.

  Ryuji pops the tape from the deck, hands it to Asakawa.

				RYUJI	
		Make me a copy of this, will you?  
		Id like to do a little research
		of my own. Theres no reason to 
		write us off as dead just yet. 

  He dramatically takes a seat.

				RYUJI	(contd)
		If theres a video, that means that 
		somebody had to make it.

				ASAKAWA	
		Theres the guest list from the 
		cottage to look into... and the 
		possibility of someone hacking 
		into the local stations broadcast 
		signals.

  Asakawa pulls a NOTEPAD from her purse and begins busily scribbling 
  away.


  INT. NEWS STATION - DAY  

  Okazaki putters around.

  Caption- September 15th.  Tuesday.

  INT. NEWS STATION - VIEWING BOOTH  DAY

  Asakawa sits by herself, reviewing the videotape.  She is replaying 
  the very last scene, an outdoor shot of a well.  She stares at it 
  carefully, and notices...

  The tape ends, filling the screen with static.  A split-second 
  afterwards, there is a KNOCK on the door and Okazaki enters, holding 
  a FILE.  Asakawa momentarily forgets about the video.

				OKAZAKI	
			(handing her the file)
		Heres that guest list you wanted.

				ASAKAWA	
		Oh, thanks.

				OKAZAKI	
		What are you gonna do with this?

				ASAKAWA	
		Uh... sorry, Im working on 
		something personal.

  EXT. IN FRONT OF A TRAIN STATION - DAY  

  Some quick shots of a FOUNTAIN gushing water, PIGEONS flapping away 
  looking agitated.  CUT to Ryuji sitting on a BENCH.  Hes deep in 
  thought, writing in a NOTEPAD. There are multitudes of PEOPLE about 
  him, and we can hear the sounds of their coming and going.  A PAIR 
  OF LEGS attached to a woman in white dress, hose, and pumps appears, 
  heading directly for Ryuji.  Her pace is slow, rhythmical, and as 
  that pace progresses all other sounds FADE into the background, so 
  that all we can hear is the CLOMP, CLOMP as those legs walk to stand 
  just before Ryuji.  The pumps are scuffed, dirtied with grime.  

  A gust of WIND rips by.  Ryuji fights the urge to look up as in his 
  ears rings the same hollowed, multi-voiced BABBLING heard on the 
  videotape.  The sound grows stronger.

				RYUJI (VO)
 		So, it was you.  You did it.

  The babbling fades, disappears as slowly the worlds normal 
  background sounds return.  Ryuji looks up, but the woman in white 
  is nowhere to be seen.

  EXT. OUTSIDE RYUJIS APARTMENT  AFTERNOON

  Ryuji rides up on a BICYCLE. He turns the corner towards his 
  apartment and finds Asakawa seated on the steps, waiting for him.

				RYUJI		
		Hey.

  Asakawa notes in his face that something is wrong.

				ASAKAWA
 		What happened to you?

				RYUJI
			(gruffly)
		Nothing.

  He enters the building, carrying his bicycle.  Asakawa follows.

  INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON  

  The two walk down the hallway towards the FRONT DOOR to Ryujis 
  apartment.  He unlocks the door and they enter.

  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  AFTERNOON

  Ryuji and Asakawa enter the living room.

				RYUJI
		So, whatd you come up with?

				ASAKAWA
		I dont think any of the guests on 
		the list brought the tape with them.  
		I couldnt confirm it face-to-face 
		of course, but even over the phone I 
		got the feeling they were all being 
		upfront with me.

 				RYUJI
		How about the other angle?  Pirate 
		signals or...

  Asakawa shakes her head.

				ASAKAWA
		Therere no traces of any illegal 
		television signals being broadcast 
		around Izu. 

  She reaches into her purse, pulls out a large white ENVELOPE.


				ASAKAWA
		Heres that copy of the videotape 
		you wanted.

  Ryuji tears the package open.  He squats down on the tatami in 
  frontof his TV and slides the tape in.  Asakawa sits on the 
  tatami as well, but positions herself away from the TV and keeps 
  her eyes averted.  Ryuji glares over his shoulder at her.

				RYUJI
			(sternly) 
		Asakawa.

  She reluctantly scoots closer, looks up at the screen.  Ryuji 
  fast-forwards the tape a bit, stopping at the scene where the 
  woman is brushing her long hair before an oval mirror.  He puts 
  the video on frame-by-frame. 

				RYUJI
		Have you ever seen this woman?

  Asakawa regards the screen intently.

				ASAKAWA
 		No...

  The tape advances to the scene where the mirror suddenly changes 
  positions.  When it does, we can again see the small figure in the 
  white gown, a figure with long black hair. When Ryuji sees this 
  his body stiffens, becomes tense.  Asakawa notices but says nothing.  
  She also notices something else.

				ASAKAWA
			(excitedly) 
		Theres something strange about 
		this shot.

  She takes the remote from Ryuji, rewinds it a ways.  Onscreen, the 
  woman begins coming her long hair again.

				ASAKAWA	
		From this angle, the mirror should 
		be reflecting whoevers filming.

				RYUJI		
		So, what does that mean?

  Asakawa lets out a short sigh.

				ASAKAWA	
		Well, if the person who made this 
		is a pro, thered be a way around 
		that, I guess, but still...

  The screen changes, showing the mass of squiggling kanji characters 
  again.

				RYUJI		
			(reading) 
		Volcanic eruption... Eruption where?

  He pauses the screen, trying to make sense of what is written.


				ASAKAWA	
		This is gonna be impossible to figure 
		out on just a regular TV screen, 
		dont you think?

  They are both still staring at the screen when from behind them comes 
  the SOUND of someone opening the front door.  Ryuji turns off the TV, 
  ejects the tape from the deck.

				RYUJI	
		Come on in.

  Asakawa flashes a look at Ryuji and then turns her head back towards 
  the front door to see who has entered.  A cute, nervous-looking young 
  GIRL with short hair approaches slowly.  She is carrying a PLASTIC BAG 
  filled with groceries.

				RYUJI	
		Asakawa, meet my student, Takano Mai.

  He turns, addresses Mai.

				RYUJI	(contd)	
		This is Asakawa, my ex-wife.

  Ryuji gets up and walks conveniently away.

				MAI		
		Nice to meet you.  Im Takano.

				ASAKAWA	
		Asakawa. *


  > * As you may already be aware, Japanese name order is the 
  >opposite of Englishs, and even close friends may continue to
  >address one another by their last names.  Incidentally, Asakawas
  >first name is Reiko.  In this scene, Mai deferentially refers
  >to Ryuji as sensei, meaning teacher.


  Mai sets the bag of groceries down and chases after Ryuji.  He is 
  putting on his jacket and getting ready to leave.

				MAI	
		Sensei, the people from the 
		publishing company called about 
		the deadline on your thesis again. 

				RYUJI		
			(brusquely) 
		Whatre they talkin to you 
		about it for?

				MAI		
		Because they can never get a 
		hold of you.

  Ryuji picks up his keys, video firmly in hand.

				RYUJI		
		Ask them to wait another week.

				MAI		
		Sensei, ask them yourself, 
		please.

  Ryuji is already headed for the door.  His back is to her as he 
  responds.

				RYUJI	
		OK, OK.

  Asakawa walks after him.  They leave.

  Mai pouts unhappily a bit, and then breaks into a smile as an idea 
  crosses her mind.  She walks across the room to where Ryuji has set 
  up a large BLACKBOARD filled with mathematical equations.  Grinning, 
  Mai rubs out part of one equation with her sleeve and writes in a 
  new value.

  INT. NEWS STATION  HALLWAY - NIGHT  

  Asakawa and Ryuji stride purposefully.  They stop before a DOOR to 
  the right, which Asakawa unlocks.  They both walk in.

  INT. NEWS STATION - VIEWING BOOTH - NIGHT 

  Asakawa and Ryuji sit in a completely darkened room, their eyes 
  glued to the television MONITOR.  They are again watching the scene 
  with the fragmented kanji characters, but despite their efforts have 
  been able to identify only one additional word, bringing the total 
  to three:

	volcanic eruption	  local	     residents

				RYUJI		
		This is impossible.

  Ryuji fast forwards, stopping at the scene with the kanji reflected
  inside an alien-looking EYE.  He reads the kanji aloud. 

				RYUJI
		Sada... 

  Ryuji moves to make a note of this, notices the time.

				RYUJI
		Is Yoichi gonna be all right?

				ASAKAWA	
			(sadly) 
		Hes used to it...

  Short silence.  Ryuji breaks it by gesturing towards the screen. 


				RYUJI
		Whoever made this had to have left 
		some kind of clue behind.  Theyre 
		probably waiting for us to find it.

  Asakawa turns a DIAL to bring up the volume, which up until now has 
  been  on mute.  The room is filled with an eerie, metallic GRATING, 
  and Asakawa spins the dial again, shutting it off.  Just as she does, 
  Ryujis eyes widen.

				RYUJI	
		Wait a minute.

  He turns the dial again, punches a few buttons as if searching for 
  something.  He listens carefully, and when he hears that strange 
  something again he stops, looks at the screen.

  It is paused at the scene with the figure, pointing, a CLOTH draped 
  over its head.  The figure now looks oddly like a messenger.

  Ryuji and Asakawa exchange glances.  This could be it.  Ryuji flips 
  some more switches, setting the sound for super-slow mo.  What follows 
  is a strange, labored sort of speech- a hidden message-- framed in 
  the skittering distortion of the tape in slow motion. 

				TAPE	
		Shoooomonnn bakkkkkarrri toou...  
		boooouuuukonn ga kuuru zouuu...

				RYUJI	
			(repeating) 
		Shoumon bakkari, boukon ga kuru 
		zo.  Did you hear that, too?

  Asakawa nods.  Ryuji is already writing it down excitedly.

				ASAKAWA	
		What does that mean?

  Ryuji tears the sheet of paper off the notepad, folds it, and tucks 
  it into his shirt pocket.

				RYUJI		
		Im gonna check it out.

  EXT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT COMPLEX - MORNING  

  Yoichi is walking to school.  He looks back over his shoulder, just 
  once,then resumes walking.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - MORNING

  All the lights are turned off, and she is sitting on the living room 
  couch watching the footage of her café interview with the junior high 
  school girls.  

  Caption-- September 16th.  Thursday.

  Just when the girl in the interview mentions that whomever watches 
  the video is supposed to afterwards receive a phone call, Asakawas 
  own phone RINGS, startling her. She runs to answer it.

				ASAKAWA	
		Hello?

				RYUJI (O.S.)
		Ive got it.  Its a dialect, just 
		like I thought.  SHOUMON means 
		playing in the water and BOUKON
 		means monster. *


  >* Translated from standard Japanese, the phrase from the videotape 
  >would initially have sounded like, "If only SHOUMON then the 
  >BOUKON will come."  These two capitalized words, later identified to 
  >be dialectical, were at the time completely incomprehensible to Ryuji 
  >and Asakawa.  Dialect can vary dramatically from region to region in 
  >Japan, to the point of speakers of different dialect being unable to
  >understand one another.  

  >The phrase on the tape can now be rendered, "If you keep playing in 
  >the water, the monster will come for you."


				ASAKAWA	
		But, dialect from where?

				RYUJI	
		Oshima.  And the site of our 
		eruption is Mt. Mihara.

  INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT  

  Ryuji and Asakawa are seated at cubicles, looking through bound 
  ARCHIVES of old newspaper articles.  Asakawa sneaks a look at Ryuji, 
  stands up and walks off a little ways.  She has already pulled out her 
  cell phone.

				ASAKAWA	
			(whispering, on phone) 
		Yoichi?  Im gonna be a little 
		late tonight, honey. 

  Ryuji looks over his shoulder at her, scowls.

				ASAKAWA
		You can do it yourself, right?  OK.  
		Sorry.  Bye.

  She hangs up, returns to her seat at the cubicle.  She resumes her 
  scanning of the newspaper articles, and Ryuji shoots her another scowl.  
  Asakawa turns a page and then stops, frowning.  She has spied an article 
  that looks like...

  Nervously, Asakawa puts the thumb and forefinger of each hand together, 
  forming the shape of a rectangle.  Or a screen.  She places the rectangle
  over the article she has just discovered, its headlines reading:

    Mount Mihara Erupts 	Local Residents Urged to Take Precautions

  Ryuji notices her, leans forward excitedly.

				ASAKAWA	
		Ive got it!  This old article...

  The two scan the remainder of the page, and find a smaller, related 
  article.	

    Did Local Girl Predict Eruption?
    A young lady from Sashikiji prefecture...

  The two read over both articles, absorbing the details.  Ryuji stands 
  suddenly, gathering his things.

				ASAKAWA
		What are you doing?

				RYUJI		
		Has your newspaper got someone out 
		there at Oshima?

				ASAKAWA	
		I think so.  There should be a 
		correspondent out there.

				RYUJI	
		I need you to find out, and let me 
		know how to get hold of him.
		Tonight.

  He begins walking briskly away.  Asakawa chases after him.

				ASAKAWA	
		What do you think youre--?

				RYUJI	
			(angrily) 
		Youve only got four days left, 
		Asakawa!  Your newspaper contact 
		and I can handle this from here 
		on out.  You just stay with Yoichi.

  Ryuji strides off.  Asakawa stands motionless.

  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY  

  A car speeds along.  CUT to a gravel DRIVEWAY leading up to a wooden, 
  traditional-style HOUSE.  Kouichi, Asakawas father, is standing before 
  the entrance and puttering around in his GARDEN.  The car from the 
  previous shot drives up, comes to a halt.  The passenger door opens and 
  Yoichi hops out, running towards the old man.  Asakawa walks leisurely 
  after her son.


				YOICHI	
		Grandpa!

				KOUICHI	
		Whoa, there!  So, you made it, huh?

  Caption-- September 17th.  Friday.

				ASAKAWA
		Yoichi says hes looking forward to 
		doing some fishing with you.

				KOUICHI	
		Is that so?

  Yoichi begins tugging excitedly at his grandfathers arm.

				YOICHI	
		Cmon grandpa, lets go!

				KOUICHI	
		OK, OK.  Well get our things 
		together and then we can go.


  EXT. RIVER  DAY  

  Asakawa stands on a RIVERBANK while her father and Yoichi, GUMBOOTS on, 
  are ankle-deep in a shallow river.  Yoichi holds a small NET, and 
  Asakawas dad is pointing and chattering excitedly. 

				KOUICHI
		There he is!  Cmon, there he is, 
		dont let him go!

  Yoichi tries to scoop up the fish his grandfather is pointing out.

				KOUICHI
		Oh, oh!  Ah... guess he got away, 
		huh?

				YOICHI	
		That was your fault, grandpa.

  Asakawas father laughs.

				KOUICHI	
		Well, whaddya say we try again?

  He begins sloshing noisily out to the center of the stream, Yoichi in 
  tow.

				KOUICHI
		Well get im this time.

  Asakawa looks away, pensive.

  INT. KOUICHIS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT  

  Yoichi is passed out asleep on the tatami mats.  A TELEVISION looms 
  inone corner of the living room, but it is switched off.  The 
  SLIDING DOORS to the adjacent guest room are open and we can see 
  futons set out, ready for bed.

  Asakawa enters the living room and, seeing Yoichi, scoops him up in
  her arms and carries him over to the guest room.

				YOICHI
			(sleepily) 
		How was work, mommy?

  Asakawa tucks him into the futons and walks silently off.

  INT. KOUICHIS HOUSE - STAIRCASE  NIGHT  

  Asakawa stands at the foot of the staircase, telephone RECEIVER in 
  hand.  The phone rests on a small STAND by the staircase.

				ASAKAWA	
		Hello?

				RYUJI (O.S.)
		Yeah.  Your Oshima contact came 
		through.  It looks like the woman 
		who predicted the Mihara eruption 
		is the same woman from the video.

  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  NIGHT

  Ryuji is crouched in front of the TV, REMOTE in hand.  The screen is 
  paused on the scene of the woman brushing her long hair.

				RYUJI
		Her name is Yamamura Shizuko.  She 
		committed suicide forty years ago 
		by throwing herself into Mt. Mihara.

  INT. KOUJIS HOUSE  STAIRCASE - NIGHT  

				ASAKAWA
		Have you got anything else?

				RYUJI (O.S.) 
		Im gonna have to check it for 
		myself.  Ill be leaving for 
		Oshima tomorrow morning.

				ASAKAWA
		Oshima?  Ive only got three days 
		left!

				RYUJI (O.S.)
		I know.  And Ive got four.

  Short silence.

				RYUJI (O.S.)
		Ill be in touch.

  Ryuji hangs up.  Asakawa, deep in thought, slowly places the phone 
  back in its CRADLE.  She turns around to walk back down the hallway 
  only to find her father standing there, face full of concern.

				KOUJI
		Whats happened?

  Asakawa shakes her head.

				ASAKAWA
		Nothing.  I just had some things 
		left over from work.

  She walks past her father, who glances worriedly after her over his 
  shoulder.

  INT. KOUJIS HOUSE - GUEST ROOM  NIGHT

  The lights are all off and Asakawa is asleep in her futon.  Her eyes 
  suddenly fly open as a VOICE sounding eerily like her deceased niece 
  Tomoko calls out to her.


				TOMOKO (O.S.) 
		Auntie?

  Asakawa looks around the room, gets her bearings.  Her eyes fall on 
  the futon next to hers.

				ASAKAWA
		Yoichi?

  There is a BODY in that futon, but it is full-grown, dressed all in 
  black.  It is curled into a fetal position and has its head turned 
  away.

  Suddenly, the IMAGE from the video of the figure with its face 
  shrouded springs to Asakawas mind.  Just an instant, its pointing 
  visage materializes, and then disappears.  It reappears a moment 
  later, pointing more insistently now, and disappears again.  

  Asakawa blinks her eyes and realizes that the futon next to hers is 
  empty.  Yoichi is nowhere to be seen.

  Just then, she hears that high-pitched, metallic SQUEAKING from the 
  video.  Eyes wide with horror, she flings the sliding doors apart--
  --and there, seated before the television, is Yoichi.

  He is watching the video.

  It is already at the very last scene, the shot of the outdoor well. 
  CLOSEUP on the screen now, and for just an instant we can see that 
  something is trying to claw its way out of the well.  The video cuts 
  off, and the screen fills with static.  

  Shrieking, Asakawa races over to Yoichi, covers his eyes though it is 
  already too late.  She scoots over to the VCR, ejects the tape and 
  stares at it uncomprehendingly.  She is then at Yoichis side again, 
  shaking him roughly.

				ASAKAWA
		Yoichi!  You brought this with you, 
		didnt you?  Why?!?

				YOICHI	
		Tomo-chan...

  Asakawa freezes, her eyes wide.

				YOICHI	
		Tomo-chan told me to watch it.

  EXT. OCEAN  DAY
  
  WAVES are being kicked up by a large PASSENGER SHIP as it speeds on 
  its way.  CUT to Asakawa and Ryuji standing on deck, looking out over 
  the waves.

				RYUJI	
		I shouldve been more careful.  
		When I was at your place that 
		day, I could feel something 
		there.  I thought it was just 
		because of the video... 

				ASAKAWA	
		You mean that Tomoko

				RYUJI		
		Thats not Tomoko.  Not anymore.



				ASAKAWA	
		Yoichi... he can see them too, 
		cant he?

  Ryuji nods his head, lowers it sadly.

				ASAKAWA	
		Its all my fault.  First Tomoko 
		died, then those three others.  It 
		should have stopped there, but it 
		didnt.  Because of me.

				RYUJI	
		I wonder...

  Asakawa turns to Ryuji suddenly.

				ASAKAWA
		How did the rumors about the 
		video even start in the first 
		place?


				RYUJI	
		This kind of thing... it doesnt 
		start by one person telling a 
		story.  Its more like everyones 
		fear just takes on a life of its 
		own.

				ASAKAWA	
		Fear...

				RYUJI
		Or maybe its not fear at all.  
		Maybe its what we were 
		secretly hoping for all along.

  EXT. PORT  DAY  

  The ship has docked, its GANGPLANK extended.  Ryuji and Asakawa walk 
  the length of the gangplank towards the shore.  A man named MR. 
  HAYATSU is already waiting for them.  He holds up a white SIGNBOARD 
  in both hands.
 
				ASAKAWA	
		Mr. Hayatsu?

				HAYATSU	
		Aah, welcome!  You must be tired 
		after your long trip.  Please, 
		this way.

  Mr. Hayatsu leads Asakawa and Ryuji to an awaiting minivan.

  Caption-- September 18th.  Saturday.

  INT. HAYATSUS MINIVAN - DAY  

  Ryuji and Asakawa sit in the back.  Mr. Hayatsu is behind the wheel, 
  chattering away.

				HAYATSU	
		Back in the old days, the Yamamuras
		used to head fishing boats out in 
		Sashikiji, though they dont much 
		anymore.  You know, one of Shizukos 
		cousins is still alive. Hes just an 
		old man now.  His son and his 
		daughter-in-law run an old-fashioned 
		inn.  I went ahead and booked 
		reservations for yall, hope thats 
		alright...

  Asakawa gives the briefest of nods in reply, after which the 
  minivan lapses into silence.  Asakawa looks dreamily out at the 
  mountain-studded landscape, then suddenly snaps to.

				ASAKAWA
			(to Ryuji) 
		Why did Yamamura Shizuko commit 
		suicide?

				RYUJI	
		She was taking a real beating 
		in the press, being called a 
		fraud and all sorts of names.  
		After a while she just lost it. 

  CUT to a scene of the minivan speeding along a country road.

  INT. HAYATSUS MINIVAN  DAY 

				RYUJI
		Shizuko was getting a lot of 
		attention around the island after
		predicting the eruption of Mt. 
		Mihara.  Seems that for some time 
		shed had a rather unique ability:
		precognition. It was around then
		that she attracted the attention 
		of a certain scholar whom you may 
		have heard of; Ikuma Heihachiro.   

				ASAKAWA
		He was driven out of the university, 
		wasnt he?

  Ryuji nods.

				RYUJI
		This Professor Ikuma convinces 
		Shizuko to go to Tokyo with him, 
		where he uses her in a series of 
		demonstrations meant to prove the 
		existence of ESP.  At first shes 
		the darling of the press, but the 
		next thing you know theyre 
		knocking her down, calling her a 
		fraud.  Hmph.  Forty years later,
		the media still hasnt changed that
		much.

  Asakawa continues, ignoring Ryujis barb.

				ASAKAWA
		Ive heard this story.  But... Im 
		sure I remember hearing that somebody 
		died at one of those demonstrations.

  A strange look crosses Ryujis face.  He looks away, ignores her 
  for a moment.

				RYUJI
		After getting kicked out of 
		university, Ikuma just vanished, 
		and no ones been able to get hold 
		of him since.  Hes probably not 
		even alive anymore.

				ASAKAWA
		But, why even try looking for him?

				RYUJI
		Because hes supposed to have had a 
		child with Shizuko.  A daughter.

  Asakawa freezes.  In her mind, she sees a small FIGURE dressed in 
  white, its face hidden by long, black HAIR.  It is the figure from 
  the video.

  EXT. OUTSIDE YAMAMURA VILLA - DAY  

  Mr. Hayatsu leads Asakawa and Ryuji to the entrance.

				HAYATSU	
		Hello?

  The INKEEPER, a middle-aged lady named KAZUE wearing a traditional 
  KIMONO, comes shuffling up.  She addresses Mr. Hayatsu.

				KAZUE	
		Thank you.

  She turns to Asakawa and Ryuji.

				KAZUE (contd)
		Welcome.

				HAYATSU
		Well, Ill be off then.

  He gives a little bow and is off.  Kazue, meanwhile, has produced 
  two pairs of SLIPPERS, which she offers to Ryuji and Asakawa.

				KAZUE
		Please.

  Ryuji and Asakawa begin removing their shoes. 

  INT. YAMAMURA VILLA  STAIRCASE - DAY  

  Kazue leads Ryuji and Asakawa up a shadowed, wooden STAIRCASE.

				KAZUE
		And for your rooms, how shall we...? 

				RYUJI
		Separate, please.

				KAZUE
		Sir.

  INT. YAMAMURA VILLA - 2ND FLOOR  DAY

  Kazue gives a little bow.

				KAZUE
		This way.

  Kazue turns to the right.  Almost immediately after reaching the 
  top of the steps, however, a strange look crosses Ryujis face.  
  He heads down the opposite end of the corridor, Asakawa close 
  behind.

				KAZUE
			(alarmed) 
		Sir!

  Ryuji flings open the SLIDING DOOR to one of the older rooms.  There, 
  hanging from one of the walls, is the oval-shaped MIRROR from the 
  video, the one used by the mysterious lady to brush her long hair.  
  Ryuji stares at the mirror, almost wincing.  He turns around as if 
  to look at Asakawa,but continues turning, looks past her.  Asakawa 
  follows his gaze, as does Kazue.  Standing at the end of the corridor 
  is an old man, MR. YAMAMURA. 

  Yamamura regards them silently, balefully.  Breaking the silence, 
  Kazue gestures for Asakawa and Ryuji to follow.

				KAZUE
			(softly) 
		Please, this way.

  Asakawa races past the innkeeper towards the old man.  He keeps his 
  back turned towards her.

				ASAKAWA
		Please!  If you could just answer 
		a few questions, about Shizuko...

				YAMAMURA
		I got nuthin to say.

				ASAKAWA
		Its about Shizukos daughter.

  The old man says nothing.

				ASAKAWA
		She did have a daughter, didnt she?

  Yamamura regards her for a moment, then turns to walk away.

				YAMAMURA	
  		Youre wasting your time.

  INT. YAMAMURA VILLA - DINING ROOM  NIGHT

  The TABLE is laid out with an elaborate-looking DINNER.  Asakawa 
  sits alone, knees curled up to her chin, eyes wide and frightened.  
  She is whimpering softly to herself.  Just then, the DOOR slides 
  open and Ryuji walks in.  He sits at the table and picks up a 
  pair of CHOPSTICKS.

				RYUJI		
		Arent you gonna eat?

				ASAKAWA	
		Umm...

				RYUJI		
		Hm?

				ASAKAWA	
		Youll stay with me wont you?  
		When its time for me to die.

				RYUJI		
		Oh, stop it.

  Asakawa scoots across the tatami mats towards the table, grabs 
  Ryuji fiercely by the arm.

				ASAKAWA
		Youll stay, wont you?  If you 
		stayed, maybe youd learn something
		that could help Yoichi--

				RYUJI
		I said stop it!  Have you forgotten 
		There was a girl with Tomoko when 
		she died?  That girls now in a 
		mental institution.  Who knows what 
		could happen. 

				ASAKAWA	
		But you could stay with me, Ryuji.  
		Youd be OK.


				RYUJI
			(angrily)
		Why, because Im already not 
		right in the head?

  Asakawa releases her hold on Ryujis arm, lowers her head.  Ryuji 
  slams his chopsticks down angrily.

				RYUJI	
		If thats the case, why not just
		let things run its course, get rid
		of father -and- son?  Yoichi was a
		mistake, anyway.

				ASAKAWA
		Stop it!

  Short silence.  When Ryuji speaks up again, his voice is soft, 
  reassuring.

				RYUJI	
		We still have two days left...

  Just then the VOICE of the innkeeper calls tentatively out from 
  the other side of the sliding door.

				KAZUE (O.S.) 
		Excuse me?

				RYUJI	
		Come in.

  Kazue slides the door open.  She stands hesitantly in the doorway, 
  something tucked under one arm.


				KAZUE	
		Its about Miss Shizuko.  

  Ryuji shoots a glance at Asakawa and stands up from the table, 
  walks towards the innkeeper.

				KAZUE	
		This is all that there is...

  Kazue produces an old black and white PHOTOGRAPH.  The photo shows a 
  WOMAN, seated, dressed in a KIMONO.  A MAN in a Western-style SUIT 
  stands beside her.  

				RYUJI	
		Is this Professor Ikuma?

  Hearing this Asakawa leaps up, walks over to examine the picture for 
  herself.

				KAZUE
		...yes.  This picture is from before 
		Id entered the household.  

  She pauses a moment.

				KAZUE (contd)
		I should go now.

  The innkeeper scuttles off, leaving Asakawa and Ryuji alone with the 
  photograph.  Unbidden, the VOICE from the video enters their 
  thoughts.

				VOICE
		Shoumon bakkari... boukon ga kuru zo...


  EXT. IZU SEASHORE - DAY

  Asakawa watches Ryuji stride down the shore.

  Caption-- September 19th.  Monday.

  Ryuji strolls up to find old man Yamamura sitting alone, staring 
  out at the sea.  Yamamura glances up to see Ryuji approaching.  
  Ryuji takes a seat next to the old man, but its Yamamura who speaks 
  first.  The deep basso of his voice emphasizes the drawl of his 
  accent.

				YAMAMURA	
		Yalld do best to be off soon.  
		Seas probably gonna be rough 
		tonight.

				RYUJI		
		What kind of a child was Shizuko?

				YAMAMURA 
		Shizuko was... different.  Shed come 
		out here by herself everday an just
		stare out at the ocean.  The fishermen 
		all took a dislikin to her.  Oceans 
		an unlucky place for us, ysee: every 
		year it swallows up more of our own. 
		You keep starin out at somethin 
		ike that... 

				RYUJI
      		Shoumon bakkari shiteru to, boukon ga 
		kuru zo.  If you keep playing in the 
		water, the monster will come for you.

  Yamamura looks at Ryuji, surprised.  

				RYUJI
		Shizuko could see inside people, 
		couldnt she?  Down to the places 
		theyd most like to keep hidden.  It 
		must have been difficult for her...

  Yamamura rises unsteadily to his feet, features twisted angrily.

				YAMAMURA
 		Please leave!  Now!

  Ryuji stands, takes hold of Yamamuras arm.

				RYUJI
		Ive got a little of that ability 
		myself.  It was you who spread the 
		word about Shizuko, wasnt it?  
		And you who first contacted 
		Professor Ikuma?

				YAMAMURA	
		Whatre you--?

				RYUJI
		You thought youd be able to make 
		some money off her.  You even got 
		some, from one of the newspapers.

				YAMAMURA		
		Leave me the hell alone!

  Mr. Yamamura strides angrily off.  Both Ryuji and Asakawa take 
  pursuit, Ryuji calling out from behind Yamamuras back.


				RYUJI		
		Tell us about Shizukos daughter.  
		Who was she?

				YAMAMURA	
		I dont know!

				RYUJI		
		She was there, with Shizuko. She 
		had to be.

  Yamamuras pace, which has become increasingly erratic, finally 
  causes him to stumble and fall.  Ryuji comes up behind him, 
  grasping him firmly.  At their touch Ryujis power awakens, and as 
  he peers into the old mans mind there is a sudden blinding

  FLASH

  The setting is a large MEETING HALL.  A number of people are seated 
  in folding chairs before a STAGE, on which are a four MEN in BUSINESS 
  SUITS and a WOMAN in a KIMONO.  A BANNER hangs above the stage, which 
  reads PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION ON THE EXISTENCE OF CLAIRVOYANCE.  

  FLASH

  Ryuji eyes widen as he realizes he is seeing Shizukos demonstration 
  before the press.  He also realizes--

				RYUJI
			(to Yamamura)
		You were there!

  FLASH

  YAMAMURA SHIZUKO, the woman in the kimono, is sitting at a TABLE 
  onstage. Her face is calm and expressionless.  Standing off to one 
  side and peering from behind the curtains is a young Mr. Yamamura.

				RYUJI	(O.S.) 
		You stood there and watched the 
		demonstration.

  CUT back to the beach.  Asakawa comes running up toward Ryuji and the 
  prone Mr. Yamamura.  Suddenly there is another

  FLASH

  Asakawa, her eyes wide, finds herself inside the scene, reliving it 
  as if she had actually been there.  She watches as Shizuko receives 
  a sealed clay POT in both hands.  Shizuko regards the pot a moment 
  and then places it gently on the table before her.  She takes a 
  calligraphy STYLUS from the table, begins writing on a thin, 
  rectangular sheet of RICE PAPER.  The members of the press talk 
  excitedly, craning their necks for a better look.

  Onstage, a JUDGE holds up the phrase written by Shizuko and the 
  folded sheet of paper taken from the sealed pot.  The phrase on both 
  sheets is identical.

				JUDGE		
		Match.

  Cameras begin FLASHING excitedly.  Shizukos features melt into a soft 
  smile. 

  The experiment is performed again, and again the phrase written by 
  Shizuko corresponds to the sealed sheet of paper.

				JUDGE
		Match.

  Again and again, Shizuko unerringly demonstrates her power to see 
  the unseen.  Finally, a bearded REPORTER explodes from his chair, 
  begins striding angrily towards the stage.

				REPORTER	
		Faker!  This is nothing but trickery, 
		and the lowest form of trickery at 
		that. 

  The reporter stops at the foot of the stage, points his finger 
  accusingly at Shizuko.

				REPORTER	
		What are you trying to pull, woman?

  A SECOND REPORTER sitting in the front row also rises to his feet.

				REPORTER #2	
		Thats right!  Professor Ikuma, 
		youre being fooled!

  By now most of the press has risen from their chairs, pointing and 
  shouting angrily. Onstage, Shizuko backs away, eyes wide and 
  frightened.  She covers both ears, trying to block out the increasing 
  din.  Professor Ikuma holds her protectively by the shoulders.  The 
  first reporter is still shouting angrily, his voice rising above the 
  others.  Suddenly, a pained look crosses his face and he collapses to 
  the floor.  The crowd, and Asakawa as well, see that the reporters 
  face is contorted into a grotesque mask of fear.

				REPORTER #3	
		Whats happened?

				REPORTER #4	
		Hes dead!



				REPORTER #5	
			(to Shizuko) 
		Witch!

  Professor Ikuma begins leading Shizuko offstage.  They stop as someone 
  unseen steps up, blocking their passage.  Shizukos eyes widen, her 
  head shaking in disbelief.

				SHIZUKO
		Sadako?  Was it you?

  CUT to Ryuji on the beach.  He looks up excitedly.

				RYUJI		
		Sadako?!

  He recalls the image from the video, the alien eye with the single 
  character SADA reflected in reverse. *


  >* The majority of girls' names in Japanese end in either -mi ("beauty") 
  >or -ko ("child").  Thus, Sadako means "Chaste child."  Sadako is, of 
  >course, the mysterious daughter of Shizuko and Professor Ikuma.


				RYUJI
		Sadako killed him?  She can kill 
		just with a thought?

				YAMAMURA	
		Shes... a devil spawn.

  CUT back to the demonstration hall.  Sadako, her face completely hidden 
  by her long hair, runs offstage... and heads directly for Asakawa.  
  Asakawa instinctively raises her arm, and Sadako grasps it fiercely.  
  All the nails on Sadako hand are stripped away; her fingers are raw, 
  bloody stumps.

  CUT back to the beach.  Asakawa, still caught in the throes of the 
  vision, has begun to swoon.  Finally her legs give out and she crumples 
  to the beach.  Ryuji grabs hold of her supportively.  He glances down at 
  her wrist, sees an ugly, purple BRUISE already beginning to form.  

  The bruise is in the shape of five long, spindly fingers.

  Mr. Yamamura slowly rises to a sitting position, and together the three 
  watch the approach of ominous, dark STORM CLOUDS.

  INT. MR. HAYATSUS HOUSE  DUSK

  Asakawa is on the phone, her voice almost frantic.

				ASAKAWA
		Thats right. After Yamamura Shizuko 
		committed suicide, Professor Ikuma
		took the daughter and ran.  No, no one
		knows where they went.  Thats why I 
		need -you- to find out where they are.  
		Even if the professors dead, Sadako 
		should still be in her forties.  Ill 
		explain it all later, but right now 
		just hurry!

  Asakawa slams the phone down.  PAN to show Ryuji slumped in one corner 
  of the room, his back to the wall.

				RYUJI	
		Sadakos probably already dead.  She
		could kill people with just a thought, 
		remember?  Her mother wasnt even 
		close to that.


				ASAKAWA	
			(flustered) 
		Well, what about that video?  If 
		Sadakos dead then who made it?

				RYUJI	
		Nobody made it. It wasnt made at 
		all. That video... is the pure, 
		physical manifestation of Sadakos 
		hatred.

  Ryuji turns to regard Asakawa, his eyes blank.

				RYUJI
		Weve been cursed.

  There is a moment of silence before Mr. Hayatsu slides the door open, 
  almost falling into the room.  He is out of breath, and speaks rapidly.

				HAYATSU	
		Its no good.  With the typhoon 
		coming in, all ships are 
		temporarily staying docked.

				RYUJI	
		What about the fishing boats?  
		Tell their captains Ill pay.

				HAYATSU
		Fishing boats?  Sir, without knowing 
		whether this typhoon is going to hit 
		us or not, I think itd be better to 
		wait and see how things turn--

  Ryuji interrupts him, slamming both palms on the table.  Glasses 
  rattle wildly.

				RYUJI	
		Fine!  Ill try searching myself!

  Ryuji stands and races past Mr. Hayatsu out into the rain.  Hayatsu 
  takes pursuit, calling after him.

				HAYATSU	
		Mr. Takayama!?  Mr. Takayama...

  Asakawa, left alone, stares down at the tatami mats.

  EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT  

  White-capped waves roll angrily in a black sea.

  INT. MR. HAYATSUS HOUSE  NIGHT

  Asakawa sits at a table, alone, her hands clasped as if in prayer.  Her 
  eyes are wide and glassy.  The phone RINGS suddenly and Asakawa dives 
  for it, wrenching it from the cradle before it can ring a second time.

				ASAKAWA	
		Hello?

				OKAZAKI (O.S.) 
		Mrs. Asakawa?  Im sorry.  I tried, 
		but I couldnt come up with any 
		leads at all.

  A look of abject fear crosses Asakawas face.  She begins retreating 
  into herself.


				OKAZAKI (O.S.) 
		Hello?

				ASAKAWA
			(softly) 
		Thank you...

  Asakawa slowly places the phone back in its cradle.  Almost immediately, 
  her face begins to crumple.  She falls to her knees, sobbing into the 
  floor.

				ASAKAWA	
		Yoichi...

  She cries a while longer but suddenly stops.  Her face, eyes streaked 
  with tears, shoots suddenly up, stares directly at the telephone.

				ASAKAWA	 
			(softly) 
		Izu...

  EXT. IZU WHARF  NIGHT

  Asakawa stands looking down on the wharf, scanning. 

  Several FISHING BOATS are docked.  The wind whips her hair crazily 
  around.   She continues scanning, and suddenly she spies--

				ASAKAWA	
			(calling) 
		Ryuji!

  Asakawa runs down onto the wharf, heading towards Ryuji.  He is 
  in mid-conversation with Mr. Hayatsu.

				ASAKAWA	
		Ryuji!  The phone in my apartment 
		never rang!  It only ever rang at
		the rental cottage!  Professor 
		Ikuma mustve...

				RYUJI	
		And weve got no way of going back.

				HAYATSU	
		Its too dangerous!  The thought of 
		anybody going out in this weather...

  The three fall into silence as they realize the powerlessness of their 
  situation.  Suddenly, a deep VOICE booms from behind them.

				YAMAMURA (O.S.) 
		Ill take you out.

  The three spin around to see Mr. Yamamura, his ROBES flapping in the 
  gusty night air. He begins walking towards them.

				YAMAMURA	
		Sadako is callin yall, reckon.  
		Mayhap to drag you down under the 
		water.

  Short silence.  Ryuji shoots a short questioning glance at Asakawa, 
  turns back to face Mr. Yamamura.

				RYUJI	
		Please.  Take us out.



  EXT. OCEAN  NIGHT

  A tiny FISHING BOAT is tossed about on the waves.  Mr. Yamamura stands 
  at the wheel, his face expressionless.

  INT. MR. YAMAMURAS FISHING BOAT  NIGHT

  Ryuji and Asakawa are crouched close together in the cabin.  Asakawas 
  expression is dreamy, faraway.

				ASAKAWA
		Its funny.  Im not afraid at all.  

  Ryuji leans over, rubs her hand comfortingly.  Suddenly he switches 
  back into analytical mode.

				RYUJI	
		Sadako probably died back out there
		at Izu, before the rental cottages 
		were ever built.

				ASAKAWA	
		So, Sadako was Professor Ikumas 
		daughter?

				RYUJI
			(nodding) 
		Ikuma smuggled her out in secret.  
		His relationship with Shizuko was 
		already a scandal, and one of the 
		reasons he got drummed out of the 
		university... Weve gotta find 
		Sadakos body.



				ASAKAWA
			(excitedly) 
		Is that going to break the curse?  
		Will Yoichi be all right?

				RYUJI	
		Its all weve got left to try.

				ASAKAWA	
		Just one more day...

  Ryuji puts his arm around Asakawa.

  EXT. MR. YAMAMURAS FISHING BOAT - DAWN  

  Ryuji stands on deck, looking out over the water.  He heads down 
  below toward the captains area.  Mr. Yamamura is at the wheel.

				RYUJI	
		We made it.  Maybe Sadako doesnt 
		have it out for us after all.

  Long pause as Mr. Yamamura says nothing.

				YAMAMURA
		Shizuko... she used to -speak- to 
		the ocean, just ramble away.  One 
		time I hid, listenin to one of her 
		conversations.

  Mr. Yamamura pauses again.

				YAMAMURA (contd)	
		And it werent in no human language.


  EXT. MR. YAMAMURAS FISHING BOAT  DAWN

  Asakawa has climbed out on deck and is looking up towards the sunrise.

  Caption-- September 20th.  Monday.

  EXT. HARDWARE STORE  DAY

  Ryuji races out of the store, loaded down with supplies.  He holds a 
  pair of BUCKETS in one hand and a CROWBAR and SHOVEL in the other.  A 
  length of ROPE is coiled over his left shoulder.  He runs towards a 
  RENTAL CAR, passing by Asakawa who stands at a PAYPHONE, receiver in 
  hand.

				YOICHI (O.S.) 
		Hello?

				ASAKAWA	
		Yoichi?  Its mommy.  I just called 
		to say Ill be coming home tomorrow.

  Ryuji shoots a look at her over his shoulder.

				YOICHI (O.S.) 
		Im tired of it here, mom!  I wanna
		go back to school.

				ASAKAWA
			(smiling) 
		Yoichi, its rude to your grandpa 
		to talk like that.

				YOICHI (O.S.) 
		Hes laughing.  You wanna talk to him?

				ASAKAWA	
		No, thats...

  Asakawa pauses, her voice hitching.  She seems about to lose 
  her composure.

				ASAKAWA	
		Im sorry, Yoichi.  Ill... Ill 
		see you tomorrow.  

				YOICHI (O.S.)	
		Whats wrong?

  Asakawas face scrunches up in an effort to hold back tears.

				ASAKAWA	
		Mommys got something she has to do.  
		Say hello to grandpa for me, OK?

  Ryuji stands by the car, scowling over at Asakawa.  He shuts the DOOR 
  just short of a slam.  CUT to Asakawa hanging up the phone.  She half-
  runs towards the rental car and enters the passenger side, staring 
  blankly into space.  Ryuji slides into the drivers seat, buckles his 
  SEATBELT.  

				RYUJI		
		What time was it when you first 
		watched the video?

  Asakawa glances at her watch.

				ASAKAWA	
		Seven or eight minutes past 
		seven.  PM.  No more than ten 
		minutes past.
 		
				RYUJI
		If the rumors are true, that 
		time is gonna be our deadline.

  Asakawa buckles up as Ryuji steps on the gas.

  INT. RENTAL CAR  DAY

  Asakawa sits in the passenger side.  Her face is almost angelic, 
  with the faintest hint of a smile.  Ryuji shoots a questioning look 
  at her.

  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD  DAY

  The white rental car tears past the SIGN reading Izu Pacific Land.  
  The car continues into the LOT, screeching around corners before 
  coming to an abrupt halt.  Asakawa, her face still oddly expressionless, 
  gets out of the passenger side.  Ryuji exits as well, the hint of a 
  shudder running through him as he regards the series of rental cabins.

				RYUJI		
		-Here-.

  CUT to Asakawa and Ryuji walking up the gravel PATH towards the rental 
  cabins.  Ryuji looks back over his shoulder as both he and Asakawa stop 
  before cabin B4.  The cabin is on STILTS, its underbelly fenced off by 
  wooden LATICEWORK.  Ryuji drops most of his supplies to the ground, but 
  keeps hold of the PICK.  He raises the pick over one shoulder and begins 
  smashing away at the latticework.  When he has cleared enough space for   
  passage, he begins picking up supplies and tossing them hastily within.  
  When finished, he holds a hand out for Asakawa.  The two enter the 
  earthen basement.


  UNDER COTTAGE B4 - DAY  

  Ryuji pulls a FLASHLIGHT out, flicks it on.  The BEAM arcs outwards, 
  illuminating what looks more like an old mine shaft than a modern 
  rental cottage.  The beam halts when it suddenly encounters an old 
  STONE WELL.  The well is badly chipped on one side, and sealed off 
  with a solid-looking stone LID.  Ryuji rushes quickly towards it.

				RYUJI
		I knew it!  The well.

  He squats down beside the well, setting the flashlight on the 
  lid.  Asakawa sinks slowly down beside him.

				ASAKAWA
		The well...

  Ryuji reaches out and takes Asakawas hand.  He sets their enclasped 
  hands onto the lid, and together they begin lightly tracing the 
  surface of the lid with their free hands.  Asakawa closes her eyes in 
  concentration... and suddenly, as with the incident on the beach, 
  Asakawa finds herself drawn into Ryujis psychometric VISION.

  FLASH

  The picture is black and white, grainy like old film.  A YOUNG GIRL in 
  a WHITE GOWN walks slowly towards an open well. She places her hand on 
  the LIP of the well, peers curiously down.  

  FLASH

  Asakawa looks up, her eyes wide open.

  FLASH
  
  There is now a second person in the vision, an ELDERLY MAN in an old-
  fashioned tweed SUIT standing behind the young girl.  He suddenly 
  produces some BLADED OBJECT, and strikes the girl savagely across the 
  back of the head.  

  The girl falls forward. The man drops to the ground, grabbing the girl 
  behind the knees and hoisting her limp BODY over the lip and into the 
  well.  The body falls into its depths.

  Panting heavily, the man leans forward and grasps the lip of the well 
  with both hands, looking down.  He flashes a guilty look in either 
  direction, checking that his crime has gone unnoticed, and as he does 
  so Asakawa realizes that she knows this face.  The image from the 
  videotape, like a face in the moon: it had been Sadako inside the well, 
  looking up to see this man staring back down at her.

  This man whose name is Professor Ikuma Heihachiro.

  FLASH

				ASAKAWA
		Her own father!

  The energy seems to drain out of Asakawa in a rush, and her body 
  crumbles.  Ryuji catches hold of her.

				RYUJI		
		It was Ikuma who put this lid on.  
		And Sadakos still inside.

  Ryuji stands quickly, takes hold of the crowbar.  He inserts it under 
  the lid and begins trying to pry it off, face scrunched with effort.  
  Asakawa digs her fingers in and lends her own strength as well. Slowly,
  the lid begins to move.  Ryuji tosses the crowbar aside and the two 
  lean the combined weight of their bodies into it.  The lid slides off, 
  dropping to the earth with a dull THUD.  Ryuji sits to one side, winded 
  with effort, as Asakawa takes hold of the flashlight.  She shines it 
  down into the well, but it only seems to intensify the gloom. What 
  WATER she can see looks fetid and brackish.  Ryuji sees her expression 
  and begins removing his JACKET.

				RYUJI
		Ill go.

  He walks off, leaving Asakawa alone.

  CUT to an overhead shot of the well.  A ROPE is fastened to one side, 
  and Ryuji has already begun lowering himself down.  His eyes wander 
  overthe grime-smeared WALLS, and with a shudder he begins to pick out 
  human FINGERNAILS.  Torn loose and spattered with blood, countless 
  fingernails line the sides of the well. 

				RYUJI
 		Sadako was alive!  Shed tried to 
		climb her way out.

  Ryujis face twists into a grimace as if momentarily experiencing 
  Sadakosterrible agony.  He waits a moment longer before edging his 
  way down the rope again, finally SPLASHING to rest at the bottom of 
  the well.  He holds his flashlight above the brackish water, calls up 
  to Asakawa.

				RYUJI
		Lower the buckets!

  Asakawa nods and lowers two plastic BUCKETS fastened to a rope.  Ryuji 
  grabs one and scoops up a bucketful of water, tugging on the rope when 
  finished.

				RYUJI
		Take it up!

  Asakawa hoists the bucket up to the rim of the well.  She walks a small 
  distance and tosses the contents out onto the ground.  She happens to 
  glance through the wooden lattice to the outside, and with a start 
  realizes that the sun has already started to set.  A nervous glance at 
  her WATCH later and she is back at the well, lowering the empty bucket 
  to find another full one already awaiting her.

				RYUJI
		Take it up!

  In the well, Ryuji glances at his watch.  He looks at it for a long 
  moment, the expression on his face saying Were not going to make it.  
  Time passes as Asakawa pulls up bucketload after bucketload, her 
  strength beginning to fade.  She half-stumbles, glances up... and is 
  shocked to realize that NIGHT has fallen.

  CUT to Asakawa slowly pulling up yet another bucket, her strength 
  almost gone.  She looks at her watch and sees that it is now past 
  6:00.  She calls frantically down to Ryuji.

				ASAKAWA
		Its already six!

				RYUJI
			(explosively) 
		I know!  Hurry up and TAKE IT UP!!

  The bucket slowly jerks into motion.  Asakawa pulls it up to the rim 
  of the well, holds it unsteadily.  She takes one faltering step and 
  falls, spilling the buckets contents onto the ground.  

  CUT to Ryuji in the well, standing ready with another bucketful.


				RYUJI
 		Take it up!

  Nothing happens.  

				RYUJI
		Asakawa!

  The bucket begins moving, even slower than before.  CUT to Asakawa, 
  her body trembling with effort. By now its all she can do to simply 
  keep her body moving.  She glances behind her, sees through the wooden 
  lattice that it is now pitch black.  A look of resignation crosses her 
  face and she releases her hold on the bucket, her body crumpling and 
  falling in on itself. 
  
  CUT to the bucket splashing back into the well, narrowly missing 
  Ryuji.

				RYUJI	
			(fuming) 
		What the hell are you doing?  Trying 
		to get me killed?

  CUT back to Asakawa, her face dead.  Ryuji calls out from the well.

				RYUJI (O.S.) 
		Hey!

  Asakawa falls backward onto the ground, arms splayed. CUT to the rim 
  of the well.  Ryuji pulls himself up over the rim, catches sight of 
  Asakawa.

				RYUJI
		Asakawa!

  She lifts her head up but says nothing as Ryuji walks over to her.

				RYUJI
		Well change.  Youre in no condition 
		to keep this up.

  Asakawa suddenly springs into life.  Her voice is frantic, fearful.

				ASAKAWA:	
		No!

				RYUJI
		Who do you expect to pull up these 
		buckets, then?

				ASAKAWA
		But, we dont even know if its doing 
		any good...

  Ryuji strides forward and slaps Asakawa painfully across the cheek.  
  He begins shaking her roughly for good measure.

				RYUJI
		And what about Yoichi, huh?  Is his
		mother not coming to pick him up 
		after all?

  He releases his hold on her.  The two stare at each other a long time, 
  saying nothing.
 
  CUT to an overhead shot of Asakawa being lowered into the well. CUT 
  now to Asakawa inside the well, her face and clothes covered with 
  grime, body simultaneously limp with exhaustion and tense with fright.  
  Unable to resist the impulse, Asakawa slowly looks over her shoulder 
  and down into the well.  The dankness, the claustrophobia seeps in 
  and she draws in her breath in the first signs of panic.

				RYUJI
		Dont look down!

  She returns her gaze, cranes her neck upward.  CUT to Ryuji leaning 
  over the rim of the well, peering down at her.  For an instant, 
  everything becomes monochrome. Its not Ryuji looking down at her at 
  all; its Professor Ikuma, checking to see if shes still alive or 
  if the blow to the back of her head has finished her off.  CUT to 
  Asakawa, her eyes wide with fright.

  Asakawa comes to rest at the bottom of the well.  A FLASHLIGHT hangs 
  from another rope, but its beam has almost no effect on the darkness.  
  Asakawa crouches forward, hands moving searchingly through the water.  
  She calls out pleadingly.

				ASAKAWA
		Where are you?  Please, come out.

  Asakawa straightens, unties herself from the rope.  A full bucket 
  already awaits.  She tugs on the rope and Ryuji pulls it up.  

  She scoops up a second bucket, but something stops her from sending 
  it up.  Instead, she begins running her arms through the water again, 
  her voice close to tears.

				ASAKAWA
		Please.  Where are you?

  Asakawa continues her blind fumbling, which sends up little splashes 
  of stagnant water.  With a start, she realizes that her fingers have 
  caught something.  Seaweed?  Asakawa draws her hands close for a 
  better look... and sees that is HAIR.  A thick clump of long, black 
  hair.

  Suddenly a pale, thin ARM shoots out from beneath the water, catching 
  Asakawa just below the wrist.  Asakawas ears are filled with a SOUND 
  like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber.  It 
  is a GIRL, her face completely hidden by long, black hair.  CUT to a 
  shot of Asakawas face.  Far from being frightened, her features are 
  oddly placid.  She regards the fearsome thing before her with an 
  almost tender look.  Asakawa reaches out, lightly strokes that long 
  hair.  

				ASAKAWA
		Its you...

  She strokes the hair again, and abruptly it peels right off the head 
  with a loud SQUELCH. Revealed is not a face at all but a SKULL.  Its 
  sockets are at first menacingly empty, but then begin to ooze the 
  green SLUDGE it has pulled up from the bottom of the well.  Like a 
  mother comforting a frightened child, Asakawa pulls the skeletal 
  remains to her breast, strokes the bony head comfortingly. Her eyes 
  begin to glaze.

  CUT to Ryuji racing up to the rim of the well, leaning down intently.

				RYUJI
		Hey!  Asakawa!  Its already 10 
		minutes past seven!  We did it!

  Down in the well, Asakawa continues staring blankly ahead.  Her body 
  suddenly falls forward, limp.

  EXT. OUTSIDE COTTAGE B4  NIGHT

  Three POLICE CARS are parked outside the rental cottages, crimson 
  headlights flashing.   A few COPS walk by, two of them carrying 
  something off in white PLASTIC BAGS.  CUT to Ryuji and Asakawa 
  sitting on the curb.  Asakawa is staring off at something, a BLANKET 
  draped over her shoulder.  

				ASAKAWA	
		Why would Ikuma have killed her?  
		His own daughter...

				RYUJI
		Maybe she wasnt his daughter at all.  

				ASAKAWA
		What?

				RYUJI
		Maybe her father... wasnt even human.

  The two exchange glances.  Ryujis gaze falls to Asakawas WRIST, 
  which he suddenly takes and holds close to his face.  The ugly 
  bruise where Sadako had grabbed her has disappeared.

				RYUJI
		Its gone...  

  He shakes his head, clearing his analytical mind of their ordeal.

				RYUJI
		Enough, already.  Its over.  Cmon.  
		Ill take you home.

  Ryuji stands, pulls Asakawa to her feet.

  EXT. OUTSIDE ASKAWAS APARTMENT - NIGHT  

  Ryujis white CAR pulls up into the parking lot.  He and Asakawa 
  get out, regard each other from opposite sides of the car. There is 
  a long moment where neither of them says anything.

				RYUJI	
		Get some rest.  

  He flashes her the slightest of grins. 

				RYUJI (contd)
		I still have a thesis to finish. 

  CUT to a shot of Ryuji and Asakawa, the car creating an almost 
  metaphoric distance between them. 

				ASAKAWA
		...thank you.

  Ryuji nods silently by way of reply.  He gets into his car and 
  drives off.  Asakawa watches him go, and then walks towards the 
  entrance of her apartment.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  BEDROOM  MORNING

  Asakawa walks into her room, sits on the edge of her bed.  It is 
  now morning, and she sits dazedly watching the sun come up.

  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  MORNING

  Ryuji sits busily scribbling into a NOTEBOOK.  He stops writing a 
  moment to regard his notes while taking a sip of COFFEE.  He 
  glances over at his BLACKBOARD for confirmation when a small scowl 
  crosses his brow.  Its gone a moment later as he chuckles wryly 
  to himself.

				RYUJI
		That girl...

  Ryuji stands, walks over to the blackboard.  He fixes Mais little 
  prank with a single chalk stroke. 

  EXT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  VERANDA  MORNING

  Asakawa emerges, taking in the dawn.  At first her face is calm and 
  tranquil... but her features change as the sun almost noticeably 
  darkens and a WIND begins to kick up her hair.  She now looks very 
  anxious.

  Caption-- September 21st.  Tuesday.


  NOTE: This next scene is entirely visual.  If you are reading this 
  translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; STOP 
  reading this now and watch the scene for itself.


  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  MORNING

  Ryuji is busy scribbling away at his notes again.  His hand suddenly 
  ceases, eyes dancing worriedly as he hears a faint...

  No.

  Breath rattling fearfully in his throat, Ryuji spins around to face 
  the TELEVISION SET.  He gets out of his seat for a better look, 
  falling to his knees on the tatami. 

  The image that fills the screen is the last scene from the videotape; 
  the shot of the well.  

  The SOUND from before comes louder now, more insistent, a metallic 
  screeching that both repulses and beckons him closer. Ryuji crawls on 
  all fours towards the SCREEN, stares at its unchanging image with 
  terrible foreboding.

  There is a flash of MOTION as something shoots out of the well. A 
  hand. First one, and then another, as Sadako, still in her grimy white 
  dress, face hidden beneath long, oily strands of hair, begins slowly 
  pulling herself out.  The television screen jumps unsteadily, fills 
  with static as if barely able to contain her image.  

  CUT back and forth between Ryuji, who is beginning to visibly panic, 
  and the television, which shows Sadako lurching ever closer.

				RYUJI
			(almost frantic) 
		Why?!

  The TELEPHONE rings, and Ryuji spins round towards it, breath catching 
  in his throat.  He looks at the phone, over his shoulder at the 
  television, back to the phone.

				RYUJI
		Thats it!  Asakawa...

  Ryuji scrambles wildly towards the phone.  He takes the receiver but 
  is unable to do more than clutch it fearfully as his gaze is drawn 
  inexorably back to the television.  Sadakos shrouded face has filled 
  the entire screen... and then, television popping and crackling, she 
  jerks forward and emerges from the television onto the floor of 
  Ryujis apartment.  Ryuji backs away, screaming in terror.

				RYUJI
		Aaargh!

  Sadako lies prone, collapsed, hair splayed out like a drowned corpse.  
  Only her FINGERS are active, crawling, feeling.  The TIPS of her 
  fingers are little more than bloodied stumps, not a single fingernail 
  on them.  She uses the strength in those fingers to pull herself 
  forward, coming jerkily to her feet.  The joints of her body twist 
  unnaturally, more insect-like than human.

  Ryuji flings the phone aside and begins scrambling about the apartment 
  as if looking for cover.  The strength has already begun to fade from 
  his body, however, and his movements are clumsy, exaggerated. He falls 
  to the floor, panting heavily.  

  Sadako turns to regard him, and for just an instant we can see beneath 
  her impenetrable shroud of hair; a single EYE burns with manic, 
  unbridled hatred.   

  Its gaze meets Ryujis, and his face twists into a grimace as he 
  SCREAMS loudly.

  FLASH

  EXT. KOUJIS HOUSE - FRONT YARD  DAY

  Yoichi sits on the lawn, doodling into a large SKETCHPAD.  He 
  suddenly stops, eyes registering that he has somehow felt his fathers 
  death.
  
  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  DAY

  Asakawa clutches the RECEIVER to her ear.  She can still hear the 
  sounds of metallic SCREECHING coming from the video, though they are 
  now becoming softer.

  EXT. OUTSIDE RYUJIS APARTMENT BUILDING  DAY

  Asakawa comes running down a side street, turning the corner and 
  making for the entrance to Ryujis apartment building.  There is a 
  single GUARD posted at the entrance. He reaches out, catches Asakawa 
  lightly by the arm.


				GUARD
		Are you a resident here, maam?

				ASAKAWA
		Im Takayama Ryujis wife!

  The guard drops his hand, and Asakawa makes for the entrance.

				GUARD
		Im sorry maam, but theyve already 
		taken the body away.

  Asakawas spins around, eyes wide.  Body?

  INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE RYUJIS APARTMENT  DAY

  Mai is there, slumped against one wall. Asakawa comes running up, 
  dropping to her knees and grasping Mai by the shoulders.

				ASAKAWA
		What happened?

  Mai shakes her head dreamily.

				MAI
		When I got here he was just 
		lying there...

				ASAKAWA	
		Did he say anything to you?  About 
		a videotape?

  Mai shakes her head again, shakes it harder until the breath 
  catches in her throat.


				MAI
		His face...

  Mai falls into silence, curls up on herself.  Asakawa leaves her 
  and crosses toward the door to Ryujis apartment.

  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT - DAY  

  The front DOOR opens wildly, noisily forward.  Asakawa comes 
  rushing in, eyes darting about the apartment.  She thinks 
  frantically to herself.

				ASAKAWA (VO)
		Ryuji... why?  Does this mean that
		Yoichi will die, too?  Is the curse 
		not broken yet?

  Her gaze falls to the television set.  She dives forward, presses 
  the eject button on the VCR.  Sure enough, the TAPE is still in 
  the deck.  She takes the tape and leaves.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

  Asakawa walks slowly, dreamily forward.  She drops the videotape 
  loudly onto the coffee table and slouches into a CHAIR.  Her eyes 
  fall to the framed photographs of Yoichi on one of the shelves.  
  This snaps Asakawa out of her daze and she begins whispering 
  intently to herself, thinking.

				ASAKAWA
		I was the only one to break 
		Sadakos curse.  Ryuji... why...?  
		Something I did that you didnt...  
		Something I did that you didnt...  

  Asakawa gives up, lowers her face into her hands.  When she looks 
  up again, she happens to glance at the television screen-- and 
  its GLARE reveals that there is someone ELSE in the room with her.  
  It is the figure from the videotape, the silent accuser with the 
  cloth draped over its face.  With a start, Asakawa realizes that 
  the figure is wearing Ryujis clothes.

				ASAKAWA
		Ryuji?!

  She spins around, but the room is empty.  Asakawas mind races.  
  The figure had been pointing towards her BAG.  She stands, 
  rummages in her bag to produce her copy of the cursed videotape.  
  She takes Ryujis COPY in her other hand, her eyes darting 
  between the two tapes.

				ASAKAWA
		Something I did that you didnt...

  It suddenly clicks home as Asakawa looks full-on at Ryujis 
  version of the tape, plainly marked COPY.

				ASAKAWA
		What broke the curse was that I copied 
		the tape and showed it to someone else!

  CUT to Asakawa slowly pulling her VCR from the television stand.  
  A look of almost frightening resolve etches her face.

  EXT. HIGHWAY  DAY

  ARIAL SHOT of Asakawas car.  We hear her VOICE on the cell 
  phone.

				ASAKAWA (O.S.)
  		Dad?  Its me.  Im on my way over.
  		Look, dad, Ive got something to ask. 
		Its for Yoichi...

  INT. ASAKAWAS CAR  DAY

  CLOSEUP on the VCR in the passenger side.  CUT to Asakawa at the 
  wheel as time spirals forward, the decisions of the present 
  already become rumor of the future.

				GIRL A (VO) 
		They say theres a way you can stay 
		alive after you watch the video.  
		Youve gotta make a copy of it, and 
		show it to somebody else inside a week.

				GIRL B (VO) 
		But what about the person you show it 
		to?

				GIRL A (VO) 
		Well, then they make a copy and show it 
		to somebody else.  Again, inside a week.

				GIRL C (VO) 
			(laughing)
		Then theres no end to it.

				GIRL A (VO) 
		Thats just it.  There -is- no end.  But 
		if it meant not dying... youd do it, 
		wouldnt you?

  Asakawas eyes begin to well.  Her car speeds along the highway, 
  to the direction of menacing-looking STORM CLOUDS.

          EXT. WHEAT FIELD - MORNING
          
          SAMANTHA DARKO (18) opens her eyes. She squints as the summer
          sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size. She sits up slowly,
          looks around... and finds herself in midst of an endless
          wheat field.
          
          Sam is pretty and demure. Her coppery hair flows past her
          shoulders. Disoriented, she stands and gazes at the infinite
          golden shimmer. Amber waves of grain. Patches of forest in
          the distance. It's quiet. Serene. Beautiful...
          
          She smiles, and starts walking.
          
          
          EXT. ARKANSAS HIGHWAY 40 - MORNING
          
          She emerges at the shoulder of a rural stretch of highway in
          Arkansas. Adjacent to her position, on the other side of the
          deserted lanes, is a TRUCK STOP.
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK STOP - MORNING
          
          Amongst the TRACTOR-TRAILERS parked in the back lot is a
          white, late-80s model CHEVROLET CELEBRITY. Sam makes her way
          across the asphalt toward the vehicle...
          
          
          INT. COREY'S CHEVROLET - MORNING
          
          COREY RICHARDSON (18) is asleep, curled up in the reclined
          driver's seat of the car. She awakens when Sam gets in on the
          passenger side and slams the door shut.
          
          Corey has the look of a typical rebellious teen: dyed hair,
          piercings, a little grungy. She rubs the sleep from her eyes,
          greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm. She
          finds a soft pack of CIGARETTES and lights one.
          
                              COREY
                    What time is it?

                    Early...
          
          Corey adjusts her seat. She takes a long drag and chokes,
          then spits out the window. She starts the car...
          
                                                                      2.

          Corey's car cruises along the flat, open road. She cranks up
          the VOLUME on the car's CASSETTE DECK, nodding her head to
          early-90s ALT. ROCK (suggestion: Into Dust, by Mazzy Star)...
          
          Sam looks out the window at the passing scenery: FARMERS at
          work in the fields; a BILLBOARD advertising a local
          restaurant; ROADSIDE DITCHES filled with trash...
          
          She fixates on a MINIVAN travelling in the slow lane. It
          contains the all-American NUCLEAR FAMILY: MOTHER, FATHER and
          three SIBLINGS, one of them being a YOUNGSTER. The Youngster
          makes a face at Sam as they pass by...

          Corey glances at the CONTROL PANEL when she HEARS the engine
          start to RATTLE. She sees that the TEMPERATURE GAUGE has hit
          the red and her CHECK ENGINE LIGHT is on.
          
                              COREY

          EXT. OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY 40/COREY'S CHEVROLET - DAY
          
          By the time they pull over on the side of the empty highway,
          steam billows out from under the hood. Sam gets out of the
          car to check on it while Corey remains behind the wheel.
          
          Sam peeks under the hood, trying to clear the air of the
          steam. It sounds like someone is rhythmically TAPPING the
          inside of the engine with a hammer.
          
                              SAM
                    Turn it off.
          
                               COREY

                          WINDOW)
                    What?
          
                              SAM
                    Turn off the car.
          
          Corey does so.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Doesn't look too good...

                    It smells funny.
          
          Sam looks up when she HEARS a PICK-UP TRUCK coming toward
          them. Corey watches as she steps out to wave it down...
          
          The pick-up pulls over ahead of them. CHRIS HOLT (24), a
          brawny, attractive young man, gets out. When Corey sees him
          she gets out too.
          
                               SAM (CONT'D)
                    Thanks for stopping. Our car's
                    messed up.
          
                              CHRIS
                    What happened?
          
                              COREY
                    My check engine light came on, then
                    it just started smoking, and
                    ticking and shit.
          
          As Chris pokes around under the hood, Sam and Corey exchange
          looks. Chris pops opens the COOLANT CAP and burns his hand on
          the steam explosion.

          of the road against traffic, and he waves to them as they
          pass. He wears old, weather beaten clothes and a multi-
          colored SKI MASK over his head and face...
          
          [END MONTAGE]
          
          Sam swivels her head to watch Tom. ANOTHER CAR passes and he
          waves to it as well. Chris picks up on her curiosity.
          
                              CHRIS
                    He waves to everybody... Just kinda
                    walks up and down.
          
                              COREY
                    Resident nutcase?
          
                              CHRIS
                    People call him Vietnam Tom.
          
                              SAM
                    He was in the war?
          
                              CHRIS
                    He thinks he was... kind of a joke,
                    ya know?
          
          Sam continues to stare until he disappears out of sight...
          PAN DOWN to a PUDDLE by the side of the road. As a CAR TIRE
          splashes through it, PAN UP TO FIND:
          
          
          I/E. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - AFTERNOON
          
          Dusty's auto repair shop, which is nothing more than a big
          garage attached to his old two-story house. Corey's car has
          been towed there, and DUSTY GIBBENS (37; father of Ruth
          Gibbens), the lone mechanic, tinkers around under the hood.
          
          Sam and Corey sit on the front steps of the house waiting,
          bored as hell. A PIT BULL laps at a nameless treat wedged
          into a crack in the walkway. The girls are forced to get up
          when Ruth (from outside the liquor store) comes to the door.
          
                                                                   5.
          
          
                              RUTH
                    Can I get out?
          
          Sam and Corey move so that she can exit the house. Ruth's
          look is hardened, rough around the edges -- she appears older
          than her 18 years.
          
          The girls watch as she enters the garage to see her father.
          She whispers something in his ear, and Dusty hands her some
          CASH, which she pockets then kisses him on the cheek. After
          this, Dusty wipes his hands on his greasy jeans and comes
          outside to address Corey and Sam.
          
                              DUSTY
                    Yeah... it's the water pump.
          
                              COREY
                    So what do we do?
          
                              DUSTY
                    I can order you up a new one.
                    Probably be a couple days.
          
                              COREY
                    Great. This the only show in town?
          
                              DUSTY
                    Cheapest and the best. But you want
                    me to call the tow guy back here,
                    no problem. Probably charge you
                    another hundred bucks, but he'll
                    get ya wherever you wanna go.
          
                              COREY
                    Just go ahead and fix it.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON
          
          Phil Coulter (48), the proprietor of a dingy little roadside
          motel, looks up from a hardcover copy of Stephen King's
          GERALD'S GAME when the girls enter. They each have a SMALL
          SUITCASE and a BACKPACK in tow.
          
                              PHIL
                    What can I do for you?
          
                              COREY
                    We need a room.
          
          He gets out a notebook and lays it out on the counter. Corey
          finds a pen and starts to fill out a registration form... A
          NEWS BULLETIN about the O.J. SIMPSON TRIAL plays at a LOW
          VOLUME on a TELEVISION in the b.g.
          
                                                                    6.
          
          
                              SAM
                    How much is it?
          
                              PHIL
                    $39 a night. How many you stayin'?
          
                              COREY
                    Just a couple, we hope.
          
          He takes the KEY to ROOM 15 off the rack.
          
                              PHIL
                    Well... welcome to El Reno.
          
          
          EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
          
          Sam and Corey arrive at the liquor store, which is down the
          street from the motel. Ruth, Randy Evans, and Jeff and Mike
          Jimenez are loitering in the parking lot in a similar fashion
          to how they were earlier in the day.
          
                              RUTH
                    You get checked into the motel
                    alright?
          
                              COREY
                    Yep.
          
          Randy seems surprised that Ruth has already made their
          acquaintance. He wastes no time in introducing himself.
          
                              RANDY
                    My name's Randy. This is Mike and
                    Jeff. Guess you already know Ruth.
          
                              COREY
                    Corey.
          
                              SAM
                    I'm Samantha.
          
          They shake, and Corey seems at ease mingling with the
          strangers. Sam hangs back a little.
          
                              COREY
                    One of you guys mind pickin' us up
                    a bottle of something?
          
                              RANDY
                    I think I can manage that. What do
                    you want?
          
                                                                      7.
          
          
                              COREY
                    I don't know. Vodka, whiskey,
                    whatever.
          
          Corey looks to Sam, who produces some cash. Randy takes the
          money and heads for the store.
          
                              RANDY
                    Be right back...
          
          After he's gone, there's an uncomfortable moment of silence
          in which Mike and Jeff ogle the girls mischievously. Ruth
          stares at them in a different way. She seems somewhat
          resentful of their presence.
          
                              RUTH
                    From Virginia, huh?
          
                                COREY
                    Yep.
          
                              RUTH
                    I saw your plates...
          
          Corey and Sam both nod in mundane acknowledgment. Another
          beat of uncomfortable silence.
          
                                RUTH (CONT'D)
                    Where to?
          
                                COREY
                    What?
          
                              RUTH
                    Your obviously just passin' through
                    here.
          
                              SAM
                    We're on the way to Vegas.
          
          Ruth snickers.
          
                              RUTH
                    Well... you need anything besides
                    booze, you just lemme know.
          
          Randy comes out of the store with a bottle in a brown bag. He
          passes it off to Corey, along with some change.
          
                              COREY
                    Thanks a lot, man.
          
                                                                      8.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    No problem. You guys wanna come
                    back to my place for bit? Bring
                    your bottle, we got some weed...
          
          Corey looks like she's considering it, but --
          
                              SAM
                    I'm really tired.
          
          She takes Sam's signal.
          
                              COREY
                    Yeah, I think we'll just head back.
                    Been a long day, ya know?
          
                              RANDY
                    That's cool.
          
          
          EXT. BANK - LATER - NIGHT
          
          The clock on the BANK SIGN shows 3:30 AM -- then flashes to --
          JUNE 19, 1995... It changes again, this time to a countdown
          to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION: 15 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 29
          MINUTES, 57 SECONDS... 56 SECONDS... 55 SECONDS...
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
          
          Sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the
          blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over
          and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed.
          
          TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the
          nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed.
          There's a digital CLOCK/RADIO that reads 3:30 AM.
          
          The TV is on, and a late night INFOMERCIAL for the GEORGE
          FOREMAN GRILL plays. Sam stares at the screen as the images
          WARP and RIPPLE in a way that coincides with an increasingly
          loud, rumbling TREMOR from outside...
          
          In a daze, she gets up and slowly walks closer to the
          television. She reaches out with her RIGHT HAND, about to
          touch it... A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - NIGHT
          
          Sam is in a grassy field behind the motel, moving away from
          the building. She wears a HOODED SWEATSHIRT, JEANS, and her
          RIGHT HAND is wrapped in some sort of MAKESHIFT BANDAGE.
          
                                                                      9.
          
          
          There's a GASH in the side of her forehead by her temple,
          with what looks to be a SHARD OF METAL partially embedded
          under the skin and protruding from the wound.
          
          She is without expression, and her movements are rhythmic and
          fluid. A tall AERMOTOR WINDMILL towers in the distance...
          
          
          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE GRASSY FIELD
          
          A glimpse of the field through Sam's eyes shows a
          phosphorescent PLANE OF DESTINY -- an intricate grid in which
          objects organic and inorganic dwell in assigned positions,
          and move according to a framework of set paths.
          
          A JACKRABBIT follows a silvery VECTOR SPEAR like prophetic
          life-gel to its burrow... COSMIC ENERGY burns around a
          CLUSTER OF STONES... Miniature VECTOR SPEARS lead a SWARM OF
          INSECTS around in a circle and then BUZZING right past Sam's
          field of vision...
          
          It's infinitely complex, but Sam sees through it clearly. She
          has no vector spear of her own to guide her, but she is
          cognizant of her path... She moves toward the WINDMILL.
          
          
          EXT. WINDMILL - NIGHT
          
          Sam appears at the foot of the windmill tower. A giant WATER
          TANK squats beside it. Remaining stoic, she looks up and sees
          Vietnam Tom sitting atop the windmill platform, more than 30
          feet up, staring back down at her through the eyes holes of
          his ski mask...
          
          
          ANGLE: WINDMILL PLATFORM
          
          Tom peers over the edge of the small platform, the surface of
          which is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER BOTTLE,
          CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP. He cradles a RIFLE in his
          arms...
          
          His focus shifts from what is at the foot of the windmill to
          what is sitting right beside him --
          
          REVEAL Sam. Her legs dangle over the side of the platform,
          and she stares off into distance.
          
                              SAM
                    The sky's so beautiful here...
          
          Tom looks in the direction that she stares and then back at
          her. Sam turns to meet his gaze...
          
                                                                     10.
          
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    But we can't stay.
          
          
          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - VIETNAM TOM
          
          Sam sees through to the core of his physical being, the
          DYNAMIC CENTER of which lingers pulsating in a translucent
          circle around his chest.
          
          Magnified NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN send ELECTRIC IMPULSES that
          release NEUROTRANSMITTERS, which excite OTHER NEURONS...
          
          Tom slowly reaches out to touch Sam, but an invisible FORCE
          FIELD makes contact impossible. RIPPLES swell throughout the
          clear plasma-like barrier from where he touched it, and his
          hand remains glued to the spot.
          
          Sam extends her bandaged right hand, and presses it to
          Vietnam Tom's as if she were touching a mirrored image of
          herself.
          
          The contact generates more RIPPLES, and as TREMORS begin to
          shake the windmill a DISTORTED VOICE echoes throughout the
          COSMOS:
          
                              DISTORTED VOICE (V.O.)
                    15 days... 18 hours... 45
                    minutes... 6 seconds. That is when
                    the world will end.
          
          A CYLINDRICAL PORTAL opens up below them, gaping and swirling
          like God's eye on the mouth of a liquid tornado. As Sam and
          Tom stand in unison to peer into it, a HEXAGONAL PLATE OF
          WHITE LIGHT emanates from within --
          
          
          EXT. BELOW WINDMILL - NIGHT
          
          They appear near the foot of the windmill, sprinting away
          from it together. Tom has his rifle, and he looks up to the
          sky as he runs...
          
          ...there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT -- deafening
          THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION --
          
          
          EXT. BUS STOP - MORNING
          
          Sam awakens to the morning sun blinding her. She struggles to
          peer through the harsh whiteness at a looming figure that
          stands over her. Her eyes adjust to discover that it's a
          policeman -- Officer O'Dell.
          
                                                                     11.
          
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    `Fraid you can't sleep here, miss.
          
          Sam sits up and realizes she's on a bench at a bus stop near
          the side of the road. O'Dell's tone is innocuous, and when
          she looks up at him again she sees that he's grinning.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Got anyplace to be?
          
          Sam manages to find her voice.
          
                                 SAM
                    The motel.
          
          She takes his hand and rises.
          
          
          I/E. O'DELL'S CRUISER/MOTEL - MORNING
          
          O'Dell's cruiser pulls into the motel parking lot, which is
          uncharacteristically full. A FIRE TRUCK is parked by the side
          of the road. Just then, a call comes in on the POLICE RADIO:
          
                              DISPATCH (V.O.)
                    We got some kinda situation at
                    Frank Haley's farm...
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Copy that. I'm here now...
          
          
          EXT. GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - MORNING
          
          Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER
          about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits
          of wood and metal strewn everywhere. GROUND WATER spurts from
          the broken WELL SEAL...
          
          And a cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the
          crater.
          
          Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite with gloved hands as Sam
          and O'Dell arrive on the scene. Corey is already there
          looking on, as well as Chris Holt, who gave them a ride into
          town, Phil Coulter from the motel, and other local CITIZENS.
          FRANK HALEY (54), the farmer who owns the land, is fuming.
          
                              FRANK
                    Un-fuckin'-believable...
          
          The Firemen drop the porous, misshapen clod by his feet.
          
                                                                  12.
          
          
                              FIREMAN #1
                    It's still warm.
          
                              FRANK
                    You know how much it's gonna cost
                    me to replace this goddamn
                    windmill?
          
          Officer O'Dell steps up beside him and kicks the meteorite
          with his boot.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Sell this thing off to some
                    meteorologist nerd club, I bet you
                    could do okay.
          
                                FRANK
                    Ya think?
          
          Sam looks down at a CAN OF FOOD on the ground amidst some
          scorched CLOTHING. O'Dell takes note of some other CANNED
          GOODS and SCRAPS OF TARP.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    What's all that stuff, Frank?
          
                               FRANK
                    That whack job Tom's been squattin'
                    up there the last couple a' months.
                    Thinks he's the goddamn town
                    watchman...
                        (BEAT)
                    You think he got blown up?
          
          Everyone scans the ground for signs of human remains until
          Phil pipes up:
          
                              PHIL
                    I saw him out in front of the motel
                    early this morning, alive and well.
          
                              FRANK
                        (SARCASTIC)
                    Oh, well, thank heavens...
          
          Sam turns and peers up at the WATER TANK. It's marred by BURN
          MARKS and DENTS from the explosion. As she tilts her head and
          looks closer, she can almost pick out a shape created by the
          damage -- a negative image like the Shroud of Turin...
          
          ...in the form of a bizarre, toothy-grinned FACE OF A GIANT
          MONSTER BUNNY.
          
                                                                  13.
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL - MORNING
          
          Sam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when
          they turn and see that Chris has followed them.
          
                                 CHRIS
                    Hey...
          
                                 SAM
                    Hey.
          
                              CHRIS
                    So you guys stayed here last night?
          
                              COREY
                    One of us did.
          
          Sam gives Corey a look. Chris decides to ignore the comment.
          
                              CHRIS
                    What's up with your car?
          
                              COREY
                    It's gonna take a couple days.
          
                              CHRIS
                    For a water pump?
          
          Sam and Corey shrug.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    None of my business, but...
          
          He's distracted when a brand new `95 BMW pulls up and parks
          nearby. JEREMY FRAME (25), a thin, pale young man hops out
          and hustles into the field toward the crash site.
          
                                 SAM
                    What?
          
          Chris regains his train of thought:
          
                              CHRIS
                    I was just gonna say, if you
                    wanted, I could give you a ride
                    back.
          
          He looks right at Sam when he says this. He then glances over
          at Corey, as if just remembering she was there.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    You too. I mean, I could give you
                    both a ride.
          
                                                                    14.
          
          
                              COREY
                    To Middlesex, Virginia? Do you have
                    any clue how far that is?
          
                              CHRIS
                        (SHEEPISH)
                    I got some time...
          
          Sam looks as though she's about to say something but Corey
          overpowers her.
          
                              COREY
                    We're not goin' back. Even El
                    Reno's better than there.
          
          Chris makes eye contact with Sam again. She maintains it for
          a moment and then looks away.
          
          
          EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY
          
          Vietnam Tom explores a cluttered junkyard, gathering
          materials. He scours amongst the PILES OF REFUSE, RUSTY
          MACHINES and crumbling STORAGE SHACKS.
          
          He bends to pick up a SCRAP OF METAL and adds it to a
          collection he's making in a worn SATCHEL...
          
          
          EXT. DINER - DAY
          
          As Sam and Corey are about to enter the diner, Trudy Potter,
          a bank teller, is on her way out.
          
          The girls move to the side so she can exit, and take notice
          of a MISSING PERSONS SIGN posted next to the door -- BILLY
          MOORCROFT'S (10) dark, empty eyes stare at them from the
          BLACK & WHITE PHOTOGRAPH.
          
                              TRUDY (O.S.)
                    Isn't that just awful?
          
          Trudy has stopped and is looking over their shoulders.
          
                              TRUDY (CONT'D)
                    His poor mother...
          
          
          INT. DINER - DAY
          
          The girls sit at a booth, sipping Cokes.
          
                              COREY
                    How much money do we have left?
          
                                                                  15.
          
          
                              SAM
                    Not a whole lot.
          
                              COREY
                    I can't believe your fucking
                    parents wouldn't give you anything.
          
                              SAM
                    They totally flipped out that I was
                    even going. They weren't about to
                    give me money for the big trip.
          
                              COREY
                    We should've waited till the end of
                    the month when my mom gets her
                    check.
          
                              SAM
                    She wouldn't have given you
                    anything.
          
                              COREY
                    I know where she keeps her cash.
                    What's she gonna do, send her
                    boyfriend after me?
          
          Corey pokes at the crushed ice in her glass with her straw.
          
                               COREY (CONT'D)
                    Doesn't matter. As soon as we get
                    to Vegas, we'll be set. My cousin
                    said sometimes she makes two grand
                    in a week.
          
                                SAM
                    Jesus.
          
          Sam is impressed, but something about her subdued reaction
          exhibits reservations... Just then, Agatha Dowdy arrives with
          plates of BURGERS AND FRIES.
          
                              AGATHA
                    Here you go. Where'd you two say
                    you were from again?
          
                                SAM
                    Virginia.
          
                              AGATHA
                    You hear that, Ted?
          
          She calls to Ted Moncton, who is busy behind the counter.
          
                                                                  16.
          
          
                               TED
                    What?
          
                              AGATHA
                    These girls are from Virginia.
          
                              TED
                    I'll be damned. I'm from Reedville,
                    if you know where abouts that is...
          
          Neither Sam nor Corey give much of a hint as to a yes or no.
          
                              TED (CONT'D)
                    Well, have yourself some ice cream
                    when you're done, on the house.
          
                      COREY                               SAM
          Okay.                           Thank you.
          
                              AGATHA
                    Anything else you need, give a
                    holler.
          
          Agatha moves off, and Sam and Corey start to dig into their
          food...
          
          Momentarily, someone else enters and takes a seat at the
          counter by their booth. It's Jeremy Frame, the driver of the
          BMW. He raises a finger to alert Ted of his presence.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Just a coffee, please.
          
          Ted nods and pours him a cup... After he receives his coffee,
          Jeremy turns and stares at the girls. They both notice him
          doing it, but Corey is the first to speak.
          
                              COREY
                    Can we help you?
          
                              JEREMY
                    No, no... it's just that I
                    recognize you. I saw you by the
                    motel. Pretty amazing, huh?
          
                               COREY
                    I guess.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I just made a deal with Frank Haley
                    to buy it for seven-hundred fifty
                    dollars.
          
                                                                  17.
          
          
                              COREY
                    Whoop-dee-doo. What the hell are
                    you gonna do with a friggin'
                    meteor?
          
                              JEREMY
                    Meteorite, actually...
          
          Corey rolls her eyes at being corrected. Sam smirks and
          munches on a french fry -- she's enjoying their conversation.
          
                               JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I'm gonna study it. I'm a grad
                    student at Redlands... we've
                    actually got a pretty cool geology
                    lab there.
          
          Corey focuses on her lunch, ignoring him, but Jeremy goes on.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I've gotta do some tests, but if I
                    had to guess, I'd say it's a
                    siderite. They're composed
                    primarily of iron and nickel.
          
                                COREY
                    Have fun.
          
                              JEREMY
                    My name's Jeremy.
          
                              COREY
                    That's nice.
          
          Sam glances up at Jeremy, expecting him to be hurt or
          embarrassed by Corey's snub. But he's not. He's smiling at
          her, and she can't help but smile back.
          
          
          EXT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE/CHURCH - AFTERNOON
          
          Each licking an ICE CREAM CONE, Corey and Sam walk past the
          home of Father Homeijer. The priest is outside working in his
          flower garden, wearing his CLERICAL COLLAR. An old CATHOLIC
          CHURCH rests on the same lot as his house, looming behind it.
          
          When Father Homeijer sees the girls walking by, he rises from
          his work, takes off his gloves and wipes sweat from his
          forehead. Sam and Corey both notice him eyeballing them.
          
                              COREY
                    What's his problem?
          
                                                                   18.
          
          
                              SAM
                    Just keep walking.
          
          Corey waves to him in a sarcastic, exaggerated manner... The
          priest doesn't wave back, but continues to gawk at them until
          they go around the corner.
          
                               COREY
                    Freak...
          
          
          EXT. JUNKYARD, STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON
          
          Vietnam Tom crouches in a decrepit SHACK covered by a piece
          of CORRUGATED ROOFING. He works with great focus, arranging
          VARIOUS BITS OF METAL into some sort of small SCULPTURE...
          
          
          EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER - AFTERNOON
          
          Having finished their ice creams, the girls pass the liquor
          store on the way back to the motel. They find Randy, Ruth,
          Jeff and Mike at their usual post.
          
                              RANDY
                    Hey, what's up?
          
                              COREY
                    Not much... just getting stared
                    down by creepy priest boy back
                    there.
          
                              JEFF
                    Father Homeijer?
          
                              MIKE
                    Don't worry, you're a little old
                    for his taste.
          
                              JEFF
                    Yeah, he's a fuckin' perv.
          
                              COREY
                        (to Randy)
                    You got an extra cigarette?
          
          Randy takes a pack from his pocket and offers her one.
          
                              RANDY
                    I'm throwin' a big party at my
                    house tonight, you guys should come
                    by. No excuses this time...
          
          Sam and Corey look at each other, considering.
          
                                                                   19.
          
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    You're gonna be stuck in El Reno,
                    you might as well have some fun,
                    right?
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - NIGHT
          
          The party at Randy's teems with LOCALS, ages ranging from
          early teens to late-20s. On the back deck is a KEG OF BEER
          and a BOOMBOX blasting MUSIC. There's a slimy-looking POOL,
          and a few people swim in the greenish water.
          
          Randy and Ruth make their rounds as a pair. They stop off so
          Ruth can sell a BAG OF WEED to some eager KIDS. Corey and Sam
          hang with Mike and Jeff, drinking beer.
          
                              COREY
                    You guys gotta come visit the club
                    when we get all set up. We'll give
                    you the VIP treatment, man...
          
          Mike and Jeff are both excited about this proposition.
          
                              MIKE
                    Sounds good to me.
          
                              COREY
                    Give us a little time, me and
                    Sam'll be runnin' that place, no
                    doubt... right?
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah. Definitely.
          
          Corey is relaxed, enjoying their newfound friends, while Sam
          appears more out of place. She drains the better part of her
          cup for some liquid courage.
          
          Randy and Ruth converge back on the group just as Officer
          O'Dell creeps into the backyard wearing plainclothes. Ruth
          notices him first.
          
                              RUTH
                    Fuck.
          
                              RANDY
                    What?
          
                              RUTH
                    That pig, O'Dell.
          
                                                                     20.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    Don't worry about Ryan. He might be
                    a cop, but he still likes to party.
          
          Randy's theory is proven when O'Dell takes a FLASK from his
          pocket and has a snort before approaching a pair of TEENAGE
          GIRLS... But Ruth is still not satisfied.
          
                              RUTH
                    I think that asshole knows I deal.
                    You know how fucked that is?
          
                              RANDY
                    From what I hear he's got a little
                    somethin' goin' on the side
                    himself.
          
                              RUTH
                    Fucking pig's a pig.
          
          They're all distracted when somebody does a cannonball into
          the pool and splashes them.
          
                      MIKE                               JEFF
          Fuck!                            Bastard!
          
                              SAM
                    What the hell...
          
          Sam bends to wipe some of the water from her pants. Ruth
          watches her, smirking.
          
                              RANDY
                    We might as well all go in now,
                    we're already wet.
          
                              RUTH
                    Good idea...
          
          Without warning, Ruth shoves Sam backwards into the pool --
          
          
          ANGLE: BENEATH THE WATER
          
          She sinks into the murky water in SLOW-MOTION. All SOUNDS are
          DROWNED OUT and everything is tranquil, completely detached.
          
          Through her blurred vision, Sam can see Randy's PORCH LIGHTS
          glimmering beyond the surface of the water... TRANSITION TO:
          
                                                                  21.
          
          
          INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          
          The SPOT LIGHTS are blinding from the perspective of the
          STAGE. Through the WHITE BLUR an auditorium full of PEOPLE
          can been seen...
          
          In SLOW-MOTION and perfect synchronicity, YOUNG SAMANTHA (11)
          and the "SPARKLE MOTION" GIRLS are in the midst of their
          dance performance... BACK TO:
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - NIGHT
          
          A HAND reaches into the pool, grabs onto Sam's arm and pulls
          her up --
          
          She breaches the surface of the water, gasping for breath --
          back to reality. She sees that Randy is the one responsible
          for pulling her out.
          
                              RANDY
                    You fall asleep down there?
          
          He, Ruth and the others are looking down at her, laughing.
          Sam is lost in thought, struck by her vision...
          
          She snaps out of it when she sees Corey tear off her top and
          jump into the pool beside her. Many of the PARTYGOERS hoot in
          approval, and Randy, Mike and Jeff strip down and leap in
          right behind her.
          
          Sam swims toward the far side of the pool where the steps
          are, and fewer people. When she arrives there, she's
          surprised to find Chris Holt waiting for her with a towel.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Thought you could maybe use this.
          
          As Chris hands her the towel, he notices a wide SCAR on the
          inside of Sam's RIGHT WRIST... but doesn't mention it. Sam
          wraps the towel around her sopping wet body.
          
          Corey looks over and sees her getting out...
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, PORCH - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
          
          Chris and Sam stand by the keg with fresh beers.
          
                              CHRIS
                    So what's so wrong at home that you
                    had to take off?
          
          The question takes Sam by surprise.
          
                                                                  22.
          
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    I'd love to get outta here someday
                    too... just don't know quite where
                    I'd go.
          
          Sam decides to open up a little.
          
                              SAM
                    I hate it there. It's like everyone
                    knows everything about me, but I'm
                    invisible at the same time. It's
                    like the worst of both worlds.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Small towns. How `bout your family?
          
                              SAM
                    They didn't want me to leave...
                    well, they did, but they wanted me
                    to go away to Harvard or something
                    like that, like my sister.
          
          Sam takes a big sip of her beer, showing signs of tipsiness.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Sometimes I think it would've been
                    easier if... I just, after my
                    BROTHER-
          
          Sam stops herself.
          
                               CHRIS
                    What?
          
                              SAM
                        (changing gears)
                    That's why I love Corey, she just
                    doesn't give a shit. She does what
                    she wants and she doesn't care what
                    people think.
          
                              CHRIS
                    You just gotta be yourself, that's
                    all. What is it you wanna do
                    exactly?
          
                              SAM
                    I always thought I'd be a dancer,
                    like in a troupe or something...
          
          Sam is self-conscious after admitting this.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    That sounds kinda stupid probably.
          
                                                                   23.
          
          
                               CHRIS
                    No...
          
                              SAM
                    When I was younger, my dance team
                    was on Star Search.
          
                               CHRIS
                    Really?
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah... but I didn't go.
          
                               CHRIS
                    Why not?
          
                              SAM
                    I didn't end up dancing in the
                    talent show where they got
                    discovered... I didn't really feel
                    like it at the time anyway.
          
                               CHRIS
                    Huh...
          
                              SAM
                    But that's why we're going to
                    Vegas. There's lots of
                    opportunities there.
          
          Chris glances over to the pool where Corey is topless,
          splashing and goofing around with some BOYS.
          
                              CHRIS
                        (SMIRKING)
                    Yeah, good place for it. Gettin'
                    some practice on the way, too.
          
          Sam takes offense, getting drunk and sensitive.
          
                              SAM
                    Is that supposed to be like some
                    kind of judgement or something?
          
                              CHRIS
                    No, I was just-
          
          She takes her beer and storms away from him.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    Sam, wait... hey, come on...
          
                                                                  24.
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
          
          Sam finds a STOOP at the side of the house where she can be
          alone. She can HEAR the PARTY going on in the backyard, but
          no one else is in sight.
          
          Still soaking wet, she plants herself on the stoop and starts
          to pound the rest of her drink...
          
          A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF RANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Sam lies in the middle of the street in front of Randy's. A
          lone, flickering STREET LIGHT intermittently bathes her in an
          orange glow.
          
          She is completely dry, wearing her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and
          JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right
          hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the GASH in her
          forehead...
          
          A CAR suddenly screams right past her prostrate form, missing
          her by inches. She sits up slowly and looks toward the front
          of Randy's house, which is about 20 yards away.
          
          
          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - DRUNK GUYS
          
          Two DRUNK GUYS exit the house and enter the complex,
          phosphorescent grid that is Sam's field of vision. VECTOR
          SPEARS jut from their chests and precede all their movements
          as they open the gas tank of a PARKED CAR, insert a SIPHON,
          and begin to drain the gas into ANOTHER VEHICLE.
          
                              DRUNK GUY #1
                    Hurry up...
          
          Although she is close by, they take no notice of Sam
          whatsoever. ANOTHER CAR speeds by, again nearly crushing her,
          but she doesn't flinch...
          
          She stands, and turns deliberately to face the opposite side
          of the road where, unlike the Drunk Guys, there is someone
          who is completely focused on her -- Vietnam Tom crouches in a
          DITCH near a CULVERT --
          
          
          ANGLE: CULVERT
          
          Sam appears with him in the tenebrous ditch. Tom stares at
          her wide-eyed through the eyeholes of his ski mask.
          
                                                                    25.
          
          
          From one end of the broad, open culvert they can see straight
          through to the other side...
          
          A PORTAL starts to take shape within, swirling around the
          circumference. Soft, BLUE LIGHT touches their faces from the
          phosphorescent glow, and a gust of WIND is nearly strong
          enough to make them falter.
          
          On the opposite end of the culvert, a PLATE OF WHITE LIGHT
          flashes for an instant then transforms into an image of
          FATHER HOMEIJER'S CHURCH --
          
          
          EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT
          
          Tom and Sam stand outside the church. The STEEPLE reigns over
          them. Sam is stoic as she watches Tom climb the STONE STEPS
          and approach the great WOOD DOORS...
          
          
          INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
          
          Sam sits like a statue in one of the PEWS. Tom strides past
          her in a daze, moving toward the PULPIT...
          
          Beside the ALTAR stand THREE BARE CROSSES in imitation of
          Calvary, each standing over 4 feet tall.
          
          Sam looks up to a HIGH CORNER, above the pulpit to the right,
          where two walls and the ceiling meet...
          
          
          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - CONVERGENCE POINT
          
          The three planes come together at an irregular angle, with
          the WALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE SLANTING INWARD, and the CEILING
          SLOPING SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD.
          
          PHOSPHORESCENCE burns in the three queerly pitches lines,
          with a concentration of heightened energy at the juncture.
          
          A VECTOR SPEAR bulges from Vietnam Tom's chest where he
          stands below it, reaching higher and higher...
          
          As Tom's SPEAR gets closer to the convergence point, the
          BIZARRE ANGLING becomes more exaggerated because the planes
          start to DIP and SWELL with impossible elasticity --
          
          
          ANGLE: BETWEEN THE WALLS
          
          Sam and Tom find themselves squeezed between the inner and
          outer walls. Claustrophobic, dusty and obscure.
          
                                                                  26.
          
          
          Dilapidated WIRING snakes around them, and Tom barely has
          enough space to reach forth and touch it with his finger...
          
          COSMIC ENERGY jolts through the WIRE. A SPARK. A BLUE
          FLAME...
          
          Heat and pressure build. The old dry wood begins to CREAK and
          SNAP -- FADE TO WHITE.
          
          
          OVER WHITE...
          
          The SHARP SOUNDS echo and fade away... then become present
          again. Louder now, and different. A BANGING...
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - THE NEXT DAY
          
          Sam pulls back the CURTAIN OF WHITE -- a SHEET over her face.
          She's lying on the floor of the motel room in between the
          beds.
          
          She's alone, and naked except for the sheet. Her WET CLOTHES
          are in a heap beside her. Her head is throbbing...
          
          BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
          
          She scrambles to put something on so she can get the DOOR...
          
          
          I/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
          
          Having thrown on some wrinkled clothes, Sam opens the door to
          find Phil, the motel owner. He does not look pleased.
          
                              PHIL
                    You plannin' on checkin' out today?
          
                              SAM
                        (GROGGY)
                    Uh... I, I don't know yet.
          
                              PHIL
                    Well, it's already way past
                    checkout time, so you'd better
                    figure it out quick.
          
                              SAM
                    I've just gotta find Corey... and
                    check on the car.
          
                                                                     27.
          
          
                              PHIL
                    You do whatever you have to, but if
                    you're stayin' another night I
                    wanna see some money up front.
          
          
          EXT. BANK - DAY
          
          Sam approaches the bank, and when she sees the tall SIGN with
          the digital clock, she stops and stares up at it. It strikes
          a chord but she doesn't know why...
          
          The sign reads 12:48 PM -- and then -- JUNE 20, 1995. It
          changes to the FIREWORKS COUNTDOWN: 14 DAYS, 8 HOURS, 11
          MINUTES, 22 SECONDS... 21 SECONDS...
          
          
          INT. BANK - DAY
          
          Sam enters the small bank, and as she approaches the counter
          she sees that Trudy Potter is in tears. Some of her FEMALE CO-
          WORKERS are consoling her.
          
                              TRUDY
                    I don't believe it... I still just
                    don't believe it.
          
                              FEMALE CO-WORKER
                    It's gonna be alright. You'll see.
          
          Trudy looks up and sees Sam waiting uncomfortably.
          
                              TRUDY
                        (dabbing at her eyes with
                         a tissue)
                    Can I help you?
          
                              SAM
                    Is everything okay?
          
                              TRUDY
                    No, it's not... Mount Calvary
                    burned to the ground last night.
          
                              SAM
                    Mount Calvary?
          
                              TRUDY
                    Father Homeijer's church.
          
                              SAM
                    Oh... How did it happen?
          
                                                          28.
          
          
                              TRUDY
                    The police are looking into it,
                    but... I know it was arson.
          
          Trudy leans in to talk quietly to Sam.
          
                               TRUDY (CONT'D)
                    It's no secret to me how people in
                    this town feel about Father
                    Homeijer. The horrible accusations
                    that have been made against him...
                    But it's just a lot of nonsense. El
                    Reno's changed so much since I was
                    a kid growing up here. The young
                    people nowadays...
                        (BEAT)
                    No offense.
          
          She places her hand on top of Sam's.
          
                              TRUDY (CONT'D)
                    But with all the drugs and the
                    crime... I just don't know what
                    this world's coming to anymore.
          
          Sam tries to redirect her focus.
          
                              SAM
                    Are you able to get money wired
                    here from my bank back home?
          
                              TRUDY
                    We don't usually work with other
                    banks like that.
          
                              SAM
                    I need to check my balance and get
                    my money out. How do I do that?
          
                              TRUDY
                    You'll have to call and arrange it.
                    You could always use Western Union.
                    Where's your bank?
          
                                SAM
                    Virginia.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Oh... `cause they're gonna need to
                    have a signature.
          
          Disappointed, Sam turns to leave...
          
                                                                  29.
          
          
          ANGLE: NEAR EXIT
          
          As she's on her way out, she notices a BULLETIN BOARD with
          another MISSING PERSONS SIGN for BILLY MOORCROFT.
          
          She stands before the picture, staring into the young boy's
          dark, empty eyes. Though it's just a low quality black &
          white photo, Billy's face emotes profound hopelessness and
          despair.
          
          
          EXT. BANK - DAY
          
          As Sam comes out of the bank Jeremy rolls up in his BMW and
          parks in the lot. He gets out and approaches her.
          
                                 JEREMY
                    Hi there.
          
                                 SAM
                    Hey.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I didn't get your name at the
                    diner.
          
                                 SAM
                    I'm Sam.
          
                                 JEREMY
                    Jeremy.
          
          They shake, and Jeremy holds her hand for a little longer
          than what is generally comfortable.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    So what are you up to?
          
                              SAM
                    Trying to get money... not very
                    successfully.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I've gotta pick up some cash too.
                    Need some supplies for the lab. I
                    don't think I've even slept since I
                    got my hands on that meteorite. You
                    should come by the lab with me and
                    check it out.
          
                                 SAM
                    I can't...
          
          Sam starts to walk away from him.
          
                                                                  30.
          
          
                              JEREMY
                    I could let you borrow some
                    money... if you need some.
          
                              SAM
                    I don't even know you.
          
                              JEREMY
                    That's okay. I trust you.
          
                              SAM
                    Thanks anyway.
          
                              JEREMY
                    You're sure you don't want to check
                    out the lab?
          
                              SAM
                    Sorry... I've gotta find Corey.
          
          Sam turns to leave.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Maybe some other time.
          
          
          I/E. RANDY'S CAR - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey rides shotgun in Randy's car, chewing on some greasy
          FAST FOOD, looking quite content. Randy is behind the wheel
          with a BEER in his hand, and Mike, Jeff and Ruth are packed
          into the back, passing around a JOINT.
          
                              MIKE
                    How many cheeseburgers did we get?
          
                              RUTH
                    Like eight.
          
          Mike passes the joint up to Corey and she takes a big hit,
          chases it with some beer...
          
                              JEFF
                    Wait, did we get smokes?
          
          Everyone in the car is stunned into momentary silence when
          they turn a corner and see what's left of the church.
          
                      MIKE                            RANDY
          Whoa!                           Jesus Christ...
          
                                                                    31.
          
          
          POV FROM THE CAR - THE CHURCH RUINS
          
          POLICE and FIREMEN swarm. Father Homeijer stands with Officer
          O'Dell, gazing at the soggy ruins. The only things standing
          amid the charred mess are the THREE BARE CROSSES of Mount
          Calvary. But they aren't completely intact --
          
          
          EXT. CHURCH RUINS - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE ON - DEFORMED CROSSES
          
          All three are bent drastically forward, sagging down toward
          the murky ground...
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (O.S.)
                    Musta' melted from the heat.
          
          Father Homeijer looks down at the metamorphosis, beside
          himself with bitterness and sorrow.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    They're made of silver-plated
                    steel. A simple fire couldn't do
                    that.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    What are you sayin'?
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    This is an extension of Satan's own
                    hand... I've seen it coming.
          
          Rolling his eyes, O'Dell walks away, leaving the priest to
          grieve for his church in private.
          
          
          EXT. JUNKYARD, STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON
          
          Vietnam Tom continues to toil over his SCULPTURE, but
          progress has been made...
          
          It has begun to take on a recognizable form: a GROTESQUE
          COUNTENANCE with TWO LONG EARS, BULGING EYES and a devilish,
          TOOTHY GRIN...
          
          
          EXT. RANDY'S CAR/STREET IN FRONT OF DEPARTMENT STORE -
          AFTERNOON
          
          Sam is walking in front of a DEPARTMENT STORE when Randy's
          car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the
          passenger side window.
          
                              COREY
                    What happened to you?
          
                                                                   32.
          
          
                              SAM
                    What happened to me...? Where the
                    hell've you been?
          
                              COREY
                    I crashed at Randy's. We just got
                    food. Want a burger?
          
                              SAM
                    My stomach's fucked up.
          
                      JEFF                             MIKE
          Awww...                         Poor tummy...
          
          Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back. Ruth leers.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    We gotta talk about what we're
                    gonna do.
          
                              COREY
                    Don't worry about it so much.
          
                              SAM
                    The motel guy came to the room this
                    morning all pissed off. We're
                    probably not even gonna have enough
                    money to pay for the car.
          
          Corey sighs, debating weather or not to get out. Before she
          can reach a decision, something in the department store's
          parking lot catches her eye: a LITTLE BOY with dark hair,
          wearing a BIRTHDAY HAT...
          
          But she blinks and he's gone, having disappeared between two
          parked vehicles.
          
          Confused, Corey rubs her eyes and gets out of the car.
          
                              RANDY
                    Should I wait a minute?
          
                              JEFF
                    We gotta get some smokes...
          
                              COREY
                    Just go ahead. I'll catch up with
                    you later on.
          
                              RANDY
                    Alright. Later.
          
          Corey gets out and shuts the door. Randy speeds off toward an
          intersection about 20 yards ahead...
          
                                                                     33.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department
          store...
          
          He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK
          OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke
          break.
          
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Sam and Corey meander toward the intersection where Randy's
          car is stopped at a red light.
          
                              SAM
                    We just gotta figure out what we're
                    gonna do. I don't think-
          
                              COREY
                        (ABRUPT)
                    Lemme guess, you wanna go home.
          
                              SAM
                    What?
          
                              COREY
                    You wanna run back to mommy and
                    daddy and say sorry so they can put
                    you through college. Well that's
                    real big of you, Sam, but I don't
                    have that option.
          
                              SAM
                        (taken aback)
                    What are you talking about?
          
                              COREY
                    I'll go home and get the shit
                    kicked out of me, and get my ass
                    grabbed by my mom's boyfriend...
          
          They're almost to the light, which is still red, and coming
          up on Randy's car. Jeff, Mike and Ruth stare out at them from
          the backseat, smelling the drama.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    I knew you'd bail on me eventually,
                    but not this quick.
          
                              SAM
                    I'm not bailing on you. Would you
                    JUST-
          
                                                                     34.
          
          
                               COREY
                     You can fucking sleepwalk back to
                     Middlesex for all I care. I'm not
                     driving you... you're a fucking
                     drag.
          
          The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the
          intersection, making a left...
          
                               SAM
                     Fuck you, Corey.
          
          Sam wheels on her and steps out into the street, storming
          straight across. Corey starts to follow... but something
          stops her in her tracks: BILLY MOORCROFT.
          
          He stands on the opposite side of the intersection, in the
          trajectory that Sam is walking -- but Sam doesn't see him.
          
          Billy wears a BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He
          looks pale and weak, and is covered with BRUISES. He stares
          right back at Corey, as transfixed as she is... TIME SLOWS
          DOWN. [Note: Sam's position is in the middle of the road.
          Randy's car has made the left but is still in the vicinity of
          the intersection.]
          
          Bewildered, Corey tries to step out into the street but
          something blocks her -- an invisible FORCE FIELD makes
          forward progress impossible.
          
          RIPPLES swell like waves throughout the barrier where she hit
          it. She looks up, following the ripples with her eyes, and
          watches as they disappear beyond her realm of vision, into
          infinite space.
          
          She reaches forth with her hand, wanting to feel the barrier
          once again... Just as she touches it... REAL TIME RESUMES --
          
          KA-BOOM!
          
          FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT
          RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the JALOPY hits on the
          front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --
          
          Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...
          
          Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR
          smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle
          plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.
          
          The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet --
          
          -- AND STRIKES SAM RIGHT IN THE HEAD!
          
                                                                     35.
          
          
          The world goes SILENT.
          
          CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...
          
          WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT
          USED TO BE...
          
          SAM'S BODY IS CRUMPLED IN THE STREET, MOTIONLESS...
          
          BILLY MOORCROFT IS GONE. THE FORCE FIELD IS GONE. COREY
          STANDS FROZEN, HORRIFIED... IN UTTER SHOCK.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, the
          expression of shock still glued to her face. O'Dell sits
          facing her.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    You're sure you didn't see a
                    driver?
          
                              COREY
                    No...
          
          He takes the statement from her.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Well, you're one lucky girl to have
                    gotten outta the car when you did.
                    Front passenger side was wiped
                    right out. Coulda' been two dead
                    girls today instead of one.
          
          Corey nods, taking this in.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    I talked to Randy and sent him home
                    a little while ago. He's pretty
                    shook up.
          
          Corey doesn't respond. O'Dell leans in to speak to her in
          confidence.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Both of us know he'd been doin'
                    some drinkin' today. But we also
                    know he's not at fault here. That
                    old beater cut right in front him.
          
                              COREY
                    Can't you just look up the license
                    plates?
          
                                                                  36.
          
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    No plates on the vehicle. We're
                    investigating the VIN, but that
                    could take a little more time,
                    depending on the history of
                    ownership. We'll find him.
          
          Corey seems somewhat hesitant to bring up the next subject:
          
                              COREY
                    What about the missing boy?
          
          O'Dell shifts in his chair.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    You really think it was him, huh?
          
                              COREY
                    He was on the side of the road
                    right before the accident.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    I'm no psychiatrist, but I do know
                    sometimes shock does funny
                    things...
          
                              COREY
                    You think I was hallucinating?
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    We were on the scene five minutes
                    after the accident. I think
                    somebody woulda noticed a little
                    boy wandering around.
          
          He sees how troubled Corey is.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Why don't you stop in and see Dr.
                    Peters on your way out... right
                    down the hall there. She'll give
                    you somethin' to make you feel
                    better.
          
          Corey nods and gets up to leave. As she's on her way out,
          O'Dell's voice stops her.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Oh, uh... is there anything you
                    wanted to say to Samantha's
                    parents?
          
          Corey's expression is blank.
          
                                                                  37.
          
          
                                 COREY
                    Like what?
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey walks out of the police station and finds herself in a
          secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti-
          depressants.
          
          She is frightened when she notices a PAIR OF EYES staring at
          her from the bushes close by -- it's Vietnam Tom. He's
          wearing his ski mask and he's got his rifle.
          
          Corey backs away as Tom slowly creeps toward her... She's
          about to scream for help when Chris Holt comes out of the
          police station behind her.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Get the hell outta here.
          
          Grateful for his presence, Corey moves to stand behind Chris.
          Tom shuffles away.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    Should know better than to be
                    carrying his rifle around town like
                    that...
          
          Corey takes a breath, recovering from her scare.
          
                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    You okay?
          
                              COREY
                    What're you doing here?
          
                              CHRIS
                    I had to put in a statement too.
                    Can I give you a lift?
          
          
          I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENING
          
          Chris and Corey pull up to the motel in his pick-up. They've
          gotten Corey's prescription filled, and she has the BOTTLE OF
          PILLS in her hand.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I'm real sorry about Sam.
          
          Corey nods.
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    It's such a waste. Just a horrible,
                    freak thing.
          
                              COREY
                    I said some pretty shitty things to
                    her right before it happened.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I'm sure she knew you didn't mean
                    it.
          
          Corey gets out of the car and walks toward the motel room.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENING
          
          Corey swallows two of her PILLS with some liquor from a
          plastic cup. She sits down on one of the full-size beds where
          Sam's belongings are spread out.
          
          She opens Sam's backpack and discovers THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME
          TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow...
          
          As Corey studies the cover, her image is reflected by the
          CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS. The angle of the mirrors creates double
          image reflections for other objects in the room. Strangely,
          Corey's reflection is only present in one of the panes.
          
          The digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM...
          
          There are PICTURES of Sam's family tucked away inside the
          book, between the pages: Sam with her mother and father, ROSE
          and EDDIE DARKO; YOUNG SAM with ELIZABETH and DONNIE; an old
          photo of the whole Darko family together -- Young Sam holds
          ARIEL, a STUFFED TOY UNICORN.
          
          Corey removes the pictures and sets them on the nightstand...
          She then looks down and notices that the book is open to:
          CHAPTER THREE - THE FRAGMENTARY UNIVERSE.
          
                              COREY
                    Fragmentary Universe...
          
          She pours over the text, some of which reads: When the fabric
          of the fourth dimension within a Tangent Universe becomes
          corrupted, a highly unstable and volatile Fragmentary
          Universe can occur, sustaining itself for no longer than
          several days... FADE TO BLACK.
          
                                                                    39.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - LATER - NIGHT
          
          Corey awakens to the sound of a little boy CRYING. She sits
          up in bed. The clock/radio reads 3:30 AM. The CRYING is faint
          but steady and sorrowful, and sounds as though it's coming
          from outside...
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
          
          Corey follows the distinctive CRYING toward the VENDING
          MACHINES on the side of the building...
          
          ...until Billy Moorcroft emerges from behind them. Corey
          freezes a few feet away from the boy, who wears the BIRTHDAY
          HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He is pale and bruised.
          
          Corey sees that he is not crying -- it's coming from
          elsewhere in the cosmos, far away. The WAILS taper off to a
          faint, DISTORTED WHISPER as Billy speaks:
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    You need to save me, Corey.
          
          Corey stares at him in disbelief.
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)
                    You need to save me... and save the
                    world.
          
                              COREY
                    Why can't anyone see you?
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    If you tell them about me they'll
                    think you're a dummy.
          
                               COREY
                    Why me?
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    I didn't pick you. Just like you
                    didn't pick me either.
          
          Corey stands before him in awe, transfixed.
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)
                    We shouldn't even be here. Nobody
                    should...
          
          Corey takes notice of the vending machines behind him. Where
          the prices should be, NUMBERS flash in a rhythm that seems to
          coincide with the ululations of the distant CRYING: 2...
          10... 16... 44... -end-... 2... 10... 16... 44... -end-...
          
                                                                     40.
          
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)
                    You don't have much time.
          
          Corey is about to respond when the sound of a DOOR OPENING
          stops her. The FLASHING NUMBERS on the vending machines go
          back to normal PRICES, the CRYING SOUND CEASES, and Billy
          disappears.
          
                              PHIL (O.S.)
                    What's goin' on out here?
          
          Corey looks over and sees Phil dressed in nightclothes,
          having come out of a room near the lobby. She's dumbstruck.
          
                              COREY
                    Nothing... I-I don't know.
          
                              PHIL
                    Go back to your room and get some
                    sleep. You've had a tough day.
          
          Phil goes back inside, leaving her alone.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
          
          Corey wanders through the aisles of the department store,
          looking peaked and jittery. She comes upon Chris stocking
          some shelves near the back of the store.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Hey... how ya feelin'?
          
                              COREY
                    Not so good.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Is there anything I can do?
          
                              COREY
                    I need some cigarettes... and maybe
                    some food. But I don't really have
                    any money right now.
          
                               CHRIS
                    I'm off at 3:30. Meet me out behind
                    the store.
          
          
          EXT. BEHIND THE DEPARTMENT STORE - LATER - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey waits on the cement steps by the loading dock. She
          shoots up when Chris comes out the back entrance with a
          PLASTIC BAG...
          
                                                                  41.
          
          
          Corey takes it from him and looks inside: CANDY BARS, a BAG
          OF CHIPS, some PEANUTS, a pack of CIGARETTES.
          
                              COREY
                    Thanks.
          
          She tears open the cigarettes and lights one. Chris lights up
          one of his own, and notices Corey's hands are shaking.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Shouldn't you go back home?
          
                              COREY
                    There's nothing for me to go home
                    to. Trust me.
          
                              CHRIS
                    What about Sam's funeral?
          
          Corey looks conflicted, but she takes a harsh stance:
          
                              COREY
                    What's the point? She's gone,
                    that's it. Nothing's gonna change
                    that...
          
          Chris lets it go.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    Is there a library around here?
          
                              CHRIS
                        (PUZZLED)
                    Yeah... you need a book?
          
                              COREY
                    Is it walking distance?
          
                              CHRIS
                    I can take you.
          
                              COREY
                    I think I'd rather walk.
          
          
          EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey and Chris stroll together along a quiet street.
          
                              CHRIS
                    So you guys were real close, huh.
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
                              COREY
                    When I moved to Virginia Sam was
                    like the only person I could even
                    stand to talk to.
          
                              CHRIS
                    How long had you been plannin' your
                    trip together?
          
                              COREY
                    Not too long... kind of a last
                    minute thing. It was good timing,
                    `cause I don't like to stay in one
                    place for too long, ya know?
          
                              CHRIS
                    Huh...
          
                              COREY
                    I was really surprised when Sam
                    wanted to come, actually. I just
                    kinda brought it up one day, and
                    she was down...
          
          Corey reflects for a beat.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    If it wasn't for me, she'd still be
                    alive right now.
          
                              CHRIS
                    You can't think like that.
          
                              COREY
                    It's true, isn't it?
          
          Chris doesn't respond.
          
          
          INT. LIBRARY, MICROFICHE RESEARCH BOOTH - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey and Chris sit before a screen in a cramped, dim booth
          near the back of the library. They stare at a MICROFILM
          ARTICLE from 1988 about DONNIE DARKO'S DEATH.
          
                              CHRIS
                    That was Sam's brother?
          
                              COREY
                    Yeah.
          
          On the screen is a PHOTOGRAPH of the DARKO HOUSE with many
          PEOPLE gathered in front of it. A JET ENGINE is being lifted
          away by a CRANE.
          
                                                                  43.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    Her parents must be going through
                    hell.
          
                              COREY
                    Sam said once she wished it landed
                    on her room instead of Donnie's.
          
          Chris thinks on this.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I saw something on Sam's wrist the
                    other night... it looked like a
                    scar.
          
                              COREY
                    She told me it was from some
                    accident. Put her hand through a
                    window or something.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Did you believe her?
          
          Corey doesn't answer. She pulls up ANOTHER ARTICLE, one that
          chronicles a MAN who was IMPALED BY A METAL PIPE with no
          known origin...
          
          A THIRD ARTICLE is about a LITTLE GIRL who was DECAPITATED BY
          A MANHOLE COVER that was inexplicably flying through the
          air...
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    God...
          
          Chris is horrified. Corey is totally engrossed.
          
          She brings up a FINAL ARTICLE that tells the story of a BOY
          who was CRUSHED BY A DUMPSTER that fell from the sky. A
          PICTURE shows his legs sticking out from under it like the
          Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothy's house fell on her in
          Munchkinland.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    I don't understand why we're
                    lookin' at this stuff.
          
                              COREY
                    They still never found a driver to
                    that car that hit Randy... I was
                    standing right there. I didn't see
                    anyone.
          
                                                                  44.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    I was pretty close too, but
                    everything was all crazy. Whoever
                    it was must've jumped out and took
                    off.
          
                              COREY
                    I found this book in Sam's backpack
                    last night. There's a chapter where
                    it talks about stuff like this
                    happening. Like a guy being killed
                    by an arrow that nobody shot, and a
                    swordsmith getting killed by a
                    sword he hadn't made yet.
                    Unexplainable things, but it says
                    there's a reason why they happen.
          
                              CHRIS
                    A book...? I don't get what your
                    talkin' about. What was the reason?
          
                              COREY
                    It didn't say.
          
          Corey thinks, trying to figure out the right way to express
          something...
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    Last night, and right before the
                    accident, I saw...
          
                               CHRIS
                    What?
          
                               COREY
                    Nothing.
          
          Corey sighs and turns back to the screen.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    You already think I'm a freak show.
          
          
          INT. LIBRARY, FRONT DESK - AFTERNOON
          
          As Chris and Corey are on the way out, they notice Jeremy
          Frame at the counter checking out a STACK OF BOOKS.
          
          In putting them down, he accidentally drops half of them onto
          the floor. He looks frazzled as he begins to pick them up,
          and he scratches compulsively at his LEFT FOREARM...
          
                                                                  45.
          
          
          I/E. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris and Corey pull up to Dusty's auto repair shop in Chris'
          truck.
          
          They get out and start to walk up to the garage, but they're
          cut off by the unchained PIT BULL -- it's growling and
          barking in a frenzy --
          
                                RUTH (O.S.)
                    Darielle!
          
          The dog heels at the sound of the voice, and Ruth bolts out
          of the house and takes her by the collar. She's got a bandage
          over a cut on her forehead.
          
                              RUTH (CONT'D)
                    Come to check on your car?
          
                                COREY
                    Yeah...
          
          Hearts still thumping in their chests, they follow Ruth into
          the garage... COREY'S CHEVROLET is parked in the same spot it
          was when she left it the other day. The hood is propped open.
          
                              RUTH
                    Randy's been a wreck since the
                    accident.
          
                              CHRIS
                    He should be. He was driving around
                    shit-faced and somebody got killed.
          
                              RUTH
                    You can just fuck off...
          
          She gets right up in his face with such intensity that Chris
          retreats a step or two.
          
                              RUTH (CONT'D)
                    Prima donna motherfucker think your
                    shit don't stink?
          
          Corey steps in:
          
                              COREY
                    She's right...
          
          Chris gives her a look.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    I mean, there's nothing Randy
                    could've done.
          
                                                                  46.
          
          
          Ruth turns and goes into the house through a GARAGE ENTRANCE.
          
                              RUTH
                    I'll get my dad.
          
          The door slams shut behind her, and Corey and Chris glance at
          each other...
          
          Momentarily, Dusty comes out, a partially eaten SANDWICH in
          hand.
          
                              DUSTY
                    Got some bad news for you...
          
          He walks them over to the car, finishing off his sandwich and
          wiping his hands on his greasy jeans.
          
                              DUSTY (CONT'D)
                    Your engine seized up when your
                    water pump blew.
          
                              COREY
                    I need a new engine now?
          
                              DUSTY
                    I can get one in there for you.
                    Cost you about fifteen hundred.
          
          Corey's face drops.
          
                              COREY
                    I don't have anywhere near that
                    much money.
          
                              CHRIS
                    That's probably as much as the
                    car's worth.
          
                              DUSTY
                    I understand. But, I already
                    ordered the water pump, and I'll
                    have to get paid for my time. That
                    comes to about three-hundred total.
          
                              COREY
                    I don't have that much either.
          
          Dusty is perturbed.
          
                              DUSTY
                    You think I do this for charity?
          
                                                                   47.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    You didn't do anything. What's she
                    want a water pump for if she
                    doesn't have an engine?
          
                              DUSTY
                    I see how it is... couple a' punks.
                    You don't plan to pay what you owe,
                    you can get the hell off my
                    property right now.
          
          Corey glares at him, furious, but Chris takes her by the arm.
          
                              COREY
                        (under her breath)
                    Asshole.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Let's go...
          
          
          I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris' truck pulls up in front of the motel and parks. At the
          same time, Father Homeijer and Trudy come out of the FRONT
          OFFICE carrying a COLLECTIONS JAR.
          
          As they approach the truck Chris slowly rolls down the
          window.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Good afternoon.
          
                              TRUDY
                    We're taking collections to help
                    rebuild Mount Calvary after the
                    tragic fire.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Any small amount you could manage
                    would really help.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Sorry.
          
          Father Homeijer and Trudy look over to Corey in the passenger
          seat but she just stares back at them.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    God bless you.
          
          They turn and walk away, and Chris rolls his window back up.
          
                                                                    48.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    Everybody wants somethin'...
          
                              COREY
                    What about you?
          
                              CHRIS
                    What do you mean?
          
                              COREY
                    You wouldn't give me stuff and
                    drive me around if you didn't want
                    something in return.
          
                               CHRIS
                    Why not?
          
                              COREY
                    `Cause that's just not how it
                    works.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Maybe you're wrong about that.
          
          Corey nods, but still doesn't believe him.
          
                               COREY
                    See ya.
          
          She gets out, and Chris eyes her as she walks to her room.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
          
          Corey lays on her stomach in bed, her head buried in The
          Philosophy of Time Travel book. The TELEVISION is on in the
          b.g. (out of focus), playing a repeat of the FOREMAN GRILL
          INFOMERCIAL...
          
          Suddenly, there is a slight TREMOR from outside and RIPPLE
          runs over the TV screen.
          
          Corey looks around, taking no notice of the odd change on the
          television -- instead of GEORGE FOREMAN'S VOICE, HULK HOGAN
          is HEARD promoting the brand new HULKSTER GRILL...
          
          Just then, there is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up to
          answer it and finds Randy -- he looks distraught.
          
                              RANDY
                    Do you hate me?
          
                               COREY
                    Huh?
          
                                                                     49.
          
          
                              RANDY
                    You think it's my fault she's dead.
          
                              COREY
                    No...
          
                              RANDY
                    You mean it?
          
                              COREY
                    Yeah... it wasn't your fault.
          
          Randy sighs as if a big weight has been lifted.
          
                              RANDY
                    What's that?
          
          Corey looks down and realizes that she's still holding The
          Philosophy of Time Travel book in her hand.
          
                              COREY
                    Oh, it's just... something of
                    Sam's.
          
          Randy nods. Corey tosses the book onto the bed.
          
                              RANDY
                    You wanna get outta here for a
                    while? I got my dad's car.
          
          
          I/E. RANDY'S DAD'S CAR/LOOKOUT - NIGHT
          
          RANDY'S DAD'S CAR navigates a DIRT ROAD up a WOODED HILL to a
          VANTAGE POINT where the whole of El Reno can be seen. SPARSE
          LIGHTS flicker over about 80 square miles of civilization.
          
          There are a few OTHER VEHICLES parked at the lookout, most
          containing COUPLES with MUSIC playing low.
          
          Randy pulls into a more SECLUDED CLEARING, away from the
          other cars but still with a nice view.
          
                              RANDY
                    I've been comin' up here since I
                    was a kid. Good place when you
                    wanna just get away from
                    everything.
          
          Randy pushes in a TAPE (suggestion: River of Deceit, by Mad
          Season), then takes a JOINT from his pocket and sparks it up.
          
                              COREY
                    Is Ruth your girlfriend?
          
                                                             50.
          
          
          Randy passes the joint to Corey and she hits it.
          
                              RANDY
                    Naw, we're just friends. She's
                    pretty weird sometimes. Too like...
                    intense, or something.
          
                              COREY
                    Seems like you guys are pretty
                    close.
          
                              RANDY
                    Yeah... don't worry about Ruth.
          
          Randy takes another hit and holds it in.
          
                              COREY
                    Do you ever have a hard time
                    telling what's real and what's not
                    real?
          
          Randy exhales and looks over at her, perplexed.
          
                              RANDY
                    Sometimes... sometimes something
                    can feel really real, but it's just
                    your mind playing tricks on you.
          
                              COREY
                    I've got so much shit in my head
                    right now... I've never felt so
                    outta control. I think I'm really
                    goin' psycho.
          
          He passes her the joint.
          
                              RANDY
                    I got some acid from my buddy one
                    time... this like flying eagle
                    pyramid shit. I took two hits, and
                    man... next thing I knew I was on
                    the floor, curled up in ball, and
                    Mike and Jeff were just standing
                    there lookin' down at me. I could
                    see this like glowing grid cutting
                    through my brain, and I knew when
                    it got all the way through I'd be
                    this sketched out vegetable. I
                    could picture my dad staring down
                    at me in the hospital in my
                    straightjacket, crying and shit...
          
          Corey blows out a hit, captivated...
          
                                                                   51.
          
          
                              RANDY (CONT'D)
                    The whole time my esophagus was
                    like twisting and turning in my
                    throat and cutting off my air
                    supply... it was terrible.
          
                              COREY
                    Jesus.
          
                              RANDY
                    I can still slip back into it
                    sometimes, but I know now that my
                    brain is what's making it real...
                    and that's like a blessing and a
                    curse, man, `cause that means you
                    have to decide what's real and
                    what's not.
          
                              COREY
                    The things that feel the most real
                    right now are... impossible. More
                    like a dream.
          
          Corey passes him the joint and he stamps out the roach in the
          car's ashtray.
          
                              RANDY
                    I know what you mean. The scariest
                    part is thinking you're not the
                    same person anymore. Something's
                    changed... like your identity.
          
                              COREY
                    What if the change is for the
                    better?
          
          Randy finds an INHALER in his pocket and takes a puff.
          
                              RANDY
                    That's fucked up.
          
                              COREY
                    I don't think I even care if I'm
                    crazy.
          
          Corey turns and looks into his eyes. Randy leans forward...
          They're about to kiss, when --
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck?
          
          A DARK SHAPE scurries to an enclosed area at the edge of the
          forest where there's a TARP, some WATER BOTTLES, CANS OF FOOD
          and a RIFLE...
          
                                                                    52.
          
          
          It's Vietnam Tom, and he's brought some supplies to his NEW
          SQUATTING GROUND.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    That fucking guy again...
          
          Randy and Corey both laugh, relieving the tension. But Tom's
          proximity has spoiled the mood.
          
                              RANDY
                    Let's get outta here.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mike, Jeff and Ruth sit on a ratty couch in Randy's living
          room, watching BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD on MTV. Some EMPTY BEER
          CANS and a HOMEADE BONG litter a coffee table. When the FRONT
          DOOR OPENS and Corey and Randy enter, none of them budge.
          
          As Corey and Randy walk to Randy's bedroom, Ruth follows them
          with her eyes...
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Randy shuts the door to his messy room. A TAPESTRY hangs from
          the ceiling. Corey is drawn to a DESK next to the bed. Above
          it is a DEATH SHRINE to KURT COBAIN -- MAGAZINE CUTOUTS,
          POSTERS and TICKET STUBS arranged decoratively.
          
          A large BLACK & WHITE POSTER showing a CLOSE   UP of COBAIN'S
          FACE is the centerpiece, and a sloppy BULLET   HOLE drawn in
          RED MARKER marks the center of his forehead.   The words `I'M
          NOT AFRAID OF DYING' are scrawled across the   bottom of the
          poster in the same BRIGHT RED.
          
                              COREY
                    This is cool.
          
                              RANDY
                    Thanks.
          
          Randy puts his hands on her hips, running them up her torso.
          Corey turns to face him...
          
          They kiss...
          
          ...and fall back onto the bed...
          
                                                                     53.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER - NIGHT
          
          A DIGITAL CLOCK on Randy's DESK shows 3:30 AM. There's a
          SLIGHT TREMOR and the numbers shift, changing briefly to
          01:10:23:08, then back again to 3:30.
          
          Corey wakes suddenly from a nightmare. She sits up and looks
          around, remembering where she is. She discovers Randy asleep
          by her side. She finds a pile of clothes on the floor beside
          the bed and grabs her shirt...
          
          ...after she pulls it on over her head, she freezes --
          because Billy Moorcroft is standing right there in his
          BIRTHDAY HAT, staring at her.
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    Only one day left.
          
          Corey turns and looks down to Randy. He's still fast asleep.
          
                              COREY
                    What am I supposed to do?
          
          As soon as she utters her question she notices a silvery,
          liquid VECTOR SPEAR protruding from the center of her chest.
          
          Billy is now gone, but her SPEAR beckons her out of the room,
          elongating to illustrate her path. Corey is in awe...
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Her SPEAR leads her through the living room, and past the
          sleeping bodies of Mike, Jeff and Ruth. Following her path
          leads her to step on RUTH'S FOOT as she goes by...
          
          Corey doesn't even notice, but one of Ruth's eyes pop open as
          she treads out the door...
          
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT
          
          Corey follows Billy, who walks in the middle of the road
          about 15 yards ahead of her. The residential street is
          guarded by great, OLD TREES on either side.
          
          The dark sky above starts to BEND and WARP, and a BUCKLE in
          space-time materializes.
          
          There's a simultaneous flash of LIGHTING and sharp CRACK OF
          THUNDER, and Corey looks up to the VORTEX -- a massive,
          swirling MAELSTROM gapes open like a tunnel to the inter-
          dimensional realm of darkest night.
          
                                                                     54.
          
          
          The VOID brightens, and ominous STORM CLOUDS and TORRENTIAL
          RAINS are visible within...
          
          Corey peers up into the MOUTH of it and sees DUSTY'S HOUSE
          AND AUTO REPAIR SHOP being doused and beaten by the STORM --
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          In contrast to the street, all is nearly SILENT in Dusty's
          garage. Corey watches as Billy moves along the perimeter
          WITHOUT SOUND, ghostly... JUMP CUTS and TIME CUTS.
          
          Her CHEVROLET sits in the bay. Some of the PARTS have already
          been harvested -- the CATALYTIC CONVERTER sits next to it on
          the floor.
          
          Corey approaches a UTILITY SINK next to a SHOWER in the
          corner...
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    You can do it.
          
                                 COREY
                    How?
          
                                 BILLY MOORCROFT
                    It's easy.
          
          Corey focuses on the sink, and it begins to tremble. The
          pipes beneath it CREAK and MOAN. WATER starts to bubble up
          from the sink drain, also in the shower...
          
          Billy stands atop her car, watching her. His perpetually
          morose expression transforms into a smile.
          
          The SINK BASIN suddenly cracks from pressure. As Corey stares
          into the drain... WE PLUNGE DOWN INTO THE PIPE --
          
          
          POV OF TELEKINETIC ENERGY - INSIDE THE PIPE
          
          We travel through meters and meters of DANK PIPING until we
          hit the WATER MAIN. There's a sound like a TIDAL WAVE
          CRASHING --
          
          
          EXT. STREET/DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - LATER - DAWN
          
          -- WATER POURS out from under the garage door down to the
          street. PULL BACK TO REVEAL --
          
                                                                   55.
          
          
          The entire driveway and the street in front of the house are
          covered with water. FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE
          are gathered in front of the property.
          
          
          ANGLE: DOWN THE STREET
          
          Ruth runs toward her house. When she turns a corner and it
          comes into view, she stops dead in her tracks. Her face shows
          sheer terror --
          
          Because her father Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into
          the back of a cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another
          policeman, OFFICER HINES...
          
          ...the PIT BULL struggles against it's CHAIN, growling and
          barking frantically.
          
          ...and Billy Moorcroft, half-naked, soaking wet and
          shivering, is wrapped in a blanket and being tended to by
          PARAMEDICS.
          
                              FIREMAN #2
                    Lucky I heard him screamin', else
                    he woulda drowned down there.
          
          Ruth keeps to the shadows and slinks toward a BACK DOOR...
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, FOOT OF THE STAIRS - DAWN
          
          She sloshes through four inches of water and skips up the
          stairs...
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, RUTH'S BEDROOM - DAWN
          
          Without turning on the lights, Ruth desperately rifles
          through her closet until she finds a SHOEBOX.
          
          Inside it are several PLASTIC BAGS -- some filled with
          MARIJUANA, others with COCAINE...
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAWN
          
          Hands shaking, Ruth dumps a bag of coke into the toilet and
          flushes it. The WHITE POWDER disappears down the swirling
          SPIRAL OF CLOUDY LIQUID...
          
          But the bowl doesn't refill.
          
                              RUTH
                    Shit!
          
                                                                    56.
          
          
          She begins to stuff the other bags down her pants...
          
          
          EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - DAWN
          
          Having deposited Dusty in the back of the cruiser and shut
          the door, O'Dell's attention turns to an upstairs window of
          the house when he sees MOVEMENT.
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Randy rolls over in bed, opening his eyes to the new day. He
          looks around for Corey, disappointed to find her gone.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
          
          Corey walks down an aisle of the department store. She finds
          Chris assisting a CUSTOMER.
          
                              CUSTOMER
                    I just checked aisle three.
          
                              CHRIS
                    They're there. At the front, by the
                    Trapper Keepers.
          
          The Customer moves off and Chris turns to find Corey standing
          beside him.
          
                              COREY
                    I'm outta cigarettes.
          
          
          EXT. BEHIND THE DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
          
          Corey waits behind the store until Chris comes out. She
          eagerly accepts TWO PACKS.
          
                              CHRIS
                    D'ya hear the news?
          
                              COREY
                    What?
          
                              CHRIS
                    They found that Billy Moorcroft
                    kid. He was at Dusty's house...
          
          Corey is floored.
          
                                                                   57.
          
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    Sick bastard had him locked up in
                    the basement. I can't believe we
                    were just over there yesterday.
          
          Corey can't help it... A grin spreads across her face.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    I guess he's gonna be okay-
          
                              COREY
                    Everything's gonna be okay.
          
          Corey cuts him off, and Chris looks at her strangely.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    I'm not crazy. I think everything's
                    gonna be okay.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
          
          Corey lays on her stomach in bed, studying The Philosophy of
          Time Travel. The book is open to: CHAPTER SIX - THE LIVING
          RECEIVER... The Living Receiver is chosen to guide the
          Artifact into position for its journey back to the Primary
          Universe. No one knows how or why a Receiver will be
          chosen...
          
          She flips through the onion skin pages to: CHAPTER TEN - THE
          MANIPULATED DEAD... The Manipulated Dead are more powerful
          than the Living Receiver. If a person dies within the Tangent
          Dimension, they are able to contact the Living Receiver
          through the Fourth Dimensional Construct...
          
          Corey glances over at the CLOSET MIRROR and sees Billy's
          image reflected. She flips over and finds him standing at the
          foot of the bed, clad in the same garb as all her visions.
          
                              COREY
                    I already saved you.
          
                              BILLY MOORCROFT
                    It's not over.
          
          He points to the CLOSET MIRROR... She stares into her own
          reflection as BILLY'S DISAPPEARS.
          
          HER IMAGE starts to FADE as well, and then the SURFACE OF THE
          MIRROR TRANSFORMS into a three-dimensional vision of a PARK.
          The focus is a SWING SET... and one of the SWINGS in
          particular, which rocks slowly back and forth. Empty. Void of
          life.
          
                                                                     58.
          
          
                                 COREY
                           (CONFUSED)
                    Why?
          
          
          INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM/DEN - DAY
          
          Inside Billy Moorcroft's quaint, sanitary-looking home is a
          small gathering to celebrate his return. STREAMERS hang over
          a table supporting a partially eaten CAKE. A BANNER that
          reads `WELCOME HOME BILLY!' is draped across the archway
          connecting the DINING ROOM to the DEN.
          
          BILLY'S MOTHER (32), with her fair complexion and dark hair,
          is an older female version of Billy himself.
          
          As she brings a POT OF COFFEE and a STACK OF CUPS into
          BILLY'S FATHER (35), BILLY'S AUNT and UNCLE, and a CHILD
          PSYCHOLOGIST who is moderating (50s; male) in the den, she
          looks as though she's barely keeping it together.
          
                              CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST
                        (between bites of cake)
                    The place for Billy to be right now
                    is at home with his family...
          
          Billy's Mother interrupts as she sets the coffee down.
          
                                 BILLY'S MOTHER
                    Excuse me.
          
                              CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST
                    Oh, thank you.
          
          The Psychologist accepts a cup.
          
                              CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST (CONT'D)
                    It'll take years for him to work
                    through what happened, but the best
                    way to open those doors is to
                    surround him with things that are
                    familiar...
          
          Billy's Mother passes her husband a cup, and they hold a
          long, painful moment of eye contact.
          
          
          INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, BREAKFAST NOOK - MOMENTS LATER -
          DAY
          
          Billy sits at a table in the sunny, HEXAGONAL ROOM. He wears
          the BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT.
          
                                                                     59.
          
          
          He appears clean and groomed, but his face and neck are
          marred by BRUISES and other ABRASIONS. Before him is a packet
          of COLORED PENCILS and some sheets of PAPER.
          
          His Mother walks up behind him, and peeks over his shoulder
          at the DRAWING that he's working on.
          
                               BILLY'S MOTHER
                    Are you sure you don't want some
                    more cake?
          
          Billy nods. His mother caresses his head as she watches him
          color. After a moment she sits down in a chair beside him and
          tries to get his attention.
          
                              BILLY'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    Billy... I-
          
          Before she can go on, she's interrupted by the DOORBELL.
          Billy never looks up.
          
          
          I/E. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - DAY
          
          Billy's Father answers the door and finds Corey.
          
                              BILLY'S FATHER
                    Only family and close friends are
                    welcome here today.
          
          Billy's Mother hovers behind her husband, curious about and
          wary of the stranger.
          
                              COREY
                    I understand... I just wanted to
                    say that I'm sorry about everything
                    that happened to Billy. And I know
                    it doesn't seem like it, but
                    everything happens for a reason...
                    and it'll all work out in the end.
          
          Billy's Father stares her down until she turns to leave
          uncomfortably. Billy's Mother starts to cry... CUT BACK TO:
          
          
          INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY
          
          ...the breakfast nook. Billy is gone.
          
          Left on the table is his completed DRAWING. It's a neatly
          executed rendition of a SWING SET -- identical to the one
          from Corey's vision in the closet door mirror.
          
                                                                     60.
          
          
          EXT. PARK - DAY
          
          Billy walks through the empty park, still wearing his
          birthday hat. He makes his way past a SAND PIT with a JUNGLE
          GYM.
          
          Balanced on one of the jungle gym's bars is a PRESCRIPTION
          BOTTLE...
          
          Billy picks it up. The name on the prescription is COREY
          RICHARDSON. JUMP CUT TO:
          
          The SWING SET. Billy leans back as far as he can as momentum
          propels his body forward and back through space. He looks up
          to the sky where SUPERNATURAL BLACK CLOUDS are forming...
          
          He swings back and forth... back and forth...
          
          
          ANGLE: PARK BENCH
          
          Corey sits nearby on a park bench, watching Billy. He looks
          back at her, showing no signs of recognition... JUMP CUT TO:
          
          The SWING. No longer a little boy sitting in it. It dangles
          erratically from the ropes, still gripped by inertia...
          
          PAN DOWN to the sandy ground below -- FIND the bottle of
          pills, now empty. Billy's unmoving, OPEN HAND...
          
          
          EXT. OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY 40/EL RENO EXIT - AFTERNOON
          
          A TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK gets off the highway and heads into
          El Reno. It's load is a batch of beat up, OLD CARS.
          
          The JALOPY is on the TOP RACK, CLOSEST TO THE END...
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - AFTERNOON
          
          Randy peeks in the window of Corey's motel room but sees
          nothing. He pounds on the door and calls for her:
          
                               RANDY
                    Corey...
          
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Corey arrives near the intersection where the accident took
          place. The BLACK CLOUDS overhead have become more vast and
          oppressive. A cold WIND blows...
          
                                                                     61.
          
          
          The TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK breaches the crest of a hill and
          comes into view, descending on the intersection.
          
          Above it the CLOUDS begin to transform and take the shape of
          an ASTRONOMICAL WORMHOLE that reaches down toward the
          earth...
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris comes outside and gazes up at the foreboding sky...
          
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          As the TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK approaches the intersection,
          Corey fixates on the JALOPY on the back...
          
          
          CLOSE ANGLE: JALOPY
          
          The CHAINS that hold the junker in place SHAKE and RATTLE...
          
          
          EXT. THE ETHER - AFTERNOON - POV INSIDE PORTAL
          
          We plunge through the PORTAL as it twists through the
          ether...
          
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          The WORMHOLE extends down to the JALOPY. Gracefully. Like an
          eel moving through water, confidently pursuing it's prey...
          mouth widening to swallow...
          
          Corey is riveted.
          
          As it passes through the intersection, the TRACTOR-TRAILER
          hits a POTHOLE -- CUT TO:

          AFTERNOON
          
          Sam is walking in front of the department store when Randy's
          car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the
          passenger side window.
          
                              COREY
                    What happened to you?
          
                              SAM
                    What happened to me...? Where the

                              COREY
                    I crashed at Randy's. We just got
                    food. Want a burger?
          
                              SAM

                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    We gotta talk about what we're
                    gonna do.
          
                              COREY
                    Don't worry about it so much.
          
                              SAM
                    The motel guy came to the room this
                    MORNING-
          
                              COREY
                        (INTERRUPTING)
                    I don't give a fuck.
          
                                 SAM
                    Excuse me?
          
                                                                     63.
          
          
                              COREY
                    I said, I. Don't. Give. A. Fuck...
          
          She annunciates every word like a true bitch.
          
                              COREY (CONT'D)
                    I'm tired of listening to you whine
                    about everything.
          
          Giggles from the peanut gallery in the car.
          
                              SAM
                    Corey, you're still drunk. Don't be
                    a fuck-ass.
          
                              JEFF
                    Did she just call her a fuck-ass?
          
                              MIKE
                    What's a fuck-ass?
          
          Everyone cracks up, including Corey. Sam is humiliated. She
          backs away from the car, anger burning in her eyes. Randy
          revs the engine, expressing his will to take off.
          
                              COREY
                    See ya later, Sam.
          
          Sam says nothing, but watches as Randy's car peels off toward
          the intersection. She's confused and hurt, frozen to the spot
          where she's standing.
          
          As Corey stares back at Sam from the car, her smile fades...
          
          
          INT. RANDY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          Corey turns to face the approaching intersection. Resolute.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department
          store...
          
          He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK
          OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke
          break.
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Randy's car is stopped at the red light. Sam strolls toward
          it ever so slowly. Jeff, Mike and Ruth gawk at her from the
          backseat.
          
          She slows down even more, having no interest in subjecting
          herself to any more of their mockery...
          
          The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the
          intersection, making a left. Sam's still 10 or 15 feet away
          from stepping into the street...
          
          She quickens her pace, almost there when --
          
          KA-BOOM!
          
          FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT
          RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the jalopy hits on the
          front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --
          
          Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...
          
          Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR
          smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle
          plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.
          
          The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet and
          skitters harmlessly across the intersection --
          
          The world goes SILENT.
          
          CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...
          
          WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT
          USED TO BE...
          
          THE JALOPY IS FLIPPED OVER ONTO ITS SIDE...
          
          SAM STANDS PEERING AT THE WRECKAGE... THE AREA OF THE CAR
          WHERE COREY WAS SITTING IS VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT. SHE DROPS
          TO HER KNEES.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON
          
          Sam signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, her eyes
          red and puffy from crying. O'Dell sits facing her.
          
                               OFFICER O'DELL
                     I just gotta ask you one more
                     time... you're sure you didn't see
                     a driver?
          
                                                                    65.
          
          
          Sam shakes her head no, and he takes the statement from her.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Well, we'll find him, one way or
                    another.
          
          Sam nods in acknowledgement. O'Dell sees how much this has
          traumatized her.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Why don't you stop in and see Dr.
                    Peters on your way out... right
                    down the hall there. She'll give
                    you somethin' to make you feel
                    better.
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
          
          Sam walks out of the police station and finds herself in the
          secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti-
          depressants...
          
          A pair of eyes peek out of the bushes close by -- it's
          Vietnam Tom. He's wearing his ski mask and he's got his
          rifle. He sees Sam, but she doesn't see him.
          
          Sam wells up with emotion, about to breakdown, and Tom
          watches her with empathy. It looks as though he's about to go
          to her when something stops him -- Chris comes out the door.
          
                                CHRIS
                    You okay?
          
          Sam is still too choked up to speak. Tom sneaks away
          unnoticed...
          
          
          INT. CHRIS' TRUCK - AFTERNOON
          
          Sam sits in the passenger side of Chris' truck and cries and
          cries. Major emotional release.
          
          Chris looks like he wants to say something, but doesn't have
          the words.
          
          
          I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENING
          
          Chris and Sam pull up to the motel in his pick-up. They've
          gone to get her prescription filled, and Sam has the BOTTLE
          OF PILLS in her hand.
          
                                                                  66.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    I'm really sorry, Sam.
          
          She doesn't respond.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    It's horrible... but sometimes
                    these things can happen for a
                    reason. Sometimes good can come of
                    it... growth, ya know?
          
                              SAM
                    What the fuck are you talking
                    about?
          
          Sam's benumbed expression doesn't change, but her tone is
          caustic.
          
                              CHRIS
                    All I meant was, sometimes-
          
                              SAM
                    I know what you meant, and it's
                    bullshit. When someone dies for no
                    reason you can't just make one up
                    to fill the void and make yourself
                    feel better. It sucks, and it fucks
                    everything up, but it doesn't mean
                    shit beyond that.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I'm sorry, I-
          
                              SAM
                    You've obviously never lost anybody
                    like I have, `cause if you did
                    you'd already know that.
          
          Chris doesn't try anymore. Sam immediately feels bad.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Thanks for the ride.
          
          She gets out of the car and slogs toward her room.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENING
          
          Sam swallows her PILLS with some water, and sits down on one
          of the full-size beds by her BACKPACK...
          
          She reaches inside and pulls out THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME
          TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow. As she studies the cover,
          her image is reflected by the CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS.
          
                                                                  67.
          
          
          The angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections for
          other objects in the room... and Sam's reflection is present
          in both of the panes.
          
          The digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM...
          
          She looks at the PICTURES OF HER FAMILY tucked away inside
          the book: Sam with her mother and father; Sam as a child with
          her sister and brother; an old photo of the whole Darko
          family together...
          
          Tears come to her eyes as she focuses on an image of Donnie,
          and she puts them all down. She touches the SCAR on the inner
          part of her right wrist...
          
          She then glances down and notices that the book is open to:
          CHAPTER NINE - REMNANTS.
          
                              SAM
                    Remnants...
          
          A portion of the text includes: Like Dreams that the
          Manipulated can have after journeys into Tangent or
          Fragmentary Universes, sounds and images may be transferred
          from one Tangent or Fragmentary Universe to another, as all
          corruptions exist on relative cosmic planes...
          
          
          EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT
          
          Sam wanders through the junkyard clad in her HOODED
          SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped
          around her right hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the
          GASH by her temple.
          
          
          SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE JUNKYARD
          
          She sees the junkyard as the phosphorescent DESTINY PLANE.
          DEAD CARS, MACHINERY and piles of SCRAP METAL glow as
          stationary objects within the complex grid. A PAIR OF RATS
          follow their VECTOR SPEARS as they shimmy up the side of a
          RUSTY TRACTOR...
          
          Sam treads effortlessly through the darkness, past the heaps
          of junk toward the decrepit STORAGE SHACK marked by the
          CORRUGATED ROOFING...
          
          
          ANGLE: STORAGE SHACK
          
          She stands before the shack, having discovered Vietnam Tom.
          He squats in the darkened corner of the scrappy shelter, and
          looks back at her through the eyeholes of a new mask --
          
                                                                    68.
          
          
          He wears on his face the SCULPTURE made of SCRAP METAL, which
          has been formed into the COUNTENANCE OF THE MONSTER BUNNY.
          
                              SAM
                    Hi, Tom. I like your new mask.
          
          Tom trembles like the frightened animal he personifies as Sam
          runs her fingers down one of the LONG, METALLIC EARS, down to
          one of the SHARPENED INCISORS of the EVIL-LOOKING GRIN...
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Are you scared?
          
          As this contact is made the tarnished metal becomes
          transparent, and the NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN can be seen
          sending ELECTRIC IMPULSES, in turn RELEASING
          NEUROTRANSMITTERS and exciting OTHER NEURONS...
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    I know you can hear me...
          
          A PORTAL forms around the shelter like a giant cylinder,
          enclosing them. Tom rises, afraid... Sam takes his hand...
          
          The PORTAL shrinks and squeezes the walls until they bend
          inward, then begin to CREAK and RUMBLE --
          
          
          EXT. BENEATH OVERPASS - THE NEXT MORNING
          
          Sam awakens to a fierce RUMBLING overhead.
          
          It happens again, and when she looks around she realizes that
          she's underneath a highway overpass in BOXER SHORTS and a T-
          SHIRT, barefoot, lying on a FLAT AREA atop the CEMENT SLOPE
          that leads down to the road below.
          
          Alarmed by both the height and sanitation of her current
          position, she shifts her body and starts to slide down the
          SLOPE...
          
          Once on even ground, she notices a brand new `95 BMW coming
          toward her.
          
                                 SAM
                    Perfect...
          
          Jeremy pulls up next to her and rolls down his window.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Sam? Are you okay? What are doing?
          
                              SAM
                    I'm... yeah, I'm okay.
          
                                                                    69.
          
          
          Jeremy gets out of the car and puts his hand on her shoulder.
          
                              JEREMY
                    You shouldn't be out here like
                    this. C'mon, get in.
          
          She allows herself to be led to the passenger side...
          
          
          INT. JEREMY'S BMW - MORNING
          
          Sam leans her head back against the headrest as Jeremy
          drives.
          
                              JEREMY
                    You do that a lot?
          
                              SAM
                    I think it's genetic or something.
          
                              JEREMY
                    That's interesting... I've never
                    heard of a specific genetic marker
                    for sleepwalking.
          
                               SAM
                    It's just that my brother used to
                    do it too.
          
                              JEREMY
                    He doesn't anymore?
          
                              SAM
                    No.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I think it's more common in
                    children. When did your brother
                    stop?
          
                              SAM
                    When he died.
          
          
          EXT. FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - MORNING
          
          Some WORKERS are in the process of   rebuilding the WINDMILL. A
          MAN WITH A HOSE sprays the side of   the WATER TANK in an
          attempt to wash off the burn marks   resembling the nearly
          imperceptible image of the MONSTER   BUNNY'S FACE...
          
                                                                   70.
          
          
          I/E. JEREMY'S BMW/MOTEL - MORNING
          
          Jeremy pulls into the motel parking lot. Sam hesitates for a
          moment before getting out.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I heard about your friend...
          
          Sam doesn't say anything, so he goes on.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I wasn't gonna say anything... but
                    then I thought I probably should,
                    because if I didn't, it might be
                    inconsiderate.
          
                              SAM
                    Well... okay. Thanks.
          
          A beat.
          
                              JEREMY
                    So... what are you gonna do?
          
                              SAM
                    I don't know yet.
          
          Sam brushes her mussed hair out of her face, still not
          wanting to go inside the motel room.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Do you believe that everything
                    happens for a reason?
          
                              JEREMY
                    I know that for every action
                    there's an equal and opposite
                    reaction.
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah... I learned that in science.
          
                              JEREMY
                    And everything in the universe is
                    in constant motion, as the universe
                    is constantly expanding...
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah, but do you believe that
                    everything happens for a reason,
                    like in life?
          
                              JEREMY
                    You mean like destiny?
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
          Jeremy thinks on this for a moment.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I think everyone has a purpose.
                    Something they're meant to do. Like
                    potential, but more clear-cut. For
                    instance, I was destined to get my
                    hands on the meteorite.
          
                                 SAM
                    Really.
          
                               JEREMY
                    I'm making amazing discoveries
                    every day, practically sleeping at
                    the lab...
          
          While he talks and becomes more excited he scratches
          nervously at his left forearm. It draws Sam's attention away
          from what he's saying.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I'm still doing some tests, but
                    there's a metallic substance that's
                    not showing up on the elemental
                    CHARTS-
          
                              SAM
                    What happened to your arm?
          
          Jeremy stops scratching. A small area on the inner part of
          his wrist is RAW and RED, partially SCABBED OVER.
          
                              JEREMY
                    It's just a rash.
          
          Sam starts to get out of the car.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Sam, wait. Here...
          
          He offers her a wad of cash. Sam hesitates.
          
                                 SAM
                    BUT-
          
                              JEREMY
                    I know you need it. It's no big
                    deal.
          
          She accepts the money.
          
                                 SAM
                    Thank you.
          
                                                                    72.
          
          
          INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY
          
          Sam shoves a load of her wet clothes into an industrial
          DRYER. She plugs in some quarters, presses the button, and
          sits back in a chair in front of the machine.
          
          As she stares into the whirling cylinder, her eyes defocus
          and she goes into a daze... TRANSITION TO:
          
          
          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - CLOSE UP - TOY UNICORN
          
          ARIEL, the STUFFED TOY UNICORN spins on a ROTATING CHAIR...
          
                              YOUNG SAMANTHA (V.O.)
                    Donnie!
          
                              DONNIE DARKO (V.O.)
                        (MOCKING)
                    The Last Unicorn, by Samantha
                    Darko!
          
                              YOUNG SAMANTHA (V.O.)
                    Give it back!
          
                              DONNIE DARKO (V.O.)
                    There was once a unicorn named
                    Ariel...
          
          The SOUND of CRINKLING PAPER.
          
                              YOUNG SAMANTHA (V.O.)
                    Donnie! You wrinkled it.
          
                              DONNIE DARKO (V.O.)
                    It's not wrinkled Sam. Just, ya
                    know, flatten it in a book or
                    something...
          
          The chair is re-spun by an O.S. hand... and the UNICORN
          topples off onto the floor. BACK TO:
          
          
          INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY
          
          Sam snaps out of her vision when she hears Trudy and Father
          Homeijer going around, asking for change.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Any small amount you could manage
                    would really help.
          
          They hover over a FAT MAN, holding out the COLLECTIONS JAR.
          
                                                                     73.
          
          
                              FAT MAN
                    Piss off...
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    God bless you.
          
          As they move down the line and approach Sam, she tenses up.
          Trudy is about to go into her spiel when she recognizes her.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Oh... hello.
          
          She smiles at Sam politely, trying not to be too awkward. It
          doesn't work.
          
          Aware of Sam's financial situation, she gives Father Homeijer
          the hint to move on. He follows her lead.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                        (to Sam)
                    God bless you.
          
          Sam watches as they move on to the next person, suddenly
          filled with sadness...
          
          
          EXT. PAYPHONE OUTSIDE BUILDING - AFTERNOON
          
          Sam stands outside at a payphone, listening to it RING...
          Someone on the other end finally picks up:
          
                                ROSE DARKO (V.O.)
                    Hello?
          
          When Sam HEARS her MOTHER'S VOICE, it brings tears to her
          eyes. As if feeling her emotion over the phone line, Rose can
          be HEARD starting to WHIMPER.
          
                                ROSE DARKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Samantha?
          
                              EDDIE DARKO (V.O.)
                        (in the background)
                    Who is it, Rose?
          
                               ROSE DARKO (V.O.)
                        (CRYING)
                    Is that you?... if it's you, please
                    come home.
          
                                EDDIE DARKO (V.O.)
                    Rose?
          
          Although it looks like she wants to, Sam doesn't speak.
          
                                                                  74.
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT
          
          Vietnam Tom sits at his new squatting ground, looking out
          over all of El Reno. He peers at the twinkling lights through
          his scrap metal BUNNY MASK, and cradles his RIFLE in his arms
          like a soldier at rest.
          
          He slowly turns and sees that Sam is sitting right next to
          him, facing the landscape. She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT,
          JEANS and the BANDAGE. The SHARD OF METAL is lodged in her
          forehead.
          
                              SAM
                    You wanna know what happens when
                    you die?
          
          Tom shakes his head no.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    I wish it was me.
          
          She looks at Tom.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    I really want... to die.
          
          Tom aims his gun at her face...
          
          He realizes that a FORCE FIELD has formed in between them,
          because when the barrel of the gun touches it, the barrier
          bends and becomes slightly opaque.
          
          Sam is expressionless. Tom's finger trembles as he places it
          on the trigger.
          
          He aims down the gun's sights, directly at Sam's RIGHT EYE,
          and sees a PHOSPHORESCENT GRID take shape like a coordinate
          system on the force field. Sam's eye is in the CENTRAL
          QUADRANT...
          
          Tom pulls the trigger. TIME SLOWS DOWN.
          
          A liquid VECTOR SPEAR shoots out of the gun barrel.
          Immediately after, a BULLET is discharged and follows it...
          
          The VECTOR SPEAR passes cleanly through the grid, but when
          the BULLET reaches it, the entire force field curves to
          accommodate the penetrating force...
          
          The spear juts out until it nearly touches Sam's eye... but
          then it stops. The bullet catches up and freezes at the same
          spot, centimeters from her face --
          
                                                                  75.
          
          
                               SAM (CONT'D)
                        (DISAPPOINTED)
                    Not today.
          
          
          I/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - DAY
          
          A HAND bangs on the door to room 15...
          
          After a beat, Sam opens it. She's got some makeup on, and has
          spent more time on her hair than usual.
          
                                SAM
                          (SURPRISED)
                    Hi.
          
          Chris lingers in front of the door, looking slightly
          uncomfortable.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I just stopped by to see how you
                    were holdin' up.
          
                                SAM
                    I'm okay.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Sorry about the other night... I
                    DIDN'T-
          
                              SAM
                    I was just upset. I shouldn't have
                    snapped at you like that.
          
          Chris nods, grateful for her forgiveness.
          
                              CHRIS
                    So what are you still doin' here? I
                    figured you woulda hopped on a bus
                    by now.
          
                              SAM
                    I'm gonna be taking off soon, I
                    think. I just gotta figure some
                    stuff out. It's quiet here.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I don't know if you're doin'
                    anything later on, but...
          
          He trails off when he HEARS a CAR pull up and park by his
          truck. He turns and sees that it's Jeremy in his BMW.
          
                                                                  76.
          
          
                              SAM
                    I was just on my way out. What were
                    you gonna say?
          
                                 CHRIS
                    Nothin'.
          
                              SAM
                    Okay, well... I'll see you later?
          
                              CHRIS
                    Yeah, sure.
          
          He steps out of the way so Sam can shut and lock the door.
          
                                 SAM
                    Bye.
          
                                 CHRIS
                    Bye.
          
          Chris stares down Jeremy as Sam gets into his car and they
          drive off together.
          
          
          INT. LAB - DAY
          
          Jeremy turns on the overhead florescent lights in the lab.
          There are ROWS OF DESKS with MICROSCOPES and some PRECISION
          ROCK SLICING EQUIPMENT.
          
          As he walks to a desk near the back, he can barely contain
          his excitement. Sam follows, taking note of a LARGE RABBIT in
          an extremely SMALL CAGE...
          
                              JEREMY
                    Here's my station.
          
          He unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and
          retrieves a BOX containing a tiny SLICE OF ROCK with a grid-
          like PATTERN OF METALLIC CRYSTALS embedded in it.
          
                                 SAM
                    That's it?
          
                              JEREMY
                    The rest is locked away somewhere
                    else... somewhere safe. Everyone's
                    gonna want a piece of this thing
                    pretty soon.
          
          He takes it over to an SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE and turns
          it on. He places the meteorite slice in the microscope's
          VACUUM COLUMN through an AIRTIGHT DOOR.
          
                                                                  77.
          
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    You ever seen one of these?
          
                               SAM
                    No.
          
                              JEREMY
                    It's a scanning electron
                    microscope. It uses electrons
                    instead of light to scan the image.
          
          A BLACK & WHITE IMAGE appears on the microscope's MONITOR --
          it's a geometric collage of all shapes and shades.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    At first I thought it was a
                    siderite, but then I saw it was
                    more than that. Much more. It does
                    have a percentage of nickel and
                    iron in it as I first suspected.
                    But it also has something else.
          
          He waits for Sam to take the bait.
          
                              SAM
                    And what's that?
          
          He points to cluster of BRIGHT WHITES on the monitor. Their
          shapes are strangely different than the others surrounding
          them.
          
                              JEREMY
                    An unrecognizable element. I've
                    done all the tests. It doesn't
                    exist on the periodic table.
          
          Jeremy is practically beaming.
          
                              SAM
                    So this is pretty major.
          
                              JEREMY
                    This is history. I'm thinking of
                    calling it framium.
          
                               SAM
                    Framium?
          
                              JEREMY
                    For my last name... Frame.
          
                                                                    78.
          
          
                              SAM
                    What if it's like... proof of some
                    alien life-form from another galaxy
                    or something.
          
          Jeremy's tone becomes serious, and he starts to scratch at
          his left forearm as he talks.
          
                              JEREMY
                    It's very important you promise me
                    you won't tell anyone else what
                    I've showed you. I have to wait
                    till just the right moment. NASA,
                    or some secret government
                    organization could come in here and
                    take it away from me...
          
          As Jeremy gets more worked up, he scratches harder...
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    And then later on, years from now,
                    take credit for the discovery
                    themselves.
          
                              SAM
                    I won't say anything.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Good.
          
          Sam stares at him for a long beat, as if examining him.
          
                              SAM
                    There's this book I think you'd
                    like... I got it from my physics
                    teacher in high school.
          
                              JEREMY
                    The study of physics has unraveled
                    some of the most profound mysteries
                    of the universe.
          
                              SAM
                    It's called The Philosophy of Time
                    Travel.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Time travel?
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah, but it's not really that.
                    It's more like one scenario, or one
                    type of scenario. I don't
                    completely understand it...
          
                                                                     79.
          
          
          Sam gazes at the cluster of white shapes on the monitor.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Another mystery.
          
                              JEREMY
                    What do you mean?
          
                              SAM
                    My life seems to be full of them.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Mysteries are what make life
                    interesting...
          
          Sam doesn't agree or disagree. She's become tense, because
          Jeremy's face is now in close proximity to hers.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    You're a mystery to me, Samantha.
          
          He goes in for a kiss, but Sam gently pushes him away.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Ow...
          
          Jeremy retreats, shielding his left arm. Sam looks down and
          sees that the red, raw area has turned into a much bigger
          RASH, covering a large part of his wrist and extending onto
          his forearm.
          
                              SAM
                    That doesn't look good.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I should get some Hydrocortisone.
          
          He looks pathetic, and Sam feels sorry for him.
          
                               SAM
                        (regarding the attempted
                         KISS)
                    Sorry about that.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I'm sorry. I should've know better.
                    You barely know me, right?
          
                              SAM
                    And nobody really calls my
                    Samantha. Just my mom and dad.
          
          Jeremy manages a smile, and Sam smiles back.
          
                                                                     80.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department
          store...
          
          He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK
          OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke
          break.
          
          
          EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
          
          The TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK carrying the JALOPY breaches the
          crest of the hill, descending on the intersection...
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Chris lights up a cigarette...
          
          
          CHRIS' POV - TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK
          
          He watches as the TRACTOR-TRAILER hits the pothole, but
          passes safely through the intersection, making a right.
          
          Something about the sight of this strikes Chris so much that
          his cigarette falls out of his mouth.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
          
          Father Homeijer and Trudy stroll down a quiet street with
          their COLLECTIONS JAR, and arrive at a fork in the road.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    You take this street, I'll take
                    that one?
          
          Without warning, Trudy kisses him on the cheek.
          
                                 TRUDY
                    Good luck.
          
          Father Homeijer blushes, but Trudy smiles at him in a
          friendly manner. They move off in separate directions...
          
          
          EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - DAY
          
          Father Homeijer raps on the door of Dusty's house. No answer.
          
                                                                  81.
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
          
          The priest lets himself into the garage, which is open but
          deserted. He notices COREY'S CHEVROLET. He steps up to the
          GARAGE ENTRANCE and knocks...
          
          No one comes to the door, but he notices that it's slightly
          ajar.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Dusty?
          
          He can hear COUNTRY MUSIC playing low within.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D)
                    Are you home, son?
          
          He lets himself inside...
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
          
          Father Homeijer walks into the dingy kitchen. The SINK is
          full of DIRTY DISHES. A coating of GRIME over everything.
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, LIVING - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE ON - PIT BULL
          
          The sleeping PIT BULL stirs...
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
          
          The priest sees that the COUNTRY SONG is coming from a STEREO
          that sits on the kitchen counter.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                        (calling out)
                    Dusty? I'd like to trouble you for
                    a small donation...
          
          The COUNTRY SONG comes to a close, and the tape runs out.
          With the music gone, the priest cocks his head to a new sound
          -- soft, distant CRYING.
          
          He looks curiously toward the CELLAR DOOR... [Note: The
          CRYING SOUND should be identical to the one that drew Corey
          out of the motel room.]
          
                                                                     82.
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, BASEMENT - DAY
          
          Father Homeijer slowly descends the rickety BASEMENT STEPS.
          At the bottom, he finds a STRING that connects to a bare
          overhead BULB...
          
          He creeps along the dusty cement floor, past an old
          WASHER/DRYER, continuing toward the source of the CRYING,
          which has become more pronounced. He wrinkles his nose at a
          foul smell...
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Who's there?
          
          He rounds a corner, and when he sees Billy Moorcroft he's
          nearly frozen in shock --
          
          The boy is locked inside a large, METAL DOG'S CAGE. He sits
          on the floor of the cage, rocking back and forth.
          
          He is pale, bruised and slick with sweat, clothed only in a
          pair of SOILED BRIEFS. Beside him is an aluminum WATER BOWL
          and some scraps of WHITE BREAD. The floor beneath him is
          soaked with URINE and scattered FECES.
          
          Father Homeijer makes the sign of the cross.
          
          
          EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - LATER - DAY
          
          Dusty's place is surrounded by FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and
          an AMBULANCE. Billy Moorcroft is wrapped in a blanket and
          being tended to by PARAMEDICS.
          
          Father Homeijer stands near the boy, being interviewed by a
          DETECTIVE.
          
          Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into the back of a
          cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another policeman, OFFICER
          HINES (28).
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Get in there, you sick fuck...
          
          Dusty says nothing as O'Dell shoves him in and slams the
          door...
          
          The two officers turn when they see RANDY'S DAD'S CAR pull up
          next to the property. Randy is in the driver's seat, looking
          confused. Ruth hops out of the passenger seat and darts
          toward the house --
          
          -- but she is cut off and grabbed by a POLICEMAN. ANOTHER
          OFFICER goes to talk to Randy in the car.
          
                                                                   83.
          
          
          Wheels turning, O'Dell addresses Hines:
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                        (regarding Dusty)
                    Let him rot in there for a few
                    minutes, maybe till the news guys
                    show up... I'm gonna go finish
                    checkin' upstairs.
          
          
          INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, RUTH'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          O'Dell lets himself into Ruth's bedroom. It's a mess -- her
          CLOTHES are all over the floor, and crinkled ROCK POSTERS
          litter the walls.
          
          Next to her bed is a FRAMED PICTURE of she and Randy. O'Dell
          starts to rifle through her desk drawers, one after another --
          
          He tosses the closet, throwing out clothes and shoes... until
          he finds the SHOEBOX. He opens it up, satisfied...
          
          
          ANGLE: OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM DOOR
          
          Officer Hines stands by the door, looking in at O'Dell
          covertly.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MORNING
          
          Sam lies in bed in front of the television. A NEWS BULLETIN
          comes on about Billy's Moorcroft's rescue:
          
                              TELEVISION ANCHOR
                    We have an update this morning on
                    our breaking news of Billy
                    Moorcroft, the El Reno youth who
                    was kidnapped over 15 months ago,
                    and rescued yesterday afternoon by
                    Father Homeijer of Mount Calvary
                    Church. Billy's condition at this
                    time is considered stable...
          
          Sam stares at the television, dumbfounded. The news cuts to
          the scene of the rescue, where Father Homeijer is being
          INTERVIEWED:
          
                              FIELD REPORTER
                    Father, what led you to this
                    particular house on this particular
                    day?
          
                                                                  84.
          
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    I was out collecting donations in
                    order to help rebuild my church,
                    Mount Calvary, which recently
                    burned down. Clearly the Lord works
                    in mysterious ways. This is nothing
                    less than divine intervention...
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL - MORNING
          
          As Sam's walking away from the motel, she looks up to the sky
          at a PASSING JET...
          
                              AGATHA (V.O.)
                    No matter how well you think you
                    know somebody, you just never
                    really know...
          
          
          INT. DINER - MORNING
          
          Sam sits at the booth where she and Corey sat before, and
          Agatha sets down a glass of ORANGE JUICE.
          
                              AGATHA
                    Dusty Gibbens has been comin' in
                    here for coffee ever since I can
                    remember... gives me the shivers.
          
          Ted pipes up from behind the counter:
          
                              TED
                    They should hang guys like that.
                    Only thing bothers me is how many
                    of `em are still out there...
          
          Chris enters the diner and catches the end of Ted's rant.
          
                              TED (CONT'D)
                    Hang `em all.
          
                               AGATHA
                        (to Sam)
                    I'll be right back with your
                    breakfast.
          
          As Agatha moves off, Chris sees Sam and approaches her table.
          
                                 CHRIS
                    May I?
          
                                 SAM
                    Sure.
          
                                                                  85.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    I guess you heard.
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah.
          
                              CHRIS
                    It's so messed up... I feel bad
                    that I recommended him now.
          
          Agatha notices that Chris has sat down with Sam.
          
                              AGATHA
                    What can I get you, honey?
          
                              CHRIS
                    Uh... sausage, eggs, coffee,
                    please.
          
                              AGATHA
                    White or wheat?
          
                              CHRIS
                    Wheat toast, please...
          
          He refocuses his attention back on Sam.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    If I had kids, I'd be worried sick
                    about `em in a world like this. I'm
                    sure your parents must be.
          
                              SAM
                    Hey, you could've been some crazy
                    rapist serial killer.
          
          Agatha is there with his coffee just in time to hear this
          last part. She gives Chris and Sam each an odd look before
          setting the coffee down and leaving.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    You turned out okay.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Yeah, but everybody doesn't.
          
                              SAM
                    I can take care of myself.
          
                              CHRIS
                    I'm sure you can... but I wouldn't
                    feel right if I didn't tell you
                    about Jeremy.
          
                                                          86.
          
          
                              SAM
                    What about him?
          
                              CHRIS
                    I don't know what you have goin'
                    with him... but you shouldn't be
                    hangin' around him. Let's just
                    leave it at that.
          
                              SAM
                    What makes you think you can tell
                    me who I can and can't hang around
                    with?
          
                              CHRIS
                    It's just that I know him better
                    than you do. He lived in my
                    neighborhood when we were kids.
          
                              SAM
                    So?
          
                              CHRIS
                    So he used to do weird stuff... to
                    animals.
          
          Sam waits for him to go on.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    My sister lost her pet rabbit once,
                    and we went all over the
                    neighborhood lookin' for it. We
                    were just about to call it quits
                    when we heard something comin' from
                    Jeremy's garage. He'd stuck it in a
                    trash can and put the lid on.
          
          Sam looks shocked and a little disgusted.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    It was half starved by the time we
                    got it home. Died just a few days
                    later.
          
                              SAM
                    How old was he?
          
                              CHRIS
                    I don't know, just a couple years.
                    Cute little black and white-
          
                              SAM
                    No. Jeremy.
          
                                                                  87.
          
          
                              CHRIS
                    He was like nine, probably.
          
                              SAM
                    He was just a kid, he didn't know
                    what he was doing.
          
                              CHRIS
                    When you were nine years old did
                    you know it was wrong to put a
                    living creature in the trash can
                    and leave it there?
          
          Sam's had enough.
          
                              SAM
                    Chris... you're a nice guy, but you
                    don't have to be looking out for
                    me. You're not my dad, you're not
                    my big brother...
          
          Chris hangs his head, frustrated.
          
          
          INT. JAIL CELL - AFTERNOON
          
          O'Dell stands at the bars of Dusty's jail cell. Dusty lies on
          his cot and stares up at the ceiling.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    You know what they do to faggot-ass
                    perverts like you in maximum
                    security, dontcha?
          
          O'Dell chuckles, enjoying this immensely.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Disgusting fuckin' piece a' shit
                    like you...
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - EVENING
          
          O'Dell, now dressed in plainclothes, is on the way to his CAR
          in the far corner of the back lot. He HEARS someone come out
          the door behind him, but doesn't turn until he HEARS his
          VOICE.
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    Hey, O'Dell...
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    I'm on my way out... what do you
                    need?
          
                                                                   88.
          
          
          Hines catches up with him and they walk and talk.
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    I'm not gonna bullshit ya.
          
                               OFFICER O'DELL
                    Okay...
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    I saw you snatch the drugs outta
                    that house.
          
          O'Dell's face grows cold but he doesn't slow his pace.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    I don't think I know what the hell
                    you're talkin' about.
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    Don't bullshit me either...
          
          Hines grabs his shoulder to stop him. O'Dell eyes his hand.
          
                              OFFICER HINES (CONT'D)
                    I don't wanna turn you in.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Then what do you want?
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    How much you think you'll get when
                    you unload it?
          
          O'Dell keeps cool, but resents being muscled.
          
                               OFFICER O'DELL
                    Depends.
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    I'll take forty percent this time,
                    but from now on it's fifty-fifty.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    What do you mean from now on?
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    I got a pretty good idea this ain't
                    the first time you done this. Won't
                    be the last, will it?
          
          Hines extends his hand and smiles. O'Dell shakes it.
          Grudgingly...
          
                                                                  89.
          
          
          After Hines turns on him and jogs back to the station house,
          O'Dell kicks the ground angrily.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Shit!
          
          When he looks up, he's startled by a pair of eyes that peer
          from the bushes nearby. Upon closer inspection, he sees that
          it's Vietnam Tom in his SKI MASK.
          
          Nervous about how much he's heard, O'Dell takes an aggressive
          stance.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Come on outta there. Now!
          
          He becomes tense when Tom emerges, because he sees that he's
          got his RIFLE.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck you doin' carryin'
                    that around in the town proper?
          
          O'Dell realizes that he's not holding it in a threatening
          manner, but cradling it in his arms.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Hand it over. Right now!
          
          Tom steps toward him ever so slowly. O'Dell reaches out and
          Tom hands him the gun, stock first.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    I should arrest you and throw you
                    in jail, you know that? Crazy
                    sonofabitch...
          
          Tom looks at the ground, hunched over meekly.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
                    Get the fuck outta my sight.
          
          O'Dell looks around as Tom shuffles off, making sure no one
          witnessed the transaction.
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT - SUNSET
          
          Sam trudges up the wooded hill to the vantage point, carrying
          The Philosophy of Time Travel book. It's quiet and peaceful,
          and everything's bathed in golden light.
          
                                                                  90.
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - SUNSET
          
          She comes upon Tom's new squatting ground in a secluded area
          near the lookout, and looks around before approaching.
          
          When she sees the handmade BUNNY MASK lying among his things,
          she puts the book under her arm and reaches down to pick it
          up.
          
          She runs her fingers down the long, shiny ears, nose, and
          jagged teeth...
          
          She doesn't realize that Tom is standing close behind her.
          When she senses his presence she's startled.
          
                               SAM
                    Sorry...
          
          She sets the BUNNY MASK down where she found it. Tom says
          nothing. He seems neither surprised nor irritated to find her
          there. He walks up beside her and sits, facing the view.
          
          After a long beat, Sam sits down beside him. To her surprise,
          Tom begins to speak:
          
                               VIETNAM TOM
                    My mom told me someday everybody
                    would understand. She said it was
                    my job to look out for the town...
                    so that's what I do. That's what I
                    always do.
          
          Sam listens to him intently.
          
                              VIETNAM TOM (CONT'D)
                    They don't know why. They don't
                    even want me here, but I still have
                    to protect them.
          
                              SAM
                    They're lucky to have someone to
                    protect them.
          
                              VIETNAM TOM
                    I'm used to it... I'm lucky to have
                    a job to do. Some people don't have
                    any reason to be here at all.
          
                              SAM
                    I know what you mean...
          
          Tom turns and looks at her strangely.
          
                                                                  91.
          
          
                              VIETNAM TOM
                    You're more important than all of
                    us.
          
          Sam peers into Tom's pale blue eyes through his ski mask.
          Without knowing why, she reaches out and touches the mask...
          
          When she starts to pull it off Tom grabs her hand, stopping
          her -- not too rough, but forceful.
          
          Sam's scared for a moment, but Tom lets her go. His eyes
          drift down to The Philosophy of Time Travel book by her side.
          Sam sees him staring, so she picks it up and hands it to him.
          
          When Tom sees the cover, his cold eyes are filled with
          emotion. Sam sees how struck he is, but doesn't understand.
          
                              SAM
                    Do you like to read?
          
          Tom says nothing.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    You can borrow it...
          
          Again, Tom does not speak. After a beat, Sam gets up slowly
          and walks away, leaving Tom with the book.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
          
          Jeremy is at the department store in the FIRST AID SECTION,
          picking out some GAUZE and DISINFECTANT. When he looks down
          the aisle and sees Sam, he moves toward her quickly...
          
          He disturbs her while she's looking at some FEMININE HYGIENE
          PRODUCTS.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Sam...
          
          When he sees the items that she's shopping for, he seems much
          more embarrassed than she does.
          
                              SAM
                    Oh, hi Jeremy.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Hi... sorry.
          
                              SAM
                    That's okay, what's up?
          
                                                           92.
          
          
                               JEREMY
                    Nothing... just that I haven't see
                    you around for the past few days. I
                    was worried. I thought you might've
                    taken off.
          
                              SAM
                    No... I've been around. Going for
                    lots of walks.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I stopped by the motel.
          
          Sam finds his manner a bit odd.
          
                              SAM
                    Like I said, I've been in and out.
          
                               JEREMY
                    Well, there's something I wanted to
                    ask you. You know that book you
                    mentioned?
          
                              SAM
                    Yeah...
          
                              JEREMY
                    I'd really love to check it out.
          
                              SAM
                    Oh...
          
          Sam's face darkens, and Jeremy picks up on it.
          
                              JEREMY
                    You said you'd show it to me
                    sometime, and I've got a hunch it
                    could really help me in some of my
                    studies related to-
          
                              SAM
                    I don't have it anymore.
          
                              JEREMY
                    What?
          
                              SAM
                    I kind of... gave it to someone.
          
                              JEREMY
                    To who? Why?
          
                                                                    93.
          
          
                              SAM
                    I'm sorry. I just... forgot that I
                    said you could borrow it, and this
                    GUY-
          
                                JEREMY
                    What guy?
          
                              SAM
                    Well... that Vietnam Tom guy.
          
          Jeremy is furious.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Vietnam Tom!? You gave away the
                    book to Vietnam Tom!?
          
          Sam backs away from him. He's getting louder and out of
          control.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I don't fucking believe what you're
                    telling me!
          
                              SAM
                    It's just a book...
          
                              JEREMY
                    He's a fucking bum! And you chose
                    him over me!?
          
                              SAM
                    No... I just-
          
          Suddenly, a hand comes down on Jeremy's shoulder. He turns
          and finds Chris standing behind him.
          
                              CHRIS
                    That's enough.
          
          Sam is relieved. Jeremy glares at Chris.
          
                              JEREMY
                    This is none of your business.
          
                              CHRIS
                    It is, actually. You're disturbing
                    my customers. Get out.
          
          Jeremy brushes past Sam as he leaves, and she and Chris are
          left alone. There's a definite "I told you so" aura.
          
                                                                  94.
          
          
                              SAM
                        (MUTTERING)
                    You didn't have to do that.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Just doin' my job.
          
          Sam starts to walk away, at first forgetting the products she
          needed. She comes back to get them, slightly flustered. Chris
          turns and leaves her in peace.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        (as he's walking away)
                    You're welcome.
          
          
          INT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Father Homeijer and Trudy are sitting on the couch in the
          living room of his quaint house, sharing a BOTTLE OF
          CHAMPAGNE.
          
                              TRUDY
                    I never had any doubts in you, or
                    in the Lord.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER
                    I know that. And we both truly
                    appreciate all your faith and hard
                    work...
          
          They sip their champagne. Trudy glows.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D)
                    We needed a miracle, but we got two
                    instead.
          
          Trudy grabs the bottle and tries to refill his glass, but the
          priest puts his hand over it.
          
                              FATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D)
                    I think I've had enough.
          
                              TRUDY
                    One more glass won't hurt you. You
                    deserve it, Father...
          
          
          I/E. O'DELL'S CAR/ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          O'DELL'S CAR pulls up to an old warehouse and parks.
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    Where the hell are they?
          
                                                                  95.
          
          
          Hines is nervous. He lights a cigarette.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    They'll be here. Just take it easy.
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT
          
          Tom wears his metal BUNNY MASK. Sam wears her HOODED
          SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, and her right hand is BANDAGED. The
          METAL SHARD is embedded under the skin of her forehead...
          
          They move slowly and methodically until they reach the center
          of the empty lot. There are lights on in the closed
          department store, but the parking lot is mostly dark.
          
                              VIETNAM TOM
                    Why do you talk to me?
          
          TOM'S VOICE is MUFFLED behind his mask.
          
                              SAM
                    Same reason you talk to me...
          
          Tom cocks his head, unsure of the answer.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Because I can see how special you
                    are.
          
                              VIETNAM TOM
                    Why can't other people?
          
                              SAM
                    They will. Only one day left.
          
          They both turn toward an area in the lot where the SHOPPING
          CARTS are stored. The METAL STORAGE RACK starts to tremble
          and burn with COSMIC ENERGY...
          
          
          INT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Father Homeijer finishes his glass of champagne. Trudy is
          already done with hers, and she takes his glass and sets it
          on the coffee table. She moves closer to him on the couch...
          
                               FATHER HOMEIJER
                    Trudy...
          
          She puts her hand on his leg.
          
                                                                    96.
          
          
                              TRUDY
                    I see the way you look at me,
                    Father...
          
          She moves in closer... He looks uncomfortable.
          
                              TRUDY (CONT'D)
                    I want you too.
          
          She's about to kiss him, but Father Homeijer stops her.
          
                              TRUDY (CONT'D)
                    I can't do this. I'm a man of the
                    cloth... and you'd regret it.
          
          He takes her by the hand, reminding her of the WEDDING BAND
          on her finger.
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT
          
          SHOPPING CARTS start to roll out of the RACK by themselves,
          following their own liquid VECTOR SPEARS.
          
          Tom stands staring at them. He is flanked by Sam...
          
          
          EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Officer Hines walks to the edge of the woods beside the
          warehouse and unzips his pants...
          
          
          ANGLE: O'DELL'S CAR
          
          With GLOVED HANDS, O'Dell grabs VIETNAM TOM'S RIFLE out of
          the trunk...
          
          
          INT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Trudy's head is buried in her hands and she bawls.
          
                              TRUDY
                    I feel like such an idiot...
          
          Father Homeijer doesn't know what to say.
          
          
          EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Hines finishes relieving himself and comes out into the open
          from the side of the building. O'Dell is waiting for him.
          
                                                                    97.
          
          
                              OFFICER HINES
                    What the fuck-
          
          BOOM!
          
          O'Dell shoots him in the chest. He is cool and calm. He
          throws the rifle down on the ground...
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT
          
          The SHOPPING CARTS whirl in an circle of ever-increasing
          speed around Vietnam Tom and Sam. The RUBBER WHEELS squeal on
          the cement until they start to melt...
          
          The VECTOR SPEARS lead the carts in a spiral that hones in
          closer and closer to the two of them. Sam is stoic. Tom is in
          awe...
          
          
          EXT. THE ETHER - NIGHT - POV INSIDE PORTAL
          
          We travel at breath-taking speed through a PORTAL as it
          weaves through millions of STARS, then an ATMOSPHERIC
          BARRIER...
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT
          
          When it looks like they'll be crushed by the scudding metal,
          or combusted by the cosmic energy, the WORM-LIKE PORTAL from
          the sky reaches down and encloses Tom and Sam like a vacuum.
          
          There's a brilliant FLASH OF LIGHT -- TRANSITION TO:
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THE NEXT MORNING
          
          CHRIS' TRUCK pulls into the lot early in the morning, and he
          gets out wearing his work uniform. Still groggy, he's about
          to walk into the store when something catches his eye...
          
          CRANE UP to FIND a STRUCTURE made of all the SHOPPING CARTS,
          as chilling and impressive as a crop circle, in the shape of
          an immense FIBONACCI SPIRAL. The metal of the carts has been
          fused together, and they're stacked in an ascending manner
          that reaches an apex in the center, like a cone.
          
          Chris is mystified... CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. STREET - DAY
          
          Two POLICE CRUISERS speed down a street in town...
          
                                                                  98.
          
          
          EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON
          
          COPS, including Officer O'Dell, converge on Vietnam Tom in
          the park, where he sits on the SWING in his ski mask...
          
                              COP #1
                    Get down on the ground!
          
          Tom looks up at them calmly, without fear.
          
                              COP #1 (CONT'D)
                    Get down on the ground, now!
          
          He obeys them and two Cops jump on him and put him in cuffs.
          One of them pulls up his head and rips off his ski mask --
          
          Tom's face is a mass of SCARS. Both his cheeks, forehead and
          chin are marred by scar tissue born from long, deep gashes.
          
          O'Dell looks into his sad, blue eyes...
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION, VARIOUS - AFTERNOON
          
          Tom is slammed against a table. An OFFICER takes his hand
          roughly and sticks his fingers into some ink to take his
          prints -- JUMP CUT TO:
          
                                 POLICEMAN (V.O.)
                    Name?
          
          Tom stands for his booking photos -- JUMP CUT TO:
          
                              POLICEMAN (CONT'D)
                        (getting angry)
                    What's your name?
          
          The POLICEMAN stands over Vietnam Tom, who sits defeated in a
          chair. A YOUNG OFFICER approaches.
          
                              YOUNG OFFICER
                    We found this on him...
          
          He passes the Policeman a set of DOG TAGS on a CHAIN. The
          name on the tags is: THOMAS WARD SPARROW.
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL - EVENING
          
          Sam walks toward the motel, wearing JEANS and a T-SHIRT...
          
          When she sees JEREMY'S BMW parked in the lot she stops short.
          But it's too late -- he's already seen her and is getting out
          of the car. He's got a bouquet of FLOWERS.
          
                                                          99.
          
          
                                 JEREMY
                    Hi, Sam...
          
          He passes her the flowers.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I hope you can forgive the way I
                    acted.
          
                              SAM
                    That was pretty weird.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I know. I just...
          
          Jeremy is awkward and shy.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I've been so wrapped up with the
                    meteorite. I haven't been eating or
                    sleeping much. I think I'm just
                    drained... but that's no excuse.
          
                              SAM
                    It's alright.
          
                              JEREMY
                    I was wondering if you'd let me
                    make it up to you.
          
                              SAM
                    You don't need to-
          
                              JEREMY
                    Please... let me take you to watch
                    the fireworks tonight.
          
                              SAM
                    I don't think so.
          
                              JEREMY
                    It's gonna be spectacular. There's
                    gonna be a meteor shower that
                    coincides with the show... I mean,
                    how often does that happen?
          
          Sam still isn't sure.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    I just wanna be your friend.
          
                              SAM
                    I was supposed to see `em with
                    Chris, but... he's stuck at work.
          
                                                                   100.
          
          
                              JEREMY
                    So, what do you say? Will you go
                    with me?
          
                              SAM
                    Gimme a sec. Lemme grab my
                    sweatshirt...
          
          Jeremy beams.
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING
          
          Chris is in the department store parking lot with a crew of
          EMPLOYEES. They work together to pry apart the numerous
          SHOPPING CARTS with CROWBARS. They've made some progress, but
          still a long way to go.
          
          Chris is distracted by JEREMY'S BMW as it cruises through the
          nearby intersection...
          
          After it passes, Chris looks up at some OMINOUS CLOUDS
          congregating in the darkening sky.
          
          From the CLOUDS above the store -- PAN DOWN TO FIND:
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT - EVENING
          
          The lookout, and Jeremy's car riding up the hill. There are
          OTHER CARS parked to watch the upcoming display, but Jeremy
          drives to a more SECLUDED AREA... (Music suggestion: 4th of
          July, by Soundgarden.)
          
          
          EXT. WOODED GROVE NEARBY - EVENING
          
          Jeremy spreads a blanket on the ground of a private grove. He
          wears a LIGHT JACKET, and sets down a GROCERY BAG. Sam has
          her HOODED SWEATSHIRT tied around her waist.
          
                              SAM
                    Shouldn't we go back out there
                    where we can see?
          
                              JEREMY
                    No, this'll be perfect. See right
                    there?
          
          He points to an area near the tops of the trees.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    That's right where the fireworks'll
                    come up.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                 101.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    And we can see the meteors better
                    without all the lights from the
                    town.
          
          Sam sits down on the blanket and checks her watch. Jeremy
          pokes around in the grocery bag.
          
                              SAM
                    So what's in the bag?
          
                              JEREMY
                    You'll see...
          
          Sam takes her HOODED SWEATSHIRT from around her waist and
          puts it on to fight the cold...
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    There's one!
          
          Sam spots a METEOR as it streaks across the sky --
          
          
          EXT. WOODED GROVE NEARBY - LATER - NIGHT
          
          JEREMY'S HAND holds a flaring ROMAN CANDLE --
          
                              JEREMY (O.S.)
                    Here it goes!
          
          A SPARKLING GREEN BALL shoots out of the stick into the air.
          Sam looks up at it and smiles. Jeremy shoots off colorful
          ball after ball, aiming in different directions.
          
                              SAM
                    They're pretty.
          
          After his stick fizzles out:
          
                              JEREMY
                    You wanna try one?
          
          Sam shrugs... He grabs another out of the grocery bag, and
          Sam gets up slowly. He passes her the ROMAN CANDLE, and she
          accepts it with her RIGHT HAND...
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Just hold it straight up.
          
          Sam holds it and Jeremy flicks his LIGHTER. The WICK
          catches...
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    It's goin'!
          
                                                                   102.
          
          
          Sam smiles and holds the stick as far away from her face as
          possible. She closes her eyes...
          
          But the wick burns down extremely fast. The FIRST BALL gets
          stuck at the top and implodes, causing the whole thing to
          catch fire.
          
                               SAM
                    Ow!
          
                               JEREMY
                    Drop it!
          
          He runs over and stamps it out as quickly as he can...
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Fucking faulty one...
          
          Sam nurses her burned hand.
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Are you okay?
          
                              SAM
                    I think so...
          
          Jeremy inspects her hand -- there's a large BLISTER.
          
                              JEREMY
                    You need to get that covered...
          
          Jeremy takes off his jacket. He then removes his T-shirt and
          starts to tear off a piece.
          
                              SAM
                    What are you doing?
          
                              JEREMY
                    It's okay...
          
          
          EXT. BANK - NIGHT
          
          The bank sign shows 8:59 PM. The display flashes to: JULY 4,
          1995... It changes to the countdown: 00 DAYS, 00 HOURS, 00
          MINUTES, 03 SECONDS... 02 SECONDS... 01 SECONDS...
          
          
          EXT. WOODED GROVE NEARBY - NIGHT
          
          Jeremy finishes wrapping the piece of his T-shirt around
          Sam's hand, creating the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE.
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
                              JEREMY
                    How's it feel?
          
                              SAM
                    A little better...
          
          The FIREWORKS suddenly begin, and fill the sky above the
          grove with bursts of bright, multi-colored lights. Sporadic
          METEORS rain down at the same time. It's magnificent.
          
          After a beat, Sam looks over at Jeremy...
          
          The fireworks illuminate his torso, and she is appalled to
          see that the raw, reddish RASH has spread to cover the
          greater part of it.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    Good God...
          
          Jeremy looks down as if he'd forgotten, then quickly picks up
          his jacket and puts it back on.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                        (ALARMED)
                    Is that from the meteorite?
          
                              JEREMY
                    I barely even notice it anymore.
                    I'm sure it'll go away soon.
          
          He zips up his jacket tight.
          
                              SAM
                    Are you fucking kidding me?
          
                              JEREMY
                    Do you think I'm disgusting?
          
          The question takes Sam by surprise.
          
                              SAM
                    No... I just think you should get
                    it looked at-
          
          Before Sam can finish, Jeremy crams his mouth into hers for a
          forceful kiss...
          
          Sam shoves him away sharply.
          
                              SAM (CONT'D)
                    What the hell are you doing?
          
                                                                   104.
          
          
                              JEREMY
                    So you do find me disgusting. Which
                    is it, Sam, I can't take much more
                    of this shit!
          
                              SAM
                    Jesus Christ...
          
          He tries to grab her, but Sam turns and runs --
          
                                 JEREMY
                    Come here!
          
          
          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
          
          Sam tears through the woods, Jeremy close behind her. The
          FIREWORKS CRACK and POP in the sky above...
          
                                 JEREMY
                    Sam! Stop!
          
          Sam jumps over a fallen log in the dark... Jeremy hits it
          dead on with his shins and goes head over heels --
          
                                 JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    FUCK!
          
          He picks himself up and charges even faster --
          
          
          INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
          
          Tom sits alone in his jail cell, morose, staring at the
          floor. He looks up when he senses someone approaching...
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT
          
          Sam sprints by the area of Vietnam Tom's squatting ground.
          FIREWORKS continue to EXPLODE and shower overhead, and some
          PEOPLE can be HEARD LAUGHING and SHOUTING from the main
          parking area, not far away...
          
          Sam runs toward the VOICES --
          
          But Jeremy grabs her from behind and spins her around!
          
                              SAM
                    Why are you doing this?
          
                              JEREMY
                    I just wanna talk to you!
          
                                                                 105.
          
          
          She struggles against his grip. The EXPLOSIONS and the RUCKUS
          from CROWD mask their noise.
          
                               JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Stop it!
          
          Sam raises her knee and connects hard with his groin. He
          starts to double over, but recovers quickly and smacks her
          across the face --
          
                              JEREMY (CONT'D)
                    Fucking bitch!
          
          Sam is stunned, and Jeremy takes her by the shoulders and
          shoves her hard --
          
          Sam stumbles backwards and falls, cracking her head on the
          metal BUNNY MASK. She rolls over onto her back, REVEALING the
          SHARD OF METAL that protrudes from the GASH by her temple...
          
          She struggles no more.
          
          
          INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
          
          Tom stands in his cell to meet the entity that approaches...
          
          
          EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT
          
          Chris and the other Employees stop working and look up at the
          sky, now roiling with sinister, SUPERNATURAL CLOUDS...
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT
          
          Jeremy slowly creeps to where Sam lies... Her eyes are open
          and she is completely still.
          
                               JEREMY
                    Sam?...
          
          Jeremy crouches beside her, and when he puts two fingers to
          her neck to feel for a pulse, he starts to tremble...
          
          The raining METEORS and FIREWORKS illuminate the SMOKE and
          the BLACK CLOUDS overhead...
          
          
          INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
          
          Vietnam Tom walks up to the CELL BARS...
          
          He comes face to face with Sam.
          
                                                                  106.
          
          
          She stares back at him through the bars from the other side.
          She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and the BANDAGE. Light glints
          off the METAL lodged in her HEAD WOUND.
          
          
          I/E. JEREMY'S BMW/LOOKOUT - NIGHT
          
          Jeremy speeds frantically down the hill, away from the
          parking area and the continuing fireworks display. Tears
          stream down his cheeks...
          
          He cuts the wheel when a pair of HEADLIGHTS blind him and a
          vehicle cuts him off. His car skids out, and he sees it's
          CHRIS' TRUCK that has almost hit him.
          
          Chris jumps out, yanks open Jeremy's door and grabs him by
          the shirt collar. He yells over the FIREWORKS:
          
                              CHRIS
                    Where the hell is Sam?
          
                              JEREMY
                        (FRANTIC)
                    I don't know... I don't know...
          
          Jeremy stomps on the gas pedal, and Chris is forced to unhand
          him as his BMW navigates around the truck and barrels down
          the hill...
          
          
          EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - LATER - NIGHT
          
          As Chris approaches Vietnam Tom's squatting ground, the
          FIREWORKS DISPLAY is in the midst of the GRANDE FINALE.
          Showers of light BURST and CRACKLE in steady succession.
          PEOPLE SCREAM in approval from the parking area nearby...
          
          Chris comes upon Sam's lifeless form.
          
                              CHRIS
                    No...
          
          He stoops by her, picks her up and hugs her limp body
          close...
          
          As he does this, Vietnam Tom approaches from behind him.
          Chris turns to face him but says nothing, still holding Sam.
          The WIND picks up and blows in gusts around them...
          
          Tom looks down at the two of them for a moment, then reaches
          down and picks up his BUNNY MASK. The EVIL GRIN is red with
          SAM'S BLOOD, and one of the teeth is missing...
          
                                                                    107.
          
          
          The last of the fireworks display occurs, leaving the night
          full of SMOKE, HELLISH CLOUDS and an increasing number of
          bright-tailed METEORS -- the APOCALYPSE.
          
          Amongst the churning clouds, a tornado-like PORTAL cuts
          through the sky and touches down somewhere in the town. It's
          swirling and vast, stretching down from limitless space...

          45 minutes... 6 seconds...      45 minutes... 6 seconds...
          
          And focuses on a single METEOR that plummets toward the
          yawning VORTEX, using telekinetic power to guide it...

          INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
          
          Sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the
          blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over
          and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed.
          
          TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the
          nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed. The
          CLOCK/RADIO reads 3:30 AM.
          
          
          EXT. WINDMILL PLATFORM - NIGHT
          
          Vietnam Tom sits atop the platform, more than 30 feet up,
          wearing his ski mask and holding his rifle. The surface of
          the platform is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER
          BOTTLE, CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP.
          
          Relaxed and at peace, Tom looks up to the clear night sky. As
          a TREMOR starts to build, he takes off his ski mask and gazes
          out over his town...
          
          He smiles.
          
          Suddenly, there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT --
          deafening THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION -- CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - THE NEXT MORNING
          
          Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER
          about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits
          of wood and metal strewn everywhere. Ground water spurts from
          the broken well seal.
          
          A cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the
          crater...
          
          Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite as Sam and O'Dell arrive
          on the scene. There are PARAMEDICS, a CORONER and other
          POLICEMEN there as well, and a large area has been cordoned
          off with POLICE TAPE.
          
                                                                 109.
          
          
          Corey is there looking on, as well as Chris Holt, Phil
          Coulter, and other local CITIZENS. TOM'S REMAINS are carried
          off in a BLACK BAG...
          
                              SAM
                    Oh my God...
          
          Sam moves to stand by Corey. The overall mood is grim, and
          Frank stands peering at the wreckage with a long face.
          
                              FRANK
                    I don't believe it...
          
          The Firemen drop the porous, misshapen clod by his feet.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    This is just a tragedy.
          
          Officer O'Dell steps up beside him and kicks the meteorite
          with his boot.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                    Sell that thing off to some
                    meteorologist nerd club, I bet you
                    could do okay.
          
                              FRANK
                    Do I look like the type of guy
                    that's gonna try and profit off
                    another man's death? You should be
                    ashamed of yourself.
          
                              OFFICER O'DELL
                        (EMBARRASSED)
                    I was just sayin'...
          
          Sam looks down on the ground and sees Tom's multi-colored SKI
          MASK...
          
          She picks it up.
          
                              COREY
                    What are you doing?
          
          As she caresses the fibers with her fingers, she is filled
          with unwarranted emotion...
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL - MORNING
          
          Sam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when
          they turn and see that Chris has followed them.
          
                                                                 110.
          
          
                                 CHRIS
                    Hey...
          
                                 SAM
                    Hey.
          
                              CHRIS
                    So you guys stayed here last night?
          
                              COREY
                    One of us did.
          
          Sam gives Corey a look. Chris decides to ignore the comment.
          
                              CHRIS
                    What's up with your car?
          
                              COREY
                    It's gonna take a couple days.
          
                              CHRIS
                    For a water pump?
          
          Sam and Corey shrug.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    It's none of my business, but...
          
          He's distracted when JEREMY'S BMW pulls up and parks. He hops
          out and hustles across the field toward the crash site...
          
                                 SAM
                    What?
          
          Chris regains his train of thought:
          
                              CHRIS
                    I was just gonna say, if you
                    wanted, I could give you a ride
                    back.
          
          He looks right at Sam when he says this. He then glances over
          at Corey, as if just remembering that she were there.
          
                              CHRIS (CONT'D)
                    You too. I mean, I could give you
                    both a ride.
          
                              COREY
                    To Middlesex, Virginia? Do you-
          
                              SAM
                        (INTERRUPTING)
                    I'll go.
          
                                                                 111.
          
          
                              COREY
                        (PISSED)
                    What?
          
                              SAM
                    I think I wanna go.
          
                              COREY
                    Things get a little tough, you're
                    just gonna give up?
          
                              SAM
                    It's not like that... You should
                    come too.
          
                              COREY
                    Fuck that. I'll wait for my car and
                    stick to the plan. Do whatever the
                    fuck you want.
          
          Corey turns and goes inside the room.
          
                               SAM
                    Corey...
          
          Sam looks back to Chris, who is uncomfortable for causing the
          conflict.
          
                              CHRIS
                    Sorry to screw you guys up.
          
                              SAM
                    It's alright. She can take care of
                    herself... she's good at it. I've
                    gotta go home.
          
          
          INT. FRANK'S BARN - DAY
          
          The METEORITE sits in a dark corner of the barn, collecting
          dust...
          
          
          INT. CHRIS' TRUCK - DAY
          
          Sam leans her head against the window of Chris' truck as they
          cruise along the highway...
          
          She gazes up at the bright, open sky.
          
          
          
          THE END

                                  James Wan & Leigh Whannell


 
               Darkness.

               The soft sound of moving water can be heard in the background. 
               From the top of the screen a tiny, floating light moves its way 
               downwards across the screen. As it passes, we see just under 
               the water part of a young mans face. His eyes are closed. The 
               light disappears, and across the darkness appears the title S 
               A W. The title fades away.
 
               The tiny light appears again, this time floating down at the 
               end of a tub of water, just near someones bare foot. The camera 
               cuts again to the face of the young man underwater. This is ADAM. 
               Suddenly, his eyes fly open and he comes to life, opening his 
               mouth and gasping for air. As he wakes up and struggles within 
               the bathtub, we see his foot catch on a drain plug, unplugging 
               it. The water starts to drain, and we see go with the water the 
               tiny light, which we can also see has some kind of key attached 
               to it. The room itself is pitch black, but we can still just 
               barely make him out in the dark. Adam lifts himself out of the 
               tub and falls onto the floor, coughing and gasping from the shock. 
               He manages to get to his feet, but as he moves forward he realizes 
               that his ankle is chained to something. He feels his way over 
               to a pipe in the corner, reaching down and pulling at his chain 
               that is attached to it. He cries out, his voice frantic, frightened, 
               and a bit hysterical.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Help! Someone help me! (He stops when 
                         he hears a loud dragging sound somewhere 
                         in the room. He looks out into the darkness 
                         and calls out.) Is someone there? Hey! 
                         (He turns back to the corner to which 
                         he is chained, says in a slightly softer 
                         but still panicked voice) Shit, Im 
                         probably dead.
 
               Suddenly, from out within the darkness comes a mans low, raspy 
               voice. It startles Adam. The voice, we will soon learn, belongs 
               to LAWRENCE.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Youre not dead.

               Adam quickly turns in the direction of the voice. Holding his 
               arms out for balance, he tries to look across the room to whoever 
               is speaking, but still cannot see a thing.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Whos that? Whos that?!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (his voice strangely a bit on the calm 
                         side, and almost irritated with Adams 
                         reaction to the situation. This shall 
                         be his tone for many scenes to come.) 
                         Theres no point in yelling, I already 
                         tried it.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Turn on the lights!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Would if I could.

                                     ADAM
                         What the fuck is going on? Where am 
                         I? (He turns into his corner, touching 
                         the wall.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         I dont know yet.

                                     ADAM
                         (smelling something; in disgust) What 
                         is that smell?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Shh! Hang on a second, I think I found 
                         something.
 
               With a loud click and an even louder buzzing sound, the very 
               bright fluorescent lights come to life, lighting up in rows, 
               starting from Lawrences end and moving towards Adam. As they 
               come on, Adam is nearly blinded by the sudden change from pitch 
               black to bright white and squints in pain, holding up his arms 
               to cover his face. In the light we now see that he is in his 
               mid-twenties, with short brown hair, wearing a dark blue striped 
               shirt over a white tee shirt and jeans, looking like a drowned 
               rat from the tub. It takes him a moment but his eyes finally 
               start to adjust, and he looks around the room. He and we see 
               Lawrence, who also winces from the glare of the lights, standing 
               by the light switch and the door. He is on the opposite end of 
               the room, also chained to a pipe in the corner by his foot. He 
               wears a blue button-down dress shirt, now soaked with sweat stains. 
               He is middle aged, mid to late forties, with pale blonde hair 
               and even paler skin. Dark circles are under his eyes. Both men 
               are barefoot.
 
               Lawrences eyes adjust to the light and he sees across the room. 
               Then, his gaze starts towards the center of the room, as does 
               Adams, who steps forward as much as he can, a look of horror 
               on his face. We see lying face down the body of a man who has 
               blown his brains out, lying in a pool of blood, clad in only 
               boxer shorts and a tee shirt. In his left hand is a gun, in his 
               right hand is a micro cassette recorder. A gunshot and a scream 
               are heard as the camera moves up and in a fast 360° angle above 
               and circling the man, ending in a full overhead view of him.
 
               
               The shot cuts to Adam, who reels in shock and disgust.

                                     ADAM
                         Holy shit!

               He turns towards the tub and leans over, gagging and coughing. 
               Lawrence in the meantime hops forward the best he can, studying 
               the body with a look of fear and concern. Adam stops coughing 
               and turns back around, takes another look at the body and around 
               the room. He looks down at his chain then starts to completely 
               freak out, grabbing and pulling at his chain.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (screaming) HELP!!! (He falls back onto 
                         his bottom on the floor as he yanks 
                         at the chain as hard as he can.) HELP!!! 
                         Help!
 
               Lawrence just stands and watches him with an almost embarrassed, 
               appalled look at his behaviour. It seems that Lawrence, despite 
               being in the situation hes in, is above that kind of uncontrolled 
               reaction. He speaks a bit coldly.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         No one can hear you.

               Adam stops pulling at the chain, stands up and looks to Lawrence, 
               his breathing fast and heavy. His voice is not yelling anymore 
               but still just as hysterical.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What the fuck is this?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Calm down, just calm down. (He knows 
                         that to remain calm is to remain in 
                         control, something he must be no matter 
                         what the situation.) Are you hurt?
 
                         
               Adam looks down at himself, shrugging slightly.

                                     ADAM
                         I dont know...yeah!

               Lawrence moves over to the pipe in the corner, leaning against 
               it for support.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (calmly) Whats your name?

                                     ADAM
                         (sarcastic) My name is Very Fucking 
                         Confused! (demanding) Whats your name? 
                         Whats going on here?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (internal eye roll; hes getting more 
                         and more aggravated with Adams behaviour) 
                         My name is Lawrence Gordon, Im a doctor. 
                         I just woke up here, just like you. 
                         (He reaches up, wipes his face with 
                         his sleeve)
 
               Adam kneels back down facing the pipe, pulling at his chains 
               once more, but not with his prior panic. He winces at the metal 
               biting into his skin.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (in pain) Ah!

               Lawrence looks at Adam with a look that seems to say Im stuck 
               in here with THIS guy? He then glances down at the body.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Recognize him?

               Adam continues to pull at his chains, does not and will not look 
               at the body, just shakes his head.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (sharply) No.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (trying to get SOMETHING out of this 
                         kid) Well, do you have any idea how 
                         you got here?
 
                                     ADAM
                         No.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Whats the last thing you remember?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         Nothing. (he sits back onto the floor, 
                         stops pulling at his chains for a moment.) 
                         I went to bed in my shithole apartment, 
                         and woke up in an actual shithole. (He 
                         raises his left leg slightly, starts 
                         trying to pull his foot out of the iron 
                         cuff. He glances to Lawrence, who has 
                         moved over to the wall to his left, 
                         bent over slightly and resting a hand 
                         against a pipe.) So what about you, 
                         huh?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (He shrugs slightly, shaking his head.) 
                         Well theres...theres not much to tell, 
                         really. (Across the room, Adam gives 
                         up with the chain for the time being 
                         but remains sitting on the floor.) I 
                         was on my way home from work and uh, 
                         I dont remember anything else.
 
               Adam just sits there, glancing over to the body and then focusing 
               on it much more. The initial panic has worn off for now, replaced 
               simply with fear and shock. His voice is a bit softer.
 
                                     ADAM
                         First dead body Ive ever seen. Look 
                         different in real life. They dont move.
 
                         
               Lawrence slowly lowers himself into a sitting position against 
               the wall. He pokes slightly at the iron cuff around his foot.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         From the looks of these chains, someone 
                         didnt want us to go very far either.
 
                         
               Suddenly, Adam leaps up, lifting up his shirt and exposing his 
               abdomen. His panic is back, but not at full force like before. 
               He studies himself then glances to Lawrence.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Can you see any scars?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (looking at him strangely) What?

                                     ADAM
                         Huh? This is what they do man, (he gestures 
                         to his stomach, where there are in fact 
                         no scars.) They kidnap you and drug 
                         you and before you know it, youre in 
                         a bathtub and your kidneys are on eBay. 
                         (A ridiculous theory to us and to Lawrence, 
                         but Adam states it with conviction.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a scoffing tone in his voice) No one 
                         has taken your kidneys.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (disbelief) How can you tell from way 
                         over there?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (matter of fact) Because youd either 
                         be in terrible agony, or youd be dead 
                         by now. Trust me.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What are you, a surgeon? (He lowers 
                         his shirt and turns and bends down to 
                         prod at the chain around the pipe again.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Yeah. (He sighs. Hes getting tired 
                         of Adam already. He speaks sharply.) 
                         So, you gonna tell me your name, or 
                         what?
 
               Adam stands back up, turns to Lawrence, his voice once again 
               calm.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Adam.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (getting to his feet, his voice a bit 
                         calmer) Well Adam, what we need to do 
                         (he leans with one hand outstretched 
                         against the pipe to his right. Adam 
                         watches him, scared but calm) is start 
                         thinking about why were here. Whoever 
                         brought us there couldve killed us 
                         by now. But they didnt. They must want 
                         something from us. (He looks up and 
                         around the room) Question is what. (He 
                         sees something up on the wall, moves 
                         forwards a bit towards it. We see that 
                         it is a brand new clock on the wall, 
                         ticking away. It reads currently at 
                         10:22.) That clock.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What about it?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Its brand new. (squints, studying it)
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (not getting what hes implying) So?
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sighs; its quite simple, why cant 
                         Adam see it?) So, someone obviously 
                         wanted us to know the time. (Adam looks 
                         a bit confused still, mulls over that 
                         information. Lawrence thinks for a moment.) 
                         Wait, I think I may be able to reach 
                         that door.
 
               Lawrence moves over as far as the chain will allow him to the 
               giant, wooden sliding door, pushing against it as hard as he 
               can. In the meantime, we see Adam thinking. He pauses, then reaches 
               down and starts going through his pockets. There is nothing in 
               the front two, but in his back left pocket he pulls out a plastic 
               baggie with a white envelope in it. He unfolds the baggie; the 
               envelope says ADAM. He stares at it in his hands, wondering what 
               it is.
 
               Lawrence continues struggling with the door, quickly glances 
               over his shoulder to see what Adam is doing. He sees Adam holding 
               the baggie. Adam reaches into the envelope, pulls out a micro 
               cassette tape. A close up shows the words Play Me written on 
               the tape label. Adam holds it in his hand, studying it. Lawrence 
               turns away from the door, looking over and trying to see what 
               Adam has in his hand.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         What is that? (Adam doesnt answer, 
                         continues looking at the tape. Lawrences 
                         voice grows impatient.) Excuse me.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (glances up briefly at Lawrence, then 
                         back down at the tape. His voice sounds 
                         slightly surprised.) Its a tape.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Where did you find it?

                                     ADAM
                         It was in my pocket.

               Lawrence thinks about that briefly then starts digging through 
               his own pockets, finds within them a white envelope with LAWRENCE 
               written across it in the same black lettering as Adams.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (regarding his tape) It says Play me.
 
                         
               Lawrence tears into his envelope, empties the contents into the 
               palm of his hand. First, he holds up a similar tape to Adams. 
               It also says Play Me. Then he holds up a single bullet, studying 
               it, not sure what its there for yet. Then, he holds up a tiny 
               key. He bends over, gets down on the floor and starts to try 
               to unlock his chains with the key. It doesnt seem to be working.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (frustrated, mumbling to himself and 
                         to the key) Come on, come on, come on....
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (seeing that it doesnt seem to be working 
                         on Lawrences lock) Throw it over here.
 
                         
               Lawrence gives him a slightly mistrustful look, but then holds 
               up the key and throws it. Adam misses the key at first as it 
               hits the floor in front of the dirty toilet near his corner.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         Fuck. (He leans over and picks up the 
                         key, then bends down and tries the key 
                         on the lock on his ankle, which doesnt 
                         work. He tries the lock on the chains 
                         around the pipe. It isnt working there 
                         either.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (watching him) No?

               Adam gives up, drops the key onto the floor frustratedly, shaking 
               his head. Thats when he looks over to the body again, and the 
               shot closes up on the hand holding the tape recorder. A small 
               loop handle juts out of the hands grip. Adam stands up, then 
               bends down and picks up the tape on the floor, looking at it. 
               He puts it back down then stretches himself flat out on the floor, 
               trying to reach. Unfortunately, there is still a good three to 
               four feet between him and the body.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Use your shirt.

                                     ADAM
                         (gets back up to his knees) What?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Your shirt.

               Adam looks down at himself, then takes off the long sleeved blue 
               shirt. He lays back down, holding the shirt by the ends of each 
               sleeve, and throws it, trying to catch it on the tape recorder. 
               It misses. He tries a second time; same result.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Come on...

               Adam tries again; it misses. It is just barely reaching. He pulls 
               the shirt back, gets back up on his knees, aggravated.
 
                                     ADAM
                         It wont work.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (trying to get him to not give up yet) 
                         Well, look around, there must be something 
                         else you can use.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (stands, ready to give up, skeptical) 
                         Theres nothing.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (insistent) Well there must be something!
 
                         
               Adam looks around his area, then into the bathtub. He sees something, 
               bends over, takes out the tub plug, which is attached to a long 
               cord. He ties the cord around the sleeve of his shirt. He kneels 
               down, holding out the shirt, aiming.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Come on, you can do it.

               Adam throws it, attempting to get the plug through the loop at 
               the end of the tape recorder. He misses.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Come on, come on, again.

               He tries again and misses. On the third try, however, he gets 
               the plug right through the loop. Lawrence smiles in relief. Adam 
               very slowly pulls it back, dragging the tape recorder along the 
               floor towards him. He picks it up, getting rid of the plug and 
               dropping it and the shirt on the floor. He picks up the tape, 
               pops it in and presses play, holding the tape recorder out a 
               bit so that they can both hear, but keeping his head tilted so 
               he can hear better. A chilling deep, raspy, sinister male voice 
               The Jigsaw Killer comes from the tape. As it speaks, Adams expression 
               is fearful, but the thought How does he know? can be detected.
 
               
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape) Rise and shine, Adam. Youre 
                         probably wondering where you are. Ill 
                         tell you where you might be. You might 
                         be in the room that you die in. Up until 
                         now, you simply sat in the shadows, 
                         watching others live out their lives. 
                         But what do voyeurs see when they look 
                         into the mirror? Now, I see you as a 
                         strange mix of someone angry and yet 
                         apathetic. But mostly just pathetic. 
                         So are you going to watch yourself die 
                         today, Adam? Or do something about it? 
                         (end)
 
               Adam looks frightened but not sure of the entire meaning of the 
               message.
 
                                     ADAM
                         I dont get it. (He presses the stop 
                         button on the tape.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (eagerly, gestures.) Throw me the player.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (pauses, thinks) No, you throw me your 
                         tape.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a heavy sigh. He looks at Adam as a 
                         slow-minded fool who simply doesnt 
                         understand the full capacity of the 
                         situation that theyre in, and speaks 
                         to him as such.) Look, were going to 
                         have to work together if we want to 
                         get out of here. Now just throw it to 
                         me.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (picks up on the tone, speaks defensively) 
                         Im not going to risk breaking it! You 
                         throw me your tape!
 
               Lawrence pauses, looking at Adam as though hed like to smack 
               him, then holds up and tosses the tape. It hits the floor behind 
               Adam, who kneels down and picks it up, pops it in, presses play. 
               Its the same chilling voice as on Adams tape. As the tape plays, 
               Adam stares at Lawrence, and Lawrence at the tape recorder.
 
               
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape) Dr. Gordon, this is your wake 
                         up call. Every day of your working life, 
                         you have given people the news that 
                         they are going to die soon. Now you 
                         will be the cause of death. Your aim 
                         in this game is to kill Adam. (Adam 
                         glances down at the tape recorder wide-eyed, 
                         then back up at Lawrence) You have until 
                         six on the clock to do it. There sa 
                         man in the room with you. When theres 
                         that much poison in your blood (another 
                         view of the body from Lawrences POV), 
                         the only thing left to do is shoot yourself. 
                         (Jigsaw coughs) There are ways to win 
                         this hidden all around you. Just remember: 
                         X marks the spot for the treasure. If 
                         you do not kill Adam by 6:00, then Alison 
                         and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon. And 
                         Ill leave you in this room to rot. 
                         Let the game begin. (end)
 
               The looks on each mans face clearly say Oh Shit. The tape ends. 
               Lawrence stands up.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (firmly) Give me that. Now. (Adam tosses 
                         him the tape. He catches it, rewinds, 
                         plays back. Adam stands up from his 
                         spot on the floor.)
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape)...then Alison and Diana will 
                         die, Dr. Gordon. And Ill leave you 
                         in this room to rot.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (thinking, trying to figure this out) 
                         Any idea who that is?
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape) Let the game begin.

                                     ADAM
                         He knows us.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Wait a minute. (rewinds more)

                                     ADAM
                         (false hope) What do you think? Probably 
                         a joke, right?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Shh, shh! (presses play)

                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape) Let the game begin.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (softly) Listen...

                                     JIGSAW
                         (on tape, in a VERY hushed tone after 
                         a brief silence)...Follow your heart.
 
                         
               Lawrence stops the tape.

                                     ADAM
                         What the hell does Follow your heart 
                         mean?
 
               Lawrence is looking around, on the walls and everywhere else 
               in the bathroom for a heart. He spots a small one drawn in brown 
               on the toilet next to Adam and points.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         There! Right next to you, on the toilet.
 
                         
               Adam looks, sees the toilet. Slowly, he bends down, resting his 
               hands on the seat, looking down into the bowl of liquid shit, 
               not really sure what hes looking for.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (impatient, gesturing) Come on, come 
                         on.
 
               Adam glances up at Lawrence with a look of Youve got to be kidding 
               me, but Lawrence watches him expectantly. Adam sighs, then reaches 
               in with his right hand, fishing around in the mess.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Oh man...(he gasps, making gagging sounds, 
                         his face turned away from the bowl. 
                         He coughs, fishes around for another 
                         brief moment, then quickly pulls back, 
                         trying to shake some of the shit off 
                         of his hand, spitting.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (expectantly) Anything?

                                     ADAM
                         (disgusted) No solids.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Take off the lid. (He points to the 
                         lid. Adam looks to it, slowly stands 
                         up, reaches for it. Lawrence has no 
                         patience.) Come on!
 
               Adam takes off the lid, places it down on the toilet seat. The 
               water is clearer inside, and he reaches in and pulls out something 
               wrapped up in a black garbage bag. He holds it up for Lawrence 
               to see, turns to him.
 
                                     ADAM
                         I really wish I had checked in there 
                         first.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Huh. (he smiles slightly) What is it?
 
                         
               Adam tears into the bag, reaches in and pulls out two hacksaws. 
               He drops the bag on the floor, bends down and takes up his chain, 
               holding one of the hacksaws and beginning to saw at the chain 
               with it. Lawrence watches him for a moment.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Hey! (Adam turns and looks. Lawrence 
                         speaks in an irritated voice) Mind passing 
                         me the other one?
 
               Adam reaches over and picks up the other hacksaw, then carefully 
               throws it across the room. It hits the pipe to Lawrences left. 
               Lawrence reaches down and picks it up, then sits down on the 
               floor. Quick shot back to Adam, who, while Lawrence is preoccupied 
               with picking up the hacksaw, quickly picks up the garbage bag 
               and tosses it into the bathtub. Both men start to saw away at 
               their chains furiously, but neither are making any progress. 
               Suddenly, Adams saw snaps in the middle, and his temper flares.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         (enraged) Fuck! Fuck! (He reacts violently, 
                         hitting the broken saw twice against 
                         the iron pipe then turns and hums it 
                         across the room, right into a mirror. 
                         A small piece of the mirror breaks off 
                         and flies to the floor.)
 
               Lawrence glances over at what Adam has done, then goes back to 
               sawing for another moment. Adam sits back down, breathing heavily, 
               leaning against the pipe in his corner. Finally, Lawrence gives 
               up, turning and sitting with his back against the pipe, also 
               breathing heavily for a moment. He sits there, when a look of 
               realization comes across his face. He holds up the saw, looking 
               at it, understanding. He lowers it to the floor, shaking his 
               head slightly.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (everything is becoming more clear now) 
                         He doesnt want us to cut through our 
                         chains. He wants us to cut through our 
                         feet. (Adam looks up at him, eyebrows 
                         raised.) I think I may know whos done 
                         this to us.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What did you say? (he stands up; is 
                         Lawrence hiding something from him?)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Its not someone I know personally. 
                         Its...just someone I know of.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (getting slightly frantic again) Jesus 
                         Christ! Tell me, who is it?!
 
               The camera closes up on Lawrences face. To the right of it, 
               the screen is fading into a flashback of a crime scene. As Lawrence 
               speaks, his face fades and the flashback scene grows clearer, 
               until it is only the crime scene, with three detectives walking 
               down a flight of stairs.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         The last I heard...the police still 
                         hadnt caught him.
 
               
               We now see the three figures descending through a trap door down 
               a flight of stairs. The lighting is a bright lime green that 
               is strangely dark at the same time. The trio enters a small, 
               cell like room with a low ceiling. They are TAPP, SING, and KERRY. 
               Tapp is a tall black man in his late forties-early fifties. Sing 
               is an Asian man in his mid to late thirties, and Kerry is a Caucasian 
               woman in her mid to late thirties with long, curly brown hair 
               that is tied back in a ponytail. All are well dressed, Sing and 
               Tapp in suits, the woman in a jacket and dress slacks. They are 
               the detectives working on this case.
 
               As they move into the room, Sing sees something that brings a 
               look of shock to his face, shining a flashlight on it. We cannot 
               see it yet.

                         (VO) And the only reason I know that 
                         is because I was a suspect.
 
               Tapp comes into the room last, ducking slightly from his height, 
               and comes up alongside Sing, looking at the same thing.

                         (VO) Ill start from the beginning.

                         This ones not fresh anymore. At least 
                         three weeks out. (Detective Tapp squints 
                         as he peers in and studies the body) 
                         Victims a 46-year old male. (Quick 
                         flash of a crime scene photo, a closeup 
                         of behind the mans head and upper back. 
                         There are deep cuts all over. The camera 
                         cuts upwards to the detectives.) Died 
                         of massive blood loss. Mostly through 
                         the femoral artery. (The camera pans 
                         around to Detective Tapp, who moves 
                         around the side fo the cage to get a 
                         better look inside, shining his flashlight 
                         in.) He started at the back of the cage 
                         and tunneled his way through the razor 
                         wire so fast its amazing he got as 
                         far as he did. Cut himself so deep, 
                         we found traces of stomach acid on the 
                         floor. (Another more gruesome crime 
                         scene photo shot of the body from the 
                         side; we can see the razor wire digging 
                         in under his arm. Also, a close-up shot 
                         of some of his wounds; long, deep cuts.) 
                         We also found this. (She holds up an 
                         evidence baggie with a micro cassette 
                         tape recorder, just like the one Adam 
                         and Lawrence found in their cell. She 
                         presses the play button, and Tapp and 
                         Sing listen. Its the same chilling 
                         voice from Adam and Lawrences tapes.)

                         (on tape) Hello Paul. You are a perfectly 
                         healthy, sane, middle-class male. Yet 
                         last month, you ran a straight razor 
                         across your wrists. Did you cut yourself 
                         because you truly wanted to die, or 
                         did you just want some attention? Tonight, 
                         youll show me. The irony is that if 
                         you want to die, you just have to stay 
                         where you are. But if you want to live, 
                         youll have to cut yourself again. (Flashback 
                         shot of Paul waking up in the cage, 
                         looking around, scared and confused. 
                         The shots go back and forth between 
                         the detectives and the Paul flashback, 
                         with him grabbing and shaking the razor 
                         wire, screaming. His screams sound distant 
                         under Jigsaws voice.) Find the path 
                         through the razor wire to the door. 
                         But hurry. At 3:00 that door will lock 
                         and then this room becomes your tomb. 
                         How much blood will you shed to stay 
                         alive, Paul? (end)
 
                                     KERRY
                         (stopping the tape) The door was on 
                         a timer. It was unlocked until 3:00. 
                         Then it slammed shut. He was given two 
                         hours.
 
               Cut back to Detective Tapp, who notices something and shines 
               his light on it. We see a strange wound on Pauls body, a piece 
               of flesh carved out into the shape of a jigsaw piece.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Jigsaw piece. (Sing looks in as well, 
                         see it. There is a quick flash of crime 
                         scene photos showing a close up of the 
                         wound. Tapp sighs.) I think were gonna 
                         be here for a while, Sing. (Sing looks 
                         to him. We get another quick crime scene 
                         shot of Paul.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (VO) The newspapers started calling 
                         him the Jigsaw Killer.
 
               Cut back to Lawrence in the bathroom. For his next two spoken 
               lines, the shot switches back and forth between him and the detectives 
               in the razor wire room.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Actually, technically speaking, hes 
                         not really a murderer. He never killed 
                         anyone.
 
               Sing, wearing gloves, gets in the cage and examines Pauls body 
               a bit. A flash of another crime scene photo of the wound with 
               a ruler held up to it is shown. More gruesome crime scene photos 
               of that and other wounds are flashed across the screen.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (VO) He finds ways for his victims to 
                         kill themselves.
 
               Cut to Sing kneeled down over a charred corpse, completely blackened, 
               at another crime scene. We hear Jigsaws voice from a tape recorder 
               play over the scene as the detectives look around, and over the 
               flashback shots.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO, on tape) Hello Mark. If youre 
                         so sick, then why do I have so many 
                         photos of you up and about? (there is 
                         a quick montage of a camera snapping 
                         several black and white shots of Mark 
                         up and about, looking around and getting 
                         into a car.) Lets put your so-called 
                         illness to the test. (Flashback image 
                         of Mark waking up. He is a younger man 
                         in his mid to late twenties, with dark 
                         brown hair. He is completely nude, smeared 
                         in some kind of Vaseline-like ointment. 
                         In front of him is a small, square glass 
                         plate held up by some chains. On the 
                         plate is a micro cassette player, a 
                         lit votive candle, and a box of matches. 
                         He gets up, looking around confusedly 
                         and scared.) Right now, there is a slow-acting 
                         poison in your veins. The antidote is 
                         in the safe. (Black and white crime 
                         scene shot of the safe, then a shot 
                         of Mark standing over it, screaming, 
                         his screams distant under Jigsaws voice, 
                         as with Paul.) The combination to the 
                         safe (quick montage of several black 
                         and white crime-scene photos of numbers 
                         written all over the walls) is written 
                         on the wall. Hurry up and program it 
                         in. But watch your step (Marks bare 
                         foot steps on the broken glass scattered 
                         all across the floor). And by the way, 
                         thats a flammable substance smeared 
                         on your body (shot of Mark looking at 
                         the ointment on his hand, up his arm, 
                         everywhere), so I would be careful with 
                         that candle, if I were you...
 
                                     MARK
                         (huddled over the safe; screams, but 
                         it is still distant sounding) Help!!!!!
 
                         
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO ctd)....or all the people youve 
                         burned with your act (Mark starts to 
                         turn the lock on the safe) just might 
                         have their revenge.
 
               We see Mark desperately going around the room, holding the candle, 
               looking at the walls, trying to find a combination. The camera 
               goes back and forth a few times in a sped-up shot to him doing 
               this and turning a the lock on the safe, trying to program the 
               combination into the safe. He moves in a circle, clockwise to 
               us. When he gets to facing right in front of us, the flame from 
               the candle flares up and engulfs the shot, flaring into a close-up 
               crime scene photo of Marks charred face.
 
               The shot moves back to the trio of detectives, with Sing holding 
               the tape recorder.
 
                                     KERRY
                         I found something else. Well, two things, 
                         actually. (She moves past them and we 
                         go with her over to a wall where there 
                         is a small hole cut, about an inch or 
                         two in diameter. The light from the 
                         outside shines in.) There was someone 
                         standing outside here watching through 
                         this peephole. Looks like our friend 
                         Jigsaw likes to book himself front row 
                         seats to his own sick little games. 
                         He was there at the last one as well. 
                         (She walks over to Sing and Tapp) Only 
                         this time, he left us his penlight. 
                         (She holds up the penlight in an evidence 
                         baggie, clicking it twice then handing 
                         it to Tapp.)
 
                                     TAPP
                         (taking the baggie, studying it) Get 
                         a rush on the prints. (He hands it back 
                         to her.)
 
                                     KERRY
                         (taking the baggie, moving out of the 
                         room) Copy that.
 
                                     CUT TO
                         Hospital room. Lawrence in his white 
                         doctors coat along with three blue-scrub 
                         clad medical students. A nurse in white 
                         stands off to the side. Lawrence is 
                         going over the patients charts. He 
                         goes over to the x-ray display, pushing 
                         the light on to view two x-rays of someones 
                         skull. He points to it with his pen 
                         as he speaks.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Okay. This patient has an inoperable 
                         frontal lobe tumor extending across 
                         the midline. Started as colon cancer. 
                         (He turns back to the three young medical 
                         students. One of them, a pretty Asian 
                         girl named CARLA, smiles at Lawrence 
                         as he speaks, seems particularly infatuated 
                         with him.) The patient has come in for 
                         a standard checkup by which we are able 
                         to monitor the rate at which his condition 
                         is declining.
 
               In the doorway, an orderly pushing a cart of cleaning supplies 
               is passing by and stops when he sees Lawrence and the medical 
               students in the room, listening to what Lawrence is saying. This 
               is Zep. Hes a man in his early to late forties dressed in orderly 
               whites with short brown hair and large blue eyes that show a 
               kindness that the others in the room seem to be lacking. Kindness, 
               and something else below the surface. He glances down at John 
               sleeping, then up at Lawrence.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         The patient had...

                                     ZEP
                         (cutting him off) His name is John, 
                         Dr. Gordon. (He looks down at the patient, 
                         who we see is a man in his late forties-early 
                         fifties, hairless except for a small 
                         white goatee. His head is to the side 
                         and he is sleeping. On the tray table 
                         in front of him is a notebook and some 
                         colored pencils. As Zep looks at him 
                         and speaks of him, there is caring in 
                         his voice, something Dr. Gordon has 
                         yet to display regarding this patient.) 
                         Hes a very interesting person.
 
               Lawrence looks almost slightly embarrassed, not for himself but 
               maybe for Zep. A condescending, smug smile plays across his face 
               and he nods. His tone matches his look.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Thank you for that information, Zep. 
                         (he looks to the students, who all share 
                         his smug smile) As you can see, our 
                         orderlies form very special bonds with 
                         the patients. (Zep just stares at Lawrence, 
                         his expression mostly blank but with 
                         pure loathing just underneath the surface. 
                         The look seems to say Fuck you, Dr. 
                         Gordon. He stares at him for a moment, 
                         then turns away, and continues down 
                         the hall with his cart.) Continuing 
                         on, the patient....
 
               But he is cut off by a voice on the intercom.

                                     INTERCOM
                         Dr. Gordon, Dr. Lawrence Gordon, please 
                         page the operator.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a smug but annoyed smirk) Obviously 
                         someone doesnt want me to tell you 
                         what the patient has. Excuse me. (He 
                         steps around the students, leaves the 
                         room. The three students watch after 
                         him with great admiration.)
 
               Cut to Lawrences office at the hospital . Inside, Tapp is leaning 
               against Dr. Gordons chair, studying the various framed degrees 
               on the wall. Sing is sitting in one of the two chairs across 
               from the desk, twisted around in his seat to look at a couple 
               of small picture frames on the bookshelf behind him. Lawrence 
               opens the door and enters, and the two detectives turn to look 
               at him. He removes his white coat and hangs it on a rack by the 
               door. Tapp speaks first, his tone is friendly, but searching.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         Dr. Gordon, Im Detective Tapp, this 
                         is Detective Sing, City Homicide. (he 
                         gestures to the degrees on the wall.) 
                         Very impressive.
 
               Lawrence smiles, pretending to care about what they think, truly 
               just wanting to get this over with so as to not waste any more 
               of his time. As he speaks, he walks over to the chair behind 
               his desk.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Oh. Thank you, I do my best. (He sits 
                         in his chair. Tapp takes the seat next 
                         to Sing across from him. Sing studies 
                         him silently, chewing gum.)
 
                                     TAPP
                         Sorry to interrupt you while youre 
                         working.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Thats fine. Now, how can I help you 
                         gentlemen?
 
               Tapps tone turns a bit more serious, but still amiable enough.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         Are you able to tell us where you were 
                         between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 
                         1:00 a.m. last night, Doctor?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (his tone just barely masking his concern) 
                         Why is it that youre interested?
 
                         
                                     TAPP
                         Wed like to ask you a few questions 
                         about it. For your sake, I think its 
                         best if we do it down at the station. 
                         Would you like to follow us there?
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Shaking his head, this is unbelievable) 
                         No, Im afraid thats...thats quite 
                         out of the question. I cant just leave, 
                         I have work to do. Plus, my wife has 
                         the car today, so...
 
                                     SING
                         (amiable but hinting that he knows something) 
                         Oh, thats okay, you can ride with us. 
                         Doc.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (chuckles uncomfortably) Im sorry, 
                         youll have to tell me again. What is 
                         this all about?
 
               Tapp produces the penlight from his pocket, holds it up for Dr. 
               Gordon.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Is this yours, Doctor?

               He puts the penlight down on the desk. Lawrence picks it up, 
               a brief oh shit look flashing across his face only to be quickly 
               covered up. He looks at the pen strangely. The two detectives 
               carefully study his reaction. Lawrence looks back up at them.
 
               
               Cut to the Police Station. In an interrogation room, Lawrence 
               paces back and forth nervously, now wearing his suit jacket. 
               His lawyer sits at the table, taking notes.
 
                                     LAWYER
                         So you have no idea how your penlight 
                         showed up at the murder scene?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Of course not!

                                     LAWYER
                         I have to ask. What were you doing last 
                         night.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a slight hesitation, a bit of guilt 
                         in his voice. As much as he would allow.) 
                         I was seeing someone.
 
                                     LAWYER
                         (a slight pause) Who? (Lawrence doesnt 
                         answer, just continues his pacing. The 
                         lawyer gets frustrated, noisily puts 
                         down his pen.) Look, if you cant be 
                         honest with me...
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (His tone quick, almost blurting) I 
                         was visiting someone. It wasnt a patient. 
                         Alright? (He sighs, shakes his head. 
                         Hes fucked, either way.) What am I 
                         gonna do?
 
                                     LAWYER
                         Well, as your lawyer and your friend, 
                         my advice to you is to bite the bullet 
                         and give them your alibi now. Because 
                         no one is going to believe you later.
 
                         
               Cut back to the Bathroom. Lawrence, still sitting against the 
               wall, throws down his hacksaw next to him, resting his hand against 
               his knee.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sighs) That was five months ago. He 
                         tried to set me up for murder.
 
               Cut back to the Interrogation room, some time Later. Lawrence 
               is sitting alone at the table. Sing comes through the door, shuts 
               it behind him.
 
                                     SING
                         Okay. We checked your alibi. It holds 
                         up. (His voice indicates that he still 
                         believes theres more to it; he does 
                         not and will not trust Lawrence.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Good! Can I go home now?

                                     SING
                         (continuing) We have one of the victims 
                         who managed to escape. (As he speaks, 
                         we see a young woman with brown hair 
                         in a ponytail wearing a visitors pass 
                         being led carefully into the room next 
                         to them and sat at a table. This is 
                         AMANDA. Lawrence and Sing can see her 
                         clearly; she cannot see them.) Want 
                         to know if you wouldnt mind sticking 
                         around and listening to her testimony? 
                         Maybe itll trigger something. (Tapp 
                         and an unidentified bald black man in 
                         a suit enter the room. The man guides 
                         Amanda into her chair, stands behind 
                         her against the wall. Tapp sits in a 
                         chair to her left.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (doesnt really care) Id like to help, 
                         really, but...
 
                                     SING
                         (cutting him off quickly, wont let 
                         him out of this that easily) Well, wed 
                         really appreciate it. Shes the only 
                         one who made it.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (quietly, giving in.) Okay.

               Camera moves into the Interrogation room with Amanda, Tapp, and 
               the unidentified man. As Tapp speaks, the camera slowly moves 
               closer over his shoulder and towards Amanda. As we get closer 
               to her, we see long, strange, scar-like markings along each side 
               of her mouth. She is shaken, her eyes distant, never looking 
               anyone, including Tapp, in the eye. It is clear that her mind 
               is still lost somewhere within her nightmare.
 
                                     TAPP
                         (speaking slowly, gently) Amanda...in 
                         your own time, tell me the first thing 
                         you remember.
 
               We move closer and closer to Amanda, then suddenly the camera 
               spins round quickly and snaps into an alternate view of her, 
               her flashback. The room she is in has the same lime-green lighting 
               as Pauls cell. Amanda sits in a chair wearing a strange iron 
               contraption around her head, a bear-trap like device covering 
               her mouth. We can see her eyes, surrounded with black eyeliner, 
               as they slowly open, groggy, just waking up.
 
                                     AMANDA
                         (VO) I woke up. All I could taste was 
                         blood. (The camera moves back quickly, 
                         and we see her tied to the chair, her 
                         wrists bound to the arms of the chair. 
                         She pulls against her bonds, moaning 
                         loudly, trying to speak or cry out but 
                         cannot.) And metal.
 
               She continues to struggle against her bonds some more. The camera 
               circles around her, and we get a better view of the strange device 
               on her head, and the padlock and timer on the back of it. A long 
               wire hangs down from the timer and below the screen.
 
               The view switches to the side of her and we see next to her an 
               old television set, which suddenly switches on, startling her. 
               After a brief moment of static, the frightening image of a demented 
               clown-like doll its face white with red spirals on its cheeks, 
               its red eyes leering at Amanda from the screen. She stares at 
               it, her moans a bit softer to match her fear and utter confusion. 
               The doll speaks, the jaw moving; it is the voice of Jigsaw.
 
               
                                     JIGSAW
                         (from the TV) Hello Amanda. You dont 
                         know me, but I know you. I want to play 
                         a game. Heres what happens if you lose. 
                         (The video moves next to the doll, to 
                         a device like the one shes wearing 
                         attached to a mannequin head. As he 
                         continues, explaining what it is, her 
                         breathing grows faster and heavier, 
                         and her moans pick up more.) The device 
                         youre wearing is hooked into your upper 
                         and lower jaws. When the timer at the 
                         back goes off, your mouth will be permanently 
                         ripped open. Think of it like a reverse 
                         bear trap. Here, Ill show you.
 
               The video pans back to a view of the doll and the device. The 
               dolls head moves and looks down at the device, and the camera 
               zooms in on it. A timer ticks away. A few seconds later, SNAP! 
               The device springs and the fake head is crushed and explodes. 
               Amanda shrieks, her eyes widening. The video switches back to 
               a close up of the doll.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (from the TV) There is only one key 
                         to open the device. Its in the stomach 
                         of your dead cellmate. Look around, 
                         Amanda. Know that Im not lying. You 
                         better hurry up. Live or die. Make your 
                         choice.
 
               The video goes to white and gray static, then switches off. Amanda 
               begins to struggle like a madwoman against her bonds and the 
               chair. The camera swings around her, circling, making her movements 
               fast and jerky. Amanda manages to pull one arm free, then the 
               other and stands up quickly. Thats when the cord in the back 
               of the device is pulled out, and the timer starts. She freezes, 
               her eyes widening. We see a close-up of the timer, and it begins 
               its sixty second countdown. She reaches behind her head, pulling 
               at the lock and the timer, trying to pull it off, but it is stuck 
               there. She starts freaking out, pulling at it as much as she 
               can, the camera movements once again fast and jerky around her.
 
               
               The camera spins back to Amanda sitting still in her chair in 
               the interrogation room, sniffling. We see a brief shot of Lawrence, 
               who watches and listens to her with grim amazement. Back to Amanda.
 
               
                                     AMANDA
                         And then I saw the body.

               We switch back into Amandas cell. Over her shoulder, we see 
               near the corner the body of a man lying on the floor on his back. 
               Amanda cautiously approaches it, the timer still ticking away, 
               her hands still at the device. She kneels down cautiously next 
               to him. She reaches down and with a shaking hand lifts up his 
               shirt, revealing a large, black question mark drawn on his abdomen. 
               She sobs harder, hunched over him.
 
               Quick cut to the interrogation room, Amanda in the center of 
               the shot.
 
                                     AMANDA
                         There was a knife.

               Back to the cell. Amanda, still leaning over, picks up a small 
               knife next to the body. She slowly brings it up in both of her 
               shaking hands, clutching it. She looks closer at it. A quick 
               shot of the timer shows it to be at 25 seconds now, almost halfway. 
               The camera moves to a shot of the mans face, when...
 
               HE OPENS HIS EYES AND STARTS TO WAKE UP. He moans, unable to 
               speak or move. His eyes slowly, groggily look around a bit. He 
               cannot even open his mouth; someone has very heavily drugged 
               him. He sees Amanda over him with a knife and his eyes widen; 
               he tries to moan at her to stop, to not do what shes about to 
               do, but she turns the knife upside down in both hands and quickly 
               stabs down. He moans in agony in the background as she stabs 
               down again, and again, and again. Blood splashes on her hands.
 
               
               A quick shot back of Lawrence as he listens, his mouth open slightly, 
               eyes wide, staring at her. Cut back to Amanda in the cell as 
               she stabs down a few more times. Then back again to the table 
               in Lawrences interrogation room. Sing throws down an evidence 
               baggie with a used syringe in it.
 
                                     SING
                         (VO as camera pans up to Lawrence) Hed 
                         been injected with an opiate overdose. 
                         He couldnt move or feel much of anything.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         You mean....he was alive?

                                     SING
                         (staring, nods slightly) Was.

               Back to Amandas Interrogation room, her head still hung, still 
               sniffling. A view of Tapp as he asks
 
                                     TAPP
                         What happened after you took it off?
 
                         
               Cut back to the cell, her bloody hands sifting through intestines 
               for a key. Cut back to interrogation room Amanda, then cut back 
               again to her holding up a liver or some other organ. Back to 
               interrogation room Amanda, the horror on her face growing, then 
               back to the cell.
 
               Amanda s hand pulls a small key from inside the organ shes 
               holding. She reaches around the back of her head, quickly trying 
               to unlock the padlock. The timer ticks away, faster and faster. 
               She gets it, pulls off the padlock and opens the device in the 
               back, ripping it away from her head and throwing it down as it 
               snaps open. She lets out the most terrible, agonized, heart-wrenching 
               scream, sobbing loudly, her hands held out in front of her, rocking 
               back and forth.
 
               Suddenly from another corner of the room, a light comes on, revealing 
               the puppet from the video in the corner. Amanda sees it, staring 
               at it wide eyed, her sobs softening for a moment as she stares 
               at it. Slowly, it wheels towards her on a tricycle. She can only 
               stare and cry, not sure what to do or expect. It stops, leering 
               at her, then speaks.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         Congratulations. You are still alive. 
                         Most people are so ungrateful to be 
                         alive. But not you. Not anymore.
 
               Cut back into a close up of Amanda in the interrogation room, 
               her head still shaking a bit, almost like a series of slight 
               spasms. She continues to sniffle, her eyes far off. Cut to Tapp.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         You are, in fact, a drug addict. Isnt 
                         that right, Mandy? (she nods, but doesnt 
                         look up.) Do you think that is why he 
                         picked you? (She lets out a sob, briefly 
                         nodding once.) Are you grateful, Mandy?
 
                         
               She finally raises her head, looking into his eyes for the first 
               time.
 
                                     AMANDA
                         (softly) He...helped me.

               As she starts sniffling and breathing more heavily, Tapp looks 
               over his shoulder into Lawrences room, right in his direction. 
               He may not see him, but he knows hes there. The camera then 
               cuts back to Amanda, who starts sobbing more heavily again. Slowly, 
               the camera moves down into and under the table, fading back into 
               an overhead view of the bathroom where Lawrence and Adam are.
 
               
               Adam sits in his corner, staring down at the floor as he has 
               been listening to Lawrences story. He looks up across to Lawrence.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         (softly) Are you sure its him?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (nods slightly) Yeah, Im sure.

                                     ADAM
                         (becoming a little hysterical again. 
                         He speaks accusingly) How do I know 
                         youre telling the truth? You can be 
                         the one who put me in this room! (he 
                         gesticulates as he speaks, pointing 
                         to Lawrence and himself.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (internal eye roll, speaks slowly, as 
                         to a simpleton) Im in exactly the same 
                         situation youre in.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Wrong. (he stands up, kicking his chained 
                         foot out. Shouts.) Wrong! Youve got 
                         one thing I dont: Information! (He 
                         hovers as close as he can in a threatening 
                         pose, pointing) You know who did this! 
                         (He picks up a glass shard that fell 
                         when he broke the mirror, holds it up 
                         threateningly to Lawrence) Now you either 
                         tell me what is really going on (Lawrence 
                         rolls his eyes, turns his head over 
                         to his left, away from Adam) or Ill 
                         cut you with this, you hear me? Ill 
                         cut- (But he stops short as he sees 
                         something in the glass. He flips it 
                         over, studying it, flips it back. He 
                         looks over to the mirror on the wall, 
                         studying it, thinking.)
 
               Lawrence notices that Adams ranting has ended, glances over 
               at him.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         What?

                                     ADAM
                         (looks over at Lawrence, then back at 
                         the mirror.) Its a two-way mirror.
 
                         
               Adam drops the shard down on the floor carefully, then reaches 
               over to the corner behind him, leaning down and picking up a 
               loose padlock. He lifts it up and throws it as hard as he can 
               against the mirror, shattering most of the glass. Lawrence briefly 
               startles at the sound and force of the glass shattering. Adam 
               reaches back down, finds another piece of debris and throws that 
               at the mirror with just as much force. The rest of the glass 
               breaks away, and a camera with a red light can bee seen behind 
               a clear glass. Lawrence stands up to get a better look at it. 
               We movie in closer to the camera, getting a better look at it 
               as well.
 
               Suddenly there is a flash of static and we find ourselves looking 
               at a fuzzy, black and white surveillance video of Lawrence and 
               Adam in the bathroom, staring right at us into the camera. The 
               shot pulls back a bit and we see that the video is on a silver 
               surveillance monitor. A partial view of other recording-type 
               equipment can be seen on either side of the monitor. A mans 
               voice speaks, though it doesnt sound quite the same as on the 
               Jigsaw tapes. As he speaks, a hand wearing a black leather glove 
               raises up slightly and waves its fingers at the screen.
 
                                     MAN
                         (OS, Taunting) I can see you...

                                     ADAM
                         (from on video) So thats what this 
                         is. Reality TV.
 
                                     MAN
                         (OS. Still taunting, sounds as though 
                         on a power trip) Dont look at me. I 
                         cant help you.
 
               The shot transitions from the video view of Adam back into regular 
               view in the bathroom. Adam stands in a threatening pose to the 
               camera, speaks angrily, loudly to it, his voice dripping with 
               sarcasm.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Can you hear me in there? Huh? Im having 
                         a blast. (he bends down and picks up 
                         another piece of debris from the floor) 
                         This is the most fun Ive had without 
                         lubricant. (Hums the piece of debris 
                         at the window. It makes a thwacking 
                         sound, but doesnt break. Not even a 
                         crack.) Make sure youre getting everything. 
                         (Bends down, throws picks up and throws 
                         another piece of debris. It hits, but 
                         no breakage. Leans down for another 
                         piece.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Scoffing tone as he watches Adam trying 
                         to break the glass) Thats not going 
                         to do anything.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (pauses, looks to Lawrence) You just 
                         want to leave it running on us? (the 
                         shot switches to surveillance view)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (very matter-of-fact) Well, you wont 
                         stop it. (shot switches to regular view) 
                         Thats why we cant cut through these 
                         chains. Its why you wont break that 
                         glass. (he gestures to the pipe then 
                         the glass) Every possible angle has 
                         been pre-thought out by him. (He appears 
                         deep in thought, starting to understand 
                         the set-up more so, figuring out the 
                         way this guy thinks. Almost admiring 
                         him. The situation may be bad, but its 
                         a brilliant design.)
 
                                     ADAM
                         You sound like you admire this prick.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (explaining) To overcome something, 
                         you have to understand what a perfect 
                         engine it is. Thats how you fight disease. 
                         (He looks up at the ceiling, at the 
                         walls, around the room) Now the tape 
                         told us to find an X. That X has to 
                         be somewhere in this room. (determined) 
                         Help me find it.
 
               Adam does not help him look. He simply cannot believe Lawrences 
               calm demeanor in this situation anymore. It seems that he is 
               almost becoming as sick of Lawrences attitude as Lawrence is 
               of his. He speaks a with a bit of a hyper tone again, accusingly.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         How can you be the calm Doctor Guy when 
                         your wife and kid are out there. (Shot 
                         of Lawrence looking around the room) 
                         Hes got them, too. (Shot of the clock; 
                         its now 12:05.) He could be doing anything 
                         to them right now. Are you thinking 
                         about that?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Suddenly looks right at him, snaps 
                         angrily) I AM thinking about that. (Adam 
                         backs off a bit. Lawrence pauses a moment, 
                         his voice changes to calm but sad.) 
                         Ive been the last thing I said to my 
                         daughter.
 
               Lawrence turns away from Adam, placing his hand on the pipe behind 
               him, and the shot moves up into blackness, then up at the foot 
               of a little girls bed in a darkened bedroom. The little girl 
               is Diana. Shes about 5 or 6 years old, with long, wavy light 
               brown hair. She lays tucked in with her eyes closed, her favourite 
               teddy bear wrapped in her left arm. The camera moves up and over 
               her a bit, moving in closer to her. Chimes can be heard tinkling 
               very faintly against a soft breeze. As the shot pauses just above 
               her, her eyes suddenly open, blinking away sleepiness. She sits 
               up, pulling away the covers, still holding her teddy bear. She 
               remains sitting in her bed, staring over into the dark corner 
               to her right. The chimes jingle away. We move in closer to her 
               face; something has her spooked. A clock ticking is suddenly 
               heard as the image fades from Diana getting out of bed into a 
               strange, mechanical-looking clock on the living room wall of 
               the Gordon Household.
 
               The shot lowers and we see the nicely furnished living room of 
               the Gordon home. The walls are a dark, crimson red, the furniture 
               in tones of red and brown. It definitely is the living room of 
               a well-off family. Not too cold, but not as warm and homey as 
               it could be. Diana slowly makes her way across the living room 
               towards her parents bedroom, moving almost dream-like, her teddy 
               bear hanging limply from her right hand. She moves to the frosted 
               glass double doors of her parents room, opening them both into 
               the bedroom, where we see her mother, Alison, laying on her side, 
               fast asleep. Alison is in her early to mid thirties with long 
               blond hair going just past her shoulders and very pretty despite 
               her sleepiness and messy hair in this scene. Diana moves into 
               the room, standing next to the bed, saying nothing, just watching 
               her mother sleeping. Alisons eyes slowly open; the feeling of 
               being watched plus the instincts of a mother have awoken her. 
               She reaches over and turns on the light, looking upon her daughter 
               with concern.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Diana, Honey, are you okay? (she pushes 
                         back the covers and gets up, crouching 
                         down in front of her daughter. Looking 
                         up at her, she places her hands on her 
                         daughters arms.) Diana, Honey, can 
                         you hear me?
 
                                     DIANA
                         (very softly, but showing almost no 
                         fear) Mommy?
 
               Alison reaches up and touches Dianas hair, bringing her hand 
               down in a soft caress on Dianas cheek.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Oh, what is it, sweet pea?

                                     DIANA
                         (very calmly) Theres a man in my room.
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (sighing, but not rudely. This is not 
                         the first time this has happened) Oh 
                         Honey, are you sure hes not just hiding 
                         in your imagination?
 
                                     DIANA
                         He talked to me.

                                     ALISON
                         (sighs) Okay, Ill come and check your 
                         room. (She smiles a small, assuring 
                         smile)
 
                                     DIANA
                         I want Daddy. Hell get the scary man.
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (her smile fading a bit) Alright, if 
                         you want. Come on.
 
               She stands and leads Diana out of the room. Cut to Lawrences 
               office. Lawrence sits hunched slightly over his laptop computer, 
               focused on some paper hes writing. Diana and Alison appear in 
               the doorway to his left. He doesnt even look up, just keeps 
               typing. Alisons tone when she speaks indicates that she knows 
               hell probably say no, or put it off on her.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Larry, sorry to bother you, but your 
                         daughter had a bad dream again.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (his eyes never leaving the screen; 
                         raises his finger to pause them) Just 
                         a minute.
 
                                     ALISON
                         She wants you to check her room.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (keeps typing, never looks up) Mmm hmm, 
                         mmm hmm, just gotta finish this paragraph.
 
                         
               Alison waits a moment, then turns to Diana.

                                     ALISON
                         (softly) You know what sweetie? Ill 
                         go check with you.
 
               They turn, slowly start to walk away as Lawrence quickly finishes 
               typing, then closes the laptop.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Nope! Im done. (he smiles, turning 
                         to look at them.)
 
               Cut to Dianas room. Lawrence reaches over and turns on the lamp 
               on Dianas side table. Diana lies in bed, slightly propped up 
               against her pillows and stuffed animals. Lawrence sits on the 
               side of her bed.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (very reassuringly) See? (he pulls the 
                         covers up over her, up to her chest.) 
                         Theres no one in your room. Theres 
                         no such thing as the bad man. Now can 
                         you go to sleep?
 
                                     DIANA
                         Im still scared.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         You are? Give me your tootsie. (He pulls 
                         back the covers and she pulls out her 
                         foot. He takes it in his hand.) Oh, 
                         what a big tootsie. (He turns to her, 
                         raising his eyebrows up) Remember this 
                         one? (He counts on her toes as he says 
                         the following) This little piggy went 
                         to market, this little piggy stayed 
                         home, this little piggy had roast beef, 
                         this little piggy had none, and this 
                         little piggy went Weeee! (he tickles 
                         up her leg to her tummy and she giggles) 
                         all the way home!
 
               Just then, Lawrences beeper goes off. He leans back, takes it 
               out and looks at it.
 
                                     DIANA
                         I hate that thing.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Well I have to go to work, sweetheart. 
                         You know what Daddys job is like. Now, 
                         come on. (he re-tucks her in, she smiles 
                         at him.) Lets see. Try and get some 
                         sleep now, okay? (He gives her a kiss, 
                         smiles, stands up and goes to the door.)
 
                         
                                     DIANA
                         Youre not going to leave us, are you, 
                         Daddy?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (suddenly concerned) What? (He stops 
                         at the door, turns, goes back over to 
                         her bed, sits down next to her and leans 
                         over. This was the last thing hed expected 
                         her to say) What are you talking about? 
                         You mean, leave you and Mommy? (She 
                         nods; he reaches up and gently brushes 
                         her hair away from her face.) No, no 
                         sweetheart, I would never do that. Who 
                         gave you that idea?
 
                                     DIANA
                         No one.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Well its not true, okay?

                                     DIANA
                         (very softly) Okay.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         How much do I love you?

               He moves his face closer to her and together they say

                                     LAWRENCE & DIANA
                         Love you very much

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Thats right, thats right! (He gives 
                         her a kiss, pulls back.) Good night, 
                         sweetie.
 
                                     DIANA
                         Good night, Daddy.

               Lawrence gets up and goes to the door, flipping the lights off. 
               He pauses before he steps out.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Tomorrow, Ill read you your favourite 
                         story.
 
                                     DIANA
                         (with a small smile) Okay.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Okay. (he goes out.)

               Quick cut to the Entrance Hall of the Gordon Residence. Lawrence 
               walks towards the door, Alison behind him. Alisons voice starts 
               to cut over the scene. Her tone is very pissed off.
 
                                     ALISON
                         I dont know how much longer I can do 
                         this, Larry.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sounds as though he has no idea what 
                         she means) What, what are you talking 
                         about?
 
                                     ALISON
                         (pissed, in disbelief) How can you walk 
                         through life pretending that youre 
                         happy?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         I am happy.

                                     ALISON
                         (confrontational) That is complete bullshit. 
                         (cut to a shot of Diana, laying on her 
                         side in her darkened room, clutching 
                         her teddy bear to her chest. Her eyes 
                         are open, she can hear everything. We 
                         stay with her for the rest of Alisons 
                         line, her voice now off a bit in the 
                         distance but still very audible) Id 
                         rather you break down and tell me that 
                         you hated me. At least thered be some 
                         passion in it.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Would you like to see her? (He reaches 
                         into his pocket and takes out his wallet, 
                         throws it across the room to Adam, who 
                         is sitting with his back against the 
                         wall, facing Lawrence. Adam picks up 
                         the wallet and opens it. He sees two 
                         pictures of Diana, side by side. The 
                         one on the left is Diana hugging a dog. 
                         The one on the right is a smiling portrait 
                         outside somewhere.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Shes beautiful.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Thank you.

                                     ADAM
                         (sighs, then looks up at Lawrence) You 
                         gonna have any more kids?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a bit wearily, but not snobby) Weve 
                         talked about it, but uh, with our schedules, 
                         its difficult enough to concentrate 
                         on one. (The tone of his voice indicates 
                         that maybe hes starting to realize 
                         that he shouldve spent more time and 
                         attention to his daughter.)
 
                                     ADAM
                         (referring to the wallet) So wheres 
                         the lucky wife? (a small smile)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Theres another picture behind the one 
                         youre looking at. (Adam reaches behind 
                         the photo on the right and pulls another 
                         photograph out. Lawrence smiles slightly 
                         as he speaks) Its my favourite one 
                         because were all in it together. Someone, 
                         usually me, has to hold the camera, 
                         which means Im always missing from 
                         the photos.
 
               Cut to Adam, looking at the picture he pulled out. His face is 
               blank, but you can sense great disturbance behind it. Cut to 
               a shot of the photo he is holding. It is not the one Lawrence 
               described, but a Polaroid of Alison and Diana bound and gagged, 
               and the message Regards with a jigsaw piece drawn next to it. 
               He turns the photo over, and there is a message. As he reads 
               it, Jigsaw reads it aloud in a voiceover.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO) X Marks the spot. Sometimes you 
                         see more with your eyes shut.
 
               Adam does his best to hide what he has seen, looks up to Lawrence.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         Its uh, its not here.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a slight disturbance from his momentary 
                         nostalgic bliss) What?
 
                                     ADAM
                         Uh, this photo youre talking about...its 
                         not here.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (slightly surprised, reaching out his 
                         hand for Adam to toss the wallet.) Really? 
                         Are you sure?
 
                                     ADAM
                         Yeah. (Tucking the picture in his right 
                         hand, he shifts slightly by lifting 
                         himself a bit with his right hand, sneakily 
                         putting the photograph down and tossing 
                         the wallet with his left hand. Lawrence 
                         picks up the wallet and starts looking 
                         for it, creasing his brow in concern, 
                         while Adam backs up against his wall, 
                         holding the photograph out of Lawrences 
                         sight against a pipe he rests his arm 
                         on as he looks at the photograph.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (disbelief, shaking his head) He...he 
                         mustve taken it. I...
 
               Alisons voice over is heard as he says this and continues to 
               look through the wallet, and we hear Alisons voiceover from 
               the scene in the main hall.
 
                                     ALISON
                         (VO) How can you walk through life pretending 
                         that youre happy?
 
               CUT TO the Main Hall of the Gordon Residence, back to the earlier 
               flashback of Lawrence and Alison. This time, we stay with them.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         I am happy. (He walks over to a chair, 
                         leaning over it as he puts something 
                         down, gets his briefcase ready to go 
                         to work. Alison stands a few feet behind 
                         him, trying her best to get him to react, 
                         to stop the bullshit and end the masquerade.)
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (pissed) That is complete bullshit. 
                         Id rather you break down and tell me 
                         that you hated me. At least thered 
                         be some passion in it.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (tired of this, brushing it off as not 
                         that important, like there really is 
                         nothing wrong) We can talk about this 
                         alter, okay? (He leans in to kiss her, 
                         but she shakes her head. He pauses there.)
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (firmly) Just leave.

               He looks at her for a moment, searching, then slowly turns away 
               and heads out the door.
 
                                     VOICE
                         Goodnight, little girl. (camera pans 
                         up closer into the closet, and we a 
                         widened blue eye and part of a face 
                         (yet unidentifiable) watching her.)
 
                         
               The closet doors burst open and Diana screams. Cut back to the 
               main hall where Alison stands alone, her head lowered slightly. 
               As soon as she hears the scream she turns and bolts towards her 
               daughters room.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Diana!?

               Alison gets to just outside the door to her bedroom.

                                     ALISON
                         Diana! (opens the door and flips on 
                         the light, gasps when she sees a figure 
                         covered by a blanket looming over Dianas 
                         bed. The figure suddenly grabs Diana 
                         and she screams, struggling against 
                         him. Alison goes for them.
 
               Quick cut to NOW, in Alison and Lawrences bedroom. Waistline 
               shot of a figure wearing a black coat, black leather gloves and 
               blue jeans, holding a stethoscope. A gun is tucked into his belt 
               and Dianas teddy bear tucked under his arm. He saunters over 
               to the gagged and bound Diana and Alison, on the floor and tied 
               to a corner end of the bed. Alison, her eyes streaming tears, 
               struggles and pulls against her bonds to try to get at him but 
               fails. Diana keeps crying Mommy! over and over again and sobbing.
 
               
               The figure crouches down beside Diana, dropping the teddy bear 
               behind her, his face still unseen. He takes the stethoscope and 
               holds the end to Dianas chest. The sound of a loud, steady heartbeat 
               is heard. Alison screams at him through her gag.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Dont do that! Leave her! Get away from 
                         her!
 
               He pulls away the stethoscope and the heartbeat halts. He reaches 
               with his right hand and pulls from his belt the gun. Dianas 
               screams become more desperate, Alisons more frantic, more angry. 
               He puts the stethoscope back against Dianas chest and moves 
               the gun up and down in front of her, then bringing it up to her 
               mothers head. We hear the heartbeat again, doubled in speed.
 
               
                                     ALISON
                         (through her gag) Keep your motherfucking 
                         hands off of my daughter!
 
               He pulls away the gun and the stethoscope, tucking the gun back 
               into his belt. He reaches down behind Diana and picks up the 
               teddy bear. As he does, we catch a brief glimpse of the lower 
               half of his face, but not enough for a clear identification yet. 
               He holds the teddy bear out in front of Diana for a moment then 
               tucks it in front of her. He pats her on the head and stands 
               up, moving over to the window. He parts the curtains slightly 
               and leans forward a bit, and we see his face more clearly. It 
               is Zep, the orderly from the hospital.
 
               Cut to static, and then a surveillance video view of the exterior 
               of the Gordon home, of the window where Zep is standing. The 
               camera zooms in on him and we hear a raspy, male voice speaking.
 
               
                                     VOICE
                         (VO as we view shot of Zep) Who are 
                         you little man...I see you...(cut to 
                         a television screen with the video of 
                         Zep in the window. Fade back and to 
                         the right as we get a view of someones 
                         apartment. Plastered on the walls are 
                         various photographs, which we can barely 
                         make out, and a desk in the corner with 
                         some recording equipment. As we move 
                         further right and hit the window we 
                         see Detective Tapp, leaning over the 
                         camera shooting the Gordons window, 
                         adjusting the view. Something about 
                         him seems just not right. We cut back 
                         to his view from the camera.) Does Dr. 
                         Gordon know youre at home with his 
                         wife? I know you know something. (his 
                         voice goes up a bit louder) What are 
                         you doing in there? Waiting for the 
                         doctor? Im waiting for the doctor, 
                         too. Hmm.
 
               Cut to a view over Tapps couch of the television with Zep on 
               video on the screen. Tapp walks over and sits down in front of 
               the television, his back to us.
 
                                     TAPP
                         I never should have let you go...

               Camera pans up to a wall of articles, all about the Jigsaw killings. 
               It moves quickly and zooms in on each headline we see. Jigsaw 
               hunt brings D.A. before Judge, Missing Man discovered at Bizarre 
               Crime Scene screaming is heard then a quick flashback shot of 
               Paul in his cage, first struggling against the wire then hanging 
               dead in his cage Killer Preaching Says Top Cop, Psychopath 
               Teaches Sick Life Lessons, quick shot of Mark going around looking 
               for the code on the walls, with the sound of his screaming over 
               the shot, Escape, Victim Survives Maniacs Game quick flashback 
               footage of Amanda in the interrogation room, then fighting with 
               her mask, and a shot of Lawrence watching and listening to her 
               testimony, Doctor Questioned in Case flash of shots of Lawrence 
               being questioned by the Tapp and Sing and then his Lawyer. It 
               ends on the flashback shot of Tapp looking back at Lawrence through 
               the two-way glass after Amanda tells her story, and the shot 
               slides into a shot of a car pulling up alongside a building.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         (VO, fading, hushed against soundtrack) 
                         I never shouldve let you go...
 
               The car pulls up alongside a building, with Lawrence in the passenger 
               seat, and Tapp driving. Lawrences awkwardness, Tapps distrust, 
               and general uncomfortable tension can be easily detected between 
               them.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Pretending like hes trying to be helpful, 
                         really just glad to be out of Tapps 
                         company) Here we are. That was uh, quite 
                         an amazing story that poor woman told. 
                         (Tapp just nods, says nothing. Lawrence 
                         smiles very uncomfortably, gets out 
                         of the car.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (leaning down and looking back into 
                         the car window.) Look, Im sorry I cant 
                         be of more help to your investigation.
 
                         
                                     TAPP
                         (nods very slightly) You know, we arrested 
                         a dentist last week who like to play 
                         with kids a bit too much. He lived two 
                         blocks from here. The sewer lines run 
                         under this neighborhood too, Doctor. 
                         (hint hint)
 
               Lawrence stands straight up, walks away. Tapp waits a moment, 
               then drives off.
 
               BAM into static and then the video from Amandas cell. We are 
               not at Tapps desk in the police station, watching him obsessively 
               watch the video, staring at the screen, remote control in hand. 
               As he watches, the camera circles around behind the television 
               to give us a better view of our obsessed detective.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (from the video) Hello Amanda. You dont 
                         know me, but I know you. I want to play 
                         a game. Heres what happens if you lose. 
                         Theres a timer at the back of the device 
                         youre wearing. When the timer goes 
                         off, your mouth will be permanently 
                         ripped open.
 
               In the background of the station we hear a couple of detectives 
               talking, then Sing walks in behind Tapp, over to his own desk. 
               He turns, watching Tapp watch the screen. Tapp stops and rewinds 
               the tape.
 
                                     SING
                         (to the other detectives leaving) Ill 
                         catch you guys down there. (he reaches 
                         over and gets something off of his desk)
 
                         
                                     JIGSAW
                         (from video) Think of it like a reverse 
                         bear trap.
 
               Tapp fast forwards a bit, hits play.

                         (from video) Ill show you...

               Tapp watches closely the demonstration of the timer then the 
               device going off and exploding. Sing watches too, not paying 
               as close attention. As soon as it explodes, Sing speaks. The 
               look on his face and the tone of his voice indicates his growing 
               concern for his partners obsession over this case.

                         Hey Tapp?

               Tapp doesnt look up, resembles Lawrence in the earlier scene 
               when Alison and Diana came to him to check her room while he 
               was working on his paper.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Mmm?

                                     SING
                         Were gonna go down to the Grill, go 
                         get a beer. You wanna come?
 
                                     TAPP
                         I dont think so. Thanks anyway.

                         Ill leave you to have fun up here. 
                         (He puts his hands on his hips, watching 
                         some more of the video.)

                         from his obsession groove) Hey Tapp? 
                         I dont mean for this to be disrespectful...(pause) 
                         Maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend.
 
                         
               Sing chuckles, hits Tapp playfully on the arm, tapp laughs a 
               bit too, but doesnt look up. Sing remains grinning a bit. But 
               then Tapp continues and rewinds the video a bit.

               Tapp fast forwards.

                         (on video) Look around, Amanda. Know 
                         that Im not lying. (Sing steps off 
                         to the right) You better hurry up. (Tapp 
                         rewinds again, suddenly pauses)

                         Wait wait wait, Sing!

               Sing stops, turns.

                                     TAPP
                         Get back here!

                         to come over.)

                         (sighs then comes over) What?

               Tapp rewinds one second then pauses, holds pencil to the screen 
               to a grafittied wall on the video.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Remember 118th Street?

                         (looks at the screen, thinks a minute) 
                         Ah...K2K. That gangs territory was 
                         only about four blocks.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Now listen to this.

               They listen with the volume up high. Over the static, the sound 
               of a fire alarm can just barely be heard in the background. They 
               look at each other. Tapp hits stop.
 
                                     TAPP
                         (looking up at Sing) We gotta check 
                         the records from all the fire emergencies 
                         that occurred there in the last two 
                         weeks. Go, right now! Mmm!
 
               Sing turns and quickly walks off.

                         Close up of a map, with Sing speaking 
                         in a voiceover. As he speaks, theres 
                         a brief shot of the two of them sitting 
                         over the map, then quick shots of a 
                         few black and white photographs of a 
                         warehouse, including a close up of a 
                         street sign Stygian St.

                         (VO) On the night of Tuesday, the 17th, 
                         we got a fire alarm going off in the 
                         rear wing of 213 Stygian Street. Its 
                         an old listing. Used to be a mannequin 
                         factory. (cut back to view of the two 
                         detectives) You think we have enough 
                         for a warrant, though?
 
                                     TAPP
                         Who said anything about a warrant? (He 
                         grins, gets up and grabs his jacket.)
 
                         
                                     SING

                         Why not?

                                     SING
                         Yeah, why not? (He grabs his gun, snaps 
                         a cartridge into it, grabsup his coat, 
                         and quickly follows Tapp.
 
               Brief shot of K2K graffiti on the video and then loud static, 
               which snaps into an exterior nighttime view of an old warehouse 
               building and a car speeding by. Our view is from inside the car 
               as it pulls up alongside the building. A police radio can be 
               heard in the background. So can the sound of a gun being loaded 
               and cocked.
 
                                     TAPP
                         (VO) At least well have the cover of 
                         darkness.
 
                                     SING
                         (VO) Yeah, well, so will anybody else.
 
                         
               A shot of inside the factory, various clutter and tables piled 
               up on one another. No signs of life...yet. A bang from the outside 
               of the door is heard. A couple more bangs and a shot of the giant, 
               sliding wooden door as it slides open, and Sing steps in, holding 
               out his shotgun, ready for anything waiting for them. Cut up 
               to a staircase, lit by eerie green light, the same as from Pauls 
               razor wire room, as the detectives make their way up cautiously, 
               Tapp in front, Sing covering behind them. They come up another 
               level, one that has been recently used we see as Tapp points 
               over to a desk with a computer, a radio, and some other miscellaneous 
               items. Then, right next to the desk, we see the K2K graffiti 
               from the video.
 
                                     TAPP
                         I got you...

               They continue on, moving into a room separated with a chain link 
               fence. There is a slightly raised platform, going along part 
               of the wall, with a few steps leading up on either side. Tapp 
               goes up the steps. On the raised area are some tables covered 
               in heavy red cloth. Tapp points to one, reaches down, and pulls 
               back the covering. He reveals a small diorama of the bathroom 
               scene where Adam and Lawrence dolls, complete with the body, 
               dolls representing each of them.
 
                                     TAPP
                         What the hell is this?.......(his voice 
                         almost a whisper) Oh shit...
 
               They move onto the next table, and Tapp pulls back the cloth 
               covering that one, revealing the leering Puppet from Amandas 
               video. Tapp stares at it wide-eyed. Next to the puppet is a strange, 
               boar-like mask with long dark hair. The camera pans back so we 
               have the view of another large object covered in red cloth that 
               Tapp and Sing had passed by. Tapp leans in closer to look at 
               the puppet, when suddenly the still-covered form starts to move 
               and muffled moaning sounds are heard. It startles the detectives.
 
               
                                     SING
                         Oh fuck!

               They both go over and stand on either side of it, taking one 
               end of the red cloth whipping it off. Underneath is a man tied 
               to a chair with duct tape over his mouth, held in place by a 
               manacle around his neck. A contraption on the chair holds two 
               power drills about six inches from either side of his head, pointed 
               directly at his temples. His eyes wide, he moans through his 
               tape at the detectives.
 
               Suddenly, a door is heard clanging open on the other side of 
               the building, and the detectives spin to face the sound, guns 
               ready.
 
                                     TAPP
                         (looks to Sing, says softly) Wait Sing!
 
                         
                                     SING
                         (trying to keep his voice low but coming 
                         off a bit loudly) What?
 
                                     TAPP
                         (eager) Lets see what hes gonna do.
 
                         
                                     SING
                         Why? Weve fucking got him.

               Tapp however, having studied this guy for so long, wants to get 
               a good look at him before hes captured, see him in his element.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         We dont know what he looks like. Lets 
                         see what hes gonna do.
 
                                     SING
                         (rather loudly, again) No fucking way!
 
                         
               As the two argue, the man in the chair continues to protest his 
               position.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Sing, Sing! (he moves in front of the 
                         man a bit, holding up his hand to try 
                         to halt Sing, trying to convince him 
                         to go along with him.)
 
                                     SING
                         (isnt buying into it) Fuck that. Im 
                         gonna take him.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Sing!

                                     SING
                         What the fuck? Shit!

                                     TAPP
                         Wait Sing, listen.

               Whoever it is is moving closer, so they quickly cover up the 
               man and the other things they uncovered. The man in the chair 
               protests loudly through his gag and struggles as much as he can 
               in his chair. Sing and Tapp go and hide behind a tarp covering 
               the entryway to another room while a figure in a black robe lined 
               in red comes up on the elevator. The elevator stops, and the 
               figure moves forward, slowly and carefully. He goes up the steps 
               to the man in the chair. The figures hood is up; we do not see 
               his face. As he walks, he seems like he might be having a somewhat 
               difficult time with it.
 
               He reaches and uncovers the man, who begs in muffled tones through 
               the gag. When the figure speaks, we instantly know it is Jigsaw; 
               it is the unmistakable voice from the tapes and the video.
 
               
                                     JIGSAW
                         Awake already, Jeff? I need more powerful 
                         tranquilizers next time. (Jeff continues 
                         his cries, sheds a few tears. Jigsaw 
                         reaches over and touches his shoulder) 
                         Dont cry. Ive given your life a purpose. 
                         Youre a test subject for something 
                         greater than yourself.
 
               Thats when Sing cocks the shotgun and the two detectives move 
               out of their hiding spot, aiming their weapons at Jigsaw.
 
                                     SING
                         Freeze! Police!

                         Hold it right there! Dont move!

                         Put your fucking hands in the air!
 
                         
               Jigsaw slowly raises his hands, starts to turn to face them but 
               then quickly steps down hard on a red button on the floor, and 
               the drill trap on Jeffs chair comes to life. He remains with 
               his back mostly to them, hands still raised.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         Now youll make a choice. (Sing runs 
                         up the steps to try to where Jigsaw 
                         is, gun aimed at him. Tapp remains where 
                         he stands.) In 20 seconds, the life 
                         of this man will be ended.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Shut up and get down here!

                                     SING
                         (keeping his gun steadily aimed) What 
                         did you do? Turn it off!
 
               Jeff in the meantime is struggling in his seat as the drills 
               come closer.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Sing, stop that thing! Im taking this 
                         bastard down. (Sing tosses Tapp the 
                         shotgun.) Move!
 
                                     SING
                         (to Jigsaw) How do you turn it off?!
 
                         
                                     TAPP
                         Tell him how to stop it!

               Jigsaw backs up a bit towards the stairs.

                                     JIGSAW
                         One key will unlock it.

                                     SING
                         (frantic) Where is it?!

                                     JIGSAW
                         Its in the box.

                                     SING
                         Box! (He sees a box on the side of the 
                         chair and opens it. Inside he pulls 
                         out a ring of at least 30 keys, and 
                         goes over to behind Jeff to try to unlock 
                         the device. He tries a couple of keys, 
                         none working.) Fuck! Which key, which 
                         key?!
 
                                     TAPP
                         Tell him which key it is!

                                     JIGSAW
                         (now facing Tapp, moving closer to him. 
                         His back is to us, we still dont see 
                         his face.) Time is running out.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Shut up and get down here right now, 
                         asshole!
 
               Jigsaw slowly moves down towards him more.

                                     JIGSAW
                         Whats more important to you Officer, 
                         arresting me or the life of another 
                         human being?
 
               Sing keeps trying various keys. Tapp goes up Jigsaw and grabs 
               him, pushing him down to his knees. Jigsaw keeps his arms slightly 
               raised.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Get down on your knees!

                                     SING
                         Jesus! Tapp! Tapp!

                                     TAPP
                         (gun aimed at the back of Jigsaws head) 
                         Hands behind your head! (Jigsaw obliges) 
                         Sick bastard.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         Yes, I am sick, Officer.

                                     SING
                         (still trying various keys, none working. 
                         Hes in a full-fledged panic. Jeff closes 
                         his eyes, crying, as the drills are 
                         only 2 inches away) Tapp! Its like, 
                         theres a hundred keys in here!
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         Sick from the disease eating away at 
                         me inside. Sick of people who dont 
                         appreciate their blessings. Sick of 
                         those who scoff at the suffering of 
                         others.
 
               Sing finally whips out his gun and shoots each drill, breaking 
               and stopping them. Tapp glances up at him, briefly distracted 
               by the gunfire.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (as he pops a blade out of a wristband 
                         hidden up his right sleeve) Sick of 
                         it all! (He lashes upwards, slashing 
                         Tapps throat)
 
                                     SING
                         (seeing the throat slash) Tapp!!! (runs 
                         down from Jeff towards them. Tapp clutches 
                         his throat, completely surprised, gurgling.)
 
                         
               Jigsaw RUNS, fast as he can, out of the room. Sing takes a couple 
               of shots at him and misses. He stops when he reaches Tapp, who 
               is slumped against the fence/wall and bends down next to him.
 
               
                                     SING
                         (desperate, a trace of despair) No, 
                         no! Tapp! Shit!
 
               Tapp gurgles at him, hands him the shotgun.

                                     SING
                         (standing, touching Tapp on the shoulder 
                         then head) Ill be back, okay? Ill 
                         be back.
 
               Tapp just kind of nods, gurgling and holding his throat. Sing 
               spins around and then starts chasing Jigsaw through the warehouse, 
               out of the room and down a flight of stairs. He moves down a 
               long, misty corridor, gun up, moving quickly but still cautiously. 
               He takes a right, goes down another flight of stairs then takes 
               another right, stopping and looking down a short flight of stairs. 
               Quick cut to Tapp starting to try to get up, holding his throat. 
               He drags himself along the floor.
 
               Back to Sing, who cocks his shotgun, then moves down the stairs 
               very cautiously. He takes a left around the corner, finds himself 
               facing down another corridor, where he sees Jigsaw trying to 
               get away. He takes aim.
 
                                     SING
                         (shouting) Freeze or Ill shoot!

               Jigsaw continues moving, so Sing fires. He hits, and Jigsaw goes 
               down. Sing pauses, waiting to see if he gets back up. Jigsaw 
               doesnt move, so Sing cocks the gun again and starts to slowly 
               move forward towards him. Cut to a shot of Tapp as he struggles 
               to his feet and starts towards the stairs to follow Sing.
 
               Back to Sing, moving further down the hall. He gets about halfway 
               down it when we see a shot of his feet just at a trip-wire. Over 
               it are some cobwebs hanging down. He reaches to part them, and 
               steps forward into the wire. As he steps we see a shot of a shotgun 
               with wire slowly pulling down on the trigger. Sing looks up, 
               and the trigger of that gun and six other shotguns pointing down 
               directly at him fire. Sing is hit, blood splattering against 
               him and the wall. We see only from his shoulders down. He spasms 
               for a moment, then falls forward to his knees. Cut to Tapp, who 
               is making strange vowel sounds, moving down the flight of stairs 
               just before the hallway where Sing now is.
 
               On his knees, Sing remains upright for a moment, spasming more. 
               We go to a shot of Jigsaw on the floor. Jigsaw starts moving 
               and gets himself up to his feet, and starts hobbling further 
               down the hall. Sings body finally falls forward onto the floor, 
               spasming still. Tapp continues down the stairs, falling against 
               the wall a couple of times. We see Jigsaw as he gets to the end 
               of the hall and starts sliding a large door open.
 
               At that moment, Tapp reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns 
               into the hallway, collapsing back into a sitting position on 
               the stairs. Jigsaw hobbles through the door and starts to go 
               left. Tapp sits up a bit and looks down the hall, where he sees 
               Sing, who has stopped spasming. His eyes widening, Tapp removes 
               the hand from his throat and reaches forward towards Sing, his 
               mouth opening and moving but no sound other than some gasping 
               coming out. The shot fades to a slow-paced black and white, and 
               then snaps into a few crime scene photos of Sings body, including 
               a nice gory one of the top of his head, part of which is now 
               missing.
 
               At the last photoflash, we cut back to a shot of Tapp presently, 
               sitting on his couch. The shot shows a good view of the scar 
               across his neck.
 
                                     TAPP
                         (weak, desperate) Had you...had you 
                         on your knees. (He sits forward, getting 
                         some things off the coffee table) Youre 
                         running. Youre running...(He gets up 
                         and goes over to the desk in the corner 
                         with the audio recording device and 
                         dozens of photos pinned to the wall, 
                         takes a seat) Youre running scared 
                         because we had you. Im going to close 
                         this case. Ram close it. (He picks up 
                         a small framed photograph, which we 
                         cant see, but likely, its of Sing.) 
                         Right, Sing? Right? Were gonna close 
                         it, Sing.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         X Marks the spot...(He stands, touching 
                         the pipe and looking up and around a 
                         bit.) X marks the spot...we need to 
                         search this room again. (He turns and 
                         looks over at Adam.) What are you doing 
                         over there?
 
               Cut back into regular view in the bathroom, with a shot of Adam 
               sitting on the tub, holding the photograph of Alison and Diana 
               just beneath the edge of the inside of the tub, looking down 
               at it. He ignores Lawrence, flipping the photo over.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (irritated) Excuse me?

                                     ADAM
                         (glancing up; calm irritation) Just 
                         because Im stuck in this room with 
                         you doesnt mean I have to report to 
                         you every ten seconds.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sighs) I really dont see the point 
                         in us not helping one another.
 
                                     ADAM
                         well what do you want me to do? Im 
                         on a leash.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Thats exactly why we need to talk. 
                         We need to think!
 
                                     ADAM
                         I am thinking!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (snapping at him) Well then dont keep 
                         me in the dark about what youre thinking!
 
                         
               There is a pause as something about that statement strikes Adam.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         Turn off the lights.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         What?

                                     ADAM
                         (letting the photo fall into the tub 
                         as he stands) Turn them off now, please!
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (doesnt get it) Why?

                                     ADAM
                         (impatiently) Just turn them off for 
                         a second!
 
               Lawrence stares at him oddly but moves backwards, reaching over 
               and flipping off the lights. Adam looks around. Lawrence looks 
               around too, but he sees nothing. He doesnt seem to think this 
               is going to help any. Then we see on the wall next to him a glow 
               in the dark X painted on the tiles. He doesnt see it and shrugs, 
               but Adam spots it.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Jesus, behind you!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (turns and sees it, is surprised) How 
                         come we didnt see that before?
 
                                     ADAM
                         The lights in here hadnt charged it. 
                         It must be glow in the dark paint or 
                         something.
 
               Lawrence turns and flips the lights back on, both of them wincing 
               slightly at the sudden transition from dark to bright white, 
               though not as much as before. Lawrence leans over and picks up 
               his hacksaw, going over to the tiles where the X is and starts 
               hitting the tiles with the handle of the hacksaw. He breaks through, 
               reaching into a small cavity in the wall and pulling out a small 
               brown box with a hinged lid. He cant believe it. He looks to 
               Adam, a small grin on his face. He places it on the floor and 
               sits down behind it.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (excitedly) Open it!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (turns it around so we and Adam can 
                         see the small lock on it.) Its locked. 
                         (He pauses, thinking, then realizes 
                         something) The key, the one from my 
                         envelope. Where is it?
 
               Adam looks around him, then leans down, looking on the floor 
               for the key.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (soft, hushed tone as he looks) Where 
                         the fuck...Here. (He finds it, picks 
                         it up and tosses it over.)
 
               Lawrence picks up the key, tries it on the lock. It works. He 
               takes the lock off, opens the box. He holds up a cell phone, 
               smiling in relief.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (big smile) Cell phone. The most beautiful 
                         invention on this planet!
 
               Lawrence takes out and holds up one of two cigarettes. Adam lets 
               out a joyful laugh.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Make that second most beautiful invention! 
                         (He reaches out his hand for Lawrence 
                         to toss it.) Give me that.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Are you joking? Youre gonna put something 
                         we found in this room in your mouth?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (pause, then) Yes, Im willing to risk 
                         it! Give me that sweet cancer. (Lawrence 
                         ignores his request, tosses out the 
                         other cigarette and a lighter. He finds 
                         lastly a small folded up note with the 
                         words Shh, Doctor, written on it.) I 
                         dont care, I really dont. Give me 
                         one of those.
 
               Jigsaws voiceover reads whats written on the note as Lawrence 
               opens the paper and reads it, keeping it low in the box where 
               Adam cant see it.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO) The cigarettes are harmless, I 
                         promise. Smoking is only poisonous when 
                         it ends in bloodshed. Think about this 
                         - you dont need a gun to kill Adam.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (growing impatient) May I please have 
                         a cigarette?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (ignoring his plea) Im trying the police. 
                         (He flips open and dials on the cell 
                         phone, but a weird beeping noise indicating 
                         the call cant go through comes from 
                         the phone. He dials again, same result.) 
                         Shit. (Pause, thinks.) This was meant 
                         to receive calls, not make them. (A 
                         moment; he realizes something.) Wait 
                         a minute...this has happened before.
 
                         
               Cut back to an overhead descending view inside a parking garage.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (VO) Last night, after I finished at 
                         the hospital. (fade into another closer 
                         shot of the cars, and Lawrence walking 
                         down the corridor, carrying his briefcase.) 
                         I was walking back to my car. (He stops 
                         a moment) I thought I was alone, but 
                         Im sure someone else was there. (He 
                         squints, bringing his hand up over his 
                         eyes. There is a flash from the side. 
                         He looks up, startled, looking in the 
                         direction in which he thinks it came 
                         from, but sees nothing. He looks around 
                         him for another moment, then continues 
                         forward to his car.)
 
               Cut to a shot within a circular overhead mirror of Lawrences 
               car pulling up to an abandoned security gate station. He gets 
               out of the car, shutting the door and going over to a phone on 
               the wall to dial security to let him out. When he dials, though, 
               it gives him a busy signal. As it beeps, we cut to another shot 
               of his car in the mirror. The back door on the passenger side 
               starts to slowly open. Back to Lawrence, who hangs up the phone, 
               aggravated, and reaches into his pocket for his cell phone. He 
               opens it and dials. Back in the mirror, we see something get 
               out of the car on its hands and knees. It is in a red robe and 
               has a strangely shaped head with long, tangly dark hair. Lawrence 
               finishes dialing, holds the phone to his ear but receives the 
               same beeping tone as the phone in the bathroom, indicating that 
               he cannot make outgoing calls. Perplexed, he holds up the phone, 
               trying to get a better signal. Alongside the car, the thing moves 
               even closer now. It gets up slowly. We see that it is wearing 
               the strange boar mask previously seen in the flashback of Jigsaws 
               workshop. It suddenly rushes upon him as hes distracted with 
               his phone and grabs him.
 
               Cut back to Lawrence sitting on the floor in the bathroom, still 
               holding the phone.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (His eyes distant, off in his memory) 
                         That...thing. It was waiting for me. 
                         (He exhales sharply, then looks back 
                         up at Adam. Adam is just standing there, 
                         staring at him. Something seems a bit...off. 
                         With a suspicious tone, Lawrence addresses 
                         him.) How did you know to turn off the 
                         lights?
 
                                     ADAM
                         Who cares? It worked.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Yeah, but how did you know?

                                     ADAM
                         (a slight pause) Instinct. (His tone 
                         is far from believable.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (doesnt believe a word of it) Instinct?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         Yeah.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         You know what? (he looks down, then 
                         back up at Adam.) Youre a terrible 
                         liar.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (quiet offense) You say that like you 
                         know me.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (speaks calmly, but anger lies underneath 
                         the surface) What else arent you telling 
                         me?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (cocky and sarcastic) Well, um, lets 
                         see. On my sixth birthday, my best friend 
                         at that time, Scott Tibbs, stabbed me 
                         with a rusty nail. I didnt tell you 
                         about that. I didnt tell you that 
                         my last girlfriend, (Lawrence lowers 
                         his head into his hands. Un-FUCKING-believable) 
                         who was a feminist vegan punk, broke 
                         up with me because she thought I was 
                         too angry. Uh, I havent told you that 
                         one of my toenails is slightly...
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (snaps at him, fed up) Just stop it. 
                         You knew to turn off these lights.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (turning away from Lawrence) What-ever.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (stands up, frustrated.) Im dealing 
                         with a juvenile.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (has had it, looks right at him) You 
                         wanna know?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (exasperated) Yeah!

               Adam leans down and reaches into the bathtub, pulls out and holds 
               up the picture of Alison and Diana.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (with a somewhat aggressive attitude) 
                         Here it is. (He throws it towards Lawrence, 
                         who looks down at it, then back up at 
                         Adam before getting down on the floor 
                         and pulling it towards him with the 
                         hinged box. He picks it up, sitting 
                         up as he looks upon it with shock. )
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (very softly, shakily) Oh God...(he 
                         turns it over, then back. Adam casts 
                         his eyes downwards, still standing but 
                         cooling off, feeling bad for Lawrence) 
                         W...where did you get this?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (softly) It was in your wallet, behind 
                         the photo of your daughter.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         W...why didnt you show me this before?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         I couldnt. (Lawrence begins to shakily 
                         sob, touching the photo.) Im sorry. 
                         (Adam goes over and sits against a pipe 
                         in his corner, lowering his head and 
                         upper body forward, holding his head 
                         in his hands.)
 
               Lawrence sniffles, shaking, then looks right to the surveillance 
               camera behind the glass and screams.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         What are you doing to them you bastard?! 
                         (He goes back to huddling over the photograph, 
                         sniffling and crying for a moment. Then, 
                         he sits up, trying to pull himself together) 
                         Okay...okay..(he looks around a bit) 
                         Okay, Ive got to think now...(He looks 
                         down, sees the note again in the box.)
 
                         
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO) Think about this...you dont need 
                         a gun to kill Adam. When theres that 
                         much poison in your blood (a slow shot 
                         moving to the pool of blood from the 
                         body in front of Lawrence), the only 
                         thing left to do is shoot yourself.
 
                         
               Lawrence looks at the body, then down. Hes getting an idea. 
               He takes a cigarette, glances over at Adam, who still has his 
               head down in his hands. He dips the end of the cigarette in the 
               blood, then puts it back in the box. He starts to get up. Adam 
               looks up, sees him standing.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What are you doing?

               Lawrence goes to the light, looks at the camera, suddenly flips 
               off the lights. We see a shot of Zep startling when the lights 
               go out on the monitor, then we go back to the darkened bathroom.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         Hey! What the hell are you doing?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (whispering so the surveillance camera 
                         will not pick him up) Adam, listen to 
                         me. I want you to play along with me 
                         on this.
 
               Zep leans in, trying to hear whats being said, but the static 
               of the video is too loud. He tries to adjust the sound, but to 
               no avail. Shot goes back into the bathroom, where Lawrence is 
               finishing saying something to Adam.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         You got that? (he turns the lights back 
                         on, both of them again wincing at the 
                         bright light. Lawrence glances at the 
                         surveillance camera, then looks to Adam.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (trying to be nonchalant) So you uh, 
                         still want that cigarette?
 
                                     ADAM
                         Um...yeah, sure.

               Lawrence makes a show of reaching into the box where the poisoned 
               cigarette is, but takes the other un-dipped one instead. He throws 
               it to Adam, who reaches down and picks it up from where it lands. 
               Lawrence throws the lighter as well. Adam puts the cigarette 
               between his lips and reaches down, picking up the lighter. He 
               glances over at Lawrence, who watches him intently. Adam just 
               shrugs then lights up. He takes a long drag, then exhales in 
               a sigh of relief and with a smile. He takes another drag then 
               suddenly freezes, his head jerking and a strange gurgling sound 
               coming from his throat. His head jerks more then the rest of 
               his body, his eyes widening. His hand drops the cigarette and 
               goes to his throat as he turns, still jerky and making a strange, 
               almost squeaky choking sound in his throat. The sound grows louder 
               as he falls to his knees, then back a bit, his left arm held 
               out in front of him dramatically. He falls backwards onto the 
               floor, twitching some more, still choking. He lets out a long 
               cough, suddenly stops jerking, and closes his eyes. The death 
               in its entirety is very, very fake.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (watches Adam, then turns to the surveillance 
                         camera, speaks with angry finality) 
                         There! Ive done it! Ive killed him 
                         with the poison, just like you wanted. 
                         (shouting) Now wheres my family?! Where 
                         are they?!
 
               Suddenly, we go to a shot of Adam lying there and a loud, electrical 
               buzzing sound is heard as his body jerks to life and he cries 
               out. He spasms and jerks around as he is electrocuted, and Lawrence 
               looks upon him in shock. Finally, the electrocution stops, and 
               Adam sits up slightly, gasping, eyes wide.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (he shrieks in pain and shock) Jesus 
                         Christ!!
 
               Lawrences reaction is not one of concern; he simply cant believe 
               that Adam just screwed up the plan.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (disbelief) What?

                                     ADAM
                         (wide eyed) I just got electrocuted!
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         What? (he rolls his eyes. Unbelievable. 
                         He speaks in a hushed tone.) That was 
                         our way out!
 
               Adam looks at him in shock, cannot believe Lawrence would think 
               hed make something like that up.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (yelling at him) Did you hear what I 
                         said? (he desperately grabs at the manacle 
                         around his ankle, pulling at it and 
                         shrieking) Get this thing off me! Get 
                         it off!
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (pissed off) Stop acting!

                                     ADAM
                         (stops pulling at the manacle and chains; 
                         now hes pissed at Lawrence for his 
                         disbelief) You think I would make that 
                         up just to mess up your stupid fucking 
                         charade?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (gives up on Adam, frustrated once more) 
                         All right, thats it! (He leans over 
                         and picks up his saw, sits down and 
                         starts trying to saw through his chains 
                         again, grunting. Adam, in the meantime, 
                         just sits back against the wall, breathing 
                         heavily, looking dazed. Lawrence continues 
                         to franticly saw, but it doesnt work. 
                         He gets pissed off and throws the blade 
                         down.) Ah, Damn it!!
 
               Back to Adam, still looking dazed. Suddenly, a look of realization 
               dawns upon his face. The electrocution has jogged his memory.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         (wide-eyed) I remember everything now. 
                         (Lawrence glances over at him.) I remember 
                         how I got here.
 
               Flashback to Adam walking up the stairs in his apartment building, 
               a camera around his neck, smoking a cigarette and listening to 
               music on his headphones. He walks with an uncaring, slow swagger. 
               He gets to the top of the stairs and walks down a red-lit hallway 
               to his apartment. He goes inside, closing the door behind him 
               then moving into the kitchen area, throwing his keys onto the 
               table and opening the fridge. The entire apartment is very rundown, 
               decrepit, dingy and old; truly a shithole apartment as Adam described 
               it earlier. There is graffiti on the door and walls, the wallpaper 
               is fading and peeling, the refrigerator is dirty.
 
               Adam opens the fridge and looks inside for a moment. He sighs, 
               then closes the door. He heads over to his darkroom, closing 
               the door behind him. The lighting is dark red. He puts the camera 
               down on the table, taking the strap off from around his neck, 
               takes off his headphones and cd player, presses stop and puts 
               them down off to the side. He sighs tiredly and goes over to 
               a tray where a photo is developing and picks it up with his fingers, 
               ganging it with a closepin on a hanging line with other photos. 
               It is a picture of a man wearing sunglasses. The man is in fact 
               Lawrence. To the left of that one is a shot of Lawrence in the 
               parking garage with his hand over his eyes.
 
               The camera cuts to a shot of the newest photo through a peephole 
               in the darkroom door as the camera fades out and back, viewing 
               the grafittied door of the darkroom before the shot fades to 
               black, industrial music playing over the shot.
 
               Cut to Adam sleeping in the now pitch-black darkroom, his head 
               down on the table. He wakes up abruptly, as though he hadnt 
               meant to fall asleep. He looks around, confused, wondering why 
               all the lights out. He gives a Great, another problem type of 
               sigh. He stands and yawns, reaching over for the lightswitch. 
               He moves it up and down a few times, but nothing happens. Another 
               aggravated sigh. He reaches down and finds a flashlight on the 
               counter, presses the on button but it doesnt work. Pissed, he 
               shakes it hard, trying to get it to come on, but that doesnt 
               work. He looks at it, scoffs.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Great.

               Suddenly, he hears something move outside the door, somewhere 
               in his apartment. On alert, he listens. He looks down and picks 
               up his camera, slinging it around his neck and holding it out 
               in front of him. He opens the creaky door into his also pitch-black 
               apartment. He takes a few steps forward, speaks nervously, but 
               trying to be brave.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Is someone there? (he takes a picture, 
                         the flash lighting up the area in front 
                         of him.) I can hear you. (He takes another 
                         picture, the flash lighting up a living 
                         room area. Nothing yet. He moves forward 
                         more, into the kitchen entryway, snapping 
                         away for light.)
 
               Suddenly, from behind him, an EVIL DOLL LAUGH is heard. He startles, 
               spinning around.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (his voice alarmed but confused at the 
                         same time) What the...? (He snaps a 
                         picture in its direction and sees the 
                         Puppet from Jigsaws workshop and video 
                         sitting in an armchair, continuing its 
                         evil laugh.) Christ! (He reaches down 
                         and finds a baseball bat on the floor, 
                         and starts hitting the doll as hard 
                         as he can until the laugh starts to 
                         fade and then just dies out. ) What 
                         the...
 
               He hears the sound of movement again, coming from just behind 
               him in a closet. He goes on alert again, holding up the baseball 
               bat and the camera.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Who is that?! Whos in there?! (he moves 
                         towards the door, shaking but trying 
                         to be a tough guy) Come on out! Ill 
                         kill you, you motherfucker! (He opens 
                         the door, holds the camera and takes 
                         a picture. As soon as the flash goes 
                         off we see the red-robed pig thing that 
                         originally grabbed Lawrence quickly 
                         move forward and grab Adam.)
 
               Suddenly, the cell phone rings. Lawrence looks down at it in 
               slight surprise. Adam snaps out of his daze to look at it as 
               well. Lawrence glances over at Adam and then carefully reaches 
               down, picks it up and answers it. The scene will cut back and 
               forth to Diana and Alison in the room and Lawrence on the phone 
               for the duration of the conversation.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (not sure what to expect) Who is this?
 
                         
                                     DIANA
                         (on the phone, sobbing) Daddy?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Diana? (he stands)

                                     DIANA
                         Daddy, is that you? (cut to a shot of 
                         her being held by Zep, the phone to 
                         her ear.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (getting sniffly) Yeah baby, its me. 
                         Im here. (Adam watches him intently)
 
                         
                                     DIANA
                         (sobbing) Im scared, Daddy.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (trying his best to reassure her) Dont 
                         worry honey, everythings going to be 
                         okay. Wheres Mommy?
 
                                     DIANA
                         Shes here with me.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Staying as calm and collected as he 
                         can for his daughter) Let me talk to 
                         her sweetie, okay? Put Mommy on.
 
                                     DIANA
                         The bad man from my room is here. He 
                         has us tied up and he has a gun.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         W...what man?

                                     DIANA
                         Please come home Daddy! (Zep kisses 
                         her on the top of her head and takes 
                         the phone away to give to Alison.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Hello? Hello? Diana?

               Zep pushes some of Alisons hair behind her ear with the barrel 
               of the gun.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (desperate) Diana! Diana!

               Zep puts the phone up to Alisons ear.

                                     ALISON
                         Larry?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Ally? Is that you? (We see a shot of 
                         Alison giving a threatening look through 
                         her tears to Zep.)
 
                                     ALISON
                         Is Adam there?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (surprised, looks to Adam, who continues 
                         to watch him worriedly) How do you know? 
                         Ally, what is going on?
 
                                     ALISON
                         (through her sobs, trying to calm them 
                         and get this message to him) Dont believe 
                         Adams lies. He knows you. He knew all 
                         about you before today. (Zep quickly 
                         takes the phone away, hangs up. Cut 
                         back to the bathroom, Lawrence on the 
                         phone.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a dial tone is heard from the other 
                         end hanging up. Lawrence is desperate) 
                         Hello? Ally? Ally? (No answer, just 
                         the dial tone. He stands up.) Hello? 
                         (He looks to the surveillance camera, 
                         screaming) God damn you! If you so much 
                         as lay a finger on them, Ill kill you! 
                         You hear me? You son of a bitch! Ill 
                         kill you! (He sits down, leaning forward 
                         over the floor, crying a bit. He slams 
                         his fist fiercely against the floor.)
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (quietly, as though cautiously approaching 
                         a dangerous animal) Are they okay?
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sits up. His voice is calmer, but rage 
                         is clearly underneath the surface) My 
                         wife, she uh, she mentioned your name.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (a brief Oh shit look appears in his 
                         eyes, but he acts surprised) What did 
                         she say?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (not looking at him yet. Speaks very 
                         firmly, trying to suppress his rage.) 
                         She told me...not to believe you.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (cannot even look at Lawrence.) Believe 
                         me about what? (There is no doubt hes 
                         hiding something)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Finally turns to look at him, the look 
                         of 1000 deaths) She told me you knew 
                         me. (He stands, looming menacingly, 
                         the look stronger on his face) Who are 
                         you?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (still trying to cover up and losing, 
                         still not making eye contact) You know 
                         who I am.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (snaps, shouting at him) Stop the lies! 
                         Youre a liar! I need to know the truth!
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (His tone changes, hes had it with 
                         hiding, had it with Lawrence) Im a 
                         liar? (Finally, he looks up, right at 
                         Lawrence. His voice is firm and accusing.) 
                         What did you do last night, Lawrence? 
                         Work at a hospital? Saving sick children? 
                         You told me that after you left your 
                         house last night, you went to work at 
                         a hospital.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (defensively) Thats because its the 
                         truth.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (almost deadly) No its not. Your wife 
                         is right, Larry. (Lawrence is now the 
                         one wearing the Oh shit look.) You dont 
                         recall getting your picture taken in 
                         that parking lot?
 
               Brief flashback shot of Lawrence in the parking garage, pausing 
               and covering his eyes for a moment when the camera flashed. We 
               see a shot of Adam holding the camera and taking the shot from 
               around a corner, ducking back behind the column. Lawrence looks 
               up at the flash, startled.
 
               Cut back to the bathroom. Adam stands up, his stance and body 
               language accusing of Lawrence. He speaks fiercely, disgusted 
               with Lawrences two-faced bullshit.
 
                                     ADAM
                         I can prove that you didnt go anywhere 
                         near a hospital last night. (He leans 
                         over and pulls out the garbage bag from 
                         the tub. Lawrence stands, staring at 
                         him in near disbelief. He has been caught. 
                         Adam takes a handful of photos from 
                         the baggie hed kept hidden inside the 
                         garbage bag, holds them up and throws 
                         them down, scattering them.) Its not 
                         the first time Ive done it either, 
                         Larry. (Lawrence leans over to look 
                         at the photos on the floor in front 
                         of him with complete and utter disbelief, 
                         picking one up and looking down at it) 
                         Ive been taking pictures of you for 
                         a few days now. (Shots of some of Adams 
                         pictures. Lawrence going into a building, 
                         Lawrence at an outdoor café eating lunch.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (still holding the photograph) But...why?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         You wanna know what I do? I get paid 
                         to take pictures of rich guys like you 
                         who go to seedy, out-of-the-way motels 
                         to fuck their secretaries. (we start 
                         seeing more shots Adam took while following 
                         Lawrence) Last night I went to your 
                         house. (Flashback of Adam holding his 
                         camera, then cut to several photographs 
                         of Lawrence leaving his house, glancing 
                         over his shoulder and moving down the 
                         sidewalk) I watched you leave. I followed 
                         you (Lawrence in the parking garage, 
                         photographs of the exterior of the Hotel 
                         Barfly. Lawrence inside the hotel, knocking 
                         on the door to one of the rooms while 
                         Adam hides around the corner with his 
                         camera) all the way to that shitbag 
                         hotel. (Photographs of Lawrence standing 
                         outside then going into the room.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (calm with rage just beneath the surface) 
                         Youve uh, had these with you the whole 
                         time?
 
                                     ADAM
                         I found them, in there (points to the 
                         toilet; quick flashback of Adam pulling 
                         the bag out of the top of the toilet, 
                         then Adam opening the bag and seeing 
                         the hacksaws and a glimpse of something 
                         else in the bag.) with the hacksaws. 
                         (Flashback of Adam tossing the bag into 
                         the bathtub while Lawrence isnt looking.) 
                         I dont know how they got there.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (angry) Yeah, right. Youre so full 
                         of it! (He angrily crumples up and throws 
                         the photo he was holding at Adam)
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (scoffing tone) Aww, face it, Larry, 
                         were both bulls hitters. But my camera 
                         isnt. It doesnt know how to lie. It 
                         only shows you whats put right in front 
                         of it. Just out of curiosity, what did 
                         you do in that motel room? You got out 
                         of there pretty fast.
 
               Cut to a flashback, the hotel room. Carla, the pretty Asian girl 
               from the hospital, is inside the room, now in a black lacy top 
               and a gray/blue skirt, waiting for him. She opens the door, taking 
               a step back as he enters. He looks unsure of the whole situation, 
               a changed attitude this evening from all the others. He shuts 
               the door behind him, and Carla smiles at him. Lawrences tone 
               when he speaks is unhappy. Not enraged, just somewhat disapproving.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Why did you um, deem it necessary to 
                         page me when you knew I was at home?
 
                         
                                     CARLA
                         I didnt know if you were going to make 
                         it. (turns, goes and sits on the bed.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sounding very business-like) But I 
                         gave you a precise time at which to 
                         page me. (He puts the briefcase on a 
                         chair by the door then goes over and 
                         sits down next to her on the bed.) You 
                         cant do that.
 
                                     CARLA
                         Its not like I know the rules for this 
                         sort of stuff. (She starts unbuttoning 
                         her shirt. Lawrence holds out his hand 
                         and stops her. She looks up at him, 
                         concerned.) Whats wrong, Dr. Gordon?
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (a sigh in his voice) Look, it was wrong 
                         for me to makes you come here.
 
                                     CARLA
                         (confused, hurt) But I thought we-
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         -Please. (very softly) Im sorry. (He 
                         stands and heads over to the door. Carla 
                         remains sitting on the bed. She sniffles 
                         slightly but doesnt cry.)
 
               Suddenly, the hotel room phone rings. Carla and Lawrence both 
               look at it, unsure, startled. Carla looks to Lawrence.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         You tell anyone you were here?

                                     CARLA
                         No. (She stands, goes over to the phone 
                         and answers it.) Hello? (She listens, 
                         turns to Lawrence) Its for you. (She 
                         holds out the phone.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         For me? (He walks over, takes the phone.) 
                         Hello?
 
               The voice on the other end is male, slightly raspy. It is unidentifiable; 
               it could be either Tapp or Zep, or someone else. It is very accusing.
 
               
                                     VOICE
                         I know what youre doing...Doctor.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         I- (but the other person hangs up, and 
                         a dial tone is heard)
 
               Lawrence hangs up the phone, turns and moves to the door. Carla 
               moves with him, watching, waiting for him to say who it was.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (nervous) I have to go.

                                     CARLA
                         What happened?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Ive got to go. (He picks up his briefcase 
                         from the chair, and heads out the door.
 
                         
               Cut to the underground parking lot, the same shot as where Adam 
               took Lawrences picture. He walks along, pauses to wince and 
               cover his eyes, then the flash. He looks up startled.
 
               The shot cuts back to Lawrence leaning forward against the wall 
               in his corner, hand against a pipe. He slowly looks up at Adam, 
               thinking of something.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Who was it?

                                     ADAM
                         Who was what?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         The person who paid you to follow me, 
                         who was it?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (internal shrug) He calls himself Bob 
                         and he gives me the money up front. 
                         Two hundred bucks a night. If Id have 
                         known I was gonna end up here, I wouldve 
                         asked for a hell of a lot more.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (pissy) What does that mean? Does that 
                         mean you saw what happened to me?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (internal eye roll; speaks as though 
                         hes been over this 100 times before) 
                         What I saw was you get into your car. 
                         Thats it. I didnt ask your name. I 
                         didnt know who you were. I dont know 
                         how I got here, I dont know how you 
                         got here. I just took the shots (As 
                         he speaks, a quick flashback of Adam 
                         taking a picture, going up apartment 
                         stairs, then in the darkroom) and went 
                         straight home to develop the. Next thing 
                         I know Im chained to a pipe in some 
                         prehistoric bathroom, staring at the 
                         guy Ive been taking shots of all night.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (seeing a major break in this mystery) 
                         Clearly, whoever paid you to take the 
                         pictures of me is the one who put is 
                         in here.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (they dont know that for sure) Maybe.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Maybe? What do you mean maybe? Of course 
                         it is! What did he look like?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (internal shrug) I dont know, he was 
                         just a guy. (Shot of inside Adams apartment 
                         and an unidentifiable figure towards 
                         the back of the room, the image darkened 
                         so we cant make him out. The figure 
                         slowly takes a step towards us/Adam)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Was he tall, was he skinny, obese, what?
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         I dont take notes about his appearance. 
                         (Shot inside apartment, the figure moves 
                         closer)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (aggravated, how can he not remember 
                         anything?) You must remember something 
                         about him.
 
                                     ADAM
                         I cant. (Shot of inside the apartment, 
                         the figure moves closer)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Youre telling me you dont remember 
                         a thing about the guy?
 
                                     ADAM
                         I told you, I- (inside apartment, the 
                         figure moves closer, just about close 
                         enough for identification)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (enraged, throwing his hands up) Oh 
                         for fucks sake! I give up!
 
                                     ADAM
                         (gives up his playing dumb tone, gives 
                         in due to irritation with Lawrence) 
                         Hes a tall black guy, hes got a scar 
                         around his neck, okay? (Shot of inside 
                         the apartment, the figure moves into 
                         a viewable light; It is Tapp.)
 
               Lawrence is leaning against the wall facing away from Adam. At 
               hearing Adams description, he slowly moves back, turns around 
               to face Adam.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Tapp! (shot of inside Adams apartment, 
                         Tapp handing us/Adam money. Adams/our 
                         hand reaches out and takes it quickly. 
                         Then, back to Lawrence) Detective Tapp!
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         Whoa, the guy who paid me to take these 
                         photos was not a cop.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         No, no, he was discharged from the police 
                         force. (Shot of Tapp at his desk with 
                         the Amanda video, looking at notes.) 
                         He broke down after his partner was 
                         killed (Tapp and Sing sitting next to 
                         each other in Lawrences office), but 
                         that didnt stop him from harassing 
                         me. (Lawrence sitting in the car next 
                         to Tapp) The guy became obsessed. (Tapp 
                         in his current apartment adjusting the 
                         camera in the window, then a shot of 
                         him leaning over a notebook, going over 
                         notes.) Hes convinced himself that 
                         I must have somehow been involved with 
                         the murders. Hes...hes crazy. (Tapp 
                         at the corner desk in his apartment, 
                         giving a crazy-sounding Heh heh heh 
                         laugh. The shot cuts back to Lawrence, 
                         who points accusingly at Adam.) And 
                         you helped him. (disgusted) You took 
                         money from him to invade my privacy. 
                         How could you do that?
 
                                     ADAM
                         (bite me tone) Call it my need to eat.
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sarcastic) Right, right. You know what 
                         Adam? Youre not a victim of this game, 
                         youre a part of it. (Points accusingly 
                         at him as he says this.)
 
                                     ADAM
                         Oh really? Obviously this cop thinks 
                         youre the one behind it all.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (Facing into the corner of his cell, 
                         turning around slightly, internal eye 
                         roll.) I told you, hes not a cop. Hes 
                         a bottom feeder, just like you. (A slight 
                         sneer from Lawrence at Adam. Lawrence 
                         turns back into his corner)
 
                                     ADAM
                         (getting REALLY pissed at Lawrences 
                         attitude towards him) What are you more 
                         pissed off about? The fact that I took 
                         some shots of you or the fact that I 
                         took some shots of you while you were 
                         cheating on your wife?
 
               Lawrence spins out of his corner, screaming in rage.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         I did not cheat on her!!!

                                     ADAM
                         What do you care what I think anyway? 
                         I dont give a crap if you covered yourself 
                         in peanut butter and had a 15-hooker 
                         gang bang!
 
               A pause, then Lawrence collapses onto the floor. Hes lost the 
               last of any strength, level headedness or control he had before.
 
               
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (weakly) How did I get here? (Adam sits 
                         down on the pipe in his corner, leaning 
                         forward a bit.) I had...I had everything 
                         in order. (he lays down on his side, 
                         facing Adam, who watches him with sympathy) 
                         My whole life was in perfect order. 
                         (He holds up and looks at the picture 
                         of Alison and Diana gagged.)
 
               Cut to the Gordons Bedroom. Zep puts Alisons gag back on her, 
               then leaves the room. Alison moves her head around to loosen 
               the gag then spits it out. She tries to fight her sobs as she 
               speaks softly to Diana.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Sweetheart, are you okay? (Diana shakes 
                         her head no) Mommy just needs you to 
                         be really, really, really strong right 
                         now. Im not gonna let anybody hurt 
                         you. You got that? (Diana nods) Okay, 
                         thats my good girl. (She starts crying 
                         as her hands work behind her to loosen 
                         the rope around them.)
 
               Cut back to Adam in the bathroom, looking up slightly from his 
               position. He glances back down at the photographs on the floor, 
               notices something odd about one of them. He furrows his brow 
               and gets down on his hands and knees, reaching over and picking 
               it up, leaning back and looking at it, studying it. Camera cuts 
               to a shot of Lawrence through the black and white surveillance 
               camera, sitting on the floor. Adams next line is a voice over 
               over this shot.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Hey, was there someone else at your 
                         house last night besides your wife and 
                         daughter?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (on camera) No.

                                     ADAM
                         (still on camera) Well, theres someone 
                         here. (He tosses the photo to Lawrence, 
                         whosits up, picks it up and looks at 
                         it. After a moment, the shot cuts back 
                         to a regular view of them, in the room.)
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (realization) I know him. (We see the 
                         photo as well. It is a shot looking 
                         up into Lawrences window, with Zep 
                         standing there, looking out, completely 
                         unaware of his picture being taken.) 
                         Zep! (Cut to a shot of Zep listening. 
                         The shot goes back and forth between 
                         him as his eyes widen while Lawrence 
                         makes his threats.) His name is Zep. 
                         Hes an orderly at my hospital. (his 
                         voice becomes a growl, furious) Zep. 
                         You perverted little psychopath. Im 
                         gonna take great pleasure in seeing 
                         you pay for this! You bastard fuck!
 
                         
               Suddenly the shot cuts to Adam, who looks up at the clock with 
               a very worried look. He points up to it.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Look. (Lawrence momentarily breaks from 
                         his Zep rage, looks up. The clock reads 
                         at 6:00.) Were out of time.
 
                                     DIANA
                         (crying) Mommy help me!

               Alison continues to untie her. Cut to Zep, getting up from his 
               chair, turning to go into the bedroom. Alison hears him moving 
               near, sees his form through the frosted glass doors. She quickly 
               replaces Dianas gag and then her own, and resumes her position 
               with her hands behind her back just as the doors open and Zep 
               steps into the room. He looks down at them, raises his eyebrows 
               slightly. He seems to have gotten himself together, ready to 
               just do what has to be done. He takes the gun from his belt and 
               leans down next to Alison. He looks at her with wide eyes, shakes 
               his head sadly. He speaks calmly.
 
                                     ZEP
                         Dr. Gordons time is up. Now Ive gotta 
                         do what Ive gotta do, and...Im afraid 
                         it has to be you that tells him he failed. 
                         (He undoes her gag, holds the phone 
                         to her head and his gun in front of 
                         her chest.)
 
               Quick cut to the bathroom, where Lawrence is still looking at 
               the slightly crumpled picture of Zep in the window. The phone 
               rings, startling them both. Lawrence quickly answers it.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (speaking quickly, the growling voice) 
                         Is that you Zep, you bastard!? (Adam 
                         gets up from his corner, moves forward 
                         slightly) I know its you, you son of 
                         a bitch!
 
                                     ALISON
                         Larry?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (his eyes widen, his fierce tone replaced 
                         with worry) Ally?
 
               Cut into the bedroom.

                                     ALISON
                         (looking right at Zep, firmly) You failed.
 
                         
               Quickly, she grabs Zeps gun and pushes him hard over to her 
               left. He is taken by surprise and goes down easily.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (who can only hear the sound of a struggle) 
                         Hello? Hello?
 
               Alison rips the gun right from his hand, quickly backs up an 
               stands. She keeps the gun aimed right at Zep. He sits up slightly, 
               trying to slowly get up, but she keeps the gun fiercely aimed 
               at him, keeping him there. His eyes are wide, likely his one 
               thought right now is Fuck.
 
                                     ALISON
                         Dont move, stay on the ground. Give 
                         me the phone. Give it to me! (He sits 
                         up a bit, carefully slides it to her. 
                         He is watching her, looking for an opportunity 
                         to overcome her once again. She picks 
                         the phone up, still keeping her eyes 
                         and her gun at him.) Larry?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Ally! Honey, are you all right?

                                     ALISON
                         No! No were not...(Zep starts to move 
                         up a bit more, his right hand out, leaning 
                         against the edge of the bed. Ally threatens 
                         him more fiercely with the gun.) Get 
                         down! Larry, where are you?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (unsure himself) I dont know. Im being 
                         held captive in a room somewhere.
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (disbelief; she sniffles a bit) What? 
                         What are you talking about?
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (starting to cry) Im so sorry, Ally.
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         (desperate) Honey, we need you here. 
                         (Zep slowly readies himself to move 
                         forward, wide eyes still staring at 
                         Alison.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (crying, apologizing) Im sorry for 
                         everything. Its my fault. Please forgive 
                         me. Ive always been happy with you.
 
                         
                                     DIANA
                         (cries out) Mommy!

               Alison turns to look at Diana when she calls her, and Zep seizes 
               the moment. He leaps up and grabs the gun from her hand, and 
               they start struggling with it. Diana starts screaming. Lawrence, 
               on his end, hears the screaming and sounds of a struggle. In 
               wrestling for the gun a shot is let off, and Diana continues 
               to scream.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (panicked) Ally!

               Cut to a shot of static on Tapps TV set, then Tapp waking up 
               to the sound of gunfire. He quickly looks over to the window.
 
               
               Back to Zep and Alison, who are still fighting for the gun. Zep 
               manages to spin her around and into a leaning forward position, 
               but she still holds on tight. Another shot goes off. Cut to a 
               shot of Tapp, who hears it, then looks at the TV. He sees the 
               flash from the window on the television. He picks up his handgun 
               and loads it quickly, gets up and heads out. Back in the apartment, 
               we see Diana cowering, still tied, holding her teddy bear. Zep 
               gets behind Diana, tries to grab her but she keeps her arms and 
               the gun upwards. Another shot is fired off.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (screams) Ally! (Adam watches him with 
                         wide eyes.)
 
               The shot cuts back into the bedroom.

                                     DIANA
                         Mommy, help me!

               The struggle moves over and into the dresser. Zep gets the gun 
               in his right hand and wraps his left arm around Alison, who quickly 
               pulls open and takes out of the top drawer a pair of scissors. 
               She spins around and with a scream stabs Zep in his left leg. 
               He screams in pain and goes down, falling onto his side, clutching 
               his leg by a wooden column, moaning in pain. Alison quickly goes 
               over and finishes untying Diana. Cut to the Main Hall of the 
               residence, where we see Tapp enter and move down the hall with 
               his gun ready. He moves cautiously but quickly. He sees Zep on 
               the floor squirming around and aims at him, screaming.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Freeze!

               Zep turns and sees him, fires a shot in his direction but doesnt 
               hit. Tapp fires back and skims the top of Zeps head. Zep clutches 
               the surface wound, fires back. Cut back to Lawrence on the phone, 
               hearing only his daughter screaming and gunshots. He sobs, collapsing 
               forward onto the floor, crying out Oh no. Adam watches him, can 
               only imagine what hes hearing.
 
               Back to the bedroom, Tapp stands next to another wooden column 
               and fires at Zep again, missing. Alison finishes untying Diana 
               and the book from the room. Zep fires at Tapp again and misses. 
               Tapp fires back, but his gun jams. Zep sees Alison and Diana 
               run from the room, and his attention goes to them once more.
 
               
                                     TAPP
                         (trying to fix his gun) What the fuck?
 
                         
               Zep gets up off the floor more, but just then Tapp gives up on 
               his gun and charges at Zep, screaming. He tackles Zep, knocking 
               him flat on his back. Zep pushes his way up but Tapp grabs him 
               from behind, pulling him towards him. Cut back to Lawrence, still 
               on the floor, sobbing with the phone clutched in his hand.
 
               
               Back to Tapp and Zep, who get up to their feet. Zep grabs a vase 
               on the floor and turns, smashing it over Tapps head. The blow 
               stuns Tapp and sends him down. Zep kneels down and picks up his 
               gun, then gets back up and starts hobbling after Alison and Diana. 
               He reaches the living room, but they are no where to be seen.
 
               
                                     ZEP
                         Mrs. Gordon? (drops old cartridge out 
                         of his gun, pops in a new one) Diana?! 
                         (His breathing is fast, desperate. He 
                         clutches the wound on his leg.) Im 
                         gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon. 
                         (He stands up a bit straighter and hobbles 
                         over to the computer station, taking 
                         keys from the desk and then hobbling 
                         down the hall and out the door. We see 
                         Tapp groaning, starting to get up. Zep 
                         glances over and sees Tapp get to his 
                         feet, but quickly hobbles to the doorway 
                         and out the door. Tapp starts to follow, 
                         just a we bit dazed from the hit. He 
                         empties his gun cartridge and replaces 
                         it, then runs towards the door, screaming.
 
                         
               Back to Lawrence crying on the floor of the bathroom. Hes just 
               a complete wreck, making low moaning sounds. Suddenly, there 
               is a loud buzzing sound his body is jerked up and he is flung 
               onto his back as he is electrocuted. Adams eyes widen and he 
               starts to panic.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Lawrence! (A bit of foamy spittle comes 
                         out of Lawrences mouth as the electrocution 
                         continues, and then a moment later stops. 
                         Adam watches, frightened, unsure. Lawrence 
                         is out.) Lawrence, get up!
 
                                     CUT TO
                         Car Chase! Zep is in the lead, with 
                         Tapp in hot pursuit behind him. They 
                         race through the streets as fast as 
                         they can.
 
               Cut back to the bathroom. Adam looks around him, not sure what 
               to do, panicking. Lawrence cant be dead, he cant be alone in 
               here. He cant handle this alone. He needs his calm, collected 
               Doctor, no matter how badly Lawrence has treated him.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (crying out, close to tears) Lawrence! 
                         Get up! I need you! (He leans down and 
                         finds a piece of debris on the floor, 
                         throws it at Lawrence. It doesnt hit 
                         him. He leans down, picks up another, 
                         throws it. This one bounces onto the 
                         floor but ricochets and hits Lawrence, 
                         who begins to stir. A moment, and Lawrence 
                         starts to move more, reaching for his 
                         head and sitting up. Adam cries out 
                         in relief.) Oh, thank God! I thought 
                         you were dead!
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (sits up, dazed and confused) He...he 
                         electrocuted me...
 
                                     ADAM
                         I told you! The same thing happened 
                         to me, see? I wasnt lying, see?
 
               Lawrence leans over and grabs his chain, the source of the electrocution. 
               Suddenly, he snaps.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (screaming) FUCK THIS SHIT!!

               Back in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to grunt and struggle 
               with his chain. Suddenly the phone rings and he turns. He quickly 
               moves to get it, but it is out of reach. He lays flat on the 
               floor, just a foot away from it, trying desperately to grab it.
 
               
               In the hallway, Tapp enters, keeping his gun aimed out in front 
               of him. He looks down the hallway, sees nothing. Cut to Zep climbing 
               down a ladder into another level, grunting in pain. Tapp hears 
               him and follows the sound down the hall.
 
               In the bathroom, the phone keeps ringing. Lawrence grabs the 
               hinged box, turns it upside down and tries to catch the phone 
               with it. He cannot reach, and starts to cry loudly again. He 
               tosses the box away, crying/screaming as he tries to reach the 
               box with his arms. Adam watches with a terrified look, not knowing 
               what to do.
 
               Zep reaches the bottom of the ladder, leaning against it, moaning 
               from the pain of his leg. He hears Tapp above him, hobbles off 
               further down the hallway. Tapp climbs down the ladder, moving 
               in the same direction as Zep. As Tapp can move faster than Zep, 
               he rounds the corner and catches Zep hobbling down the hallway. 
               Zep turns and sees him, firing a few shots but missing. Tapp 
               ducks behind a large stone column jutting out of the wall. He 
               leans out and fires at Zep. Zep falls back slightly but remains 
               standing. If he got hit, it isnt clear where. Zep then turns 
               and quickly hobbles further down the hall.
 
               Cut back to Lawrence still crying and trying to get the phone 
               as it keeps ringing.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         No!!!! (He lowers his head and cries 
                         loudly.)
 
                                     ADAM
                         (Frightened but trying to stay calm 
                         for Lawrence.) Lawrence, calm down. 
                         There must be a way out of this! (It 
                         seems to be a complete role reversal 
                         for the two of them from the beginning, 
                         where Adam was the one freaking out 
                         and Lawrence was calm. Here, Adam is 
                         terrified but still calmer than Lawrence, 
                         who has just lost it.)
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (screaming) I cant be calm! My family 
                         needs me! No, God! (He cries and screams, 
                         still cant get the phone. He quickly 
                         turns and sits up, grabbing the chain 
                         and pulling it as he lets out a terrible 
                         scream of rage. Adams hands are up 
                         clutching his head, trying to keep his 
                         cool but having a very hard time.)
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (Loudly trying to speak over Lawrences 
                         continued loud, primal screams.) Lawrence, 
                         I have a family too! I dont see them, 
                         thats my mistake. Its a mistake Id 
                         like to fix!
 
               Cut to Zep hobbling down the hall. Tapp is there running after 
               him. Zep turns a corner, and Tapp runs to try to keep up.
 
                                     TAPP
                         Im gonna kill you you sick asshole!
 
                         
               Back in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to freak out as he mentally 
               breaks down, clutching the chain and screaming more.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (desperate, losing his attempted calm 
                         stance) Lawrence, stop it!
 
               Lawrence sits up, stops pulling at his chain but continues screaming. 
               He starts to unbutton his blue button-down shirt. That is too 
               slow, however, so he starts to rip it open.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (sobs in his voice) Lawrence, please 
                         calm down! Theres a way out of here, 
                         theres a way out!
 
               Lawrence gets his shirt off, down to a plain white tee shirt 
               underneath. He starts to wrap one end around his manacled foot 
               and ties it off. Adam realizes what he is preparing to do, completely 
               loses it and freaks out, screaming.
 
                                     ADAM
                         Lawrence! No! Oh my God! What are you 
                         doing?!
 
               Lawrence holds the other end of the shirt in his mouth, biting 
               it for a brace. The look in his eyes is one of complete madness 
               and desperation. He takes up the hacksaw in his right hand, puts 
               it against his ankle and starts to saw into his foot while Adam 
               begins to scream in complete horror. Lawrence screams through 
               the cloth between his teeth. The blood squirts up onto Lawrences 
               shirt and neck. Adam collapses to the floor in his corner, screaming 
               and wincing.
 
               Back to Zep rounding another corner in the hallway. He moves 
               into an old break room and Tapp runs in after him, finally catching 
               up. Tapp tackles him, tripping him backwards and causing Zep 
               to hit his head against and old mini-refrigerator. Tapp grabs 
               him and brings him up, throwing him hard against the stone wall. 
               Zep falls down to his side. Tapp grabs him up and throws him 
               forward against a cage wall.
 
               Back to Lawrence, still sawing away, blood on his face, neck 
               and shirt.
 
               Back to Tapp pummeling Zep from behind in the back. A look of 
               twisted glee is upon Tapps face as he hits Zep. Zep falls to 
               the floor, gun beside him. He looks like he just wants to curl 
               up and die. Tapp goes down for the gun but Zep reacts, grabbing 
               it. Tapp grabs his hand, and Zep pushes himself up into a standing 
               position, the wall in front of him, Tapp pushing up behind him, 
               trying to take the gun.
 
               Back in the bathroom, Adam is on his hands and knees, screaming 
               and crying as he begs Lawrence to stop. Lawrence does stop, sits 
               up and tosses the saw of to the side. Adam collapses forward 
               a bit.
 
               Back to Zep and Tapp, who continue struggling from the gun. Zep 
               squeezes his way down, groaning as he suddenly drops down between 
               Tapp and the wall, his gun aimed up at Tapp. He pulls the trigger 
               and the shot hits Tapp in the chest, a loud surprise to the former 
               detective.
 
               Back in the bathroom, Lawrence crawls along the floor, moaning. 
               He finds and picks up the single bullet from his envelope, looks 
               at it. Adam watches him in terror.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (screaming/crying) What are you doing?! 
                         (Lawrence crawls on farther, towards 
                         the body.)
 
               Cut back to a close up of the bloody hole in Tapps chest. Tapp 
               remains standing a moment, in shock, gasping, then falls down 
               backwards onto the floor. Zep is still on his knees, holding 
               the gun up at a diagonal. Tapps eyes flutter, then finally close. 
               Zep turns and gets up, limping in pain out of the room and down 
               another hall.
 
               Back in the bathroom, Lawrence reaches the body. He takes the 
               gun, opens the chamber.
 
                                     ADAM
                         What are you...(He suddenly realizes 
                         Lawrences intentions. His eyes go wide, 
                         and he starts to cry out and beg.)
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         Oh my God! Oh my God! Lawrence dont! 
                         (Lawrence puts the bullet in, then closes 
                         the chamber) No! Lawrence, please, Im 
                         begging you! (Lawrence aims the gun 
                         at Adam) Lawrence, its not me who did 
                         this to you!
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (looking like Death, his voice hoarse) 
                         You have to die.
 
                                     ADAM
                         (His hands up in front of him defensively, 
                         moving side to side to try to throw 
                         off Lawrences aim) No, I want to live!
 
                         
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (moving the gun along with Adams movements) 
                         Im sorry...
 
                                     ADAM
                         I want to live!

                                     LAWRENCE
                         My family...(he aims and pulls the trigger, 
                         hitting Adam in the upper chest area. 
                         Adam falls down forward onto the floor, 
                         his screams stop.)
 
               Lawrence collapses, sobbing. Then he sits up a bit, turning to 
               the surveillance camera and screaming.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         Ive done it! Now show them to me! (he 
                         continues to cry, dropping the gun next 
                         to him, collapsing back down with his 
                         forehead to the floor.)
 
               Cut to the Gordons neighbors living room. Alison paces back 
               and forth, holding a cell phone to her ear. Two neighbors sit 
               off to the side on a couch with Diana.
 
                                     NEIGHBOR
                         (OS, on phone) Thank you very much, 
                         Officer.
 
                                     ALISON
                         (on cell phone) Larry?

                                     NEIGHBOR
                         (hanging up the phone and going over 
                         to Alison) Did you get through to him?
 
                         
                                     ALISON
                         Theres still no answer.

                                     NEIGHBOR
                         (reassuringly) Its all right. Ive 
                         called the police. Everythings okay.
 
                         
               Alison goes and sits on the couch. Diana comes up to her, and 
               Alison embraces her daughter.
 
               Cut back to the bathroom, with a shot of the sliding door. The 
               sound of a lock being undone and a bang is heard. Lawrence pushes 
               himself up into a kneeling position, a look of shock on his face. 
               The door slides open and there stands Zep, green mist behind 
               him in the hallway. Lawrence turns and sees him. Zeps eyes dart 
               around the room, seeming to say What the fuck happened in here? 
               He sees Lawrence on the floor, and an eager look comes into his 
               eyes. He walks in, and Lawrence starts to yell at him.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         You bastard! Ill fucking kill you! 
                         (Lawrence grabs Zeps leg as he passes 
                         but is too weak and Zep pulls away, 
                         looking down at him, moving over to 
                         the other side of the body) Ill fucking 
                         kill you! You fucking bastard! (Lawrence 
                         quickly cralws forwarrd and takes up 
                         the gun, pulling the trigger several 
                         times, but there are no more bullets. 
                         It just clicks.) Ill fucking kill you! 
                         You fucking bastard! Ill fucking kill 
                         you! Ill fucking kill you!
 
               Zep goes over to Adam, pushing his side with his foot a couple 
               of times, but to no reaction. He then looks to Lawrence and aims 
               his gun at him, shaking his head.
 
                                     ZEP
                         Youre too late.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         (weakly) Why?

                                     ZEP
                         Its the rules.

               Zep is about to pull the trigger when suddenly Adam comes to 
               and grabs his ankle, pulling him down. The back of Zeps head 
               hits the floor hard. Adam pulls him towards him, struggles to 
               get the gun from Zeps hand, screaming. The gun goes off once 
               off to the side. Adam moves Zeps arm back and forth, and it 
               goes off again. Finally, Adam slams Zeps arm down and gets the 
               gun away from him, tossing it away. He slugs Zep hard across 
               the face, stunning him. Lawrence starts crawling towards them. 
               Screaming like a madman, Adam sits up and grabs the toilet seat 
               lid from the toilet, and slams it down onto Zeps head as hard 
               as he can. He repeats this seven times before the lid snaps in 
               half. Lawrence reaches the two and reaches up for Adams arm 
               as Adam brings the broken lid down again. Lawrence grabs his 
               arm and Adam drops the lid, falling forward a bit and clutching 
               his shoulder wound with his free hand, crying hard. Lawrence 
               moves in, touching his head to Adams.
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (his voice very weak and shaky) Youre 
                         going to be all right. (Adam stops sobbing 
                         for a moment) Youre just wounded in 
                         the shoulder. I have to go and get help.
 
                         
                                     ADAM
                         (grasping Lawrences shirt, begging.) 
                         Dont leave me! No!
 
               Lawrence nods, pulling away from him and starts to crawl off. 
               Adam reaches for him as he turns himself around and away.
 
                                     ADAM
                         No!! (he keeps crying) No! No! (Lawrence 
                         crawls towards the door.) Lawrence! 
                         Lawrence!
 
                                     LAWRENCE
                         (he pauses, turns to look back at Adam) 
                         Dont...Dont worry, Ill bring someone 
                         back, I promise. (He continues crawling 
                         on, out the door while Adam watches 
                         him pathetically, still crying and reaching 
                         out for him.)
 
               Lawrence makes it out the door, and starts dragging himself down 
               the hall. Adam is now alone in the room with two corpses. Adam 
               looks to the door one more time then turns to Zeps body. He 
               pulls himself on top of him, wincing at his shoulder pain.
 
               
                                     ADAM
                         (thinking) Key...key...

               He starts going through Zeps pockets, patting him down. He finds 
               Zeps wallet, opens it and feels through it; there s nothing 
               of value to him right now. He tosses it down. He continues feeling 
               for something, suddenly feels something in Zerps coat pocket. 
               His eyes widen as he reaches in, wincing from the pain in his 
               shoulder. He pulls out a tape recorder. He stares at it, his 
               eyes and mouth starting to widen. He glances down at Zep, then 
               at the tape recorder. Sitting up a bit more, he presses play. 
               It is Jigsaws voice.
 
                                     JIGSAW
                         (VO) Hello Mr. Hindle. Or as they called 
                         you around the hospital: (shot of Zep 
                         in the hospital with his cleaning cart, 
                         stopping at Johns room) Zep. I want 
                         you to make a choice. (Shot of the closet 
                         doors in Dianas room flying open, Diana 
                         screaming, Alison coming in and seeing 
                         him looming over her. Shot of him tying 
                         and gagging Alison and Diana. Shot of 
                         the photo of Diana and Alison tied and 
                         gagged.) Theres a slow-acting poison 
                         coursing through your system (shot of 
                         Zep watching the monitor, holding his 
                         hand to his mouth. He actually looks 
                         rather ill) which only I have the antidote 
                         for. Will you murder and mother and 
                         her child (Zep rocking aback and forth, 
                         getting ready to kill Alison and Diana) 
                         to save yourself? (Shot of Zep next 
                         to Alison, saying Dr. Gordons time 
                         is up; holds the phone to her ear. Shot 
                         of Zep in the living room, screaming 
                         Mrs. Gordon! Shot of Zep on the floor 
                         firing up at Tapp.) Listen carefully, 
                         if you will. There are rules. (Lawrence 
                         on the floor looking up at Zep, asks 
                         Why? to which Zep says Its the rules.)
 
                         
                                     JOHN
                         The key to that chain is in the bathtub.
 
                         
                                     FLASHBACK MONTAGE
                         
               Zeps voiceover of Hes a very interesting person, with a shot 
               of John in his hospital bed with Dr. Gordon and the med students. 
               His name is John. Shot of Lawrence pointing at the chart, He 
               has an inoperable frontal lobe tumor. Close up shot of John in 
               his bed, eyes flickering open slightly.
 
               Shot of Tapp in the workshop, holding a gun to Johns head. Sick 
               from the disease eating away at me inside. Shot of the detectives 
               at Pauls cage, shot of the jigsaw puzzle piece wound on Paul, 
               Kerry saying Sounds like our friend Jigsaw.
 
                                     JOHNS VOICE
                         Sick of people who dont appreciate 
                         their blessings. Shot of Lawrence with 
                         Diana, checking his beeper, on his computer 
                         ignoring Diana and Alison, trying to 
                         kiss Alison as she pulls away.
 
               Frontal shot of John in his robe in the workshop with the detectives, 
               his arms raised, his face clearly visible. Cut to Kerry at the 
               peephole in Marks room, saying Looks like he likes to book himself 
               a front row seat to his own sick little games, with overlapping 
               footage of John on the floor in the bathroom, eyes open slightly, 
               then a shot of the pig creature crawling out of Lawrences car.
 
               
                                     JOHN
                         (VO) Hello Mark, Paul, Amanda, Zep, 
                         Adam, Dr. Gordon. (As he says each name, 
                         the following image of them appears: 
                         A shot of Mark screaming with the safe, 
                         Paul in his cage while still alive, 
                         Amanda in her mask in the chair, Zep 
                         watching on the monitor, Adam holding 
                         the tape recorder to his ear, Lawrence 
                         holding the tape recorder to his ear. 
                         Then, a shot of the Puppet on the video 
                         as he says) I want to play a game.
 
                         
               Back to the shot of Adam staring at him, shocked. Suddenly, Adam 
               looks down, grabs Zeps gun and aims for John. But before he 
               can pull the trigger John holds out the remote for the electricity 
               and starts to electrocute Adam, who starts jerking around and 
               drops the gun. As he spasms, a very, very fast montage of images 
               from the entire film from beginning to the end, starting with 
               a shot of Adam being electrocuted after his fake death, then 
               Lawrence, then going back to the beginning, all the way up and 
               ending with Adam stretched out on top of Zep, spasming still 
               from the electrocution. Suddenly the electricity stops and he 
               gasps, raspy loud breathing. John turns away, starts towards 
               the door. Adam can only watch after him.
 
                                     JOHN
                         (VO) Most people are so ungrateful to 
                         be alive. (John turns off the lights 
                         at the door, only the green lighting 
                         from the hallway illuminating him and 
                         then Adam just barely. John moves out 
                         the door, slowly.) But not you. (Adam 
                         reaches out for him and screams. John 
                         turns around and takes the door handle, 
                         starting to slide it shut.) Not anymore.
 
                         
               Adam SCREAMS as loud as he can in terror and despair as John 
               pauses for a moment with the door halfway shut, and says
 
                                     JOHN
                         GAME OVER.

               John slams the door shut the rest of the way, and we are left 
               in darkness with the sound of Adam screaming No! Dont!!! over 
               and over and crying. The screams fade out, and is replaced by 
               the ending titles and instrumental music.
 
               THE END

FADE IN

ON A RINGING TELEPHONE.

A hand reaches for it, bringing the receiver up to the face of
CASEY BECKER, a young girl, no more than sixteen.  A friendly face
with innocent eyes.

                CASEY
        Hello.

                MAN'S VOICE
            (from phone)
        Hello.

Silence.

                CASEY
        Yes.

                MAN
        Who is this?

                CASEY
        Who are you trying to reach?

                MAN
        What number is this?

                CASEY
        What number are you trying to reach?

                MAN
        I don't know.

                CASEY
        I think you have the wrong number.

                MAN
        Do I?

                CASEY
        It happens. Take it easy.

CLICK! She hangs up the phone.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal
Casey in a living room, alone.  She moves from the living room to
the kitchen.  It's a nice house.  Affluent.

The phone RINGS again.

INT.  KITCHEN

Casey grabs the portable.

                CASEY
        Hello.

                MAN
        I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.

                CASEY
        So why did you dial it again?

                MAN
        To apologize.

                CASEY
        You're forgiven. Bye now.

                MAN
        Wait, wait, don't hang up.

Casey stands in front of a sliding glass door.  It's pitch black
outside.

                CASEY
        What?

                MAN
        I want to talk to you for a second.

                CASEY
        They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.

CLICK!  Casey hangs up.  A grin on her face.

EXT.  CASEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

A big country home with a huge sprawling lawn full of big oak
trees.  It sits alone with no neighbors in sight.

The phone RINGS again.

INT.  KITCHEN

Popcorn sizzles in a pot on the stove.  Casey covers it with a
lid, reaching for the portable phone.

                CASEY
        Hello.

                MAN
        Why don't you want to talk to me?

                CASEY
        Who is this?

                MAN
        You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.

                CASEY
            (shaking the popcorn)
        I don't think so.

                MAN
        What's that noise?

Casey smiles, playing along, innocently.

                CASEY
        Popcorn.

                MAN
        You're making popcorn?

                CASEY
        Uh-huh.

                MAN
        I only eat popcorn at the movies.

                CASEY
        I'm getting ready to watch a video.

                MAN
        Really? What?

                CASEY
        Just some scary movie.

                MAN
        Do you like scary movies?

                CASEY
        Uh-huh.

                MAN
        What's your favorite scary movie?

He's flirting with her.  Casey moves away from the stove and takes
a seat at the kitchen counter, directly in front of the glass
door.

                CASEY
        I don't know.

                MAN
        You have to have a favorite.

Casey thinks for second.

                CASEY
        Uh...HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the
        guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around
        and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?

                MAN
        Guess.

                CASEY
        Uh...NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.

                MAN
        Is that the one where the guy had knives
        for fingers?

                CASEY
        Yeah...Freddy Krueger.

                MAN
        Freddy-that's right. I liked that movie.
        It was scary.

                CASEY
        The first one was, but the rest sucked.

                MAN
        So, you gotta boyfriend?

                CASEY
            (giggling)
        Why? You wanna ask me out?

                MAN
        Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?

                CASEY
        No.

                MAN
        You never told me your name.

Casey smiles, twirling her hair.

                CASEY
        Why do you want to know my name?

                MAN
        Because I want to know who I'm looking
        at.

Casey spins around like lightning facing the glass door.

                CASEY
        What did you say?

                MAN
        I want to now who I'm talking to.

                CASEY
        That's not what you said.

                MAN
        What do you think I said?

Casey CLICKS on the outside light.  A flood light illuminates the
backyard.  Her eyes survey the grounds.  But it's empty.  No one's
there.  She turns the light out.

On the stove, the popcorn POPS.

                CASEY
        I have to go now.

                MAN
        Wait...I thought we were gonna go out.

                CASEY
        Nah, I don't think so...

                MAN
        Don't hang up on me.

                CASEY
        Gotta go.

                MAN
        Don't...

CLICK!  Casey hangs up.  She checks the glass door making sure
it's locked and then moves to the stove as...

THE PHONE RINGS.

She slides the popcorn from the stove, reaching for the phone.

                CASEY
        Yes?

                MAN
        I told you not to hang up on me.

                CASEY
        What do you want?

                MAN
        To talk.

                CASEY
        Dial someone else, okay?

                MAN
        You getting scared?

                CASEY
        No-bored.

CLICK.  She hangs up.  The phone RINGS again.  She grabs it.

                CASEY
        Listen, asshole...

                MAN
            (deadly serious)
        NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU
        HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE
        A FISH. UNDERSTAND?

Total silence.  He has gotten her full attention.

                CASEY
        Is this some kind of a joke?

                MAN
        More of a game, really.

Casey eyes the glass doors, then looks up the hallway to the front
doors...moving to it.  It's unlocked.  She bolts it.

                CASEY
        I'm two seconds from calling the police.

                MAN
        They'd never make it in time.

Casey moves her face flush against the door, her eye looking
through the peephole.

ANGLE THROUGH PEEPHOLE.

A distorted view of the front porch.  It is empty.  She relaxes a
bit, relieved.

                CASEY
        What do you want?

                MAN
            (pure evil)
        TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.

Casey's jaw drops as total fear storms her face.  She hangs up the
phone, throwing it down on a side table when...

THE DOORBELL CHIMES.

Casey leaps out of her skin.  She turns to the door as it chimes
again.

                CASEY
            (calling out)
        Who's there?

Another CHIME.  She moves to it.

                CASEY
            (louder)
        Who's there?

No answer.  Fuck this.  It's time for the police.  She goes for
the portable phone. Just as she picks it up...

IT RINGS.

Casey almost drops it, losing her breath...

She brings it to her ear with trembling hands, saying
nothing...listening, waiting...

A long silence.  And then.

                MAN
        You should never say "Who's there?".
        Don't you watch scary movies? It's a
        death wish.

Casey clutches the wall, nearly collapsing.  She tries her
damndest to hang tough.

                CASEY
        Look, enough is enough. You had your fun
        now you better leave me alone or else.

                MAN
        Or else what?

CLOSE ON her face, her mind thinking, calculating...

                CASEY
        My boyfriend will be here any second and
        he'll be pissed when I tell him...

                MAN
        I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.

Busted.  She holds steady.

                CASEY
        I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll
        be here any second and your ass better
        be gone.

                MAN
        Sure...

                CASEY
        I swear it. And he's big and plays
        football and will beat the shit out
        of you.

                MAN
        I'm getting scared.

                CASEY
        I'm telling you the truth.
        I lied before...

                MAN
        I believe you...

                CASEY
        So you better leave.

                MAN
        His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?

Silence.  Casey buckles at the knees, losing it.

                CASEY
        How do you know his name?

                MAN
        Go to the back door and turn on the porch
        light--again.

Casey, terrified, forces herself to move.. staggering to the
kitchen...to the glass doors.  Her shaky hand finds the light
switch...she hits it.  The back yard is lit.

Sitting in a lawn chair in the middle of the backyard is a big,
line backer of a guy, her boyfriend...

STEVE

tied and gagged.  He's been roughed up, but he's alive.
CLOSE ON his eyes..wide in fear..staring at his girlfriend,
pleading with her.

                CASEY
        Oh Goddddd...

Casey SCREAMS.  Her hand moves to the lock on the door.

                MAN
        I wouldn't do that if I were you.

Terror rides Casey's face.  She's petrified.

                CASEY
        Where are you?

                MAN
        Guess.

Her eyes search the yard, combing bushes, trees.  He could be
anywhere-anywhere.

                CASEY
            (begging)
        Please don't hurt him.

                MAN
        That all depends on you.

                CASEY
        Why are you doing this?

Tears find their way, streaming down Casey's face.

                MAN
        I wanna play a game.

                CASEY
        No...

                MAN
        Then he dies. Right now.

                CASEY
        NOOO!

                MAN
        Which is it?

A long silence.  Casey touches the glass...staring at STEVE...this
big jock of a guy is crying too.

                CASEY
        What kind of game?

                MAN
        Turn off the light.

Her hand goes to the switch...Steve tugs and pulls at his
straps...as if begging her...his face sweat and tears...

CLICK

He disappears in the darkness.  Casey moves away from the glass,
back toward the living room, unbelieving, horrified.

                MAN
        Here's how we play. I ask a question. If
        you get it right-Steve lives.

Three curtainless windows line one wall.  Casey crouches down
behind the couch, tipping a lamp cord from it's socket, darkening
the room.  Her body quivers.

                CASEY
        Please don't do this...

                MAN
        Come on. It'll be fun.

                CASEY
        No...please.

                MAN
        It's an easy category. Movie trivia.

                CASEY
            (begging)
        ..please...

                MAN
        I'll even give you a warm up question.

                CASEY
        Don't do this. I can't..

                MAN
        Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.

                CASEY
        No...

                MAN
        Come on. It's you favorite scary movie,
        remember? He had a white mask, he
        stalked the baby-sitters.

Casey goes silent...a nervous wreck...she can barely speak much
less think.

                CASEY
        I don't know...

                MAN
        Come on, yes you do.

                CASEY
        Please..stop...

Casey is SOBBING.

                MAN
        What's his name?

                CASEY
        I can't think.

Casey has officially reached hysteria, petrified beyond all
reality.

                MAN
        Steve's counting on you.

Suddenly...through tears...Godsent...

                CASEY
            (a whisper)
        Michael...Michael Myers.

                MAN
        YES!

Casey SIGHS...relieved.

                MAN
        Now for the real question.

                CASEY
        NOOOO....

                MAN
        But you're doing so well.

                CASEY
        Please go away! Leave us alone!

                MAN
        Then answer the question. Same category.

Casey is a blubbering, wet mass on the floor.

                CASEY
        ..please..no...

                MAN
        Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.

A mad smile purses Casey's lips.  She knows this.  She leaps up,
through tears, screaming...

                CASEY
        Jason! Jason!...JASON!

A slight PAUSE.

                MAN
        I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.

                CASEY
        No it's not. It was Jason.

                MAN
        Afraid not.

                CASEY
        It was Jason. I saw that godamned movie
        twenty times. It was Jason.

                MAN
        Then you should know Jason's MOTHER
        -Mrs.Vorhees was the original killer. Jason
        didn't show up until the sequel.

Casey is stupefied.

                CASEY
        You tricked me...

                MAN
        Lucky, for you there's a bonus round.
        But poor Steve...I'm afraid...he's out.

This implication sends Casey running to the kitchen...to the glass
doors.  She flips on the porch lights to see...

STEVE

eyes wide, sitting in the lawn chair...his belly gaping open...a
mass of blood and ripped flesh...his insides lay on the ground
between his feet...steam rising.

A SCREAM erupts from the bottom of her soul as Casey collapse on
the floor...nearly passing out.  CLOSE ON her face...pale and
ghostly white.  She SOBS.

                MAN
        Final question. Are you ready?

She doesn't answer.  A long, maddening silence.  Casey reaches up
and CLICKS off the light, making Steve go away...wishing,
hoping...

                CASEY
        ..leave me alone..please...

                MAN
        Answer the question and I will.

Casey is curled up on the floor like an infant, rocking slowly
back and forth.

                MAN
        What door am I at?

                CASEY
        What?

                MAN
        There are two doors to your house. A
        front door and a back one. If you answer
        correctly-you live.

From where Casey sits she can see both front and back doors.  She
deliberates...with her last bit of strength she tries to
strategize.  Eyeing both, the front door...the back door trying to
decide between the two.

                CASEY
        Don't make me...I can't...I won't.

                MAN
        Your call.

In the darkness, Casey crawls to the kitchen counter-she leans up
and grabs a long, sharp knife.

Casey looks around her...she looks down the hall to the front
door...then turns back to the kitchen glass door as it suddenly...

SHATTERS TO BITS...

as a lawn chair come flying through it.  Exploding glass sprays
everywhere.

This incites Casey like fire.  She springs to her feet...bolting
out of the kitchen as a SHADOW moves quickly through the shattered
doorframe.

ANGLE ON CASEY

Somewhere in the house, back flat against a window, listening to
FEET ON CRACKING GLASS.  She turns and unlocks the latch, quietly
sliding it up. She can hear him move through the foyer...to the
front door.

Casey lifts herself up and puts her legs through the window.  She
holds the knife in one hand, the phone in the other.

Casey eases out the window, fumbling, dropping the knife back in
the house.  She starts to reach for it.  Fuck it, she takes off...

EXT.  SIDE OF HOUSE

Casey it at the back corner of the house.

                MAN
        I can hear you. I know you're here.

Casey eases along a narrow path between a tall fence and the side
of the house...going for the front yard.  She must pass the three
curtainless windows.  She gets to the first one and peeks in...

The FIGURE has pulled open the foyer closet, searching for her.

Casey creeps along, to the next window, she looks in...the FIGURE
is completely on the other side of the room moving toward the hall
that leads to other parts of the house.

She moves further along the house...squeezing by hedges...to the
third window...she peeks in to the FIGURE...

STARING BACK AT HER...

His face covered with a ghostly white mask, inches from her...his
eyes piercing through...soulless...Casey SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER as
a hand...

CRASHES through the glass window grabbing hold of her neck...she
beats at him trying to free herself...her nails dig into his
arm...she wrenches from side to side...finally breaking free as
the hands disappear inside the house...

EXT.  CORNER OF HOUSE

Casey sails around the corner of the house, eyeing the front door.
It remains closed.  Her eyes cover the sprawling country yard when
suddenly....

HEADLIGHTS APPEAR

in the distance, coming down the road towards the house...she
recognizes them instantly.  Mom...Dad...she tears off across the
yard toward them...moving like lightning...

The car turns into the driveway...Casey SCREAMS, waving madly,
rushing by a tree as...

THE GHOST MASKED FIGURE APPEARS

Casey stumbles back, catching her balance...the FIGURE moves on
her, arm poised high...a flash of silver...and Casey is struck,
across the chest.  She looks down to see her shirt blossoming
red...a look of bewilderment as she drops to one knee.

The knife rises again...Casey throws her hand forward...the blade
comes down...but it's blocked by the portable phone still in her
hand.  She turns staggering to...

EXT.  DRIVEWAY

A MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE emerge from the parked car.  They move to the
front door completely unaware of what's happening to their
daughter, only feet from them.

EXT.  FRONT YARD

Casey stumbles forward...her parents ten feet away...she opens her
mouth to scream but no sound resonates...she is beyond
words...staggering, swaying...the FIGURE moving behind her.

EXT.  FRONT DOOR

Her parents approach the door

                FATHER
        That fish smelled strong.

                MOTHER
        I told you to send it back.

The father discovers the front door ajar.  A puzzled look.  Casey
is right behind them with one arm outstretched.  If they'd only
turn around...

They enter the house and close the door as....

Casey collapses on the ground, clutching her bloody chest...the
FIGURE upon her.

INT.  FOYER

The father sees straight back into the kitchen...the shattered
patio door.

                FATHER
        Jesus...

                MOTHER
        What is it? Where's Casey?

                FATHER
            (calling out)
        Casey? Casey?

In a split second they're both panic stricken.  The father begins
searching the house frantically.  The mother is hysterical.

EXT.  FRONT YARD

CLOSE ON Casey...she's dragged by her feet through damp soil...the
life going fast from her body...her hand still clutching the
phone.

INT.  FOYER

Back in the house.

                MOTHER
        Where is she?

                FATHER
        Call the police.

The mother moves  to the phone in the foyer, picks it up...There
is no dial tone.  She jiggles the base.

                FATHER
            (searching)
        Casey? Where are you honey? Call the
        police, goddammit.

                MOTHER
        The phone's dead.

The...the softest...faintest voice is heard...

                CASEY
            (from phone)
        ..help me...

                MOTHER
        She's here, God, I can hear her.
        Where's my baby?

The husband returns to the foyer finding his wife clinging to the
phone.

                FATHER
        Where is she?

                MOTHER
        I can hear her. Oh Mother of God,
        I can hear her.

The father upturns the living room.

                FATHER
        Casey! Casey!

                MOTHER
        Not my daughter...not my...

The husband grabs hold of his wife.

                FATHER
        Get in the car and drive down to
        the Mackenzie's.

The other throws the front door open and rushes out...the father
moves through the house when a SCREAM echoes out.  That of his
wife.  He tears off for the front door.

EXT.  FRONT DOOR

The father rushes out the door to find his wife, on her knees,
bent over, retching.  His eyes move beyond to a tree in the front
yard...his stomach fails him...his dinner rises...as he bares
witness to the single, most horrifying sight he'll ever see.

That of his only daughter as she hangs from a big oak
tree...strung up...very much dead...her stomach ripped open.

BLACKOUT!

BEGIN MAIN TITLES

FADE IN:

INT.  BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT

A teenage girl's room.  Neat and pinkish.  On the bed, amongst age-
old stuffed animals lie opened school books. The CAMERA PANS to a
desk against the wall where...

SIDNEY PRESCOTT

a young girl of 17, sits, her face glued to the computer monitor
in front of her.  CLOSE ON her face.  Sharp and clever with deep,
lonely eyes.  She's comfortable in a plain, flannel nightgown.

Her hands are at work, typing feverishly, when suddenly...

CRASH-BOOM

A noise behind her.  She turns abruptly, eyeing an open window
across the room. A SCRATCHING sound.  She stands and moves toward
it.

EXT.  WINDOW

Sidney sticks her head out the window.  The late night wind hits
her face as a SHADOW appears just to the left of her, a hand
reaches out, grabs her and suddenly a FIGURE is on top of her...

INT.  BEDROOM

Sid SCREAMS...pulling away from the figure...breaking free,
falling back onto the floor.

                VOICE
            (o.c.)
        Hey...it's just me.

Sid looks up to see...

BILLY LOOMIS

A young, strapping boy of seventeen.  Handsome and alluring.  A
star quarterback/ class president type of guy.  He sports a smile
that could last for days.

                SIDNEY
        Billy? What the...

                BILLY
        I'm sorry. Don't hate me.

                SIDNEY
        What are you doing here?

                BILLY
        You sleep in THAT?

Billy pulls himself through the window.

                SIDNEY
            (whispering)
        My dad's in the other room.

                BILLY
        I'll only stay a sec.

Suddenly...

The bedroom door BURSTS open.  The doorknob catches on the open
closet door behind it jamming it, holding it in place.

                VOICE
            (from behind door)
        What's going on in there?

Billy quickly rolls out of sight behind the bed.  Sidney unjams
the door to reveal...

MR. PRESCOTT, late 40's, a severe presence.  A distracted man,
nervous and pre-occupied.

                MR. PRESCOTT
        Are you okay?

                SIDNEY
        Can you knock?

                MR. PRESCOTT
        I heard screaming.

                SIDNEY
        No you didn't.

                MR. PRESCOTT
        No? Oh, well...I'm hitting the sack. My
        flight leaves first thing in the morning.
        Now the expo runs all weekend so I
        won't be back til Sunday. There's cash
        on the table and I'll be staying at the
        Raleigh Hilton...

                SIDNEY
        ..out at the airport...

                MR. PRESCOTT
        ..so call if you need me.

                SIDNEY
        Got it.

He gives the bedroom a quick once over.

                MR. PRESCOTT
        I coulda swore I heard screaming.

Sidney distracts him, giving him a peck on the cheek.

                SIDNEY
        Have a good trip.

                MR. PRESCOTT
        Sleep tight, sweetie.

He gives her a wink and pulls the door closed.  Billy reappears.

                BILLY
        Close call.

                SIDNEY
        What are you doing here?

Billy takes a flying leap and lands on the bed.

                BILLY
        It just occurred to me that I've never
        snuck through your bedroom window.

                SIDNEY
        Now that it's out of your system.

                BILLY
        And I was home, bored, watching
        television, THE EXORCIST was on
        and it got me thinking of you.

                SIDNEY
        Oh it did?

                BILLY
        Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good
        stuff was cut out and I started thinking
        about us and how two years ago, we started
        off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R"
        rating on our way to an NC17. And how
        things have changed and, lately, we're just
        sot of...edited for television.

                SIDNEY
        So you thought you could sneak in my
        window and we would  have little bump-
        bump.

                BILLY
        No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your
        underwear rule. I just thought we might do
        some on top of the clothes stuff.

She snuggles up next to him, planting a kiss on his lips.
Passionate and gentle.  He, however, reacts like a shark, moving
on top of her, his hands everywhere as he presses into
her...Sidney breaks away.

                SIDNEY
        Time to go, stud bucket.

Billy sits up.  His heart isn't racing...it's POUNDING.

                BILLY
        See what you do to me.

Sweat has popped out all over his forehead, his breathing heavy.

                SIDNEY
        You know what my dad will do to you?

                BILLY
        I'm going...I'm going.

He moves to the window.  She follows, motioning to his wound.

                SIDNEY
        I appreciate the romantic gesture.

She gives him a kiss goodnight.  Sweet and simple.

                BILLY
            (whisper)
        Hey..about the sex stuff. I'm not trying
        to rush you. I was only half serious.

She kisses him again as he eases through the window.

                SIDNEY
        Would you settle for a PG-13
        relationship?

                BILLY
        What's that?

She pulls her flannel gown open for a split second...flashing her
left breast.  His mouth drops open...surprise, shock.  Their eyes
meet.  They share a smile.

                SIDNEY
        Get outa here.

INT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

CLOSE on Sidney snuggling her pillow, sleeping peacefully when...

THE RADIO ALARM BLASTS from the night table loud enough to wake
the dead.  Sidney bolts up.

                DISC JOCKEY
            (from radio)
        ..found brutally murdered...

CLICK.  Sidney, quick with the reflexes, shuts it off instantly.
A car trunk SLAMS shut outside.

Sidney pulls herself out of bed and leans to the window just in
time to see her Dad jumping in his car.  She half waves down at
him but he doesn't see her.  He's as good as gone, pulling out of
the driveway and disappearing down the road.

A moment as Sidney stands at the window, staring out after him.

EXT.  SCHOOL - MORNING

CLOSE ON A SIGN

"BAYBORO HIGH SCHOOL.  HOME OF THE FIGHTING BULLDOGS"

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a picture perfect small town
school.  Old and charming.  Students come and go, moving about.
Nothing unusual, except for the...

six police cars, four news vans, flashing cameras, and crowds and
crowds of lookie-loo's gathered just off campus.

EXT.  SIDEWALK

Sidney approaches the school seeing the commotion.  Four different
REPORTERS stand in front of four different cameras giving four
different news reports.

She moves passed a policeman standing guard.  Her interest peaked,
she stops at the first reporter who is...

GALE WEATHERS

Thirties.  He smart face is overshadowed by a flashy smile and a
massive mane of chemically enhanced hair.

                GALE
            (for the camera)
        The small town of Bayboro, North Carolina
        was devastated last night when two young
        teenagers were found brutally butchered.
        Authorities have yet to issue a statement
        but our sources tell us that no arrest
        has been made and the murderer could
        strike again...

ON SIDNEY.  Moved, disturbed.  From behind, a finger taps her
shoulder.  She spins around to see...

Tatum Riley, same age, feisty, carefree.

                TATUM
        Do you believe this shit?

                SIDNEY
        What happened?

They break away from the crowd and head for school.

                TATUM
        Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker
        and Steve Forrest were killed last night.

                SIDNEY
        No way.

                TATUM
        And not just killed, Sid. We're talking
        splatter movie killed-split open end to
        end.

                SIDNEY
        Casey Becker? She sits next to me in
        English.

                TATUM
        Not anymore. Her parents found her
        hanging from a tree. Her insides on the
        outside.

                SIDNEY
        Do they know who did it?

                TATUM
        Fucking clueless-they're interrogating
        the entire school. Teachers, students,
        staff, janitors...

                SIDNEY
        They think it's school-related?

                TATUM
        They don't know. Dewey said this is
        the worst crime they've ever seen.
        Even worse than...
            (stopping herself)
        Well it's bad. They're bringing in the
        feds. This is big.

Sidney looks back at Gale, her face deeply pained.

INT.  CLASSROOM - LATER

A frumpy old woman, MRS. TATE, faces her class.  Her hands clasped
together.  A tragic look upon her face.

                MRS. TATE
        ..a terrible tragedy. An unbearable
        loss. It's days like today we need
        prayer in school...

Sidney sits near the rear of the room.  The desk in front of her
sits vacant.  Sidney can't take her eyes of it.

The door opens and a student opens with a slip of paper.  He hand
s it to Mrs. Tate.

                MRS. TATE
        Sidney. It appears to be your turn.

INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

The room is at capacity...wall to wall with police, and the likes.
Some sit, stand, lean...

SHERIFF BURKE, a round man in his fifties, wipes the stress from
his face.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Who's up next?

A young officer looks at the clipboard.  This is DEPUTY RILEY,
better known as DEWEY.  He's a big guy, 20's, handsome in a
scrubbed-clean boyish way.

                DEWEY
        Sidney Prescott.

Sheriff Burke gestures to bring her in.  PRINCIPAL HIMBRY, 50's,
an old codger of a man wearing a sour face speaks up.

                MR. HIMBRY
        Sidney Prescott. She was daughter of...

                DEWEY
        We all know Sidney, Mr. Himbry.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        How she doin'?

                MR. HIMBRY
        She's adjusted well. Maintains an "A"
        average. You never know she...

Himbry stops short, seeing Sidney in the doorway.  He rises and
seats her.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Hi Sidney.

                SIDNEY
        Sheriff Burke. Dewey.

Dewey shakes his head seriously.

                DEWEY
        It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        How is everything?

                SIDNEY
        Good.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        And your Dad? How's he doing?

                SIDNEY
        We're fine. Thanks.

                MR. HIMBRY
        We'll be brief, Sidney. The police have a
        few questions they'd like to ask you...

Sidney eyes them all nervously.

EXT.  SCHOOL COURTYARD - LATER

Students sit at outdoor tables eating lunch.  Crowded at one table
is the "gang".  This consists of Sidney, Billy and Tatum.

Next to Tatum, sits her boyfriend STUART, with his arm draped
across her back.  He's a Billy wannabe.  Almost the jock, almost
handsome, almost cool.  He tries way to hard.

Across the table is the fifth wheel, RANDY.  A tall and gangly kid
with no such Billy-like aspirations.  A witty jokester who
elevates geek to coolness.

                TATUM
        Hunt? Why would they ask if you like
        to hunt?

                STU
        I don't know, they just did.

                RANDY
        Because their bodies were gutted.

Sidney flinches.

                BILLY
        Thanks Randy.

                TATUM
        They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.

                STU
        Because there's no way a girl could have
        killed them.

                TATUM
        That is so sexist. The killer could
        easily be female-BASIC INSTINCT.

                RANDY
        That was an ice pick-not exactly the
        same.

                STU
        Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely
        hollowed out. Takes a man to do
        something like that.

                TATUM
        Or a man's mentality.

                SIDNEY
            (quiet, almost to herself)
        How do you gut someone?

All eyes turn to Sidney.  A serious silence.  And then:

                STU
        You take a knife and slit from the groin
        to the sternum.

Sidney shivers down to her soul.  The whole table rolls their eyes
at Stu.

                STU
        What? She asked.

                BILLY
        It's called tact, you fuckrag.

                STU
        Sorry.

                RANDY
        Remember in JAWS when they caught the
        wrong shark at first and Richard Dreyfuss
        cut it open to look foe body parts and all
        they found was a licence plate and all this
        white milky goo.

Stu leans over and socks Randy in the arm.

                STU
        You heard Billy-shut the fuck up.

                SIDNEY
        Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?

Stu's taken back, a little off guard.

                STU
        For about two seconds.

                RANDY
        Before she dumped him foe Steve.

Tatum turns to Stu, surprised.

                TATUM
        I thought you dumped her for me.

                STU
        I did. He's full of shit.

                RANDY
        And are the police aware you dated the
        victim?

                STU
            (offended)
        What are you saying? That I killed
        her or something?

                RANDY
        It would certainly improve your high
        school Q.

                TATUM
        Stu was with me last night.

                RANDY
        Oooooh...before or after he sliced and
        diced.

                TATUM
        Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last
        night?

                RANDY
        Working, thank you.

                TATUM
        I thought Blockbuster fired you.

                RANDY
        Twice.

                STU
        I didn't kill anybody.

                BILLY
        No one's saying you did.

                RANDY
        Besides-
            (perfect Stu mimic)
        "Takes a man to do something like that."

                STU
        I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.

                RANDY
            (to Stu)
        Did you really put her liver in the
        mailbox? I hear they found her liver
        in the mailbox.

                TATUM
            (eyeing Sidney)
        Randy, you goon-fuck, I'm eating here.

Stu nibbles at Tatum's neck.

                STU
        Yeah, Randy, she's getting mad. I think
        you better liver alone.

Stu cracks up at his own joke.  The others just MOAN.  Sidney is
about to crawl out of her skin, trying hard to ignore it all.

EXT.  SIDNEY'S HOUSE - LATER

A huge two story country home with a spacious lawn.

A yellow school bus stops in front of the house and Sidney steps
off.

The house looks big and lonely as Sidney moves up the walk to the
front door.

INT.  BEDROOM - LATER

Sidney is on the telephone.

                SIDNEY
            (into phone)
        You sure I can stay over?  My dad won't
        be back til Sunday.

                TATUM
            (through phone)
        No prob. I'll pick you up after
        practice.

                SIDNEY
        Tell your mom I said thanks.

                TATUM
        Yeah, yeah...are you okay?

                SIDNEY
        Uh-huh, it's just...you know, the police
        and reporters...it brings it all back.

                TATUM
        I'll be there by seven. I promise

                SIDNEY
        Thanks, Tatum.

                TATUM
        Later.

Sidney hangs up.  She takes a seat at her computer and boots it
up.  She sits in front of it staring at the blue screen...her own
reflection staring back.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - LATER

Sidney comes down the stairs, her arms carrying a change of
clothes, toothbrush, make-up...

She opens the hall closet and pulls a small overnight bag from the
top shelf.  Moving into the living room she loads it up, plopping
down on the sofa, hitting the TV remote.

CLOSE ON THE SCREEN

A news reporter fades in.

                REPORTER #1
            (on TV)
        The entire nation was shocked today by
        the teen murders in North Carolina...

Sidney switches channels.

                REPORTER #2
        The State Bureau of Investigation has
        joined forces with local authorities to
        help catch what the Governor has called
        the most heinous...

The channel switches again.  Gale weathers appears, standing in
front of the school.  Her white teeth gleaming.

                GALE
        This is not the first time the small town
        of Bayboro has endured such tragedy. Only
        a year ago, Maureen Prescott, wife and
        mother, was found raped and murdered...

An old black and white snapshot fills the screen-a woman,
beautiful and familiar.

CLOSE ON SIDNEY

eyes frozen, mesmerized by the image.  Suddenly she CLICKS the TV
off.  Her eyes go to the clock on the end table.  5:45 PM.  Her
eyes then move to the framed photo next to it...the same black and
white photo stares at her...a healthy, vibrant woman.  An older
version of Sidney.

Sidney curls up on the sofa closing her eyes tight...

INT.  LIVING ROOM - LATER

The clock on the end table reads 7:15 PM.  Sidney is fast asleep
on the couch.  The phone RINGS.  Sidney leaps up grabbing the
portable phone.

                TATUM
            (from phone)
        Practice ran late. I'm on my way.

                SIDNEY
            (eyes clock)
        It's past seven.

                TATUM
        Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite
        it til way after ten.

                SIDNEY
        I'm not worried.

                TATUM
        Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER
        and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in
        ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you
        pause it just right you can see his penis.

                SIDNEY
        Whatever. Just hurry.

                TATUM
        Bye.

She hangs up the phone.  It immediately RINGS again.

                SIDNEY
            (into phone)
        Tatum?

                MAN'S VOICE
            (from phone)
        Hello, Sidney.

IT'S HIM.  THE VOICE FROM BEFORE.

                SIDNEY
        Hi. Who is this?

                MAN
        You tell me.

Sidney thinks, trying to place his voice.  It sounds a little
distorted.

                SIDNEY
        I have no idea.

                MAN
        Scary night, isn't it? With the murders
        and all, it's like right out of a horror
        movie or something.

                SIDNEY
        Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are
        you calling from work? Tatum's on her
        way over.

                MAN
        Do you like scary movies, Sidney?

                SIDNEY
        I like that thing you're doing with your
        voice, Randy. It's sexy.

                MAN
        What's your favorite scary movie?

                SIDNEY
        Don't start. You know I don't watch that
        shit.

                MAN
        And why is that?

                SIDNEY
            (playing along)
        Because they're all the same. It's
        always some stupid killer stalking some
        big breasted girl-who can't act-who
        always runs up the stairs when she should
        be going out the front door. They're
        ridiculous.

A brief silence.

                MAN
        Are you alone in the house?

                SIDNEY
        That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me,
        Randy.

                MAN
        Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.

                SIDNEY
        So who are you?

                MAN
        The question is not who am I. The
        question is where am I?

                SIDNEY
        So where are you?

                MAN
        Your front porch.

This gives her pause.  She moves to the window and pulls aside the
drapes.

                SIDNEY
        Why would you call me from my
        front porch?

                MAN
        That's the original part.

ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW.  She can't quite see all of the porch.

                SIDNEY
        Oh yeah? Well I call your bluff.

Sidney goes to the front door.  She unlocks the bolt, unsnags the
chain, and pulls the door open...revealing the front porch...

COMPLETELY EMPTY.

She steps out onto it, phone still in hand.  A single light shines
overhead illuminating the porch, but little beyond.  Darkness is
all around.

                SIDNEY
        So where are you?

                MAN
        Right here.

Sidney peers out into the darkness past thick shrubs that grow on
either side of the porch.

                SIDNEY
        Can you see me right now?

                MAN
        Uh-huh.

                SIDNEY
        What am I doing?

She sticks her finger up her nose, pretending to pick.  Silence.
No answer.

                SIDNEY
        Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry.
        Bye now.

                MAN
        If you hang up, you'll die just like your
        mother.

Sidney stops dead in her tracks, speechless.

                MAN
            (deadly)
        Do you want to die, Sidney? Your mother
        didn't.

His seriousness unnerves her.  Sid flies off the handle.

                SIDNEY
        FUCK YOU! YOU CRETIN!

She hangs up on him.  Moves back inside the house.  Locks, chains,
and bolts the door when...

A FIGURE COMES LEAPING OUT OF THE HALL CLOSET

rushing her, ramming into her side..the phone flies..the FIGURE is
on top of her as she goes down...SCREAMING...

She looks up to see the FIGURE, darkly dressed with a pale,
distorted face, white and ghostly...a mask.

Her instincts surface and she kicks up with her foot making the
contact with his leg...he topples over...coming right at her, his
hand finding her neck.  Suddenly, along, silver blade appears
above her.

Sidney pulls, jerks, twists...finally she lifts her torso forward
knocking the FIGURE off her...sending him reeling into the living
room.  Wasting no time, Sidney leaps to her feet.

She moves to the front door, unlocks it...pulls it open...it
catches on the chain.  Shit!  She pushes it closed again looking
behind her..the FIGURE has risen, knife in hand.
Sidney pulls on the chain and then-inexplicably turns and...

RUNS UP THE STAIRS.  The FIGURE right behind her.

INT.  UPSTAIRS LANDING

The FIGURE leaps at Sidney taking hold of her foot, she grabs
madly at the wall...her hands grasp a framed painting-a quiet
country home, subdued colors, done in oils-she rips it from the
wall swinging it behind her...

It catches the FIGURE head on, smashing against his skull, sending
him backwards, tumbling down the stairs.  Sidney races to her
bedroom...

INT.  BEDROOM

She locks the door shut, the pulls her closet door open, placing
the edge right at the door knob just as...

THE FIGURE POUNDS AGAINST THE BEDROOM DOOR...

ramming it, it rips open, but the closet door catches it in a
crazy vice-like hold.

Sidney grabs the desk phone.  It's dead...off the hook downstairs.

The figure rushes the door several times..the frame splinters..but
won't give.

Sidney is at her computer, she punches at the keypad madly.

CLOSE ON SCREEN AS WORDS APPEAR.

        FAX MODEM

        9-1-1 SEND

The knife slashes through the crack in the door wildly.

ON SCREEN AGAIN

        HELP KILLER

        34 ELM ST

Sidney presses SEND when it occurs to her-all is quiet.  The
FIGURE is gone.  A fearful silence.  She looks around...the only
sound her own rapid, terrified BREATHING.

ON THE SCREEN

        "Stay calm.  Police enroute."

Suddenly a NOISE at the window...Sidney looks up to see...

BILLY

her boyfriend, staring at her, surprised.

                SIDNEY
        Oh Billy...Please...God...

                BILLY
        I heard screaming. The door was locked.
        Are you okay...

                SIDNEY
        He's here. He's trying to kill me...

Billy pulls himself through the window.  As he does, a small black
object falls from his dark jeans.  It hits the floor as Sidney
eyes it...a sleek, compact cellular phone.

Sidney stops in her tracks.  Their eyes meet...an eternity.  A
SIREN is heard in the distance.  Sidney bolts...

                BILLY
        Hey...wait...what's goin..

Billy reaches for her.  Sidney unblocks the bedroom door and tears
out of the room.

INT.  LANDING

Sidney nearly falls down the stairs...

INT.  FOYER

She rips the chain off the door, pulls it open, coming face to
face with a white, ghostly mask.
A massive SCREAM erupts from her gut as...

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK

to find Dewey-Deputy Riley, holding it.  Red lights flash, sirens
BLAST vas car after car surrounds the house.

Sidney falls into the safety of Dewey's arms.

EXT.  FRONT YARD - MINUTES LATER

The yard is a whirlwind of activity.  An ambulance, squad cars,
cops everywhere...

CLOSE ON BILLY'S FACE

as it SMASHES against the hood of a police car.  His hands are
being cuffed, his rights being read.

                BILLY
            (screaming)
        I didn't do anything! Sid...where's Sid?
        Ask her, she'll tell ya...

Dewey holds a car door open as Sheriff Burke steps out.

                DEWEY
        We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Hank Loomis' kid? Aw..Jesus...

                DEWEY
        He's her boyfriend.

They approach Billy as he's being placed in a squad car.

                BILLY
        Sheriff...I didn't do it...please, call
        my Dad..please...

The squad car disappears with Billy as another car comes to a stop
in front of the house.  Tatum gets out, freaked beyond belief.

Back to the Sheriff and Dewey as they storm across the yard.

                DEWEY
        I was first to respond.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        What were you doing out here?

                DEWEY
        Drive by patrol.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        How is she?

                DEWEY
        She's tough.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Have to be. The shit she's gone through.

Across the yard sits Sidney, in the back of an ambulance as
PARAMEDICS check her out.

Sheriff Burke and Riley approach.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        We're seeing a lot of you today.

She tries to smile but fails.

                DEWEY
        You gonna be able to come down to the
        station and talk to us a bit?

                SIDNEY
        ..yeah...

TATUM appears, barreling past an OFFICER.

                TATUM
        What happened? Oh God...

Tatum rushes to her, grabbing hold of her.

                DEWEY
            (to Tatum)
        What are you doing here?

                TATUM
        Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.

                DEWEY
        You can't be here, Tatum. This is an
        official crime scene.

                SIDNEY
        It's okay. She was supposed to pick me
        up.

                TATUM
        Her dad's out of town. She's staying
        with us.

                DEWEY
        Does mom know?

                TATUM
        Yes, you doofus.

Two news vans come driving up the street.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        The vultures are coming. Let's get you
        out of here.

EXT.  STREET

A big, white news van comes to a stop in front of the house.  The
side door slides open and Gale Weathers hops out just in time to
see Sidney being escorted to a squad car.

                GALE
        I'll be damned.

Jumping from the driver's seat is KENNY, Gale's cameraman and
flunky.  An earnest young chap on the chubby side.

                KENNY
        What? What?

                GALE
        Jesus! The camera-hurry!

But it's too late.  Sidney is as good as gone.  Gale sees Tatum
moving quickly to her car.

                GALE
        Excuse me?

Tatum looks up to see Gale Weathers rushing her.

                GALE
        Was that Sidney Prescott they took away?

                TATUM
        I don't know.

Tatum hops in her car, ignoring her.

                GALE
        What happened to her?

                TATUM
        I'm not talking to you.

Tatum's car peels out as Kenny comes running up with his camera.

                KENNY
        Where'd she go?

Gale spins around, flashing her pearly whites.

                GALE
        Look, Kenny, I know you're about fifty
        pounds overweight but when I say hurry
        please interpret that as...MOVE YOUR
        FAT TUB OF LARD ASS NOW!

Gale moves back to the van leaving Kenny miffed.

INT.  POLICE STATION

A small town station.  The bull pen is a little square room with
four desks and tonight--it's hopping.  Cops everywhere.

INT.  SHERIFF'S OFFICE

Sidney sits at a desk drinking a cup of water.  She wears the
Sheriff's jacket over her shoulders.  Dewey approaches.

                SIDNEY
        Did you reach my Dad?

                DEWEY
        You're sure it was the Hilton?

                SIDNEY
        At the airport.

                DEWEY
        He's not registered. Could he have gone
        to another hotel?

                SIDNEY
        I don't know. I guess.

                DEWEY
        We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.

Sidney stares blankly, numb.

INT.  SHERIFF'S OFFICE

Billy sits opposite Sheriff Burke.  Next to Billy, sits his
father, HANK LOOMIS, an older version of Billy.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        What are you doing with a cellular
        telephone, son?

                MR. LOOMIS
        It's my phone. He was just playing
        around with it.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        You got some ideas of playing around, boy.

                BILLY
        I didn't call anyone with it. I just
        took it for fun.

                MR. LOOMIS
        Everybody's got one now. Why don't you
        check the phone bill for chrissakes.
        Call my carrier--AirFone Comp. They'll
        have records of every number dialed.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were
        you doing out at Sidney's tonight?

                BILLY
        I just wanted to see her, that's all.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        You rode your bike out there?

                BILLY
        Yes, sir.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        And last night? Sidney said you crawled
        through her window last night too?

                MR. LOOMIS
            (surprised)
        You were out last night?

                BILLY
        I watched TV for awhile but the I felt
        like going for a bike ride.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?

                BILLY
        No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone,
        Sheriff.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The
        governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows
        who else on their way down here.

Billy fights tears.

                BILLY
        This is crazy. I didn't do it.

Sheriff Burke eyes him up and down, very carefully.

INT.  POLICE BULL PEN - MINUTES LATER

Tatum has joined Sidney.  The sheriff's door opens and Billy is
led out by a coupla UNIFORMS.  Burke and Dewey appear in the door
watching Tatum comfort Sidney.

OUT OF EAR SHOT

                DEWEY
        That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's
        and WalMart. Neither of which keep
        purchase records.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        What about the cellular phone bill?

                DEWEY
        They're pulling Loomis' account. But
        it'll be morning before we see something.
        You think he did it?

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Twenty years ago I woulda said not a
        chance. But these kids today...damn if I
        know.

                TATUM
            (o.s.)
        Hey...Dewey. Can we go now?

                DEWEY
        Hold up a sec...

                SHERIFF BURKE
        She staying with you?

                DEWEY
        We haven't located her Dad yet.

                TATUM
            (o.s.)
        Goddammit, Dewey!

Dewey turns to her, his face red.

                DEWEY
        What did Mama tell you? When I wear this
        badge you treat me like a man of the law.

                TATUM
        I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're
        ready to go.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Use the back way. Avoid the circus.

EXT.  POLICE STATION - SIDE DOOR

The door opens and Sidney, Tatum, Dewey, and a coupla OFFICERS
exit avoiding the horde of REPORTERS that can be seen around the
corner waiting anxiously at the front entrance.

                DEWEY
        I'll get the car. Wait here.

Dewey takes off.  From the darkness of the alley, Gale Weathers
appears with Kenny and his camera.  They've been waiting.

                GALE
        Hello Sidney.

Sidney spins around to see Gale, standing, smiling at her.
Sidney's body tightens and her face goes taut.

                GALE
        Some night. Are you alright?

Their eyes meet in cold familiar stare.  Sidney says nothing.
She's visibly shaking.

                GALE
        What happened?

                TATUM
        She's not answering any questions. Just
        leave us alone, okay?

                SIDNEY
        It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her
        job. Right, GALE?

                GALE
        Yes, that's right.

Dewey, in a squad car, turns into the alley and pulls up.  The
other news people have wisened up.  They begin to flock the alley.

                SIDNEY
        How's the book?

                GALE
        It'll be out later this year.

Sidney tries to contain herself..squeezing a clenched fist.

                SIDNEY
        I'll look for it.

                GALE
        I'll send you a copy.

In a blurred, unexpected instant, Sidney brings her fist forward,
SMASHING it hard into Gale Weathers's face.  The impact sends Gale
reeling backwards, knocking into Kenny as they both tumble to the
pavement.

ON SIDNEY...breathing deep, a sense of satisfaction on her face.

INT.  TATUM'S BEDROOM - LATER

A spacious bedroom.  Typical.  Tatum and Sidney lay on the bed.
They both wear night shirts.

                TATUM
        God, I loved it. "I'll send you a copy."
        BAM! Bitch went down. "I'll send you a
        copy." BAM! Sid--SuperBitch!

Dewey appears in the doorway holding a bag of ice.

                DEWEY
        I thought you might want some ice for
        that right hook.

Sidney sits up, takes the ice, and puts it on her hand.

                DEWEY
        I'll be right next door. Try to get some
        sleep.

Dewey moves back out the door.

                SIDNEY
        Any word on my Dad?

                DEWEY
            (turning to her)
        Not yet, but we're looking. If you need
        anything...

                TATUM
        Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Dewey smiles, pulling the door closed on his way out.  Sidney lies
back down.

                SIDNEY
        Just another sleepover at the Riley's.

                TATUM
        Just like old times, ain't it?

                SIDNEY
        No, nothing's like it used to be.

Sidney rolls over at her side, away from Tatum.

A telephone RINGS somewhere in the house.

                TATUM
        Do you really think Billy did it?

                SIDNEY
        He was there, Tatum.

                TATUM
        I knew this guy was too perfect. He was
        destined to have a flaw.

A KNOCK at the door.  It opens and a friendly, graying woman pops
in.  This is MAMA RILEY.  She wears a comforting smile.

                MAMA RILEY
        Telephone, dear.

                TATUM
        Who is it?

                MAMA RILEY
        It's for Sid

                SIDNEY
        My Dad?

Mama Riley shakes her head sadly.

                TATUM
        Take a message.

                SIDNEY
        It's alright. I'll get it.

Sidney takes off out the door.  Mama Riley motions to Tatum.

                MAMA RILEY
            (whispers)
        How is she?

Tatum shrugs.

INT.  HALLWAY

Sidney grabs the phone at the end of the hall.

                SIDNEY
        Hello?

                MAN
            (from phone)
        Hello Sidney.

IT'S HIM.  The CAMERA does a Hitchcock as Sidney's entire body
goes weak..his VOICE moving through her..invading her.  She CRIES
OUT.

                SIDNEY
        NOOOOOO...

Mama Riley turns in the doorway.  Tatum comes bolting out of the
bedroom.

                MAN
            (from phone)
        Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy
        doesn't stand a chance with you.

                SIDNEY
        LEAVEMEALONE!

                MAN
        Looks like you fingered the wrong
        guy...again.

                SIDNEY
        Who are you?

                TATUM
        Hang up, Sid.

                MAN
        Don't worry. You'll find out soon
        enough. I promise.

Mama Riley BEATS on a closed bedroom door.

                MAMA RILEY
        Dewey! Dewey!

                MAN
        This is gonna be fun, Sidney. Just like
        old times.

CLICK.

Dewey flies out of his room wearing only his boxers...holding his
gun.

                DEWEY
        What? What?

The phone goes dead.  Sidney stands frozen.

EXT.  BAYBORO MAIN STREET - DAWN - ESTABLISHING

The morning sun shines high over Bayboro Townsquare.  Cars come to
life, townsfolk stir as the picture postcard community awakens
from a restless sleep.

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

Sidney and Tatum sit at the kitchen table, dressed and ready for
school as Mama Riley serves up breakfast.  A small television sits
on the counter BLARING.

Dewey, in uniform, stands near the door, talking on the phone.

                MAMA RILEY
        I think you girls really should stay home
        today.

                TATUM
        Your objection is duly noted.

                SIDNEY
        I'd rather be around a lot of people,
        Mama Riley.

From the TV, Sidney hears her name, "SIDNEY PRESCOTT..."  All eyes
go to the television.

                REPORTER
            (on TV)
        ..who escaped a vicious attack last night
        was the daughter of Maureen Prescott who
        was brutally killed last year when
        convicted murderer Cotton Weary...

INSERT of COTTON WEARY, in prison fatigues.  A once handsome man,
now haggard and worn.

                REPORTER
            (cont'd)
        ..broke into their home and savagely
        raped and tortured the deceased. Cotton
        Weary is currently awaiting appeal for
        the death sentence handed down after the
        young Sidney testified against him. She
        was the key witness in the state's
        prosecution...

                SIDNEY
        It's never gonna stop. Is it?

Dewey is off the phone.

                DEWEY
        Billy was released. His cellular bill
        was clean. He didn't make those calls.

                SIDNEY
        Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not
        making it up.

                DEWEY
        I know. We're checking every cellular
        account in the county. Any calls made to
        you or Casey Becker are being cross-
        referenced. It's gonna take time but
        we'll find him.

                SIDNEY
        And my Dad? Any word on him?

Riley shakes his head "no".

EXT.  SCHOOL STREET - LATER

Once again, REPORTERS line the street attacking students as they
make their way to school, asking questions, hungry for that
teenage insight.

Dewey's patrol jeep cruises by.  Sidney watches from the
passenger's window.

INT.  PATROL CAR

Dewey pulls up in front of the school.  Tatum hops out while Sid
lingers, suddenly unsure.  Dewey takes notice.

                DEWEY
        Hey, it's school. You'll be safe here.

Sidney forces herself out of the jeep as a microphone is shoved in
her face...

                REPORTER
        How does it feel to almost be brutally
        murdered?

Dewey leaps from the car, intercepting the reporter.

                DEWEY
        Leave the girl alone, will ya? She wants
        to go to school.

Sidney eyes the newsvan that's pulled up behind her.  The side
door slides open and Gale Weathers steps out.

                TATUM
        Come on, Sid.

                SIDNEY
        Just a sec...I need to talk to someone.

She heads over to Gale.

EXT.  NEWSVAN - STREET

Sidney, puts her head down, hiding her face...avoiding other
reporters as she makes her way to...

Gale who sits in the open door, checking her face in a mirror.
Makeup tries hard to hide Sid's handwork-a swollen black and blue
right cheek.

Gale spots Sidney immediately and leaps to her feet.

                GALE
        Stop right there.

Sidney throws her hands up in surrender.

                SIDNEY
        I'm not here to fight.

                GALE
        Just stay back.

                SIDNEY
        I want to talk to you.

                GALE
            (calling into the van)
        Kenny. Camera. Now.

Kenny's head darts out from the van.

                SIDNEY
        Off the record. No cameras.

                GALE
        Forget it.

Sidney contains herself.

                SIDNEY
        Please. You owe me.

                GALE
        I owe you shit.

Gale moves inside the van.  But Sidney is relentless.

                SIDNEY
        You owe my mother.

                GALE
        Your mother's murder was last year's
        hottest court case. Somebody was gonna
        write a book about it.

                SIDNEY
        And it had to be you with all your lies
        and bullshit theories.

                GALE
        What is your problem? You got what you
        wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail.
        They're gonna gas him. A book is not
        gonna change that.

                SIDNEY
        Do you still think he's innocent?

Gale's interest is peaked.  She eyes Sidney suspiciously.

                GALE
        He was convicted in a court of law. Your
        testimony put him away. It doesn't
        matter what I think.

                SIDNEY
        During the trial, you did all those
        stories about me. You called me a liar.

                GALE
        I think you falsely identified him. Yes.

                SIDNEY
        Have you talked to Cotton?

                GALE
        Many times.

                SIDNEY
        Has his story changed?

                GALE
        Not one word. He admits to having sex
        with your mother but that's all.

                SIDNEY
        He's lying. She wouldn't have touched
        him. He raped her, then butchered her.
        Her blood was all over his coat.

                GALE
        He was drunk that night. He left his
        coat at your house, after your mother
        seduced him...

                SIDNEY
        I saw him leaving wearing it.

                GALE
        But couldn't it have been someone else
        you saw wearing that coat? The same
        person who planted it in Cotton's car,
        framing him? The same person who
        really killed your mother?

A long beat.  Sidney considers this for the millionth time.

                SIDNEY
        No, Cotton murdered my mother.

But there's doubt in her voice.  Gale's face lights up.

                GALE
        You're not so sure anymore, are you?

Sidney clams up.

                SIDNEY
        No, it was Cotton.

Tatum comes waltzing up.

                TATUM
            (to GALE)
        Nice welt.

Gale ignores her, zeroing in on Sidney, half realizing.

                GALE
        The killer is still on the loose, isn't
        he? These murders are related.

                TATUM
        Yo--let's rock.

Sidney starts to fidget.

                SIDNEY
        I'm sorry I mangled your face.

She take off with Tatum.  Gale calls after her.

                GALE
        Wait, Sidney, don't go...

But Sidney and Tatum have already disappeared in the crowd of
students moving across campus.

Gale looks to Kenny.

                GALE
        Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death
        row. A killer still on the loose.
        Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.

                KENNY
        You want to go live?

Gale's mind races with possibilities.

                GALE
        No, not so fast. We have nothing
        concrete.

                KENNY
        When did that ever stop you? You can't
        sit on this. This is huge.

                GALE
        If I'm gonna blow this up-I need hard
        proof.

                KENNY
        But it's so much easier when we make it
        up.

                GALE
        Not this time. I owe Cotton that much.
        Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.

EXT.  SCHOOL CAMPUS - SECONDS LATER

Tatum and Sidney make their way across campus.

                TATUM
        Just relax. You're at school now. No
        one can get you here.

                SIDNEY
        But if it wasn't Billy it could be
        anybody. He could be here at school
        right now.

They move up the walk as a FIGURE falls in step behind them,
sporting a WHITE GHOST MASK.

                TATUM
        Serial killers are smart by definition.
        They minimize their risk. They plan and
        pre-calculate everything. Showing up
        here would be the most lame-brain
        move he could make.

                SIDNEY
        He promised me he'd be back.

As easy as the figure appeared, it disappears-falling out of site,
unseen by either of them.

                TATUM
        I wouldn't put too much stock in a
        psycho's promise.

They move up the front steps toward the main doors of the school
as the GHOST MASKED FIGURE reappears...standing at the top of the
steps...Sidney sees it first, stopping dead in her tracks.

She steps back, spinning around to find...

A GHOST FACE behind her as well, both of them approaching, closing
in on her.  Sidney starts to SCREAM when the two ghosts bust up
LAUGHING, tearing off across campus.

EXT.  STREET

In front of the school we catch up a REPORTER doing a live remote.
He holds a mask in his hand.

                REPORTER
        This morning several students, in what
        appears to be a prank, have been spotted
        wearing masks. School officials have yet
        to comment but this is the same type of
        mask worn by the killer...

INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

Just before the bell.  The hallway is congested with students
heading to class.  Tatum is at her locker with Sidney.

                SIDNEY
        This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.

                TATUM
        I want you to meet me here right after
        class, okay?

Billy appears in the crowd, with Stu tagging behind.  Tatum spots
him first.

                TATUM
        Shit, what is he doing here?

                SIDNEY
        I bet he's pissed.

                TATUM
        Just ignore him. You had good reason to
        think what you did.

Billy and Stu approach.  Billy's face is solemn.

                BILLY
        Hi, Sid. Can we talk a sec?

Sidney says nothing.  She can barely look at him.  Tatum
intervenes.

                TATUM
        You know if I were accused of carving up
        two people, I'd take the opportunity to
        skip school.

                STU
        Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.

                BILLY
        Talk to me, Sid.

Suddenly, a SCREAM erupts.  All eyes go to a GHOST MASKED STUDENT
running down the hall, screaming wildly, running amuck.

                SIDNEY
        Why are they doing this?

                STU
        Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.

Billy punches Stu in the side.

                STU
        Owwww...

                BILLY
        You open your mouth and stupidity pours
        out.

                STU
        Sorry.

Sidney, clearly upset, takes off down the hall.  Billy races off
after her.

                TATUM
            (yelling)
        Stay away from her, Billy.

Tatum SLAMS her locker door shut as the bell RINGS.

INT.  CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER

With first period underway, the halls have cleared.  One or two
struggling students can be seen rushing to class.

Sidney moves quickly down the hall, rounding a corner, running
smack into...

BILLY

They collide hard catching Sidney off guard, scaring the life out
of her.  She falls backwards, but Billy catches her fall.

                SIDNEY
        Jesus, SHIT!

                BILLY
        Hey, hey, it's just me.

Sidney pulls away from him quickly.  Billy feels the slight.

                BILLY
        What? You don't still think it's me?

Sidney catches her breath.

                SIDNEY
        No...I don't...it's just...Oh God, Billy,
        someone was there, someone tried to
        kill me.

                BILLY
        The police say I scared him off. It
        wasn't me, Sid.

                SIDNEY
        I know. He called again last night at
        Tatum's house.

                BILLY
        See, it couldn't have been me. I was in
        jail, remember?

                SIDNEY
        I'm so sorry...please understand.

                BILLY
        Understand what? That I got a girlfriend
        who would rather accuse me of being a
        psychopathic killer than touch me.

                SIDNEY
        You know that's not true.

                BILLY
        Then what is it? Is there somebody else?

                SIDNEY
        No...

                BILLY
        Is it the sex thing? Am I being too
        pushy?

                SIDNEY
        No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm
        still adjusting to my mom.

                BILLY
        It's been a year since she died.

                SIDNEY
            (correcting him)
        Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.

                BILLY
        When are you gonna let that go, Sid?
        When my mom left my dad--I just accepted
        it. This is the way it is. She's not coming
        back.

                SIDNEY
            (sharply)
        Your parents split up. It's not the same
        thing. Your mom left town, she's not in
        a coffin somewhere.

                BILLY
        You have to move on, Sid.

Sidney starts to walk away but turns back, angry.

                SIDNEY
        I'm glad to know you're coping so well
        with life, Billy. But some of us aren't so
        perfect. Some of us are just trying to
        hold on.

Sidney disappears through a door marked GIRL'S BATHROOM, leaving
Billy alone in the hallway.  He SMACKS his forehead, pissed at
himself.

INT.  GIRL'S BATHROOM

Large and spacious.  Closed bathroom stalls line one wall facing a
row of sinks and a huge mirror.  Sidney enters as TWO GIRLS tinkle
and talk--each from their respective stalls.

                GIRL #1
        She was never attacked. I think she made
        it all up.

                GIRL #2
        Why would she lie about it?

                GIRL #1
        For attention. The girl has some serious
        issues.

Sidney listens intently.

A toilet FLUSHES.  Sidney quickly jumps in a stall, hiding, just
as GIRL #1 appears from a stall.  She looks like that voice--a
snotty little twit.

                GIRL #1
        What if she did it? What if Sidney
        killed Casey and Steve?

                GIRL #2
        And why would she do that?

                GIRL #1
        Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed
        them both in a jealous rage.

Another toilet FLUSHES.

                GIRL #2
        Why would Sidney want to be with Steve?
        She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.

                GIRL #1
        Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.

INSIDE THE STALL Sidney listens.  Her face weakening.

                GIRL #2
        You're evil.

                GIRL #1
        Please, it's common knowledge. Her
        mother was a trollop.

GIRL #2 appears from her stall--another twit.  They both stand in
front of the mirror adjusting two snotty faces.

                GIRL #2
        Cut some slack. She watched her mom get
        butchered.

                GIRL #1
        And it fucked her up royally. Think
        about it. It makes perfect sense. Her
        mom's death leaves her distraught and
        hostile at a cruel and inhumane world,
        she's disillusioned, where's God, etc.
        Completely suicidal. And one day she
        snaps. She wants to kill herself but
        realizes teen suicide is out this year.
        And homicide is a much healthier
        therapeutic expression.

From the stall, Sidney listens, her heart pounding, jaw quivering.

                GIRL #2
        Where do you get this shit?

                GIRL #1
        Ricki Lake.

The two girls exit.  Sidney moves out of the stall, catching her
reflection in the mirror.

                SIDNEY
        Pathetic.

Water DRIPS somewhere from a leaky pipe as wind WHISTLES in from
the cracked transom above the bathroom door.  It sound almost like
a whisper,   "Siddneey..."

Sidney spins around.  What the...  She checks out the bathroom.
The doors to the stalls are all closed.  She bends down and scans
beneath them, looking for feet.  No one.  Nothing.

Sidney turns back to the mirror.  Suddenly...

                MAN
            (o.c. whisper)
        Siddneey...

Unmistakable this time.  The VOICE strikes Sidney like a nail
through the eye.  It comes from one of the stalls.  She stands
thunderstruck, eyeing the stalls thru the mirror.

                SIDNEY
        Is someone there?

A long, morose silence.  And then:

                MAN
            (softly, simply)
        It's me, Sidney.

Sidney spins around.  Fuck no!  HE'S HERE.  Terror floods her
face.  She eyes the exit door, then the row of stalls she must
pass to get to it.

She checks under the stalls again.  Nothing...where the fuck is
he?  She takes a step forward when...

TWO FEET step down from a toilet onto the floor in the last stall.
Sidney's face draws tight as the stall door begins to CREAK open.
She bolts forward, making a break for it...but slips on the wet
floor...her feet flying out from under...

Sidney reaches out...grabs hold of a sink...saves herself from
falling...she glimpses a GHOST MASK in the mirror coming for her.
A hand grabs her shoulder as she SLAMS her body through the exit
door...narrowly escaping.

INT.  CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Sidney flies out of the bathroom door SCREAMING...burning up the
hallway, not looking back.  A TEACHER, hearing her SCREAM, peer
out from an open doorway...as Sidney sprints by him, not
stopping...running madly.

INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE on a red-faced Principal Himbry as he reads someone the riot
act.

MR. HIMBRY
I'm sickened. Your whole havoc-inducing,
thieving, whoring generation disgusts me.

The CAMERA SWINGS AROUND to reveal two GHOST MASKED STUDENTS
standing at attention.  Mr. Himbry rips the mask off of one of the
student's heads.

                MR. HIMBRY
        Two students have been savagely murdered.
        And this is how we express our compassion
        and sensivity?

He rips the mask off the other student.

                MR. HIMBRY
        We throw on a mask and dance around
        campus just hoping someone else gets
        butchered before we get bored again.
        You're both expelled.

The GHOSTS doth protest...

                GHOST #1
        Aw, come on, Mr. Himbry, it was just a
        joke.

                GHOST #2
        Yeah, that's not fair.

A deep rooted hostility has taken over Mr. Himbry's face.  Neither
student budges, scared to even breathe.

                MR. HIMBRY
        No, it's not fair. Fairness would be to
        rip your insides out and hang you from
        a tree so you can be exposed for the
        desensitized, heartless little shits that
        you are.

Suddenly the door BURSTS open and Sidney appears, hysterical.

                SIDNEY
            (crying)
        He's here...I saw him...he's here...

Mr. Himbry rushes to her, arms outstretched.

                MR. HIMBRY
        Easy child.

Sidney collapses in his arms.

EXT.  SCHOOL STREET - MINUTES LATER

Dewey's patrol jeep is parked in front of the school.  He stands
in the open driver's door talking on the radio.

                SHERIFF BURKE
            (from radio)
        She's okay. Looks like some boys were
        teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the
        school though. I want you to take look
        around.

                DEWEY
        Yes, sir, sheriff.

Dewey shuts the jeep door and heads for campus when Gale Weathers
appears, her fake face aglow.

                GALE
        Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent,
        INSIDE STORY.

                DEWEY
        I know who you are, ma'am. How's the
        eye?

                GALE
        Productive. So they're closing down the
        school?

                DEWEY
        Well..uh...yes ma'am. For the time being.

Dewey heads for the school building. Gale scurries along side him
flirtatiously.

                GALE
        And why is that? Has something happened?

                DEWEY
        You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.

                GALE
        I know, I should be in New York covering
        the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew?
        Please, call me Gale. You look awfully
        young to be a police officer.

Dewey's eyes wander down to Gale's long legs, the way her hips
move as she walks...he's clearly distracted.

                DEWEY
        I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.

                GALE
        Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study
        I proved to be most popular amongst
        males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course,
        you don't look a day over twelve, except
        in the upper torso area. Does the force
        require that you work out?

Dewey looks away, blushing a bit.

                DEWEY
        No, ma'am. Because of my boyish good
        looks, muscle mass has increased my
        acceptance as a serious police officer.

They approach the school's front entrance.  Suddenly, Mr. Himbry's
VOICE in amplified through intercoms across campus via the PA
system.  They stop to listen.

                MR. HIMBRY
            (via PA)
        "Your attention please. Due to the
        recent events that have occurred and
        until it comes to a resolve--effective
        immediately--all classes are suspended
        til further notice. The Bayboro Police
        Dept. has also asked me to announce a
        city wide curfew beginning at 6 o'clock
        PM. I repeat..."

Gale speaks over Mr. Himbry's voice.

                GALE
        Boy, you people sure do make fuss over
        a serial killer.

                DEWEY
        Serial killer is not really accurate,
        ma'am. The killer has yet to strike
        twice.

                GALE
        Well, we can hope, can't we? We
        certainly don't have any leads. A ghost
        mask, a cellular phone--not much there.

                DEWEY
        We're tracking the cellular phone bill.

                GALE
        Really? You small town guys are good.
        And have you located Sidney's father?

                DEWEY
        No, not yet.

                GALE
        He's not a suspect, is he?

                DEWEY
        We haven't ruled out that possibil...

Dewey, realizing he's said too much, clams up.

                DEWEY
        If you'll excuse me, ma'am.

                GALE
        Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.

                DEWEY
        That's quite alright. If I may say so,
        ma'am, you're much prettier in person.

Dewey starts up the school's front steps as the bell RINGS.

                GALE
        So you do watch the show?

He turns to her earnestly as STUDENTS come pouring out the front
doors.

                DEWEY
        I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole
        year.

                GALE
        You are precious. Please, call me Gale.

She smiles deliciously, gives him a wink, then struts off as
Dewey, like a nervous little school boy watches her go.

INT.  SCHOOL CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER

School is clearing out.  The halls have begun to empty as Tatum
escorts Sidney down the hallway.

                TATUM
        It was just some sick fuck having a
        laugh.

                SIDNEY
        It was him, Tatum. I know it.

Tatum wants to believe her but...

                TATUM
        You are not to be alone again. Is that
        clear? If you pee--I pee.

Stu appears.

                STU
        Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid,
        what happened?

                TATUM
        For once, Stu, drop it.

                STU
        Okay, but whatever you did--the entire
        student body thanks you.

Stu moves to Tatum and gives her a kiss.

                STU
        And to celebrate this impromptu fall
        break, I propose we have a party.
        Tonight, my house.

                SIDNEY
        Are you serious?

                STU
        My parents are out of town. It'll be
        like my hurricane bash last year.
        Nothing extreme. Just a few of us,
        hangin'.

Tatum warms to the idea.

                TATUM
        This could be good. What do you think,
        Sid?

                SIDNEY
        I don't know...

                TATUM
        Come on. Pathos has it's perks.

Sidney considers trying hard to be good spirited.

                STU
        Remember, there's safety in numbers.

                SIDNEY
            (giving in)
        Yeah, okay...whatever.

                STU
        Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.

Stu speeds off, sliding down the empty hallway.

INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - LATER

Mr. Himbry sits at his desk staring at the ghosts masks before
him.  He picks one of them up, snickering.

                MR. HIMBRY
        Damn...

He stands and moves to the closet next to his office door.  He
pulls it open to reveal a mirror hooked inside the door.  He tries
the mask on, pulling it over his face, looking in the mirror
when...

A KNOCK AT THE DOOR stops him.  He rips the mask off his head,
turns to his office door and opens it to reveal...

AN EMPTY DOORWAY.  He pokes his head into the outer office area
and looks around.  But no one's there.

                MR. HIMBRY
        Yes? Hello?

The place is empty.  A little suspicious he closes the door,
catching his reflection in the closet mirror.  He looks at the
mask in his hands.  Jesus, even he's jumpy.  Two seconds later...

ANOTHER KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  Himbry grabs the door quickly, this
time throwing it open.  Again no one's there.  He steps out into
the outer office determined to catch a prankster.

INT.  OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Completely empty.  Mr. Himbry moves through the outer office and
into the school corridor.  The overhead lights have been turned
off and the corridor is now dark and deserted.  He looks up and
down the hall.  Only a JANITOR is seen in the distance pushing a
broom.

                MR. HIMBRY
        Little shits.

Mr. Himbry returns to his office.

INT.  OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Himbry reenters his office, moving to his desk, when he spots the
closet door NOW CLOSED SHUT.

This gives him a pause-he had left it open.  Hadn't he?  Suddenly,
he can't remember.  He shifts uneasy, reaching for the door knob,
pulling the door open to reveal...

AN EMPTY CLOSET.  He stands still a moment, suddenly realizing
someone could easily now be standing behind the open closet door.
Nervously, he pushes it shut to reveal...

NOTHING.  Himbry shakes away his jitters, realizing he's spooked
himself.  He continues to his desk, pushing his office door shut
when...

A GHOST MASKED FIGURE lunges from behind it...knife in hand.
Quick and easy.  Three quick jabs to the stomach and Himbry goes
down.  The GHOST MASKED FIGURE towering above him.

EXT.  TATUM'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON - LATER

The late afternoon sun is quickly disappearing.

Tatum and Sidney rock on the front porch looking out into the
small town neighborhood.  Dewey's patrol jeep is parked in the
driveway.

Despite loud music, BLARING from an inside stereo, this is a quiet
moment.

                TATUM
        Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth.
        Maybe he was having an affair with your
        mom.

                SIDNEY
        So you think my mom was a slut too?

                TATUM
        I didn't say that, Sid. But you know
        there were rumors. Your dad was
        always out of town on business.
        Maybe your mom was a very unhappy
        woman.

                SIDNEY
        If they were having an affair how come
        that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?

                TATUM
        You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's
        a rumor.

                SIDNEY
        Created by that little tabloid twit Gale
        Weathers.

                TATUM
            (delicately)
        It goes further back, Sid. There's been
        talk about other men.

                SIDNEY
        And you believe it?

                TATUM
        Well...you can only hear that Richard
        Gere-gerbil story so many times before
you have to start believing it.

A long silence as Sidney agonizes over all of this.  She stands up
and moves to the edge of the porch and stares out onto the
neighborhood.

                SIDNEY
        If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still
        out there.

                TATUM
        Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to
        sound like some Wes Carpenter flick.
        Don't freak yourself out--we've got a
        long night ahead of us.

                SIDNEY
        You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore
        me.

                TATUM
        Come on, let's rock.

Sid follows Tatum inside the house never seeing the GHOST MASKED
FIGURE that stands across the street, under a tree.  His presence
so subtle and unobtrusive you'd have to see this movie a second
time to know he was there all along.

EXT.  MAIN STREET - LATER

Stu is moving along main street when Billy comes barreling up next
to him.

                BILLY
        How'd you do?

                STU
        Piece of cake. She'll be there.

                BILLY
        Thanks, butt wart. You did good.

                STU
        So you gonna try and make up with Sid?

                BILLY
        Duh...that's quick.

                STU
        I was just asking. Why are you always at
        me?

                BILLY
        Because I'm trying to build your self-
        esteem. You're far too sensitive.

                STU
        Oh....

Billy thumbs Stu's forehead.

                BILLY
        You ready to party hard tonight?

                STU
        You know it.

They come to a building centrally located in the heart of Main
Street.  A huge, blue monstrosity that's bigger than the local
bank and post office combined. The sign in front reads
BLOCKBUSTER.

INT.  BLOCKBUSTER - CONTINUOUS

You typical Blockbuster--huge and crowded.  Randy, in his
Blockbuster get up, is busy reshelving returns when Stu appears--
knocking the videos out of his hand.

                STU
        Jesus, this place is packed.

                RANDY
            (picking up videos)
        We had a run in the mass murder section.

                STU
        You coming tonight?

                RANDY
        Yeah, I'm off early--curfew you know.
            (looking off)
        Now that's poor taste.

                STU
        What?

Randy refers to Billy who stands down the aisle talking to TWO
GIRLS.  (The twits from the bathroom perhaps.)

                RANDY
        If you were the only suspect in a
        senseless bloodbath would you be standing
        in the horror section?

                STU
        It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't
        do anything.

                RANDY
        You're such a little lap dog. He's got
        killer printed all over his forehead.

                STU
        The why'd the police let him go?

                RANDY
        Because, obviously they don't watch
        enough movies. This is standard horror
        movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.

Randy moves down the aisle, reshelving videos.

                STU
        Why would he want to kill his own
        girlfriend?

                RANDY
        There's always some stupid bullshit
        reason to kill your girlfriend. That's
        the beauty of it all. Simplicity.
        Besides, if it's too complicated you lose
        your target audience.

                STU
        So what's his reason?

                RANDY
        Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.

                STU
        She's saving herself for you.

                RANDY
        Could be. Now that Billy's tried to
        mutilate her, you think Sid would go out
        with me?

                STU
        I think her father did it. How come they
        can't find his ass?

                RANDY
        Because he's probably dead. His body
        will come popping out in the last reel
        somewhere...eyes gauged. See, the police
        are always off track with this shit, if they'd
        watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time.
        There's formula to it. A very simple one.
        Everyone's always a suspect--the father,
        the principal, the town derelict...

                STU
        Which is you...

                RANDY
        So while they're off investigating a dead
        end, Billy, who's been written off as a
        suspect, is busy planning his next
        hunting expedition.

                BILLY
            (o.c.)
        How do we know you're not the killer?

Randy spins around to find Billy right behind him.  Busted.

                RANDY
        Uh...hi, Billy.

                BILLY
        Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost it's
        reality button?

Randy shrugs, laughing it off.

                RANDY
        You're absolutely right. I'm the first
        to admit it. If this were a scary movie,
        I'd be the prime suspect.

                STU
        And what would be your motive?

                RANDY
        It's 1995--motives are incidental.

EXT.  MAIN STREET - LITTLE LATER

Dewey's patrol jeep makes it's way down mainstreet.  It's almost
dark.  The street is close to deserted.

INT.  PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS

Dewey's behind the wheel having a heated conversation with Tatum
while Sid stares out the window.

                DEWEY
        A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.

                TATUM
        Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a
        little blow out--we'll be perfectly safe.

Sid stares out the window. CLOSED SIGNS fill the storefronts, a
few people rush to their car, in a hurry to beat curfew.

                SIDNEY
        God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN
        THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.

                DEWEY
        Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout
        some killer in Texas.

                TATUM
        Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a
        movie about you. Who's gonna play you?

                SIDNEY
        Oh, god...

Dewey comes to a stop, parking the car in front of the police
station. He looks to Sid with a brotherly smile.

                DEWEY
        I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.

                SIDNEY
        Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd
        cast Tori Spelling.

EXT.  PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS

They pile out of the jeep.  Dewey heads for the station.

                DEWEY
        I'll just be a few minutes. Don't go
        far.

The girls take off for the local supermarket that sits across the
street.

                SIDNEY
        Is Billy going to be there tonight?

                TATUM
        He better not be. I told Stu to keep his
        mouth shut. I think we can live without
        EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for
        one night.

They approach the grocery store.  Small and simple.  Sid and Tatum
grab a shopping cart from the bin and enter the store, pushing the
cart through two sliding glass doors.

A lone CHECKOUT LADY behind the counter, big and frumpy, looks up
from counting money.

                CHECK OUT LADY
        You girls gonna have to hurry it up.
        We're under curfew.

                TATUM
        Two minutes tops.

They make a bee-line for the junk food section just as the
automated doors slide shut behind them and a...

GHOST MASKED FIGURE appears, out of nowhere, standing just
outside, watching, quietly through the glass store windows.

EXT.  POLICE STATION - SHERIFF'S OFFICE

Sheriff Burke's face heats up as Deputy Riley marches in,
hurriedly.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?

                DEWEY
        Keeping my eye on Sidney.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real
        bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls
        were listed to Neil Prescott--Sidney's
        father. He made the calls with his cellular
        phone. It's confirmed.

                DEWEY
        Couldn't his cellular number have been
        cloned?

                SHERIFF BURKE
        There's more. Guess what tomorrow is?
        The anniversary of his wife's death. It all
        fits. He's our man.

                DEWEY
        Have you contacted the bureau?

                SHERIFF BURKE
        They believe he's out of state by now.
        We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in
        effect through the night. If he's not
        picked up by morning--we'll do a house
        to house.

                DEWEY
        You think he could still be in town?

                SHERIFF BURKE
        He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?

                DEWEY
        She's with my sister. Should I bring her
        in?

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Hold off for now. Just stay close to
        her.

                DEWEY
        She'll be with her friends over at Stu
        Maker's tonight.

                SHERIFF BURKE
        Watch her. Don't let on--just keep your
        eyes out.

                DEWEY
        Yes, sir.

INT.  SUPERMARKET - FEW MINUTES LATER

Sidney and Tatum push a basket through the junk food section.  The
store is completely empty.  The girls gab freely.

                SIDNEY
        Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I
        just can't relax.

                TATUM
        You have a few intimacy issues as a
        result of your mother's untimely death.
        It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.

                SIDNEY
        But he's been so patient with me, Tatum.
        You know, with all the sex stuff. How
        many guys would put up with a girlfriend
        who's sexually anorexic?

                TATUM
        Billy and his penis don't deserve you.

Sidney grabs some chips and salsa from the shelf.  Down the aisle,
through the storefront window the GHOST MASKED FIGURE still stands
watching their every move.

EXT.  SUPERMARKET

Sid pushes the cart out of the glass door with Tatum riding it.
The GHOST MASKED FIGURE is nowhere to be found.

                SIDNEY
        What do you think about when you're
        having sex?

                TATUM
        With Stu, there's little time to stop and
        reflect. But sometimes before, to relax
        and get in the mood, I think about Grant
        Goodeve.

Sid pushes the cart and Tatum across the street.

                SIDNEY
        Who?

                TATUM
        Grant Goodeve--the oldest brother on
        EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He
        was the one who lived off alone. He would come
        around every now and then with his guitar and
        sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..."
        He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot
        brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I
        was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show
        came on every day after school right during my
        puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental
        in my maturing as a woman.

                SIDNEY
        How does that get you in the mood with
        Stu?

                TATUM
        During foreplay, I sing the theme song to
        myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives
        with love..." It's a real turn on.

                SIDNEY
        No way.

                TATUM
        Grant wrote the song himself. I'm
        convinced the lyrics had a secret
        meaning, "Eight is enough..."

Sid pushes the cart up to Dewey's jeep.  Tatum hops off.

                SIDNEY
        What secret meaning? Like a Satanical
        thing?

                TATUM
        Watch the show, Sid. His basket is
        bigger than the one you're pushing.

                SIDNEY
        TATUM!

                TATUM
        Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits
        til he's dead but the minute you mention
        an eight inch weenie. Watch out.

Sidney stops just short of a laugh.  Tatum pulls the back jeep
door, loading the groceries in.  Behind her, the GHOST MASKED
FIGURE appears, just out of their sight, behind the jeep's open
back door.

                TATUM
        There's that sense of humor. I knew it
        still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some
        fun tonight.

                SIDNEY
        Deal.

Sidney moves to the back door and closes it shut, when from
behind...

DEWEY stands.  Sid jumps, startled.

                DEWEY
        You girls ready.

                SIDNEY
        Yeah.

                DEWEY
        Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard
        tonight, Sid.

                TATUM
        No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.

                DEWEY
        Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the
        way, I promise.

                TATUM
        Shit.

Tatum kicks the shopping cart out of the way, blindly.  It rolls
down the road by itself, gaining speed on a decline running smack
into the GHOST MASKED FIGURE who stops the cart cold with one
hand.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

Dewey's jeep makes it's way down a long, winding road.  Headlights
illuminate the thick woods that line each side.  Following behind
them at a discreet distance is a huge white newsvan.

Dewey comes to the end of the road.  It dead ends at...

STU'S HOUSE which sits alone in a clearing, big and ominous with
no neighbors in sight.  A huge old home just ripe for a night of
fun and...terror.

From the looks of things the party has already started.  Music is
BLARING. A few KIDS hang on the porch.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

A big room with KIDS sprinkled throughout-smoking, drinking,
cutting up.  A stereo BLASTS music while the TV airs around the
clock killer coverage.

Tatum and Sid enter with groceries.  Various FRIENDS greet them.

                TATUM
        Caterer's here.

The girls carry bags through a hallway that opens up onto an
enormous kitchen.  Stu and some GUYS are leaning over the sink
drinking beer through a funnel.

                TATUM
        That's mature.

                STU
        Where you guys been? We had to start
        without you.

EXT.  STU'S HOUSE - ROAD

The newsvan pulls up and parks unobtrusively on the side of the
road a few feet down from the front yard.

INT.  NEWSVAN

Kenny and Gale move around inside the van.  Kenny hovers over a
control panel complete with video monitors.

                KENNY
        What's the plan?

                GALE
        Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a
        window and tape all of tonight's
        festivities.

Kenny picks up a compact video camera the size of his fist.  He
checks its battery pack.

                KENNY
        The control board's glitched. You know
        we can't carry a live picture.

                GALE
        What's the delay?

                KENNY
        About thirty seconds.

                GALE
        As long as it records I don't give a
        shit. We're not doing a remote.

Gale slides open the side door and steps out into the darkness,
not seeing the FIGURE that stands behind her.  A hand grabs her
shoulder, Gale's heart stops as she spins around to find...

Dewey, smiling, extremely pleased to see her.

                DEWEY
        Evening, ma'am.

                GALE
        Deputy...good evening.

                DEWEY
        What brings you out to these parts?

                GALE
        You never know when or where a story will
        break.

                DEWEY
        Not much story here. Just a bunch of
        kids cutting loose.

                GALE
        Then what are you doing here?

                DEWEY
        Keeping an eye on things. Checking the
        place out.

                GALE
        Mind if I join you?

Dewey considers for a whole two seconds.

                DEWEY
        Not at all.

Gale leans in the van, grabs the camera from  Kenny's hand, and
throws it in her bag.  She gives Kenny a wink.

INT.  KITCHEN

CLOSE ON a microwave.  Popcorn POPS inside.  CAMERA WIDENS TO
REVEAL...

Sid, Stu, and Tatum moving about the kitchen, preparing a junk
food feast.  Other TEENS pop in and out. Randy appears amongst
them.  He carries an armful of videos.

                RANDY
        I thought we'd make it a BLOCKBUSTER
        night.

He lets the videos splatter across the kitchen counter.  Stu and
Tatum dive in.

                STU
        I thought everything was checked out.

                RANDY
        I had 'em hid in the foreign section.

Sidney peruses the videos.

                SIDNEY
        THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT
        --How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these
        movies?

                RANDY
        She's the Scream Queen.

                STU
        With that set of lungs--she should be.

                TATUM
            (to Sid)
        Tits--see.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - FEW MINUTES LATER

The party is going strong.  Ten maybe fifteen people stand, sit,
lean.  Some crowd around the floor in front of the television.
Randy is taking a vote.

                RANDY
        How many EVIL DEAD'S?
            (hands go up)
        How many HELLRAISER'S?

Hands go up.  BICKERING AD-LIB, etc.

The doorbell RINGS.  Stu goes for it.

                STU
        I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're
        in the fridge in the garage.

                TATUM
        What am I? The beer wench?

                STU
            (o.c.)
        Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick
        from INSIDE STORY?

They look up the hallway to see Dewey and Gale standing in the
foyer.

                TATUM
        Shit, Dewey!

Everyone perks up, eyeing Gale.

                TATUM
        What is she doing here?

                DEWEY
        She's with me. I just wanted to check on
        things.

The GUYS in the room are drooling over Gale.  Including Stu.

                TATUM
        So you did--now leave...and take your
        media muff with you.

Tatum takes off for the kitchen.

Gale has quickly become the focus of the party.  All eyes are on
her.

                SOME TEEN
        I watch your show regularly.

                STU
        This must be big news to be on INSIDE
        STORY.

                GALE
        Huge.

                ANOTHER TEEN
        Wanna interview us?

                RANDY
        We could be like two grief stricken
        students and we'll say really nice things
        about our good friends who were
        slaughtered senselessly.

                STU
        I can cry on cue.

Gale eyes the bookshelf above the television.

                GALE
        Maybe later?

Suddenly, Gale starts to COUGH.

                GALE
        Can I trouble you for some water?

                STU
        How 'bout a beer? Randy--get the lady a
        beer.

                RANDY
        You get it.

Gale slips the camera from her bag--hits the ON switch and holds
it behind her...waiting for the right moment.

BACK IN FOYER

                SIDNEY
        Have they found my father?

                DEWEY
        Afraid not.

                SIDNEY
        Should I be worried?

                DEWEY
        Not yet.

INT.  KITCHEN

Tatum is alone in the kitchen.  She empties popcorn into a bowl,
then pulls open the refrigerator...looks quickly, then
remembers...

She moves through the adjoining laundry room to the...

INT.  GARAGE

The kitchen door opens and light floods the darkened garage.
Tatum stands in the doorway searching for a light switch.

She finds a button and hits it.  BRRRRMMM!  The electric garage
door starts to rise.  Wrong switch.  She hits it again and it
closes.

She finds another switch.  CLICK.  A small lightbulb overhead
comes on, barely lighting the large two car garage, leaving
pockets of shadows along the wall.

Tatum spots the refrigerator against a far wall and heads for it,
not seeing the kitchen door, quietly, slowly, closing behind her,
sealing her off from the rest of the house.

Tatum stumbles to the refrigerator and throws it open.  Its light
casts a glow across her face.

CRASH-BOOM!

Tatum jumps, spinning around just in time to see a cat escape
through a large pet door that's built into the garage door.  She
smiles at her jumpiness.

Tatum loads up with as many beer as her hands will carry and heads
back to the kitchen.

At the kitchen door, she juggles the beer, reaching for the knob.
It's locked.

                TATUM
        SHIT!

She KICKS it with her foot several times.

                TATUM
        Hey, Shitheads!

A moment.  No answer.

                TATUM
        OH, SHIT PISS!

Tatum leans over and, with her elbow, hits the garage door button.
BRRRMM!  It begins to rise.

She moves towards the rising door, beer in hand.  Suddenly, CRR-
BRRRM!  The garage door RESETS, reversing direction, moving down,
closing.

                TATUM
        What the...

Tatum spins around to see..

A GHOST MASKED FIGURE

Silhouetted in the dark, next to the kitchen door, his hand on the
switch.  Tatum at once GASPS, taken back, but then relaxes.

                TATUM
        Is that you, Randy? Cute.

The FIGURE stares at her, blankly.

                TATUM
        And what movie is this from? I SPIT ON
        YOUR GARAGE.

Tatum takes a step towards the FIGURE.

                TATUM
        Lose the mask. If Sidney sees it, she'll
        flip.

The FIGURE shakes his head slowly from side to side.

                TATUM
        Oh, you wanna play psycho killer?

The FIGURE slowly nods.

                TATUM
        Can I be the helpless victim?

The FIGURE slowly nods again.

                TATUM
        Okay, let's see. "No, please don't kill
        me, Mr. Ghostface. I want to be in the
        sequel."

Tatum takes a step to move around the FIGURE, but he steps too,
blocking her.

                TATUM
        Cut, Casper. That's a wrap.

Tatum moves again, sidestepping the FIGURE, but he's faster and
cuts her off.

Tatum juggles the beer against her chest with one hand and with
the other pushes the FIGURE hard, knocking him aside.

                TATUM
        Randy--will you stop?

But as the FIGURE intercepts, lunging forward, grabbing her wrist
hard, Tatum stumbles...beer cans hit the floor, spewing...

                TATUM
        You little shit.

Tatum yanks hard, releasing his hold when a flash of silver
catches her eye.  She looks down, glimpsing a long sharp blade as
it darts forward, cutting into her forearm...

Tatum pulls back, horrified, as the moment turns deadly serious.

The FIGURE advances on her--knife out, ready.  She staggers
backwards, holding her bloody arm, backing into the refrigerator,
SCREAMING.

                TATUM
        Who are you?

The FIGURE lashes out with the knife.  Tatum dodges it, leaping
back against the fridge.  The FIGURE advances.  Instinctively, she
rips the top freezer door open, BASHING the FIGURE in the face,
sending him backwards, reeling.

Tatum bolts to the...CLOSED GARAGE DOOR.  In a panic, she BEATS
and PULLS
on it, trying to make it lift.  She eyes the FIGURE...he's
recovering...

She goes for the pet door, dropping to the floor, diving for
it...she wedges her upper body through, her head, shoulders, torso
just as the...

FIGURE pounces, grabbing hold of her feet.  Tatum goes crazy
SCREAMING and KICKING trying to get through.

EXT.  GARAGE DOOR

Tatum is half in/half out of the pet door.  She BEATS and JERKS
wildly, unable to see the FIGURE on the other side...

A true fighter, Tatum kicks hard, making direct contact with the
FIGURE, knocking him away.

She takes the moment to pull herself through further...but she
stops...stuck.  She pulls and tugs but can't move.  She listens
but hears nothing.  Where did he go?  An agonizing silence.  And
then...

CRR-BRRRM!  The garage door is activated.  It begins to rise
upward, taking
Tatum with it.  She SCREAMS MADLY.

                TATUM
        NOOOOOOOO.....

Tatum's arms and legs fly about violently as she tries to free
herself from the door, but it moves too fast, carrying her up...

She looks above to see where the door rolls back into garage
rafters just as her neck hits the first beam, SNAPPING instantly.

INT.  FOYER - MINUTES LATER

It's getting late and SOME KIDS leave through the front door,
muttering, "parents and curfew", etc.  The door hangs open wide.
Sid moves to close it when....

BILLY appears in a classic fake scare.

                SIDNEY
        Billy? Jesus, you scared me.

Stu appears.

                STU
            (with a wink)
        Dude. What are you doing here?

                BILLY
        I was hoping Sid and I could talk.

                SIDNEY
        If Tatum sees you--she'll draw blood.

                STU
        You guys can go up to my parents room?
        To talk and...whatever.

                BILLY
        Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.

                SIDNEY
        It's okay. We need to talk.

Sid grabs his hand and leads him up the staircase.  Randy appears
from the kitchen just in time to see Sid and Billy disappear
upstairs.

                RANDY
        What's Leatherface doing here?

                STU
        He came to make up.

                RANDY
        There goes my chance with Sid.

                STU
        Like you had one.

INT.  NEWSVAN

Kenny fidgets at the control board.  He hits a coupla buttons,
bangs the side of the monitor and a picture emerges...the living
room.  The camera is positioned just above the television...

ON SCREEN

The party is in full swing.  Several TEENS sit right in front of
the television.  Because of the camera's position they appear to
be staring right into the lens.

Suddenly, the van's side door slides open and Gale pops in.

                KENNY
        Got a picture. Perfect placement. We
        can see everything.

Gale is ecstatic.

                GALE
        Tell me, Kenny, has a cheesy tabloid
        journalist ever won the Pulitzer?

INT.  BEDROOM

A large, master bedroom with glass doors that lead out onto a
balcony.

Sid and Billy stare at each other for a long moment.  Awkward.

                SIDNEY
        So...

                BILLY
        So...I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit
        and I'm sorry.

                SIDNEY
        No, Billy. I'm the one who's been
        selfish and self-absorbed with all of my
        post traumatic stress.

                BILLY
        You lost your mom...

                SIDNEY
        But you're right--enough is enough. I
        can't wallow in the grief process forever
        and I can't keep lying to myself about
        who my mom was.

Billy bows his head quietly, knowingly.

                SIDNEY
        I think in some weird analytical,
        psychological bullshit way I'm scared
        I'm gonna turn out just like her, you
        know? Like the bad seed or something...

                BILLY
        Oh Sidney...

                SIDNEY
        Everytime I get close to you I see my
        mom. I know it doesn't make sense.

                BILLY
        Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in
        SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she
        kept having flashbacks of her dead father.

                SIDNEY
        But this is life. This isn't a movie.

                BILLY
        Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's
        one great big movie. Only you can't
        pick your genre.

Billy moves to her.  They embrace, tenderly.

                SIDNEY
        I wanna let go. I do...

                BILLY
        Ssshh...everything's gonna be okay. I
        promise.

Sidney takes the initiative, acting on impulse, kissing him long
and hard.  She breaks away passionately, out of breath.

                SIDNEY
        Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?

Billy nibbles her neck.

                BILLY
        Sshh..it's okay.

                SIDNEY
        Or even a good porno.

                BILLY
            (shocked)
        What?

She stares at him, her eyes sexually charged.

                SIDNEY
        You heard me.

                BILLY
            (incredulous)
        Are you serious?

                SIDNEY
            (surprising herself)
        Yeah...I think so.

They smile at each other.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

The camera sits on the book shelf lodged between two knickknacks,
completely inconspicuous. The CAMERA WIDENS to reveal several
TEENS watching the TV--the horror diehards.

                TEEN #1
        Look, here it comes. SPLAT!

                TEEN #2
        The blood's not the right color. Why do
        they do that? It's too red.

                RANDY
        Here comes another...

                TEEN #3
        Predictable. Knew he was going to bite
        it.

                BORED TEEN
        How can you watch this shit over and
        over?

                RANDY
        Shhhhh.

                STU
        I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do
        we see Jamie Lee's breasts?

                RANDY
        Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie
        Lee was always the virgin in horror movies.
        She didn't show her tits until she went legit.

                BOY TEEN
        No way.

                RANDY
        That's why she always lived. Only
        virgins can outsmart the killer in the
        big chase scene in the end. Don't you
        know the rules?

Stu finishes his beer.

                STU
        What rules?

Randy hits the pause button on the remote and stands in front of
the television, explaining.

                RANDY
        There are certain rules that one must
        abide by in order to successfully survive
        a horror movie. For instance: 1. You
        can never have sex. The minute you get a
        little nookie--you're as good as gone.
        Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink
        or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an
        extension of number one. And 3. Never,
        ever, ever, under any circumstances, say
        "I'll be right back."

                STU
        Wanna another beer?

                RANDY
        Yeah.

                STU
        I'll be right back.

Everybody "ooohhs".

                RANDY
        There he goes folks--a dead man. Wave
        bye-bye.

INT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS

Gale and Kenny watch the monitor.  The party is clearing out some

A RAP at the van door.  Gale pulls it open to see Deputy Riley
standing, his face all smiles.

                DEWEY
        Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check
        out a possible lead. Thought you might
        like to join me.

                GALE
        What kind of lead?

                DEWEY
        A car was spotted in the bushes a little
        ways up the road.

                GALE
        I'd love to. If you're sure it's
        alright?

                DEWEY
        Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.

                GALE
        Can I bring Kenny?

                DEWEY
            (too quickly)
        NO! I mean...I should probably take just
        you.

Gale steps out of the van turning back to Kenny.

                GALE
        I'll be back.

She slides the van door closed.

EXT.  ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Gale heads for Dewey's patrol jeep.

                DEWEY
        Actually, I thought we could walk. It's
        not far.

Gale appears skeptical, but smiles anyway.  She's genuinely
smitten by this young guy.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

SCARY MUSIC fills the room.  The party is reduced to the diehards
in front of the television.

                RANDY
            (pointing to TV)
        Look, here comes the obligatory tit shot.

                OTHER GUYS
        Beautiful! Finally!

INT.  BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Billy and Sidney are going at it...passionately.  He has his head
buried in her neck.

                SIDNEY
            (to herself)
        "Eight is enough to fill our lives with
        love..."

It's working.  Sidney pushes Billy off her as she pulls her shirt
over her head.  She fumbles with the clasp of her bra as the...

CAMERA RUSHES IN on her breasts.  Just as Sid's bra straps slide
of her shoulders...

Billy moves in front of the CAMERA, pulling his jeans off,
Blocking Sidney from view.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

Back in the living room, the horror fest continues when the phone
RINGS.  Everyone ignores it.  It RINGS again.

Finally, Randy grabs the receiver from the side table.

                RANDY
        Hello? Yeah....HOLY SHIT.

Randy, freaked, drops the phone, finds the TV remote and pauses
the movie, the others protest
"Hey, Put is back..." etc.

                RANDY
        Listen up. They found Principal Himbry
        dead. He was gutted and hung from the
        goal post on the football field.

This stills the room.  Complete silence as the news sinks in.  ON
different faces...a moment of devastation..disbelief.  And then:

                TEEN #1
        So what are we waiting for?

                TEEN #2
        Let's get over there before they pry him
        down.

And in seconds the room is empty as everyone bolts for the
door..HOOTIN' and HOLLERIN' ...leaving Randy, near drunk, alone in
the living room.  He returns to the movie.

                RANDY
        We were just getting to the good part.

INT.  NEWSVAN - MINUTES LATER

Kenny is barely watching the monitor, he reached boredom some time
ago.  He finds a bag of Cheetos and chows down when he hears
SCREAMING from outside.  He peers out the window to see the last
of the PARTY KIDS pile into two cars and race off down the road.

He chews a Cheeto slowly, his interest piqued.

INT.  BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

The sex is over...and both Sid and Billy are dressing
respectively.  That post-sex awkwardness.

Sid brushes out her hair as her eyes come to rest on the telephone
on the nightstand...it puzzles her as a stark reveleation crosses
her face.  She turns to Billy who sits on the floor, putting on
his shoes.

                SIDNEY
        Who did you call?

                BILLY
        What?

                SIDNEY
        When you're arrested-you're allowed one
        phone call? Who did you call?

                BILLY
        I called my dad.

                SIDNEY
        No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw
        him.

                BILLY
        Yeah...and when I called no one answered.

                SIDNEY
        Uh-huh.

                BILLY
        You don't still think it was me?

                SIDNEY
        No, but if it were you, that would have
        been a very clever way to throw me off
        track. Using your one phone call to call
        me so I wouldn't think it was you.

Billy stands up.

                BILLY
        What do I have to do to prove to you I'm
        not a killer?

He makes a move toward her when..from behind, in a split instant,
from the open balcony doors comes...

THE GHOST FIGURE

Sidney sees the FIGURE immedietely, SCREAMING.  Billy tries to
calm her, oblivious to the advancing GHOST.

                SIDNEY
        BILLYWATCHOUT!!!!

Billy barely turns as a long steely blade rises high in the air.
It strikes down with force...hitting his chest as blood sprays the
air.

ON SIDNEY as red crimson splatters across her face...as the knife
is thrust in and out of Billy who tries hard to put up a
fight..but it's useless...he never had a chance.  His body falls
to the floor..lifeless.

ANGLE ON GHOST

as he watches Billy's body come to a still before quietly, calmly
turning his attention to...

SIDNEY who stands, numb...scared to death.  And only when the
GHOST takes a step forward does Sidney break.  She takes off like
a rocket...leaping over the bed and out the door.

INT.  HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Sidney tears out the door and down the hall, coated in Billy's
blood.

ANGLE ON THE GHOST

as he catches up with her, grabbing hold of her collar.  She pulls
away from him...her shirt ripping down the back.

Her hands find a door knob and she goes for it, pulling the door
open...moving quickly inside...locking it behind her.

INT.  DARK SPACE - CONTINUOUS

Total darkness.  Sidney's hands scour the wall for a light switch.
The doorknob turns...the lock holds..as the door is nearly SHAKEN
from it's hinges...and then...

NOTHING.  All goes silent.  Only Sidney's rapid BREATHING fills
the space around her.

Sidney, trembling, shaking, reaches above her, feeling, until she
finds a string.  She pulls it...as a lightbulb SWITCHES on
overhead.

She's in a small box of a room.  The door is on one side, a small,
narrow staircase on the other.  She eyes the doorknob, then the
staircase...contemplating...but it's an easy decision.  There's no
fucking way she's going up to the attic.

She unlocks the door and pushes on it.  But it won't give...she
pushes on it again.  It's locked from the other side.  Shit.  She
turns to the staircase.

EXT.  DARK ROAD - CONTINUOUS

A long, deserted country road.  In the distance, a single
flashlight beams ahead, the only light in the black night.  Gale
and Dewey can be heard.

                GALE
        So is Dewey your real name?

                DEWEY
        Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck
        with a long time ago.

                GALE
        I like it. It's... sexy.

                DEWEY
        Nah... it's just this town's way of not
        taking me serious.

                GALE
        What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a
        meteorologist...

CLOSE ON Gale and Dewey, walking closely, side by side-
flirtatiously.  Gale is surprisingly nervous.

                GALE
        People treat me like the Antichrist of
        television journalism.

                DEWEY
        I don't think you're so bad.

Gale smiles.

                GALE
        Are all the local boys as sweet as you?

Dewey blushes.  He starts to say something when headlights appear
behind them.  They both spin as TWO CARS loaded with KIDS come
racing right at them.

Dewey grabs Gale and pushes her off the road... just as the cars
speed by, oblivious to them.

IN THE DITCH

Gale lands face up with Dewey right on top of her.  He steals a
glance in her eyes before rolling off her.

                DEWEY
        You okay?

Something takes Gale's attention.

                GALE
        What's that?

Dewey looks to where gale points.  He finds the flashlight and
aims it into the bush.  The tail end of a car is just visible.

                DEWEY
        Looks like a car.

Dewey helps her up and they move to it.  He shines the flashlight
on the plates but it's already obvious to the CAMERA.  This is the
same car we last saw Sidney's father driving away in.

                DEWEY
        Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.

                GALE
        Sidney's father?

                DEWEY
        We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here.
        What the fuck is he doing here?

Dewey is panicked.  He grabs Gale and they race off down the road.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Randy continues to watch TV.  He is now sloppy drunk, completely
involved in the movie on the screen.

SCARY MUSIC SWELLS, filling the room.

                RANDY
            (to TV)
        No, Jamie. Look behind you! Watch out!
        Behind you!

And if he followed his own advice, he would see the GHOST MASKED
FIGURE that stands directly behind him...knife poised.

INT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS

Kenny finishes off a soda and crushes the can in his hand.  He
tosses it to the floor when a movement from the monitor catches
his eye.

ON THE MONITOR is Randy, still on the couch, engrossed in the
movie.  Directly behind him...the GHOST.  Kenny does a double-
take.  No fucking way.  He watches as the GHOST stands still,
unmoving, knife raised.

                KENNY
        JESUS...FUCK...

The GHOST takes a silent step forward.

                KENNY
            (screaming at the monitor)
        BEHIND YOU! LOOK BEHIND YOU!

This kid needs help.  Kenny bolts out of his seat and goes for the
side door.  He slides it open and sticks his head out as...

A LONG, SHARP BLADE

comes at Kenny, fast and furious...slicing into his throat.  Kenny
falls forward...out the door as the GHOST MASKED FIGURE is upon
him.

THE CAMERA PANS TO THE MONITOR

just in time to see the GHOST MASKED FIGURE turn away from Randy,
leaving him unharmed, moving instead, out the front door, on a
thirty second walk to the newsvan.

INT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

The attic is long and narrow...cluttered with furniture, boxes,
and the likes...moonlight filters in through a small raised window
on the front wall of the house.

Sidney moves through the attic...BUMPING into this, KNOCKING over
that...she passes a dusty mirror, jumping at her own reflection.
She cringes at her image, drenched in Billy's blood.  She stares
long and hard...something about the blood, the redness of it.  She
moves on, determined.

She eyes the raised window above her...a way out...if she could
only reach it...

EXT.  FRONT YARD

Gale and Dewey come running up the drive, frantic.

                DEWEY
        I'll call for backup.

                GALE
        I'll get my camera.

They split up.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS GALE as she rushes to the
newsvan, throwing open the door.

                GALE
        Kenny! Camera! Quick!

The van is empty.

                GALE
        Kenny?

A CAR HORN goes off.  Gale spins around.  It came from the patrol
jeep in the driveway.

                GALE
            (calling out)
        Dewey?

She moves across the yard to the jeep, the door hangs open...Dewey
is nowhere to be found.

                GALE
        Dewey? Where are you?

A look of pure dread comes over Gale.

INT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Sidney has stacked object after object building a ladder to the
window.  She climbs to the top, holding onto the window frame.

She spots Gale almost immedietely.  She SCREAMS OUT, looking for
the window latch.  But there's not one.  It doesn't open.  Sidney
starts beating on it...trying to break it...

EXT.  FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

Gale, hanging tough, approaches the front door, unable to hear
Sidney's SCREAMS three floors up.  Gale reaches for the door just
as she hears LOUD, HORRIBLE SHRIEKS from just inside.  She backs
away.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

AN EAR-CURDLING JAMIE LEE CURTIS SCREAM BLASTS through the empty
living room as the horror movie on TV comes to it's horrifying
climax.

Randy is now gone.

EXT.  FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

Gale races across the yard putting distance between her and the
house.  She moves back to the van...

INT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

Sidney has found an old tennis racket.  She swings a solid
forehand at the window.

THE WINDOW SPRAYS GLASS

Sidney moves quickly, lifting herself up over broken glass and
pulling herself through the window frame.

EXT.  SIDE OF THE HOUSE

Sidney wastes no time.  She looks for Gale, SCREAMING, but Gale is
gone.

Sid lowers herself down the ledge, sliding down a sloped portion
of the roof onto...

THE MASTER'S BEDROOM BALCONY.

Then she eases herself over the railing and lowers herself,
letting herself hang as low as she can...then she lets go, free-
falling the rest of the way...but in a split instant...

THE GHOST APPEARS

grabbing her wrists in midair.

Her body hangs, dangling against the side of the house.  The GHOST
begins to lift her, pulling her back onto the balcony.

Sidney jerks, pulls, twists...but the HANDS have her, hoisting her
up...Sidney SCREAMS MADLY...yanking one last time, freeing
herself.

SHE DROPS TO THE GROUND, a good seven feet, landing on her back,
hitting hard.  She grabs at a pained leg and brings herself
upright.

INT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS

Gale is frantic.  She starts the engine up and hits the headlights
when she discovers she can't see out of the windshield.

Gale rubs at the glass.  Sure enough, something is on the
windshield outside, blocking her sight.  Gale hits the wipers as
BLOOD SMEARS across the glass, it drips down from above.

Gale SCREAMS as a HAND reaches in through the open window...she
looks up to see...

RANDY, staring at her madly.

                RANDY
        What's going on?

A sheer moment of fear as Gale hits the gas plummeting the car
forward, into a ditch.  She hits the BRAKES.  Randy is thrown
forward, away from the van.

Gale reverses, backs up, hits the brakes again...just as Kenny's
face comes sliding down the outside of the windshield...eyes wide,
face distorted, blood everywhere.

Gale hits the gas, and yanks the wheel, sending Kenny's corpse
flying off the top of the van.

Gale spins the van around, onto the road, hits the gas madly,
gaining speed just as...

SIDNEY APPEARS

in the middle of the road, drenched in blood, very much resembling
a young Sissy Spacek.

Gale swerves to miss her, but she turns too sharp and the van
veers off the road at top speed...flipping over on its side,
sliding off into the thick foliage.

EXT.  ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Sidney races to where the van lay on it's side.  Sidney peers
through the windshield...Gale's body lay limp and bloody.

SIDNEY CRIES OUT, turning, limping to the driveway.  She sees the
patrol jeep with it's open door...she goes for it.

INT.  JEEP

Sidney hops in, reaches for the ignition...NO KEYS!  Shit.  Just
then, Sidney's eyes go to the front porch.  She watches as the
front door opens and a FIGURE appears in the darkness,
undetectable.

Sidney throws the headlights...illuminating the front side of the
house, revealing...

DEWEY STANDING IN THE DOORWAY.

                SIDNEY
        DEWEY!

Sidney opens the jeep door, moving to him, noticing his body,
slumped, knees buckled...

And then his body falls forward, slowly, deliberately, hitting the
porch hard.  Standing behind him is...

THE GHOST

SIDNEY SCREAMS FROM THE BOTTOM OF HER SOUL.

                SIDNEY
        NOOOOOOOO!!!!!

Sid jumps back inside the jeep, closing the door, locking it.  She
reaches over and locks the passenger's door and then she...waits.

And watches as the GHOST leans over Dewey's still body, fumbling
with something.  Then the FIGURE stands upright, in his hands he
holds...

THE KEYS

They jingle in the wind, the GHOST toying with her, enjoying
this...

Sidney, hysterical, locks eyes with the FIGURE as he moves to the
door, Sidney leaps on it, holding the lock button down, making it
impossible to unlock.  Her face is pressed against the
glass...inches from the MASKED FIGURE.

She uses every ounce of strength when suddenly, the GHOST
DISAPPEARS, dropping down, below the window, out of her view.

Sidney moves to the center of the jeep, trying hard to listen over
her own RAPID BREATHING, every sound AMPLIFIED.

Then she hears it, the soft JINGLING of keys near the passengers
side door.  She pounces on the lock, holding it down.

A shadow cuts the beam of the headlights, unseen by Sidney.  The
lock turns on the other side.  Sidney leaps over and holds it
down, securing it.  This is beyond nerve-racking.  Sidney is
certifiable.

Her eyes spot the police radio for the first time.  She grabs the
mouthpiece and hits the switch.

                SIDNEY
        Help! Please! I'm at Stu Maker's house
        on Turner Lane. Please, HE'S GONNA
        KILL ME!

EXT.  FRONT OF JEEP

ANGLE through front windshield.  Sidney RANTING into the police
band.  She doesn't see the...

GHOST FIGURE open the tailgate door of the jeep and slowly crawl
in behind her.

The GHOST FIGURE reaches out and grabs hold of Sidney's neck.

Sidney, with surprising strength, spins around and attacks the
GHOST.

She falls back against the dash, legs out, kicking wildly at him.

Her hand reaches for the door, finds the lock, the door lever, she
pulls...

The door swings open...

Sidney falls out of the door, hitting the ground.

EXT.  FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

Sidney, on her stomach, squirms away from the jeep.  She brings
herself up to her hands and knees, looking behind her to see
nothing...

THE GHOST HAS DISAPPEARED.

Sidney's eyes roam the yard but he's nowhere.  Completely gone.
Vanished.  Sid crawls to the front porch where...

DEWEY'S BODY LAY

Thinking quickly, precisely, she reaches to Dewey's holster and
grabs his gun when a VOICE ECHO'S behind her...

                VOICE
            (o.c.)
        Sidney!

She turns to see Randy racing to her, limping.  He appears stone
cold sober.

                RANDY
        Jesus, Sid. We gotta get out of here.

Sidney throws the gun forward.

                SIDNEY
        Stop. Right there.

                RANDY
        Don't shoot. It's me.

                SIDNEY
        Don't come any closer.

                RANDY
        Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's
        dead, she's been killed...I think Stu did
        it.

He takes a step forward when another VOICE SPEAKS UP.

                VOICE
            (o.c.)
        Don't believe him, Sid.

Sidney spins around to see Stu moving up the walk.

                STU
        He's lying. He killed Tatum. And Billy.

Stu moves closer to Sidney.

                SIDNEY
        Stay away.

She aims the gun in his direction.

                STU
        His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid.
        He's gone psycho.

                RANDY
        Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the
        one.

Sidney has lost it, she doesn't know who to trust.  She aims the
gun at Stu..then Randy..then Stu...

                STU
        Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.

                RANDY
        No, Sid.

They both move toward her.  There's no time.  She must act now.
Finally...

                SIDNEY
        Fuck you both.

And with that, Sidney steps back into the house and SLAMS the
front door shut.

INT.  LIVING ROOM / FOYER

Sid locks and bolts the door.  From the other side she can hear
Randy SCREAMING.

                RANDY
        NO, SID. OPEN UP. PLEASE...
        HE'S GONE CRAZY.

His fists POUND against the door.  Sidney, stumbling in the
darkness, rushes to the phone in the living room.  Just as she
reaches for it...it RINGS.  It scares the life out of her.  She
SCREAMS, yanking it up.

                SIDNEY
        Please! God! Help me!

                VOICE
            (from the phone)
        Having fun Sidney?

Sidney falls apart, SCREAMING.

                SIDNEY
        NOOOOOOOOO!!!

She throws the phone down, disconnecting the call.

Sid moves back to the door.  RANDY'S SCREAMS ARE MADDENING.  She
eyes the lock, deliberating.

                SIDNEY
            (at the door)
        GOAWAYLEAVEMEALONE!

CLUNK!  A NOISE UPSTAIRS.

Sidney looks up the staircase, into the darkness, her face SHOCKED
to see...

BILLY

emerging from the shadows, stumbling down the stairs.  Very much
alive.

                SIDNEY
        Oh God. Billy!

He's blood-soaked and dazed.  Sidney meets him in the landing,
grabbing him, holding him...

                SIDNEY
        I thought you were...

                BILLY
        I'm alright. Gotta...get...help.

Billy goes for the door.

                SIDNEY
        He's out there.

Randy continues POUNDING ON THE DOOR, SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS
LUNGS.

                RANDY
            (through door)
        Please, you gotta let me in. He's
        gonna kill me.

Billy goes for the door.  Sidney blocks him.

                SIDNEY
        NO! Don't believe him.

                BILLY
        It's okay. Give me the gun.

Sidney hands him the gun.  Billy turns and unlocks the door,
opening it.  Randy rushes in, grabbing Billy, pleading...

                RANDY
        Help me...

                BILLY
            (calming him)
        Shhhh. It's okay.

                RANDY
        Stu's flipped out. He's gone mad.

Slowly, a small smile creeps across Billy's face.

                BILLY
        "We all go a little mad sometimes."

Randy squints, confused, as Billy aims the gun at Randy and pulls
the trigger.  The BLAST throws Randy's body against the wall
before sliding to a heap on the floor...still.

                BILLY
        Anthony Perkins--PSYCHO

BILLY TURNS TO SIDNEY...

Who stands only feet away, face aghast...

Fuck, no...this can't be happening.  Billy's eyes are on her,
unmoving.

He sticks his tongue out and slowly licks the blood dried to his
face...tasting it.

                BILLY
        Corn syrup. Same stuff they used for
        pig's blood in CARRIE.

Sidney is dumbfounded.  Slowly, she takes a step back, moving into
the dark refines of the kitchen.

Billy, lurches forward in a fake-out, baiting her.  She takes
another step back--petrified.

CLOSE ON BILLY'S FACE.  It is no longer familiar to Sidney.  There
is something inhuman now about his features.  His expression is
pure evil.

She takes another step back, shrinking into the dark kitchen.

THE CAMERA TAKES A MOMENT TO ADJUST TO THE DARKNESS as the outline
of a FIGURE appears...

STANDING RIGHT BEHIND SIDNEY.

She continues to back up, moving right into the arms of...

STU

Sidney spins around...her mouth open in speechless horror.

                SIDNEY
        Stu...please...help me...

Stu stares back at her, eyes wide, lips curled in a subtle smile
as he holds a small compact CELLULAR PHONE up to his face.

                STU
            (whispering into phone)
        Surprise, Sidney.

His VOICE sounds affected now...the VOICE of the killer.

Sidney looks back to Billy, then to Stu, then to Billy again.  It
becomes all too clear.

She stands between them, her mind racing, calculating...

SHE BOLTS INTO THE LIVING ROOM

If for no other reason than to put space between her and
them...they stand in the entryway, trapping her in.

                BILLY
        Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've
        got one more surprise--Stu, I believe it's
        your turn.

                STU
        Oh yeah

Stu disappears into the kitchen.

                BILLY
            (to Sidney)
        What's wrong? You look like you've seen
        a ghost.

Sidney stands, trying hard to hold a calm resolve.

A NOISE comes from the kitchen.  A low dragging sound.  Stu
reappears from the front hall...wrestling with
something...someone...

CLOSE ON STU...he has a body in tow, he thrusts it forward and it
rolls into the living room.  Sidney looks down to find...

HER FATHER

bound and gagged.  His eyes wide in fear, very much alive.

                SIDNEY
        Daddy!

She starts for him.

                BILLY
        Close enough.

Stu places the cellular phone in Mr. Prescott's shirt pocket.

                STU
        Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.

                SIDNEY
        Why are you doing this?

                STU
        It's all part of the game.

                BILLY
        It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!

                SIDNEY
        Fuck you.

                BILLY
        We already played that game. You lost,
        remember?

                STU
        You have to play, Sid. Don't want to
        disappoint your dad. He's been waiting
        around all night.

                BILLY
        It's an easy game. We ask you a
        question. If you get it wrong--you die.

                STU
        And if you get it right--you die.

                SIDNEY
        You're crazy--both of you.

                STU
        The official term is "psychotic".

                SIDNEY
        You'll never get away with this.

                BILLY
        Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't
        believe how easy it was to frame him.

                STU
        Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took
        a few notes. It was fun.

Billy and Stu relish their madness, proud of themselves.

Sidney looks to her dad, sees the tears in his eyes.  She looks
back to Billy, unflinching..a determined look on her face.

                SIDNEY
        Why did you kill my mother?

                BILLY
        Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I
        think she wants a motive. Hmmm...I don't
        really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did
        Norman Bates have a motive?

Stu plays along, shaking his head.

                STU
        Nope.

                BILLY
        And did they really ever explain why
        Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people?
        Don't think so. You see, it's scarier
        when there's no motive, Sid.

                SIDNEY
            (fighting tears)
        I don't understand...

                BILLY
        We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman
        was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit
        all over town like she was Sharon Stone or
        something.

                STU
            (laughing)
        ..so we put her out of her misery. I
        mean, let's face it, your mom was no
        Sharon Stone.

Stu cracks up over this while Billy turns very serious.

                BILLY
        Is that motive enough for you? Or how
        about this? Did you know your slut
        mother was sleeping with my dad and she's
        the reason my mom moved out and deserted
        me.

A sudden silence.  Sidney is rigid with shock, his words resonant
with truth.

                SIDNEY
        What?

Even Stu is surprised with his seriousness.

                BILLY
        Think about it. On the off chance I get
        caught-a motive like that could divide a
        jury for years, don't you think?. You took
        my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy
        factor. Maternal abandonment causes
        serious deviant behavior. It certainly
        fucked you up. It made you have sex with
        a psychopath.

                STU
        That's right and now that you're no
        longer a virgin. You gotta die--those
        are the rules.

Billy sits the gun down on the table near the foyer.  And then
moves to Sidney with the butcher knife in hand.

                BILLY
        Pretend this is all just a scary movie,
        Sid. How do you think it's going to end?

Sidney doesn't respond.

                STU
            (excited)
        This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got
        it all figured out. Why do you think we
        kept your father alive so long? Why did
        we save you for last?

                BILLY
        You know what time it is, Sid? It's
        after midnight. It's your mother's
        anniversary. We killed her exactly one
        year ago today.

Billy turns to Stu with the knife.  They eye each other.

                BILLY
        Ready?

                STU
        Yeah...

Billy pulls the knife back and brings it forward quickly, slicing
into Stu.  He stumbles to ho his knees, WINCING in pain.

                STU
        Jesus...

Sidney SCREAMS...as blood gushes..real blood, a dark, deep red.
Stu inspects the wound to his side...then he smiles...

                STU
        Good one. My turn.

He takes the knife from Billy.

                BILLY
        Don't forget-stay to the side and don't
        go too deep.

Stu stabs at Billy's belly, puncturing him...Billy doubles over...

                BILLY
        Jesus...fuck, that hurt.

                SIDNEY
        Stop it!

                BILLY
            (squelching the pain)
        Got the ending figured out yet? Time's
        running out.

                STU
        Come on, Sid. Think about it. Your
        father is the chief suspect. We cloned
        his cellular. The evidence is there.

Billy takes the knife and slashes at Stu's arm, two quick
cuts...he doubles over...

                BILLY
        What if your father snapped? Your mom's
        anniversary set him off and he went on a
        murder spree, killing everyone...

                STU
            (in major pain)
        Except for me and Billy...we were left
        for dead...

                BILLY
        And then he killed you and then shoots
        himself in the head. It's a perfect
        ending.

                STU
        Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on
        and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these
        days--you gotta have a sequel.

Stu takes the knife and cuts at Billy.

                SIDNEY
        You sick fucks--you've seen one too many
        movies.

Billy looks at her, bent over, crazed.

                BILLY
        Oh Sid, don't blame the movies...Movies
        don't create psychos. Movies just make
        psychos more creative.

Stu staggers a bit.

                STU
        That's it, Billy. I can't take any more.
        I'm feeling woozy.

                BILLY
        Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.

Billy moves to Sidney's father.

                STU
        Where'd you put it?

Stu is searching the foyer for the gun.

                BILLY
        It's on the table.

                STU
        No, it's not.

Billy hobbles over.  The gun is gone.

                BILLY
        Where the fuck is it?

                VOICE
            (off camera)
        Right here, asshole.

Billy and Stu look up in unison to see...

GALE WEATHERS-CORRESPONDENT FROM INSIDE STORY

standing in the front door way, gun in hand.  Her body tattered
and bloody.  Her hair a mess.

                BILLY
        I thought she was dead.

                STU
        She looked dead. Still does.

Gale holds the gun firm, in total control.

                GALE
        I've got an ending for you. The reporter
        left for dead in the newsvan comes to,
        stumbles upon you two dipshits, finds the
        gun, fumbles your plan, and saves the day.

Sidney steps forward.

                SIDNEY
        I like that ending.

Billy lunges at Gale, but she holds steady.  Billy and Stu eye
each other.

                BILLY
        She can't get both of us.

                STU
        Odds are--she'll miss anyway.

In a mad rush, they storm Gale, heading straight at her.  She
pulls the trigger, but nothing happens...the safety is on.

Billy charges forward, grabbing hold of the front door, SLAMMING
IT SHUT.  It catches Gale in the face, knocking her backwards out
the door.  She goes down...out.

                STU
        Cool move.

Billy steps out the front door and retrieves the gun from where
Gale lays.  Then he turns back inside the house to find...

SIDNEY GONE.

                BILLY
        Where'd she go?

Stu looks around, staggering now, bleeding heavily...Sidney has
completely disappeared.  Only her father, bound and gagged remains
in the living.

                STU
        I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.

                BILLY
        Where the fuck did she go?

Suddenly, the phone RINGS.  Billy and Stu look at each other.
Completely surprised.  Billy scrambles over to the phone.

                BILLY
            (picking up phone)
        Hello?

                SIDNEY
            (from phone)
        Are you alone in the house?

Billy looks to Mr. Prescott.  The cellular phone is gone.

                BILLY
        You bitch--where the fuck are you?

                SIDNEY
        Not so fast.  We're gonna play a little
        game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST
        CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED
        YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?

Billy looks around the living room.

                BILLY
        Find her.

Billy is fuming now...slightly staggering...and starting to lose
it.  He SCREAMS at Stu who has fallen to his knees.

                BILLY
        FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!

                STU
        I can't...I'm bad off, Billy. You cut
        to deep.

Billy throws the phone at Stu.  He mouths to him, so Sid can't
hear.  "Talk to her..."  Then Billy takes off for the kitchen.
Stu takes the phone.

                SIDNEY
            (aware)
        So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got
        one. The police are on their way. What
        are you going to tell them?

                STU
        Peer pressure...I'm way to sensitive.

Billy flies back in the room, grabbing the phone from Stu.  He's
completely nuts now, staggering, bleeding, totally insane.

                BILLY
            (SCREAMING in phone)
        I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like
        your slut whore mother.

                SIDNEY
        Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed
        Mama's boy.

Billy starts ripping the room up, overturning furniture in a mad
fit of rage...when he notices the hall closet.  Touche!  He smiles
deliriously, heading for it, ripping it open as...

A GHOST MASKED FIGURE strikes from within, with an umbrella, the
sharp end hitting him in the chest as it fans out.  Billy stumbles
back, stunned, as the GHOST comes at him again...the umbrella
lodges in his chest, and he goes down.

Sidney rips the GHOST MASK off her head.  She looks at Billy,
disgusted, throwing the mask on Billy's now still body.  A
movement behind her sends her reeling around to find...

RANDY slowly sitting up.  His body drenched in blood.  He's
alive...barely.  He looks to Sidney...through pain...

                RANDY
        You know what I hate most about horror
        movies? The final scene...it just goes on
        and on...and it gets so stupid...

Randy manages to stand when a FIGURE COMES LEAPING at him,
completely unexpected...it's Stu...barreling into him...they fall
back into the living room.  Sidney grabs the gun next to Billy and
turns to the living room to find...

Randy and Stu rolling across the floor in a dead lock, fighting,
both seriously injured...Sid tries to find aim when a...

HAND GRABS HOLD of Sidney's ankle, toppling her to the
floor...once again she finds Billy on top of her...

IN THE LIVING ROOM

Randy and Stu pound at each other, beating and clawing...

ON SIDNEY as she fights viciously, attacking with everything she's
got...

Randy is desperately trying to pry away from Stu...he grabs hold
of the television set and tries to pull himself off the floor out
of Stu's clutch...

His hands find the top of the TV...the VCR...he yanks on it,
gripping it with his hands, bringing it around with force-CRASHING
the VCR into Stu's head.  Stu drops.

ON SIDNEY as she digs her hand into Billy's open chest wound.  He
CRIES OUT BLOODY MURDER.  Her other hand brings the gun up to his
face...but he head bunts it out the front door...suddenly a flash
of silver appears above Sidney.

Billy has grasped the butcher knife...he rises it high above
Sidney ready to strike...when a bullet RIPS THROUGH THE FOYER
striking Billy knocking him back into the living room.

Sidney looks up to see...

GALE WEATHERS, holding the gun in a death grip as smoke rises
above the gun's chamber.

Sidney sits up as Gale moves to her, helping her.  Their eyes
meet.  A life truce.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Billy and Stu lay face up, head to head.  Sid and Gale move over
them, staring down.  Randy joins them.

                RANDY
        Sid, you found me out...I'm a virgin.
        And pretty happy about it right now.

Sidney nudges their bodies.  They both stir.

                RANDY
        Careful. This is the moment when you
        think the killer's dead, but then he
        springs back to life for one last scare.

Sidney grabs the gun from Gale.

                SIDNEY
        Not this time.

She positions her foot on Stu's chest and aims.

                SIDNEY
        This is for my Mom, asshole.

She SHOOTS him in the forehead, a clean and perfect shot.  The she
aims the barrel at Billy who's eyes suddenly open, blinking up at
her, blood bubbling from his lips.  He's not yet dead.  Their eyes
lock.

                SIDNEY
        And this Billy stud-bucket is for having
        an incredibly small weenie.

She FIRES another perfect shot.  They're both goners.

Sidney drops the smoking gun, standing silent over the bodies.  A
quiet moment when suddenly...

A FIGURE LUNGES AT THEM

Both Sid and Gale and Randy SCREAM in epic, final scare
proportions as Mr. Prescott leaps forward, still bound and gagged.

Sid catches her breath, relaxing.

                SIDNEY
        Oh Daddy...

She rushes to him, untying him...while Gale moves to the bookcase
and retrieves the hidden camera.

                GALE
        I wanna close-up.

Randy appears by Sidney's side, helping her untie her father.

                RANDY
        This is probably an inappropriate
        moment, but you think you'd want
        to maybe go out with me sometime...
        like on a date?

Sidney looks at him, dumbfounded.

                RANDY
        Maybe catch a movie?

A long moment as Sidney's face goes from disbelief to resignation
to the slight trace of a smile.

                SIDNEY
        Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.

                RANDY
        You got it.

He smiles at her...watching as Sidney grabs hold of her father,
holding him tight as Gale Weathers, with camera in hand, gets one
hell of an ending to this SCARY MOVIE.

Scream 2

                                               FADE IN:
   
   
   EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT
   
   An old preserved movie theatre. The kind only found in
   a small town. Very picturesque. The marquee in front
   reads:
   
   "SNEAK PREVIEW TONIGHT
   'STAB'
   Rated R"
   
   A line has formed around the block, GUYS and GIRLS -
   mostly college age.
   
   CLOSE on a girl, MAUREEN, no more than 18. A friendly
   face with innocent eyes. She stands in line with her
   boyfriend PHIL, same age. A handsome counterpart.
   
                       MAUREEN
             I hate scary movies.
   
                       PHIL
             It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your
             hand.
   
                       MAUREEN
             If we hurry, we can still catch the
             Sandra Bullock movie.
   
                       PHIL
             We got free tickets.
   
   He pulls her close, snuggling with her.
   
   
   EXT. BOX OFFICE
   
   Maureen and Phil reach the box office, presenting their
   tickets.
   
   They pass through the front doors where an USHER stands
   randomly handing out GHOST MASKS. A Hollywood variation
   of a most familiar one. Phil takes one.
   
                       MAUREEN
             What's that?
   
                       USHER
             The studio sent them.
   
   
   INT. THEATRE - A MINUTE LATER
   
   The small theatre is nearly packed to capacity. Maureen
   and Phil enter, moving down the aisle searching for two
   seats. A YOUNG GIRL SCREAMS, whizzing by them as a
   GHOST MASKED GUY chases after her. The crowd LAUGHS.
   Everyone is having fun.
   
   Maureen and Phil find aisle seats down towards the
   screen just as the lights DIM. People FAKE SCREAM in
   terror. A very lively crowd.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   Credits roll as the movie begins. The studio logo
   appears followed by...
   
   "A ROBERT RODRIGUEZ FILM"
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   Maureen turns to find a GHOST MASK in her face. Phil
   has slipped it on.
   
                       MAUREEN
             I don't think so.
   
   Phil gets in her face, playing with her. She swats him.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Take it off.
   
                       PHIL
             But...
   
                       MAUREEN

   More credits.
   
   "BASED ON THE BOOK "THE WOODSBORO MURDERS" BY GALE
   WEATHERS"
   
   Maureen looks behind her, toward the rest of the
   audience. A sea of white ghost faces fill the theatre.
   The publicity masks actually glow in the dark. A
   chilling sight that leaves Maureen extremely spooked.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The movie begins. A house in the middle of nowhere.
   Lights burn from within.
   
   Inside the house, a YOUNG GIRL, Alicia Silverstonish is
   taking a shower. The water cascades over her nubile
   body. Suddenly, a FIGURE is glimpsed through the
   curtain. It's all very PSYCHO.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Now why does she have to be naked?
             How does that serve the plot?
   
                       PHIL
             Sssshhh.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower
   curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She
   grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living
   room, grabbing the phone.
   
                       GIRL
             Hello?
   
   A menacing VOICE responds.
   
                       VOICE
             Hello?
   
                       GIRL
             Who is this?
   
                       VOICE
             You tell me.
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   Maureen is not having a good time. She's already
   spooked.
   
                       MAUREEN
             I hate this shit.
   
                       ON SCREEN
             The phone rings again.
   
                       VOICE
             Why did you hang up on me?
   
                       GIRL
             Who is this?
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   Maureen shifts in her seat.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Why doesn't she just hang up and
             call the police? Stupid..
   
                       PHIL
             Shush.
   
                       MAUREEN
             I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
   
   He nods. Maureen stands and moves up the aisle.
   
   
   INT. LOBBY - SECONDS LATER
   
   Maureen emerges from the theatre and into the small
   lobby. It is dark and shadowed. She moves down a long
   hallway to a staircase. A "BATHROOM" sign with an arrow
   points downstairs.
   
   Maureen hits the stairs to...
   
   
   INT. BASEMENT LOUNGE - SAME
   
   A small lounge leads to two bathroom doors. Very low
   lighting. Maureen descends the stairs, heading for
   the...
   
   
   INT. GIRL'S RESTROOM - SAME
   
   A large bathroom. Five stalls line one wall. The door
   CREAKS open. Maureen enters and shoots for a stall.
   
   
   INSIDE THE STALL - MOMENTS LATER
   
   Maureen finishes up, fastening her pants. Suddenly, the
   bathroom door CREAKS open. Maureen listens. FOOTSTEPS
   are heard. Loud and heavy.
   
   Maureen eyes the crack in the stall door. Not much is
   visible. Suddenly, a SHADOW sweeps by. The footsteps
   stop.
   
   Maureen finishes up quickly. She flushes, throws the
   stall door open and rushes out to find...
   
   THE BATHROOM EMPTY.
   
   The stall doors are all closed. Maureen shoots for the
   door. She rips the door open as a FIGURE rushes her...
   
   A YOUNG GIRL followed by her FRIEND, both perky and
   loud. They hurl past Maureen, LAUGHING and carrying on.
   
                       GIRL #l
             I got so scared my bladder rolled.
   
                       GIRL #2
             You chicken shit. It's just a
             movie.
   
                       GIRL # l
             No, it really happened. It's a true
             story.
   
   Maureen is out the door. Now thoroughly spooked.
   
   
   INT. BASEMENT LOBBY - SAME
   
   Alone, Maureen moves for the stairs when a FIGURE
   emerges from the shadows. A GHOST MASKED SHAPE
   appearing behind her...
   
   LUNGING FOR HER, grabbing her, spinning her around. She
   SCREAMS MADLY as the Ghost starts LAUGHING. The mask
   comes off. It's Phil.
   
                       MAUREEN
             You ass.
   
                       PHIL
             I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to.
             It was too easy.
   
                       MAUREEN
             You are so not funny.
   
   Phil takes her in his arms.
   
                       PHIL
             Come on, baby. Lighten up a little,
             will ya?
   
                       MAUREEN
             I get scared really easy, okay.
   
                       PHIL
             You gotta go with it. Scary movies
             are great foreplay.
   
   He's sincere. He leans down and plants a kiss on her.
   She caves, kissing him back. Sweet and sensual.
   
                       MAUREEN
             I just have a hard time with
             insipid, sexist violence.
   
                       PHIL
                   (nibbling her neck)
             We can still Sandra Bullock it.
   
                       MAUREEN
                   (nibbling back)
             Sandra started without us. We can
             stay. He kisses her again, then
             breaks away.
   
                       PHIL.
             Yeah? Okay. I gotta whizz. Meet me
             upstairs?
   
                       MAUREEN
             Want some popcorn?
   
                       PHIL
             Butter.
   
   Maureen moves up the stairs out of sight. Phil turns,
   reaching for the bathroom door just as a...
   
   GHOST MASKED FIGURE appears in his path. Phil steps
   back, surprised. Suddenly, a flash of silver shoots
   forth as Phil is pierced with a long sharp knife. Quick
   and silent. He bellies over just as the Ghost Shape
   strikes again. Phil goes down without a scream.
   
                                               CUT TO:

   A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The
   young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING,
   flying through the room.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to
   the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house."
   etc.
   
   Maureen makes her way back to her aisle seat. She sits
   down next to...
   
   
   PHIL
   
   Who sits with the mask on. The reflection from the
   movie bouncing against it in the darkness.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Give it up.
   
   She sits down, with the popcorn.
   
                       MAUREEN
             How many stabs did I miss?
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl slips out a side door, completely
   terrified. In her hand, she holds a portable phone.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Maureen offers Phil popcorn.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Why doesn't she run?
   
   Phil turns to her, bringing his finger to his masked
   lips, SSSHHING her.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST
   MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through
   the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting
   away, running...
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her
   best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her
   popcorn.
   
                       MAUREEN
             This is so tired.
   
   She turns her attention to Phil.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Hey, you... pasty face...
   
   Phil ignores her. She reaches over in the darkness
   putting her hand on his knee. She inches it up. The
   Ghost-masked Phil just stares ahead.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Whatsa the matter? Can't I get your
             ghost?
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl is running through the yard. The Ghost
   Killer is right behind her, chasing her... she
   SCREAMS...
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Maureen pretends to watch the movie while her hand
   continues to move between Phil's legs. She stares
   ahead, WINCING at what's about to happen to the girl on
   screen.
   
   She doesn't notice as Phil pulls a long sharp hunting
   knife from inside his coat jacket. Maureen's hand moves
   up Phil's jacket... something stops her. She feels
   something on her fingers... something wet. She pulls
   her hand back, the reflected movie illuminating bloody
   fingers.
   
   Maureen stares at her hand...
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her,
   pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife.
   The young girl is helpless...
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Maureen looks at Phil, confused... as if seeing for the
   first time... IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the
   Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other
   one clutching the hunting knife.
   
   Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD
   SCREAM that is matched by the entire audience as they
   SCREAM at the screen.
   
   
   ON SCREAM
   
   The young girl is stabbed in the heart.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Maureen is helpless. The knife comes fast and furious,
   striking her in the stomach. She falls forward, into
   the aisle as...
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl, clutching her bloody chest... drags
   herself, crawling across wet grass... the killer behind
   her... raising his knife again.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle,
   clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable
   to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to
   see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle.
   
   Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several
   PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see
   the Ghost Face coming at her again... knife raised.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl is slashed again.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   The knife slices into Maureen again... then again. The
   theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost
   keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A
   horrifying, sickening sight.
   
   Maureen stumbles forward, her bloody body moving down
   to the front of the theater. Suddenly, the entire
   audience begins...
   
   
   APPLAUD AND CHEER
   
   Maureen, swaying from side to side, turns to the crowd
   and emits a HORRENDOUS BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM as...
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl lets out an enormous EAR SCREECHING
   SCREAM that mirrors Maureen's as the killer attacks one
   last time, stabbing her, silencing her forever.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   The Ghost slashes out one last time, direct and fierce.
   Maureen falls back against the movie screen... very
   much dead. Her arms flail across the screen... smearing
   blood over the wide screen image of the GHOST MASK.
   
                                               SMASH CUT

   INT. DORM ROOM - MORNING
   
   A typical college dorm room. Industrial strength
   furniture. There's two of everything.
   
   A RINGING phone stirs a YOUNG GIRL in bed, asleep under
   a mound of blankets and pillows. The girl starts to
   rise as the phone is answered. A VOICE is heard. Brass
   and sassy.
   
                       VOICE (O.S.)
             Hello... uh-huh... Who is this?
             Well, we identify ourselves around
             here. No, you can't. Uh-huh...
             yeah, right...
   
   The girl rolls out of bed, her hair falls away to
   reveal her face - It's SIDNEY PRESCOTT. Two years older
   has brought a maturity to this beautiful young woman.
   Her face posses a survivor's edge. Stronger and more
   determined, she appears to have weathered the storm.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I got it.
   
   She stands and moves to...
   
   
   HALLIE
   
   Her roommate and friend. An attractive young black
   woman. Twenty at most. Brazen. Fun. Full of life. She
   hands the phone to Sidney.
   
                       HALLIE
             Knock yourself out.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hello?
                   (silence)
             Hello?
   
                       VOICE
             Hello Sidney.
   
   A VOICE spits out of the phone. Deep and haunting.
   Sidney doesn't flinch.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Yes?
   
                       VOICE
             What's your favorite scary movie?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Who is this?
   
                       VOICE
             You tell me.
   
   Sidney grabs a small device hooked to the phone. She
   takes a look at its display.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Cory Gillis. 442-8730.
   
   Silence.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Hot flash, Cory - prank phone calls
             are a criminal offense prosecuted
             under penal code 653M...
   
   CLICK! The phone goes dead.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Enjoy the movie.
   
   She hangs the phone up, turning to Hallie.
   
                       HALLIE
             Time to change numbers again?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Nah... I think it'll die off. It's
             opening weekend. Let's see how it
             goes.
   
   Sidney grabs her robe and shower bucket as Hallie
   channel surfs. Various morning news programs are on
   their small TV. Snippets are heard.
   
                       REPORTER
                   (from TV)
             "... The two victims, Maureen Evans
             and Phil Stevens..."
   
   The channel switches. A YOUNG MAN is being interviewed.
   Attractive, sullen. Sad.
   
                       YOUNG MAN
                   (from TV)
             Please, I just wanna be left alone.
   
   His voice stops Sidney cold. She turns to the
   television.
   
                       HALLIE
             He sure gives a lot of interviews
             for someone who wants to be left
             alone.
   
   Hallie hits the remote. The man's image disappears as
   the TV goes off. Hallie turns, all smiles.
   
                       HALLIE
             Get your ass in gear. You're late.
             Don't forget we've got rush at the
             Deltas tonight. Don't wear anything
             you don't want trashed. Sid? Sid?
   
   Sidney turns from the television. Momentarily lost.
   Recovery is immediate.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I can't believe I let you talk me
             into going Greek.
   
   Sid moves to the door and throws it open. A GHOST
   FIGURE LEAPS at her. She SCREAMS but then stops
   herself.
   
   It's just a costume hung from her doorframe. Preset, to
   scare. Another prank. Sidney rips it down, turns to
   Hallie, throwing the costume at her.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Pumps. Nice handbag. Whaddya think?
   
   Sid is surprisingly cool. She exits out the door,
   leaving Hallie staring at the Ghost Mask in her hands.
   
                       CUT TO:
             
   
   EXT. DORMITORY - MORNING - LITTLE LATER
   
   Sid steps outside of her dorm. The morning sun shines
   down as Sid breathes in, taking in the day just as
   FIFTY NEWS REPORTERS NOB HER.
   
                       REPORTER #2
             Sidney, did you know the victims?
   
                       REPORTER #1
             Do you feel responsible for the
             murders?
   
                       SIDNEY
             What murders?
   
   Microphones are shoved in her face as Sidney is seiged
   upon by journalists and TV cameras. She starts to
   panic.
   
                       REPORTER #3
             Do you think there will be more
             murders?
   
   Sidney is mortified. She pushes and shoves but there is
   no escape. The questions come at her like lightning.
   She sees a whole in the crowd and goes for it as a
   REPORTER, a flashy woman - all hair and teeth, thick
   sunglasses, moves in her way.
   
                       FLASHY REPORTER
             Did you kill them last night, Sid?
             Has it gotten to you? Have you
             finally snapped?
   
   Sidney's eyes flare. Her fist starts to clench when...
   
   BAM! Someone beats her to it. A fist flies out from the
   crowd, connecting with the flashy woman's face. She
   drops. Sid spins around to find...
   
   
   GALE WEATHERS
   
   Standing, tight-fisted. Their eyes meet. A quick
   moment. Sidney is happy to see her.
   
   The onslaught continues. Cameras flash, reporters
   shove. Gale moves in front of Sid, holding the crowd at
   bay. The reporters begin to throw questions at Gale.
   
                       GALE
                   (to Sid)
             Quick, get outta here.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What's going on?
   
                       GALE
             Just go. l'll find you later.
   
   Sid wastes no time. She takes off, running around the
   side of the building. She stops, takes a breath, but
   the reporters are on her tail. She looks up to see a...
   
   
   SMALL CAMPUS SECURITY VEHICLE
   
   Appear, moving towards her. It slows down.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
                   (from the vehicle)
             Hop on, Sid.
   
   Sid goes for it as two hands reach out to help her. One
   smooth move and Sidney is in the arms of...
   
   
   DEWEY RILEY
   
   She looks at him. Her face a book of questions.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What's going on, Dewey?
   
   He smiles at her. A safe, warm smile. His face as cute
   as ever.
   
                       DEWEY
             It'll be alright.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. SECURITY CART - MINUTES LATER
   
   The security cart trots along, passing STUDENTS coming
   and going. Dressed smartly in a campus security outfit,
   Dewey maneuvers the cart across the campus grounds.
   Sidney rides beside him, horrified as she listens to
   him.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Three hundred people watched?
             Nobody did anything?
   
                       DEWEY
             They thought it was a publicity
             stunt.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Oh my God. How could it happen?
   
                       DEWEY
             They don't know. It was carefully
             planned. Earlier in the day the
             victims received anonymous passes
             to the movie.
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's a copycat killer I knew this
             would happen. That fucking movie.
   
   The cart comes to a stop in front of a building.
   
                       DEWEY
             As of now, they don't see any
             relation. But they're checking it
             out. The state, Special Task Force,
             FBI - they're all here. They'll
             find the guy.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Yeah, right.
   
                       DEWEY
             Look, Sid, why don't you take off?
             Disappear for a few days. I'll come
             with you.
   
                       SIDNEY
             No. I will not crawl under a rock.
             This is a fucked-up world and
             people kill people all the time.
             I'll just get used to it.
   
   Dewey steps down off the security cart and helps Sid
   off.
   
                       DEWEY
             Nothing will happen to you. I
             promise.
   
   Sid's tough demeanor is cracking. She takes a deep
   breath.
   
                       DEWEY
             That's why I'm here, right? We take
             care of each other. C'mon, I'll
             walk you to class.
   
   He starts off, for the first time, a severe limp is
   visible as his left leg drags behind him.
   
                       SIDNEY
             You go, it's all stairs, I can take
             it from here.
   
                       DEWEY
             Don't worry...
   
                       SIDNEY
             Dewey, I'm completely equipped with
             mace, alarm whistle, keyring,
             knife, a degree in defensive
             combat...
   
                       DEWEY
             Just in case...
   
                       SIDNEY
             No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be
             okay. Go back to work and let me
             get back to my quasi pseudo-happy
             existence.
   
   Sidney reaches up and gives her pseudo-brother a kiss,
   then takes off for the building. Dewey watches until
   she disappears inside, then limps back to his security
   cart.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. STUDENT UNION PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER
   
   A newsvan pulls up and parks next to a trough of other
   newsvans and REPORTERS. Some are doing live remotes,
   others ready themselves for the next onslaught.
   
   Gale gets out of the newsvan, her cellular affixed to
   her ear.
   
                       GALE
             I don't know... no one's talking.
             What's the studio's position? Never
             happen. They'd be stupid to pull
             the movie. With all this free press
             - they're gonna have huge numbers
             this weekend. It'll break box
             office records. Of course I have
             bumps.
   
   Gale's CAMERAMAN can be seen behind her, in the van
   fussing with equipment.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             I need two minutes at six o'clock.
             I wanna do a piece on the slain
             kids - no sympathy shit - let's
             stick with the movie angle. I wanna
             pull a clip from an old film...
   
   Gale turns to her cameraman, snapping her fingers.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             Hey, what was the name of that
             movie?
   
   The guy looks up at her. It's RANDY. Two years older
   but still the charming jokester.
   
                       RANDY
             HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. MGN/UA.
             1980. Tom Hanks' first film.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
                   (into phone)
             HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. Yeah, find
             it. Don't worry, I've got it
             covered... I have a plan. Yeah,
             I'll get it. Give it a rest - I
             said I'll get it. Later.
   
   She hangs up, turning to Randy.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             Pressure's on. You ready for this?
   
                       RANDY
             I'm there, man. No worries. I got
             ya covered. I'm so there. That's
             why I'm here - because I'm there.
   
   Randy holds up his camera - stoked.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. SCHOOL OF FILM - LATER
   
   Sidney moves down a hallway. Not your typical school
   building. Through open doorways, film equipment is
   glimpsed. Editing bays and the like. She's in the Film
   Department.
   
   She comes upon an open door and peers in. A large room,
   a class is in progress. She slips in quietly.
   
   
   INT. CLASSROOM - SAME
   
   Sidney takes a seat at the back of the room. A handful
   of FILM STUDENTS sit around on torn couches heavy in
   discussion. Sid goes unnoticed as she watches a
   whirlwind debate. A SNOTTY GUY is pontificating a
   point.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             Sequels are too handicapped. By
             definition alone, they're inferior
             films.
   
   Hallie sits on a couch next to MICKEY, 20's, atheletic,
   cool and rowdy. Arms enwrapped.
   
                       MICKEY
             Bullshit generalization. Many
             sequels have surpassed their
             original.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             Name one.
   
                       MICKEY
             ALIENS Far better than the
             original.
   
                       ANOTHER GUY
             Subjective.
   
                       SOME GIRL
             Life's subjective. I much prefer
             Ridley Scott.
   
   The conversation overlaps, everyone arguing... making
   their point about ALIENS VS. ALIEN.
   
                       HALLIE
             No way. ALIENS rocked. "Stay away
             from her - you bitch."
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             I'll give you that one. Name
             another.
   
                       MICKEY
             T2.
   
                       SOME GIRL
             You've got a hard-on for Cameron.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             A bigger budget does not make a
             better movie. TERMINATOR one is
             historical.
   
   Someone screams out, "You Sarah Connor?" as the
   TEACHER, a young artsy type, speaks up.
   
                       ARTSY TEACHER
             How about THE GODFATHER PART II?
   
   Ooooohhh. The whole room goes worship silent. All in
   agreement.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             The almighty exception. Name
             another.
   
   A YOUNG MAN, handsome and smooth, jumps into the
   conversation. His name is Derek.
   
                       DEREK
             EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Smarter story.
             Improved effects.
   
   From the back of the room, Sidney watches him. Fixated.
   
                       HALLIE
             I liked JEDI. With the furry
             things.
   
   Everyone BOO'S. "Ewoks blow."
   
                       MICKEY
             Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
   
                       HALLIE
             I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH,
             PART 20.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             Case in point. The entire horror
             genre was destroyed by sequels.
   
                       ARTSY TEACHER
             Really? And why do you think that
             is?
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             Sequels suck. Hello. It becomes
             about: money and no one's
             interested in quality.
   
                       DEREK
             It's more than that. Horror films
             are only as good as their villains.
             How can Freddie and Jason possibly
             be scary after they've been diluted
             through five or six sequels.
   
                       TEACHER
             What's the solution? If you were
             making a sequel today what would
             you do differently?
   
   The class stews on this. Derek turns, spotting Sidney
   in the back of the room. She gives a half wave. He
   starts for her, excusing himself.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             The point is - I made my point.
             Sequels suck.
   
   
   INT. CORRIDOR - SAME
   
   Derek and Sidney move out into the hallway. Derek
   throws his arms around her protectively.
   
                       DEREK
             How are you? You weren't in class.
             I called as soon as I heard...
   
                       SIDNEY
             I skipped. Too many "That's her"
             looks.
   
                       DEREK
             I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Don't ask what you can do. No
             coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
   
   He looks at her with bedroom eyes.
   
                       DEREK
             I can do that. And I can also do
             this.
   
   He moves on her, wrapping her in his arms and kissing
   her passionately. She breaks away, laughing.
   
                       SIDNEY
             No PDA.
   
   But it's a failed objection. He kisses her again and
   they're soon devouring each other like two people in
   love. Right in the middle of the hallway.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. STUDENT UNION - LATE AFTERNOON
   
   The place is a circus. The front steps of the student
   center have been roped off to form a platform. A podium
   and mike have been placed center.
   
   CROWDS have gathered for the press conference that is
   being held by the university. Reporters and cameras
   have been roped off to the side. On stage, DEAN FISHER,
   a sharp looking woman in her forties is talking to
   spectators.
   
                       DEAN FISHER
                   (reading from a
                   prepared statement)
             "... and we feel this unfortunate
             isolated tragedy in no way reflects
             upon our fine school and we should
             trust that the authorities and FBI
             are acting quickly to bring us
             answers..."
   
   Beside her stand uniformed COPS, the local SHERIFF, FBI
   AGENTS. She continues on...
   
   
   IN THE ROPED OFF NEWS SECTION
   
   Gale walks through the crowd, listening to the Dean.
   
                       FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
             Gale? Can I have a second?
   
   Gale spins around to find DEBBIE SALT, the flashy
   reporter who she decked earlier, standing in front of
   her.
   
                       GALE
             Look, I'm sorry about the face.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer -
             NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
   
                       GALE
             Fair enough.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             What are you doing here? I thought
             you had retired from field
             reporting?
   
   The woman has immediately put Gale on the defensive.
   TWO OTHER REPORTERS have taken notice. Suddenly,
   CAMERAS are on Gale.
   
                       GALE
             Well, you know I'm dear to the
             subject matter.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             And much richer as a result.
   
                       GALE
             Do I know you? You look familiar.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             I took your vulture seminar seminar
             at Berkeley last year.
   
                       GALE
             Good for you.
   
   And in seconds the vultures are upon her as Gale
   Weathers is beseiged by REPORTERS. The questions spew
   forth. "Why are you here?" "Is this the work of a
   copycat killer?" "Have you talked to Sidney?" etc.
   
                       GALE
                   (ever smooth)
             Guys, you're missing the show.
   
   And with that Gale wanders off into the crowd.
   
   
   ON STAGE
   
   The LOCAL SHERIFF, a smart looking guy in his 50's is
   fielding questions.
   
                       SHERIFF
             No, we have no evidence of a serial
             killer. We think the killer acted
             deliberately and not at random...
   
   
   ON THE LAWN
   
   Students and concerned faculty stand. Among them are
   Sidney, Derek, Hallie and Mickey. Next to them stand
   JOEL, 20's, black, sensible and friendly. A very
   intelligent face.
   
                       DEREK
             But what are they doing? He's
             talking but he's not saying
             anything.
   
                       JOEL
             Sounds like they don't know
             anything.
   
                       HALLIE
             Do you think they'll cancel Hell
             Week?
   
                       MICKEY
             You're getting nailed - you're not
             getting out of it.
   
   From across the way, two gorgeous sorority type girls,
   LOIS and MURPHY stand with their FRATERNITY JOCK
   BOYFRIENDS. All looks and attitude. Their eyes are on
   Sidney as they huddle in a conspiratory stance.
   
                       JOEL
             Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
   
                       SIDNEY
             This has nothing to do with me,
             Joel. There's an estimated 270
             serial killers currently active in
             the US at any given time. I can't
             control that. Who's hungry?
   
                       HALLIE
             I have rehearsal.
   
                       MICKEY
             I have to watch rehearsal.
   
   Hallie kicks him. Joel moves to Sid.
   
                       JOEL
             I gotta hit the library. Anatomy.
             Some of us have real majors. You
             gonna be okay, Sid?
   
                       SIDNEY
             You're not allowed to ask that.
   
                       JOEL
             I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Thanks, Joel.
   
   Joel smiles, heading out as the two sorority girls,
   Lois and Murphy saunter over.
   
                       LOIS
             Hello, pledges. Enjoying
             yourselves?
   
   Instantly, Hallie stands at attention. Sidney joins
   begrudgingly.
   
                       HALLIE
             Yes, sister Lois. Very much so.
             Thank you for asking.
   
                       MURPHY
             Good. We need your help, pledges.
             Are you familiar with the Deltas TP
             fundraiser?
   
   The pledges shake their heads. Suspicious. Lois
   withdraws two rolls of toilet paper from her book bag
   and passes them out.
   
                       LOIS (CONT'D)
             In our efforts to raise money for
             our favorite cause...
   
                       MURPHY
             ... this week's TKE kegger...
   
                       LOIS
             Ne ask that you sell individual
             squares of toilet paper for a mere
             nickel a piece.
   
                       MURPHY
             We've set you each at a five dollar
             quota.
   
                       MICKEY
             Come on, guys. Uncool.
   
                       MURPHY
             Am I getting fraternity
             interference, Mickey?
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's okay. I can peddle toilet
             paper.
   
                       DEREK
             Sid, you don't have to.
   
   Sidney takes her toilet paper.
   
                       SIDNEY
             No special treatment. I can do
             this. C'mon Hallie.
   
   She throws him a comforting glance. She's okay with
   this. She heads off with Hallie. Derek watches.
   
                       DEREK
             How do you put up with this Greek
             shit?
   
                       MICKEY
             Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it,
             I'm into Hallie...
   
                       ACROSS THE WAY
             Gale moves through the crowd as the
             press conference/rally continues.
             She runs dead smack into...
   
   
   DEWEY
   
   Their eyes meet. A long moment. The silence between
   them is revealing.
   
                       GALE
             Hello, Dwight.
   
                       DEWEY
             Miss Weathers.
   
                       GALE
             I've been trying to reach you but
             you haven't returned...
   
                       DEWEY
             I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers,
             excuse me.
   
   He tips his hat curtly, then starts off. She stops him.
   
                       GALE
             The name's Gale, remember'?
   
   He turns on her. His eyes on fire.
   
                       DEWEY
             Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is
             embedded clearly between my ears.
   
                       GALE
             I see you read the book.
   
                       DEWEY
             Yes, I do retain reading skills.
             Shock.
   
                       GALE
             And an explanation is, of course,
             out of the question.
   
                       DEWEY
             Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the
             room with his dim-witted Barney
             Fifish presence." I think you've
             explained yourself.
   
                       GALE
             Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
   
                       DEWEY
             No, what you are is a money hungry,
             fame- seeking liar and - forgive me
             for saying - mediocre writer who
             has a cold storage shed where her
             heart should be.
   
   This stings Gale.
   
                       GALE
             You have every right to be upset.
   
                       DEWEY
             Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with
             inexperience."
   
                       GALE
             I never meant to imply...
   
                       DEWEY
             How do you know my dim-witted
             inexperience isn't merely a subtle
             form of manipulation used to lower
             people's expectations thereby
             enhancing my ability to effectively
             maneuver within any given
             situation?
   
   Gale is at a loss.
   
                       GALE
             I'm sorry. I don't know what else
             to say except I'm sorry.
   
                       DEWEY
             No, I'm the one who's sorry. I
             misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse
             me, I have some oozing to do.
   
   Dewey turns and limps away, leaving Gale staring after
   him. Her face smashed fiat.
   
   
   ON STAGE
   
   The sheriff continues fielding questions from
   reporters.
   
                       SHERIFF
             No, there has been no evidence that
             more than one killer is
             responsible...
   
   
   ACROSS THE WAY
   
   Sidney and Hallie have split up. They move through the
   crowd selling toilet paper. Several STUDENTS make their
   purchase.
   
   Sidney pockets her change, looks up to see Gale,
   standing alone. She goes to her.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hello, Gale.
   
                       GALE
             Sidney. Hello. How are you?
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't
             stop calling but other than that...
   
                       GALE
             I'm sorry.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Yeah, well... you are the
             definition of mixed emotions. I
             really should hate you... I see
             your movie's getting good reviews.
   
                       GALE
             It seems to be causing a stir.
             What's with the toilet paper?
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's hell week. I'm pledging the
             Deltas.
   
                       GALE
             It's good to see you involved.
   
                       SIDNEY
             My morn was a Delta.
   
   Beat. People have begun to notice the two of them
   talking. Reporters and spectators have slowly circled
   them. Gale looks around. She spots Randy, who appears
   behind Sid, with his camera. Gale gives him the nod. He
   throws the camera up, hits the light.
   
   Sid spins around, surprised to see him.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Randy? What are you doing here?
   
   But then she sees someone else, standing off to the
   side. A man she recognizes immediately. He looks at;
   her, his face sullen, broken. Sidney loses her breath.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Cotton...
   
   He moves to her.
   
                       COTTON
             Hello, Sidney.
   
   Gale motions to Randy. He maneuvers, getting the two of
   them in frame. A long moment, Sidney just stares at
   him. Completely off guard. She looks to Randy who aims
   the camera directly at her... filming her.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What are you doing?
   
   She turns back to Gale, staring holes through her,
   realizing she's been set up. She looks back to Cotton.
   She doesn't know what to say. She turns back to Gale.
   Eyes aflame.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             You BITCH!
   
   Sidney storms off, disappearing in the crowd. Cotton
   turns to Gale. His face pained.
   
                       COTTON
             This was a mistake. I shouldn't be
             here.
   
   He takes off, pushing through the crowd. Randy stops
   filming.
   
                       RANDY
             Can you say backfire?
   
                       GALE
             Did you get it?
   
                       RANDY
             Yeah, I got it.
   
   Randy is clearly not happy about his part in this. It's
   in his voice.
   
                       GALE
             You need to check your conscience
             at the door. We're not here to be
             loved.
   
   Randy's face reveals otherwise.
   
                       AT THE PODIUM
             The sheriff continues.
   
                       SHERIFF
             No, we don't anticipate another
             murder but we are taking every
             precaution possible...

   INT. SORORITY HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
   
   A huge living room. Divided sensibly in several

             sounds drunk. I'll call you back.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             That shit. He only calls you when
             he's drunk. Don't go over there.
   
                       CICI
             I won't.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             Don't. Think Bailey.
   
                       CICI

             Okay, Ted, you sound loaded. What's
             up?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Who's Ted?
   
   Realizing, it's not Ted.
   
                       CICI
             Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. I thought
             you were someone else.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE

             Where is everybody?
   
                       CICI

             I'm designated driver. I have to be
             here in case a sister calls and
             needs a ride.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             That's too bad.

                       MAN'S VOICE
             What if I said you?
   
                       CICI
             What if I said goodbye?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Why would you wanna do that?
   
                       CICI
             Why do you always answer a question
             with a question?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             I'm inquisitive.
   
                       CICI
             I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna
             leave a message for someone?
   
   Silence. No response.
   
                       CICI (CONT'D)
             Hello? Hello? Where'd you go?
   
   Silence again. And then...
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Do you wanna die tonight, Cici ?
   
   Almost a whisper. Simple. Direct. His voice pierces
   Cici. Her eyes widen. BEEP! Call waiting CLICKS
   through.
   
                       CICI
             Just a second.
                   (clicks over)
             Yes?
   
   Cici gets up and moves to...
   
   
   INT. FOYER - SAME
   
   Cici checks the front door, making sure it's locked.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             Was it Teddy?
   
                       CICI
             No, some creep asshole trying to
             scare me.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             It's hell week. Chill. The movie
             murders have brought out the
             crazies. It's nothing.
   
   BUMP! A noise from upstairs. Cici spins around to the
   staircase.
   
                       CICI
             Shit.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             What is it?
   
                       CICI
             I heard a noise.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             Where?
   
                       CICi
             Upstairs.
   
   BUMP! Something moves upstairs. It sounds almost like
   footsteps.
   
                       CICI
             Shit. Cici moves to the staircase.
             She peers up it.
   
                       CICI (CONT'D)
                   (calling out)
             Hello? Hello?

                       GIRL ON PHONE
             I can't believe you're alone in
             that house.
   
   Cici looks up the staircase again.
   
                       CICI
                   (soft whisper)
             I don't think I'm alone.
   
   Floorboards CREAK above her. Cici freaks.
   
                       CICI
             I'm outta here.
   
   She flies to the door, unlocking it, throwing it open.
   She moves out onto the...
   
   
   EXT. FRONT PORCH - SAME
   
   A wooden porch with a bulb glowing overhead. She stands
   on the porch steps, looking back, through the open
   door, into the house. The phone starts to CRACKLE.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             You're breaking up. Where are you?
   
                       CICI
             Outside.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             That's smart.
   
   Cici looks up and down the street. A YOUNG GUY walks
   along the sidewalk.
   
                       CICI
                   (calling out to him)
             Hey, you? HELLO? HELL0?
   
   The guy wears a headset, his head bobbing to the beat.
   He doesn't see her. Cici looks up the street to a
   sorority house down the block. Lights burn from within.
   People come and go.
   
                       CICI (CONT'D)
             There's something going on at the
             Delta Zeta's. I'm gonna walk down.
   
   Cici moves further down the porch steps. The phone
   begins to CRACK severely.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
                   (phone begins to go
                   out)

             Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll
             call you back.
   
   Cici hangs up the phone. She hits the "TALK" button.
   Nothing but static. She tries again. She can't get a
   dial tone. She looks back to the front door. She
   hesitates quickly, debating, then she moves back up the
   porch steps.
   
   She tries the phone again. It still won't connect. She
   moves back to the front porch. It connects. Major
   static. She dials 511.
   
                       VOICE

                   (too much static)
             I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Hello?
   
   Cici eyes the open front door. She inches back to it.
   
                       CICA (CONT'D)
             Can you hear me now?
   
                       VOICE
             We... bad..connec... call back.
   
   The phone goes dead.
   
                       CICI
             Shit.
   
   Cici redials. The same static.

                       VOICE
             I can't hear you.
   
   Cici peers through the front door, into the house. It's
   completely empty. Cici steps back inside the house. The
   connection becomes much clearer.
   
                       CICI
             I'm calling from the Chi Omega
             house. Someone is harassing me.
             Hello?
   
   There's no one on the line.
   
                       CICI (CONT'D)
             Shit!
   
   SUDDENLY, A FIGURE APPEARS BEHIND HER. A HAND GRABS
   HER.
   
   Cici spins around, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER.
   
                       GIRL'S VOICE
             Did the phone ring?
   
   Standing before her is DAWNIE, a young girl, sweet, pre-
   occupied.
   
                       CICI
             Jesus, you scared me. What are you
             doing here?
   
                       DAWNIE
             I live here.
   
                       CICI
             I thought you were going to the
             mixer?
   
                       DAWNIE
             I had to change. Did anyone call?
   
                       CICI
             Just some asshole trying to scare
             me.
   
   The front door remains wide open. The phone RINGS. Cici
   stares at it in her hand. She doesn't answer it.
   
                       DAWNIE
             Are you okay?
   
   Cici nods, answering the phone. ROCK MUSIC BLARES from
   the receiver.

                   (from phone)
             We're at Grogs and need a ride to
             Acid Rain.
   
                       DAWNIE
             Who is it? Is it Tina?
   
                       CICI
             They're at Grogs.
   
   Dawnie grabs the phone, moving into the living room.
   She moves to a mirror and fusses with her hair.
   
                       DAWNIE
             Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm on my way.
             Cici follows her back into the
             living room.
   
                       CICI
             I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
   
   Dawnie hangs up the phone, turning to Cici.
   
                       DAWNIE
             Take the next one. You should set
             the alarm. There's a killer on the
             loose.
   
   Reflected through the mirror is the foyer. Neither see
   as a SHROUDED FIGURE appears through the front door.
   Dawnie turns back to the mirror just as the Figure
   sweeps into the dark dining room and out of sight.
   
   Dawnie starts back for the front door. The phone RINGS.
   
   Dawnie grabs it.
   
                       DAWNIE (CONT'D)
             Hello?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Is Cici there?
   
                       DAWNIE
             Who's calling?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Ted?
   
   Dawnie throws her the phone and races out the door.
   
                       DAWNIE (CONT'D)
             It's your ill-concieved boyfriend.
             Seeya later. Set the alarm.
   
   She SLAMS the door shut behind her. A second later we
   hear it lock. Dawnie brings the phone up to her ear.
   
                       CICI
             Hello? Ted?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             No, it's me.
   
   Cici nearly collapses. She's starting to lose it.
   
                       CICI
             WHAAAATT?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Don't forget to set the alarm.
   
   Cici hangs up, throwing the phone across the room. She
   moves back to the foyer where an alarm panel is
   positioned in the wail. She hits a coupla digits and a
   BEEP is heard as she activates the alarm.
   
   She checks the door, making sure it's locked, then she
   turns and moves into the...
   
   
   DARK DINING ROOM
   
   Cici finds the light switch. CLICK! The room is
   illuminated. Two long dining tables run the length of
   the room. It's empty. Void of the Figure.
   
   
   INT. KITCHEN - SAME
   
   A large, dark kitchen. Cici moves to the frig and opens
   it, She gives it the once over. The frig light reflects
   against her face. She closes the refrigerator, not
   seeing the Shadow that bounces across her back.
   
   Cici moves to a sliding glass door that overlooks the
   backyard. She checks the lock. Secure. Then, the phone
   RINGS.
   
   She turns to the phone that's attached to a nearby
   wall. It RINGS AGAIN. She reaches for it, answering it.
   
                       CICI
             Hello?
   
   
   SUDDENLY, TWO HANDS LUNGE OUT OF THE DARKNESS
   
   One finds her neck, the other grabs her by the hair,
   wrenching her head backwards and spinning her around,
   shoving her, pushing her into the...
   
   
   SLIDING GLASS DOOR
   
   Glass explodes everywhere, shattering to bits as Cici's
   body crashes through it, setting off the ALARM. A loud,
   shrill RING resonants through the house as Cici's body
   lands on the deck outside. Still. (NOTE: WES DOES
   REALLY SCARY SHIT HERE.)
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
   
   Two doors down from Chi Omega. A big, old Gothic home
   serves as the Delta Zeta sorority. MUSIC PLAYS from
   inside. It sounds like a party.
   
   
   EXT. DELTA ZETA LIVING ROOM - SANE
   
   The room is filled with fifteen to twenty people.
   SORORITY GIRLS and FRAT BOYS who SCREAM and CHEER as
   they watch four girls who sit on their knees, hands
   behind their back, in front of a coffee table devouring
   plates of macaroni and cheese topped with whipped
   cream.
   
   Sidney, Hallie, and two other girls, TERI and LUCE tear
   into the macaroni with all their might. Gobbling it up,
   making a mess of themselves. Mickey is next to Hallie,
   coaching her on. On Sid as she finishes her plate.
   
   A whistle BLOWS.
   
                       MURPHY (CONT'D)
             Looks like we have a winner.
   
   Sid sits up. Macaroni and whipped cream is all over her
   face. She smiles the victor. Everyone APPLAUDS.
   
                       MURPHY (CONT'D)
             Sidney gets to skip the next round
             of Bulimia bingo.
   
   Hallie, a face full of grime, eyes Sid.
   
                       HALLIE
             You bitch.
   
   They crack up. Someone passes her a towel. She stands
   wiping her face, looking across the room as Derek
   enters through the front door. She waves at, him. He
   hurries over.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Where have you been'? You missed my
             shining moment. I won the macaroni
             sundae binge.
   
                       DEREK
             I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
   
   
   ON HALLIE AND MICKEY
   
   Mickey is cleaning off Hallie's face.
   
                       MICKEY
             I don't want you to choke or
             anything but you're trailing. You
             need to pick the pace up.
   
   She swats him.
   
   
   ON SID AND DEREK
   
   Sid and Derek stand arm in arm watching the next round.
   
                       SIDNEY
                   (complete throw away)
             Any news?
   
                       DEREK
             About what?
   
                       SIDNEY
             The forbidden subject.
   
   He shakes his head.
   
   Suddenly, a FRAT BOY pops into the room.
   
                       FRAT BOY
             Yo, guys, outside. Something's up
             at the Chi Omega. Police are
             everywhere.
   
   People begin to stand, moving to the windows and front
   door. Sidney looks to Derek.
   
   
   EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - SAME
   
   Everyone comes flying out of the front door and into
   the yard as POLICE CARS WHIP BY. SIRENS BLARING.
   
   
   ANGLE ON STREET
   
   Two doors down sits the Chi Omega house crawling with
   police, ambulances, reporters...
   
   "Yo - let's check it out." "C'mon." The entire crowd
   takes off in droves down the street. All except for...
   
   
   SIDNEY AND DEREK
   
   They stand on the porch, watching as the street becomes
   a circus.
   
   
   CLOSE ON SIDNEY'S FACE
   
   She knows.
   
   
   INT. CHI OMEGA HOUSE - SAME
   
   Captain Tyler, the Sheriff, police, FBI... the house is
   crawling. Dewey sifts around on his own, checking
   things out.
   
   
   IN THE KITCHEN
   
   Captain Tyler and the Sheriff stand at the shattered
   glass door.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Lots of blood. But no body.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Have you checked the...
   
                       SHERIFF
             Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Take the neighborhood.
   
   The Sheriff turns to his men.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Alright men, listen up...
   
   Dewey is all ears.
   
   
   INT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - SAME
   
   Derek and Sid stand on the porch, his arms around her.
   Her face is numb.
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's starting all over again.
   
                       DEREK
             Lemme take you home.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'll get my jacket.
   
   Sidney, indifferent, moves through the open front door,
   back inside the house. Her face and mind detached from
   what's going on. Derek remains on the porch, watching
   the spectacle. Slowly, the door behind him closes.
   
   
   INT. DELTA ZETA LIVING ROOM - SANE
   
   Sid moves through the living room, she grabs her coat
   when the phone RINGS. She looks at it suspiciously...
   knowingly... she reaches for it.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hello?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Hello Sidney?
   
   The VOICE. Low and haunting. Sidney closes her eyes.
   When she opens them tears are immediate But still, she
   refuses to crack.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Who are you?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Soon, Sidney, soon.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What do you want?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             To see every ounce of blood drain
             from your body.
   
   The Voice has never sounded more evil... more
   seductive. Sidney doesn't flinch. She holds steady.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Then come and get me.
   
   And with that Sidney hangs up the phone, SLAMMING it
   down. Silence. And then...
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             My pleasure.
   
   The Voice comes from inside the room... behind her.
   Sidney spins around and finds herself staring at the...
   
   
   GHOST MASKED FIGURE
   
   But not the one from the movie theater. The one from
   Sidney's nightmare long ago. It stands in the foyer
   archway, staring at her.
   
   A sustained moment. A stand off. Sidney doesn't move.
   But then the killer withdraws his trademark. A long,
   steel hunting knife... blood stained.
   
   
   SIDNEY BOLTS
   
   As the GHOST LEAPS at her. She SCREAMS, dodging him,
   
   
   ON THE PORCH
   
   Derek hears her SCREAM. He turns to the front door. He
   finds it locked. He starts to BEAT on it.
   
                       DEREK
             Sid? Sid?
   
   
   IN THE LIVING ROOM
   
   Sid just dodges the Ghost, just missing the knife's
   blade. She bolts through the living room, to the front
   door. Derek beats on it from outside.
   
   
   IN THE FOYER
   
                       SIDNEY
             Derek. He's in the house. Help...
             me...
   
   She struggles with the door, there are too many locks,
   the Ghost is already upon her. She looks to the stairs,
   thinks better of it... flies through the dining room.
   
   
   INT. FRONT PORCH - SANE
   
   Derek is going nuts trying to get into the house. He
   moves along the porch to the windows, looking through.
   He watches as the Ghost Figure chases her into the
   kitchen. Derek looks about the porch. He rears his foot
   back and kicks in the window.
   
   
   INT. KITCHEN - SAME
   
   Sid moves through the kitchen to the back door. She
   struggles with the lock as the Ghost is right behind
   her. She barely makes it out the back door...
   
   
   EXT. BACK YARD - SAME
   
   A large, fenced in yard. Lots of big oak trees. Sid
   flies down the back porch and into the yard. She moves
   across it, passed trees and shrubs. She spots a closed
   fence door in the back of the yard. She looks behind
   her to find...
   
   
   NOTHING
   
   She scans the yard, the Ghost Figure has completely
   disappeared. She moves behind a big tree, hiding behind
   it.
   
   Sid stops, catches her breath, then peers from behind
   the tree. The yard is completely empty. She goes for
   the fence door, slowly moving around the tree.
   
   BUMP! A noise in the darkness. She spins around, still
   making her way around the tree, moving backwards,
   walking right into a FIGURE. She SCREAMS, spinning
   around, finding herself face to face with...
   
   
   CICI'S BODY
   
   Hanging, dangling, hung from the tree, her stomach a
   ripped, bloody mess. Sidney SCREAMS IN UNFORGETTABLE
   HORROR. She steps back, falling right into the arms
   of...
   
   
   DEWEY
   
   She turns, SCREAMING.
   
                       DEWEY
             It's okay. It's okay. It's just me.
   
   He takes her into his arms, comforting her, as she
   holds on for dear life.
   
   
   EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - MORNING
   
   The early sun casts light upon an otherwise dark and
   joyless morning as the blood stained campus slowly
   comes to life.
   
   
   EXT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING
   
   The local campus security office has been converted
   into a media event. News trucks, cameras and REPORTERS
   stand guard outside while inside...
   
   
   INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING
   
   The place is packed. No longer just a campus security
   office. The place has been converted to the local
   police station as well as FBI headquarters. UNIFORMS
   and SUITS swarm the place.
   
   In a back section of the room, Sheriff Hartley and
   Captain Tyler are in a huge discussion with Dean
   Fisher. Tempers are heated. Its been a sleepless night
   for all.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             We don't know if it's random. We
             haven't been able to connect the
             victims.
   
                       SHERIFF
             The first two were stabbed without
             thought. The sorority girl was
             gutted with autopsy precision.
   
                       DEAN FISHER
             Christ! Just do something. I will
             not have a repeat of Gainesville.
             Not on my campus. .
   
   Dewey listens to this exchange, slowly stepping
   forward.
   
                       DEWEY
             Sidney Prescott, sir.
   
   They both turn to him.
   
                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             She's the connection.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             We know that, son.
   
                       DEWEY
             The killer was trying to get to
             her. That sorority girl was a
             distraction.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             We're aware of that.
   
   Sheriff Hartley steps forward.
   
                       DEWEY
             The killer is obviously repeating
             Woodsboro. I can fill you in on
             what I know.
   
   Dewey is not a welcome participant. Eyes roll. Captain
   Tyler pulls Dewey aside.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Look, son. I know you've lived
             through this, but we got it under
             control. Why don't you have some
             coffee?
   
   Just then, Gale Weathers appears being ushered in by
   TWO UNIFORMS. Dean Fisher greets her with smiles The
   FBI and local police fawn over her.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Thank you, Miss Weathers for coming
             in.
   
                       GALE
             Of course, what can I do?
   
   Captain Tyler gives Dewey a patronizing pat on the
   back, sending him off.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             We were hoping you could help with
             the killer's profile.
   
   Dewey's face couldn't be more burned.
   
   
   INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING - MINUTES LATER
   
   A chalk board in front of them. Three names are written
   on it under the label "Victims" - "MAUREEN EVANS, PHIL
   STEVENS, CICI TAYLOR"
   
   Gale is at the chalk board
   
                       GALE
             Maureen Evans - Maureen Prescott.
             Sidney Prescott's mother. The first
             victim in the Woodsboro Murders.
             Phil Stevens - Stephen Orth - the
             first kid to be murdered. Ten to
             one - Cici is not the third
             victim's real name.
   
                       SHERIFF
             It's Cassandra.
   
                       GALE
             Nickname Cassie or - Casey. The
             third victim in Woodsboro. She was
             hung from a tree and gutted.
   
   The room goes quiet. Dewey watches from the back of the
   room. His eyes burning holes into Gale.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Jesus...
   
                       GALE
             This is a complete copycat. Your
             killer is even going in sequence.
   
   Captain Tyler sits up.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Who was the next victim in
             Woodsboro?
   
                       GALE
             In the book or in the movie?
   
                       DEAN FISHER
             Let's try reality.
   
                       GALE
             Mr. Himbry - the principal was the
             next victim. However, in the movie
             version, Tatum Riley was killed
             next. Dramatic license.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies
             out of his seat and into action.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
                   (to his men)
             Find me every variation of Himbry
             and what was the other name...
   
                       DEWEY
             Tatum Riley.
   
   Dewey speaks up. His voice soft but heard. The entire
   room stares at him, knowingly. Gale's eyes find his. He
   looks away.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Both on campus and the surrounding
             community. I want names ASAP.
   
                       DEAN FISHER
             I'll get you full access.
   
   The room breaks into a fury as they jump into action.
   Gale stops Captain Tyler.
   
                       GALE
             What about Sidney? Is she safe?
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             She's completely insulated. I've
             got my top men on her.

   INT. SIDNEY ' S DORM ROOM - MORNING
   
   Sid, Derek, Hallie, Mickey, and Joel lounge among
   pillows and blankets. The remains of a sleepover. Joel
   parts the blinds.
   
   
   ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW
   
   Two plains clothed policemen are in view, milling about
   outside - standing guard.
   
                       JOEL
             How many guys they have on you?
   
                       MICKEY
             I counted four.
   
   Hallie reads from a notebook in her hand.
   
                       HALLIE
             Okay, you're sure about skipping
             Calculas?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Please, I have the perfect excuse.
   
                       HALLIE
             What about rehearsal?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Gotta.
   
                       HALLIE
             I'll cover you through rehearsal.
             Derek when do you get outta docu-
             drama?
   
                       DEREK
             Two.
   
                       HALLIE
             So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
   
                       DEREK
             And watch her til 8:00 - I've got
             to edit.
   
                       JOEL
             Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio
             and we can grab a bite.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
   
                       HALLIE
             Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take
             her late evening.
   
                       MICKEY
             Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
   
                       HALLIE
             Too bad.
   
                       SIDNEY
             This is exactly what I don't want.
   
                       DEREK
             I think it's out of your control.
   
   Derek puts his arms around her, pulling her close.
   Mickey and Hallie argue about this evening. Joel moves
   out the door.
   
                       JOEL
             Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
   
                       SIDNEY
             But...
   
   Derek kisses her sweetly.
   
                       SIDNEY
             My screwed up life shouldn't have
             to bleed onto my friends.
   
                       DEREK
             Let us decide that.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What about your film? Isn't it due
             next week? Have you even started
             it?
   
                       DEREK
             It's under control.
   
   He kisses her again.

   INT. STUDENT UNION - LATER
   
   A huge one-stop for students. Comprised of several open
   floors, it looks like a mini-mall. A cafeteria, book
   store, movie theatre, arcade, etc. fill the place.
   
   Gale moves through the lobby area when she sees Debbie
   Salt heading her off. She tries to bolt but she's not
   fast enough.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Hi, Gale, any leads?
   
                       GALE
             Tons and tons.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Where is Sidney's father?
   
                       GALE
             Home - where he lives.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             And are the police sure about that?
   
                       GALE
             Why don't you ask them?
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Already did. He's the perfect
             suspect, don't you think?
   
                       GALE
             No, I don't.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Parents are always responsible. It
             all starts in the home.
   
                       GALE
             Look, I know you kinda hold me up
             as your career template and it
             gives you some anal charge to
             challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm
             not interested in the scoop
             anymore. Excuse me.
   
   Gale charges off, moving to a nearby newsstand. The
   tabloid papers exploit what's going on. Crazy headlines
   about the murders dominate the newsrack.
   
   Gale is clearly bothered by this. Just then, a phone
   RINGS. She pulls it from her pocket.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             Hello?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Hello, Gale.
   
   It's the Killer. His voice is unmistakable.
   
                       GALE
             Who is this?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             I'll give you one guess.
   
   Gale knows immediately. She looks around for help. A
   CAMPUS COP is across the lobby.
   
                       GALE
             Who are you?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             That's not the way we play the
             game.
   
                       GALE
             I don't play games.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             What if your life depended on it?
   
   Gale gets testy with him.
   
                       GALE
             What do you want?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             You're pretty when you're angry.
   
   Gale stops cold. She looks around. The place is alive
   with people. He could be anywhere.
   
                       GALE
             Where are you?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             I'm everywhere.
   
   She continues moving to the Campus Cop.
   
                       GALE
             Oh - a God complex
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Stay away from the cop.
   
   A deadly warning. Gale stops. She plays it cool. She
   looks above her to the upper floor. STUDENTS hang over
   a balcony.
   
                       GALE
             What do you want from me?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             It's what you want from me.
   
   Silence.
   
                       GALE
             What do you mean?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             You are writing another book,
             aren't you? That's why you're here.
             The story's not over.
   
                       GALE
             You're getting obvious.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             No, Gale, I'm just getting started.
             Seeya soon.
   
                       GALE
             No, wait...
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Watch your back.
   
   CLICK. The phone goes dead. Gale spins around, doing
   quick circle to make sure no one's around her. She
   turns and heads off, right into...
   
   
   DEWEY
   
   They both GASP.

   INT. CAMPUS THEATRE - DAY
   
   A large tiered theatre. Seats five-hundred. Old but
   preserved and updated. A rehearsal is in progress.
   SEVERAL ACTORS stand stage center running lines as
   stagehands work on the set around them.
   
   Sidney is one of them. She moves around the stage, very
   animated. More alive than ever. She dons a Russian
   accent. Convincing. A promising actress.
   
                       SIDNEY
                   (in character)
             "Pain, yah, such pain. Pain."
   
   An awkward silence. Everyone looks at each other.
   Finally, Lois, the bitchy sorority girl speaks up.
   
                       LOIS
             That's not the line. You jumped.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Shit. Did I?
   
                       LOIS
             About a page.
   
                       DIRECTOR
                   (off stage)
             CUT! Let's take five.
   
   The actors break up as Sidney, frustrated, walks across
   a make shift bridge that takes her across the orchestra
   pit and down the stairs into the house where Hallie
   sits watching. Sid's bodyguards can be seen sitting
   scattered about.
   
                       HALLIE
             That was good.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Yeah, right.
   
   The DIRECTOR, mid-30's, intelligent, friendly.
   
                       DIRECTOR
             Sid, why don't you get outta here?
             We'll pick this up tomorrow.
   
   Sid nods in agreement. The Director smiles at her.
   
                       DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
             Work on the accent.
   
   She grabs her things and heads off with Hallie when...
   
                       VOICE
             Sid?
   
   Sid turns to find Randy moving through an aisle. He had
   been watching rehearsal. Sid's face tenses.
   
                       HALLIE
             Who is that guy?
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet
             you outside.
   
                       HALLIE
             No, girletta, I don't leave your
             side.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I've got my entourage. Take a
             break. Please.
   
   Sid is definite. Hallie backs off, heading up the
   aisle, against her better wishes.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What do you want?
   
                       RANDY
             I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never
             should have gone along with Gale. I
             know I'm stupid. I wish I had some
             good reason to give you but I'm
             just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be
             mad at me.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Do you work for her now?
   
                       RANDY
             Well, yeah... she gave me a job.
             Freelance. It got me outta
             Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton
             and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I
             knew it was a bad idea but it
             seemed like a quasi harmless bad
             idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up.
   
   Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly
   appearing.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Me, too. Randy. Me too.
   
   He nods, knowingly.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Wanna get outta here?

                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking
             I'd pull Jesse off...
   
                       GALE
             I'd prefer Dewey, Captain.
   
   Tyler doesn't argue. He's too crazed. Dewey avoids
   Gale's stare.

                       HALLIE
             I didn't say she was alone. That
             guy - from her home town showed up.
             They went off together.
   
   Hallie plops down, giving Mickey a big kiss.
   
                       MICKEY
             I've been waiting for you, baby.
   
                       JOEL
             Is that cool? Just to leave her
             like that?
   
                       HALLIE
             She's got guards with her.
   
                       DEREK
             What guy?
   
                       HALLIE
             Randy somebody.
   
                       JOEL
             Randy Meeks. He was with Sid that
             night in Woodsboro.
   
                       MICKEY
             Her old boyfriend?
   
                       JOEL
             No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy
             was a friend.
   
                       MICKEY
             Watch out, Derek.
   
                       HALLIE
             He tried to kill her first.
   
                       MICKEY
             Is Sid in therapy?
   
                       JOEL
             She was for a while. Gave it up.
   
                       DEREK
             How do you know so much about her?
   
                       JOEL
             I read the book.
   
                       MICKEY
             I could use some therapy.
   
                       DEREK
             Should we be worried about this
             guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just
             showed up and now people are dying?
   
                       HALLIE
             He seemed harmless.
   
                       DEREK
             Aren't most serial killers
             seemingly harmless?
   
                       JOEL
             And white.
   
                       MICKEY
             Easy black boy.
   
                       JOEL
             It's documented. Most serial
             killers are attractive - slightly
             off white males in their twenties.
   
                       HALLIE
             That's you, honey.
   
   Hallie kisses Mickey again.
   
                       MICKEY
             I got a surprise for you.
   
                       HALLIE
             What?
   
   Suddenly, he leaps up on the cafeteria table and begins
   to sing at the top of his lungs.
   
                       MICKEY
             "If I should stay. I would only be
             in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I
             know, I'll think of you each step
             of the way...
   
                       HALLIE
             Don't do this.
   
                       MICKEY
             "And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always
             love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will
             always love you."
   
   Everyone has taken notice. They begin to cheer and sing
   with him.
   
                       JOEL
                   (to Derek)
             Whitney?
   
                       DEREK
             I think he's doing Dolly.
   
                       MICKEY
             "And I hope life treats you kind
             and I hope you have all you dreamed
             of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
   
                       DEREK
             Definitely Whitney.
   
   Hallie can't help but be touched. He finishes up,
   ending on a last, final note. As he does, he pulls a
   necklace from around his neck. His Greek letters dangle
   from it. He places them around her neck, kissing her.
   
                       JOEL
             Isn't that a big no-no?
   
                       DEREK
             I think so.
   
   Hallie breaks away. She swats him.
   
                       HALLIE
             You're going to get it. You know
             what happens.
   
                       MICKEY
             But I love you. And I want the
             whole world to know it.
   
   Hallie smiles, her eyes misty. Derek and Joel eye each
   other.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. CINEPLEX MOVIE THEATRE - LITTLE LATER
   
   Sid and Randy continue watching the movie. The guards
   behind them are way engrossed.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   It's the end of the movie. Tori Spelling is running for
   her life from two killers - Johnny Depp and his
   sidekick. She finds herself trapped in the kitchen.
   Johnny Depp holds the knife up to Tori's face.
   
                       TORI
             Why did you kill my mother?
   
                       JOHNNY
             Because she was sleeping with my
             dad. She's the reason my mom left.
             She was a whore just like you.
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   These words sting Sid. Randy notices her flinching.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
                       TORI
             My mom was no whore. Don't you say
             that.
   
                       JOHHNY
             Whore! Whore! Whore! Whore!
   
   Tori starts to cry.
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   Tears find their way down Sidney's cheeks.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   Johnny Depp and his murderous sidekick start stabbing
   each other.
   
                       JOHNNY (CONT'D)
             It's the perfect alibi, Sidney.
   
                       SIDEKICK
             Just like in the movies.
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   Sidney can't take it anymore. She gets up and races out
   of the theatre.
   
   
   INT. LOBBY - A SECOND LATER
   
   Sid emerges from the theatre and into the lobby. She
   moves into a curtained section where the water fountain
   is. She looks up and sees Randy flying out of the
   theatre. He exits outside looking for her. The cops are
   right behind him.
   
                       VOICE
             Hello Sidney.
   
   Sidney spins around. Cotton Weary stands before her.
   shoulders slumped, his face pained.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Cotton.
   
                       COTTON
             Can we talk?
   
                       SIDNEY
             I don't think that's a good idea.
   
                       COTTON
             Look, yesterday wasn't my idea.
             That was all Gale and dollar signs
             and ratings.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What do you want from me, Cotton?
   
                       COTTON
             You could start with an apology.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I did that.
   
                       COTTON
             You wrote me a letter. Very
             cordial. Very appropriate.
   
                       SIDNEY
             How? What could I say that would
             make a difference? I took away a
             year of your life - how do I
             apologize for that?
   
                       COTTON
             I wish it was just a year. I lost
             everything because of you. I have
             nothing now. Look at me, this is
             what I've become.
   
   A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Cotton, there isn't one day, one
             hour, one minute when I'm not
             reminded of what I've done. I have
             not had one second of reprieve and
             no therapy or religion or spiritual
             plane can ever erase what I feel in
             every vein of my being. And I wish
             I had in me what you need to hear
             but I don't think the words exist.
   
   More silence.
   
                       COTTON
             I just thought if I saw you face to
             face, maybe it would help.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Did it?
   
                       COTTON
             It helped me realize one thing.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What?
   
                       COTTON
             You're a self-obsessed little cunt
             like your mother.
   
   And with that, Cotton flips on a dime. His face turns
   evil. Sidney races by him as he throws out his arm,
   stopping her just as...
   
   
   THE TWO POLICE GUARDS
   
   Appear, grabbing him from behind. They throw him
   against the wall, retaining him. Randy appears at Sid's
   side.
   
                       RANDY
             You okay?
   
   Sid nods as she watches the officers arrest him. They
   do a body search, pulling from his coat a large
   revolver. Cotton just smiles.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - LATER
   
   Sid and Randy walk up the steps to the school library.
   The ever helping guards behind them.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I don't know. I don't think Cotton
             did it. It's too predictable.
   
                       RANDY
             If he's innocent he'll have an
             alibi.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I guess Gale's going to be pissed
             she missed her exclusive.
   
                       RANDY
             I'll relay it. You sure you don't
             wanna go home?
   
                       SIDNEY
             I have this button I press. See? It
             insulates me.
   
   She mimes an air lock valve.
   
                       RANDY
             I gotta coupla of those buttons
             myself.
   
   There's something sad about this exchange. These two
   people understand each other
   
                       SIDNEY
             Thanks for the movie, Randy.
   
                       RANDY
             Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just
             had that been there done that
             feeling.
   
   Sidney watches as Randy shoves off, disappearing across
   campus. Sid turns to find Derek leaning against a pole.
   
                       DEREK
             I had the four o'clock shift. You
             weren't there. You had us worried.
             Is everything okay?
   
                       SIDNEY
             No, it's not.
   
                       DEREK
             I don't really know what happened
             in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you
             don't trust me.
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's not you, Derek. I don't trust
             myself. I tend to make big
             selection errors when it comes to
             men.
   
                       DEREK
             Then I'll make this easy for you. I
             like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid.
             But I'm gonna stay away. Until you
             say otherwise.
   
   A long moment. He looks at her, hoping she'll say
   otherwise.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'm sorry, Derek.
   
   Derek nods. So that's how it's going to be. He turns
   and wanders off, not looking back once.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. NEWSVAN - CAMPUS - LATER
   
   The newsvan is parked at a curb. It sits out of the way
   overlooking the student commons area. A grassy area
   where students sit and conjugate.
   
   Gale walks back and forth with the cellular attached to
   her ear. Dewey sits leans against the van, watching
   her. He still has a crush but hides it as best he can.
   
                       GALE
                   (on phone)
             The interview's not going to
             happen. 1 changed my mind. I've
             harassed the girl enough. It's in
             poor taste and a bad idea.
   
                       FROM THE PHONE
             Your entire career is in poor
             taste...
   
                       GALE
             Gotta go, call me when you have
             something nice to say.
   
   Gale hangs up, she looks to Dewey. Smiles.
   
                       DEWEY
             So what made you change your mind
             about Sidney?
   
                       GALE
             Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
   
                       DEWEY
             You're a hard one to figure out.
   
                       GALE
             It's that complex yet shallow
             quality. It's deliberate.
   
                       DEWEY
             I think you're all an act.
   
                       GALE
             And deep down I'm a good person?
             Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
   
                       DEWEY
             I know that.
   
                       GALE
             Yeah?
   
                       DEWEY
             I also know that you're an aging TV
             reporter slash writer who, despite
             huge tabloid success, has some self
             worth issues regarding your
             personal life which directly
             effects your professional life in a
             non-positive manner. A coupla
             failed relationships with - I'm
             guessing balding, older men - have
             turned you into this bitch with a
             cell phone. But I bet sometimes,
             late at night, when you're all
             alone a sadness seeps to the
             surface and in a moment of clarity
             you know that all you really want
             is to be touched and held and
             fondled.
   
   Gale stares at him, stunned. A moment as the tension
   swirls about them.
   
                       GALE
             And where did you gain all of your
             Gale Weather's insight?
   
   Dewey approaches her. Gale has never been more taken
   with him. They stand incredibly close.
   
                       DEWEY
             After my spinal cord was damaged I
             was laid up for over a year. A lot
             can happen when you're on your
             back.
   
   They're nearly touching now. Just then, Randy
   approaches.
   
                       RANDY
             What'd I miss?
   
   Gale backs away from Dewey, breathless. Her cellular
   phone RINGS. She eyes Dewey, then hands it to Randy.
   
                       GALE
             I'm not here.
   
   Randy takes the phone.
   
                       RANDY
             Hello?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Gale?
   
                       RANDY
             She's not here right now.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             But she's standing right next to
             you.
   
   Shit! Randy motions to Gale and Dewey. It's him. He
   points around campus, mouthing "He's watching." Gale
   grabs Dewey.
   
                       GALE
             C'mon.
                   (to Randy)
             Keep him talking.
   
   Gale and Dewey race off, across the grassy area where
   STUDENTS come and go.
   
   
   ON RANDY
   
   He holds the phone, scared, not knowing what to say?
   
                       RANDY
             So... what's your favorite scary
             movie? No response. Silence.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             They'll never find me.
   
   Randy eyes Dewey and Gale, they move through Students,
   searching.
   
                       RANDY
             What do you care? Let 'em have
             their fun. So, what's up?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             What's your favorite scary movie?
   
                       RANDY
             SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening.
             What's yours? Wait, let me guess.
             THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL
             EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT
             DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY?
             Am I close?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Closer than you think.
   
   
   ON DEWEY AND GALE
   
   They move through passing STUDENTS.
   
                       GALE
             He has to be nearby. He likes the
             game.
   
   Dewey is on the his walkie. "I need back-up." He has a
   hard time keeping up with Gale. He hobbles along.
   
   
   BACK ON RANDY
   
   He goes on a tirade pacing back and forth.
   
                       RANDY
             So what's your deal? Can we talk
             openly for a second? How does one
             become a serial killer? Huh? Are
             you psychopathic or merely
             psychotic? And what is the
             distinguishing feature'? Were you
             slapped around as a child? Is it
             hereditary? Did your Mom take test
             drugs? You know, have you tried
             getting laid? It's done wonders for
             my homicidal tendencies.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Do you want to die?
   
                       RANDY
             Gee, let me think. "Do you want
             to... " Is that the best you can
             do? Some tired hand me down rehash?
             Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a
             book about you. No movie rights.
             Nothing. I've been through this
             before and much better I might add.
   
   
   ON GALE AND DEWEY
   
   Gale spots a YOUNG MAN, sitting with some other KIDS.
   He's talking on a cellular phone. She races to him and
   rips it from his hands. He leaps up ready to pounce on
   her.
   
   Dewey appears.
   
                       DEWEY
             It's okay. C'mon, Gale.
   
   
   BACK ON RANDY
   
   Randy won't let up. He continues dissing.
   
                       RANDY
             And if you're such a brilliant
             smart killer - why copycat? Why not
             be original? Where's the
             innovation? Let's pioneer some new
             ground. Make a statement. Go down
             in history. Now you'll always be
             the Woodsboro copycat killer.
             That's lame. It's like a bad
             sequel. And why Woodsboro? What
             about Manson, Bundy, Son of Sam?
             Why imitate two high school loser-
             ass dickheads - 1 knew the guys.
             Stu was a wussy ass wet rag and
             Billy - jesus - what a rat-looking
             homo-repressed, mama's boy.
   
   Suddenly the newsvan door RIPS OPEN, a GHOST MASKED
   FIGURE lunges out grabbing Randy by the neck. The move
   is quick and precise. A hard yank and Randy is wrenched
   back into the newsvan. The door SLAMS shut.
   
   
   ON DEWEY AND GALE
   
   As they run back to the newsvan. SIRENS are heard in
   the distant. Gale races up to find Randy nowhere.
   
                       GALE
             Randy? Randy? Where did he go?
   
   Dewey circles the van as Gale moves to the sliding side
   door. She tears it open as...
   
   RANDY'S BODY FALLS OUT. Blood everywhere. His throat
   slit.
   
   Gale's SCREAM is heard all over campus.
   
                                               CUT TO:

   Yellow tape has been placed around the newsvan. People
   have gathered as Randy's body is taken out on a
   stretcher.
   
   Captain Tyler and Sheriff Hartley share frustrated
   faces.
   
                       SHERIFF
             He's broken his pattern.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             They've broken their pattern.
   
                       SHERIFF
             You're sure about this two person
             thing?
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Broad daylight, a crowded movie
             theatre. This is too much fun for
             one person.
   
   Different UNIFORMS whirl by.
   
                       SHERIFF
             I would say we are now officially
             baffled.

   Sheriff Hartley looks up as REPORTERS flock them,
   surrounding them in questions.

   INT. LIBRARY - RESEARCH COMPUTER ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
   
   A room of the library sectioned off exclusively for
   computer use. It consists of thirty to forty cubicles
   that house computer terminals. Every cubicle is full.
   The place is packed.
   
   Sid sits at a terminal busy at work. Her two police
   guards wander up and down the cubicles keeping an eye
   out.
   
   
   CLOSE ON SIDNEY
   
   Her face appears concentrated, focused. She scans the
   computer screen in front of her.
   
   
   ON THE MONITOR
   
   Sid is typing feverishly. Suddenly, her screen starts
   flashing and BEEPING, freezing her words.
   
   
   ON SIDNEY
   
   Confused, she tries to make it stop but it won't. She
   leans back, turning to the GUY next to her. A handsome
   young man.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Excuse me? Did your computer just
             freeze?
   
   The guy leans over and takes a look at Sid's monitor.
   
                       GUY (CONT'D)
             You have an instant message, that's
             all. Just hit ALT M.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'm not signed on.
   
                       GUY
             Someone here in the room. All the
             terminals are connected.
   
   The guy returns to his own computer. Sidney eyes the
   screen suspiciously. She hits ALT + M. A message pops
   up on the screen.
   
   "YOU'RE GOING TO DIE TONIGHT."
   
   Sidney freaks. A muffled CRY. She shoots up, looking
   about the crowded room. He could be anywhere. The two
   guards take notice, rushing over to her.
   
                       SIDNEY
             He's here. He's in the room right
             now.
   
   She points to the screen. The men instantly break up
   and cover the room. They start pulling people from
   their terminals to check their screens.
   
   Sidney backs away from her screen, her terror growing.
   
   Suddenly, it starts flashing and BEEPING again. She
   looks around. She slowly moves toward it, drawn
   uncontrollably. She hits ALT + M. Another message pops
   up:
   
   "THE POLICE CAN'T SAVE YOU."
   
   
   CLOSE ON SIDNEY'S FACE
   
   It's stone pale. She takes a deep breath and begins to
   type.
   
   
   ON THE MONITOR
   
   The words "FUCK YOU" appear. Sid hits "SEND".

   Captain Tyler and Sheriff Hartley are drilling a very
   subdued and cool Cotton.
   
                       COTTON
             What better alibi could I have? I
             was here in custody.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Maybe you don't work alone.
   
                       COTTON
             Yeah, that's it.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Why did you attack Sidney Prescott?
   
                       COTTON
             There was no attack, we were
             talking. Very heatedly. Miss
             Prescott and I have a very
             complicated past. That's no crime.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             And the gun?
   
                       COTTON
             I have a permit. It's registered. I
             have a legal right to carry it.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Why do you need a gun?
   
                       COTTON
             Gentlemen, your growing hysteria is
             not reason enough to hold me here.
             I've been down this road before.
             And unless you're going to charge
             me with a crime I'd like to walk
             outta here. I have an interview at
             6:00.

   Gale sits at a table. Dewey approaches. He places a
   hand on her shoulder. They're both at a loss.
   
                       GALE
             Where's Sidney'?
   
                       DEWEY
             She's safe.
   
   Silence.
   
                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             How you doin?
   
                       GALE
             Not good. How you doin?
   
                       DEWEY
             Not good.
   
   Just then, the Sheriff and Captain emerge from their
   office. Cotton is escorted out behind them. Gale moves
   to him.
   
                       DEWEY
             Can't we hold him?
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             No, we got pressure from California
             State. The man practically has
             clemency. We can't run the risk of
             falsely accusing him. He has to be
             standing over the victim with knife
             in hand before we make a move.
   
                       DEWEY

   He stands at a counter, signing forms. Gale approaches.
   
                       GALE
             What's going on, Cotton?
   
                       COTTON
             You know the story, Gale. Man
             falsely accused, sent to prison,
             proved innocent, released back into
             the real world and never trusted
             again. Want the exclusive?
   
                       GALE
             Did you do it?
   
   She looks him dead in the eyes.
   
                       COTTON
             Now, Gale, you were so instrumental
             in my freedom. You're not having
             character doubts now, are you?
   
                       GALE
             You have a right to be angry.
   
                       COTTON
             No, Gale, I don't have any rights.
             You made sure of that.
   
                       GALE
             Cotton, I've done nothing but help
             you.
   
                       COTTON
             You've done nothing but get rich
             off of me. How many books have you
             sold, Gale? You think I don't
             understand points and royalties and
             ancilliary rights?
   
   Just then, the OFFICER behind the counter brings him
   his gun in a plastic bag. Cotton takes it out and
   checks it over. Gale is surprised to see the gun.
   
                       GALE
             Don't do anything stupid, Cotton.
             You've come to far.
   
                       COTTON
             Gale, I don't know what I'm doing
             from one moment to the next. I'm
             just taking it as it comes.
   
   Cotton pockets the gun and heads out. Gale rejoins
   Dewey and the others.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Night's coming. I think its time to
             beef up security on the Prescott
             girl.
   
                       GALE
             Where is she?
   
                       SHERIFF
             She was just escorted to her dorm
             room.
   
                       DEWEY
             Is she safe there?
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             We're going to bring her in. Hide
             her out for a coupla days. And
             we're issuing a campus lock-in this
             evening. No one is allowed out
             after dark.
   
                       DEWEY
             That doesn't work, sir.
   
                       GALE

   Music peels paint as YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENTS rock to
   deafening tunes. A row of kegs line one wall as a the
   party gears up for a drunken night ahead.
   
   Derek is seen with his video camera. He's filming Lois
   and Murphy. They talk into the camera. Both tipsy
   chatty.
   
                       LOIS
             It's all about sisterhood.

             Thanks, ladies.
   
   They take off to the kegs.

             Are they aware of your not so
             positive portrayal of Greek life?

             You freakin?
   
   Derek shrugs. He's clearly upset by it when from out of
   nowhere, SEVERAL FRAT BOYS appear, picking Mickey up,
   lifting him over their heads. Everyone starts CHEERING
   and CLAPPING.
   
                       FRATERNITY JOCK
             He lavaliered. He's dead.
   
   They carry him around the room, CHANTING. The frat boys
   abduct Mickey, taking him up the stairs and out sight.
   Others lookie loo's follow. Derek grabs his camera and

             I enjoyed its clever execution...
   
                       HALLIE
             We're missing the Sig Ep party.
   
                       SIDNEY
             No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties
             and mass murderers don't go
             together. Trust me.
   
                       HALLIE
             No, no, I hadn't planned on going,
             it's just Mickey will be pissed.
   
   Hallie clearly wishes she were there.
   
                       SISKEL
                   (from TV)
             It was just an excuse to kill
             young, big breasted girls. I didn't
             like it.
   
   They're reviewing STAB. Hallie switches channels.
   There's a KNOCK on the door. Sid answers - it's Dewey
   and Gale. From the look on their faces...
   
                       SIDNEY
             Someone else has been killed.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - BACK YARD- LITTLE LATER
   
   SPLAT! Gobs of gooey food goes flying through the air
   exploding perfectly all over...
   
   
   MICKEY
   
   Who stands buck naked, tied... chained to a tree in the
   back yard. The yard is crowded with FRAT BOYS and
   SORORITY GIRLS who delight in torching him. Mounds of
   syrup, eggs, and other wet and slimy food is plunged
   upon him.
   
                       FRATERNITY JOCK
             Who do you love?
   
                       MICKEY
             Hallie.
   
                       FRATERNITY JOCK
             Did you say "My TKE brothers"?
   
                       MICKEY
             No, I said Hallie.
   
   More food and slime come barreling at him. A drunk Lois
   and Murphy pull the police tape down from the previous
   night's crime scene and begin to Mayflower him. The
   crowd goes crazy.
   
   
   INT. SIDNEY'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
   
   Hallie consoles Sidney. Dewey and Gale nearby. Sidney
   is a stone rock. It's frightening to watch her hold it
   together.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'm fine. I wish people would stop
             treating me like glass. I'm not
             gonna break.
   
                       HALLIE
             It's okay to break, girl. You
             shatter if you have to.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'd really just like to be alone.
   
                       DEWEY
             The police are waiting outside.
             They're going to take you somewhere
             safe.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Dewey, there's no such place.
   
                       DEWEY
             Humor me, Sid.
   
   Sidney starts packing an overnight bag.
   
                       HALLIE
             Can I come with her?
   
                       SIDNEY
             No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you
             down too. I'll be alright.
   
                       GALE
             Sid, I'll come with you.
   
                       SIDNEY
             But who would operate your camera?
   
   A burn. It comes out of nowhere. Gale goes silent. A
   KNOCK at the door. Dewey opens to find a Police guard
   standing with Joel.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             He's cool, Remy.
   
   Joel is ushered in. He says his hello's, moving to
   Hallie. Gale and Dewey move out into the hall with the
   guards. Sid continues to pack. Her face rigid.
   
                       JOEL
             They got Mickey. He's being toasted
             at the Deltas.
   
                       HALLIE
             I knew it. Shit! I gotta get over
             there.
   
                       JOEL
             We're under quarantine.
   
   He points to Dewey who talks to Gale in the hallway.
   
                       HALLIE
             I'm the only one who can cut him
             down.
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's not a good idea, Hallie.
   
                       JOEL
             I'll go with her.
   
                       HALLIE
             Be safe, girl.
   
   She gives Sidney a hug before she can object, then she
   and Joel race out into the hallway as Dewey sticks his
   head in.
   
                       DEWEY
             Sid, you should get going.
   
   He looks at Joel and Hallie.
   
                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             Where are you two headed?
   
                       JOEL
                   (instant cover)
             Hallie forgot her footage at the
             film dept. I'm gonna walk her over
             before it's gets too late
   
                       DEWEY
             You really...
   
                       HALLIE
             I gotta have it, Dewey.
   
   Gale steps in.
   
                       GALE
             Hey, Dewey?
   
                       HALLIE
             Seeya, Dewey.
   
   Hallie and Joel race outta there before any more
   objections. Dewey turns to Gale.
   
                       GALE
             If you were truly a copycat,
             wouldn't you want to emulate
             everything about the killer that
             you could?
   
                       DEWEY
             Meaning?
   
                       GALE
             He's already gotta be a part of
             Sid's life. What do you know about
             this Derek?
   
                       DEWEY
             Solid alibis. He was with Sidney
             when she was attacked.
   
                       GALE
             Billy had alibis too.
   
   Dewey turns to Sid who now stands ready in the doorway.
   
                       DEWEY
             Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll
             find you later, okay.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Whatever.
   
   Sidney's exterior keeps hardening.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - BACK YARD- LITTLE LATER
   
   Mickey is still tied to the tree. He's so completely
   covered in hardened gook it looks like he's wearing
   clothes. The last of the crowd has left. They've gone
   back to the party. He stands shivering in the cold.
   
   He checks the chain that holds him secure. It's
   composed of several bike locks and steel twine. He's
   not going anywhere.
   
   BUMP! He hears a noise. He looks to the nearby shrubs
   and beyond. Nothing. Just a noise of the night.
   
                       MICKEY
                   (whispering)
             Come on, Hallie, baby...
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. DEREK'S DORM ROOM - LATER
   
   A dark room. A slight disturbance at the door and it
   comes popping open. Light from the hall floods the room
   as Dewey and Gale slip in and close the door behind
   them.
   
                       GALE
                   (checking door)
             You broke the lock.
   
                       DEWEY
             You broke my heart.
   
                       GALE
             What are we looking for?
   
                       DEWEY
             A bloody knife. A ghost mask.
             Something like that?
   
                       GALE
             Can we turn the light on?
   
                       DEWEY
             That's not the way it's done.
   
   Dewey pulls out his flashlight and begins to search the
   room. He sifts through drawers and a closet.
   
                       DEWEY
             And it's sexier in the dark.
   
                       GALE
             Dewey, you and I would never make
             it.
   
                       DEWEY
             Maybe not. But think about the sex.
             As frustrated as I am...
   
                       GALE
             ... and as lonely as I am...
   
                       DEWEY
             We'd break some furniture.
   
   Gale LAUGHS at this. She reaches over and pats his
   buttock.
   
                       GALE
             Tell you what. We get through this
             one. And we'll take out a hotel
             room. Over here with the light.
   
   Dewey points the light to a framed picture. It's of
   Joel and Derek - a buddy pose. She sifts through some
   text books on the desk.
   
                       DEWEY
             They're roomates.
   
                       GALE
             And Joel's pre-med.
   
                       DEWEY
             The sorority girl was gutted with
             autopsy precision.
   
                       GALE
             Shit! It's both of them. The first
             murders were to throw us - using
             the same names as Woodsboro. But
             they've moved on - they're getting
             closer to Sidney. They're not
             looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to
             kill. They're looking for the new
             Tatum.
   
                       DEWEY
             Hallie?
   
   A moment. Then in a splash, they're outta there.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MINUTES LATER
   
   A squad car makes it's way down the quiet campus
   street.
   
   
   INT. SQUAD CAR - SAME
   
   Sidney sits in the backseat. The two police officers
   ride in front.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Where are you taking me?
   
                       POLICE GUARD #1
             Actually, I don't know.
   
                       POLICE GUARD #2
             We're meeting another car that will
             transport you the rest of the way.
   
                       POLICE GUARD #1
             Safety precautions.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I feel like Eddie Murphy.
   
   The car comes to a halt in front of a stop light.
   
                       POLICE GUARD #1
             We feel like Kevin Costner.
   
   Sidney smiles at this just as the car door rips open on
   the passenger's side. Two hands reach in and yank
   Police Guard #2 from the car. He starts to CRY OUT but
   it's cut short.
   
   Sid SCREAMS as the Police Guard behind the wheel
   struggles with his seat belt. He looks up to see a
   Ghost Masked Figure move around the side of the car
   towards his door. He reaches for his gun but it's too
   late. The Ghost has the door open.
   
   A flash of silver and the Police Guard's throat is
   slit.
   
   
   IN THE BACK SEAT
   
   Sidney SCREAMS and SCREAMS, BEATING on the door of the
   car. It won't open. She's trapped like a caged animal.
   
   
   IN THE FRONT SEAT
   
   The Ghost pulls the Police Guard from the car, then
   gets in, behind the driver's seat. The Ghost puts the
   car in drive and takes off down the road.
   
   Sidney looks behind her as the guard's dead bodies lay
   sprawled in the middle of the road. She turns to the
   door, BEATING and CLAWING at it. She leans back, manic,
   and KICKS at the window with her feet. No use.
   
   
   EXT. CAMPUS DRIVE - SAME
   
   The car makes its way down the deserted street
   
   
   IN THE BACKSEAT
   
   Sidney is beyond frantic. She eyes the Ghost through
   the gate. She turns and twists looking for an escape.
   Through the window, she sees approaching headlights.
   She SCREAMS through the closed window as a car passes
   by.
   
   Sidney takes notice as the car turns onto another
   campus street. Big, stone school buildings line each
   side of a thin, road.
   
   She eyes the Ghost through the rearview window. The
   white masks turns as hidden eyes bore through her. The
   Ghost hits the gas, picking up speed.
   
   Sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her.
   She rips it open, rustling through it frantically. She
   pulls books, pencils, paper... Sid grabs a long, yellow
   No.2 pencil. She grips it hard, looking to the metal
   grate just behind the driver's seat. The Ghost's neck
   is right up against it.
   
   Sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the
   Ghost's head, ready to attack.
   
   Without pause, Sid RAMS the pencil through the grate,
   into the Ghost's neck. It lodges there as the Ghost
   falls forward in pain, losing control of the wheel for
   a moment.
   
   The car jumps the curb and SLAMS against a building.
   The Ghost yanks the wheel, over correcting. He tries to
   bring it back to the road but doesn't see the lamp post
   that stands directly in the car's path.
   
   The Squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post,
   SLAMMING into it, bringing the car to a CRASHING HALT,
   lodging it agaisnt the building's stone exterior.
   
   Smoke rises from a bashed engine as it emits a fatal
   rumbling.
   
   
   INSIDE THE CAR
   
   All is still. In the backseat, Sidney rises from the
   floorboards. She looks up to see the Ghost Masked
   figure slumped over the steering wheel. Out.
   
   Sid quickly pulls herself together, looking about,
   sizing up her options. She tugs on the door handle. It
   won't budge. She looks to the passenger's side of the
   car. It's flush against the building.
   
   Then she notices the metal grate. The edge has been
   pried apart in the crash. Sidney reaches for it,
   pulling on it, bending it backwards...
   
   CREAK!
   
   Sid tries to stifle the noise it makes, all the while
   eyeing the Ghost who remains unconscious. She creates
   an opening large enough for her to crawl through. She
   lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the...
   
   
   FRONT SEAT
   
   Sid falls down into the seat, her eyes never leaving
   the Ghost. She lay crumpled up against the smashed
   passenger's door, the only sound is her own TERRIFIED
   BREATHING. She watches the Ghost Masked Figure. His
   body doesn't move. She contemplates her next move.
   
   The only way out is through the driver's door.
   
   After what seems an eternity, she slowly reaches over
   with her foot and nudges the Ghost. No movement.
   Nothing.
   
   She slides across the seat towards the Ghost, moving to
   his side. She reaches with her hand and pushes on the
   Ghost's shoulder. His body moves, slumping back against
   the back of the seat. It clears space for her to pass
   through.
   
   She sits up on her feet, facing the Ghost. With her
   leg, she reaches over him, straddling him. She leans
   against the steering wheel, her arm quickly reaching
   for the door knob.
   
   HONK!
   
   Her back brushes against the horn. Sid TENSES, her face
   a little more than a foot from the Ghost Mask. He
   doesn't move. He's completely out cold. Sid pushes the
   car door open and starts to slide completely over the
   Ghost when she stops.
   
   She looks to the Ghost.
   
   
   CLOSE ON HER FACE
   
   As she fights with a decision. Then, with a fierce
   determination, Sid reaches for the Ghost Mask. She
   finds the edge and begins to peels the Mask away
   when...
   
   
   THE GHOST COMES TO LIFE
   
   Lunging forward. Sidney SCREAMS, leaping, falling out
   the car door.
   
   
   OUTSIDE THE CAR
   
   BAM!
   
   Sid hits the pavement hard. She lifts herself up when
   her entire body is YANKED VIOLENTLY BACKWARDS.
   
   The Ghost has hold of her foot, pulling her back into
   the car. Sidney KICKS and WRITHES breaking free. She
   hops to her feet as the Ghost emerges from the car.
   Sidney SLAMS the car door shut. It catches the Ghost,
   knocking him backwards.
   
   Sid tears off, down the street, running, burning up the
   pavement.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. FILM SCHOOL - MINUTES LATER
   
   The film school sits in the still darkness.
   
   
   INT. HALLWAY - SAME
   
   Dewey and Gale move down a dark and shadowed hallway.
   THUMP! They stop cold.
   
                       GALE
             Ssshh! What was that?
   
                       DEWEY
             Let's find out.
   
   Dewey keeps moving.
   
                       GALE
             This is all too familiar.
   
                       DEWEY
             Over here.
   
   Dewey has lead her to a door marked "LECTURE HALL".
   
   
   INT. LECTURE HALL - SAME
   
   The same room seen earlier. A large, rounded room with
   three levels of seats that shoot straight up to the
   ceiling. A podium stands center. Video monitors hang
   from the ceiling in different places around the room.
   
   Dewey and Gale enter. If not for the red EXIT SIGNS
   that hang over the exit doors, the room would be
   completely dark.
   
   They move down the first level of chairs to the
   lecturn.
   
                       GALE
             Maybe they never got here. He could
             have taken her anywhere.
   
                       DEWEY
             C'mon. Let's go.
   
   CLICK! STATIC! A noise from above takes their
   attention. They looks up as a video monitor comes to
   life. Images appear.
   
   
   CLOSE ON MONITOR
   
   Home-made video footage fills the screen. A movie
   theatre, people standing in line. The home camera ZOOMS
   in to a YOUNG COUPLE. Maureen and Phil come into view.
   
   
   ON DEWEY AND GALE
   
   Gale watches the screen as Dewey looks around the room,
   searching for it's source.
   
   CLICK! Another monitor comes to life. More home shot
   video footage. This time of a big house. A closer look
   reveals it to be the Chi Omega Sorority House. A young
   girl stands on the front porch talking on a portable
   phone. It's Cici.
   
   
   ON GALE AND DEWEY
   
                       GALE
             Jesus Christ!
   
                       DEWEY
             He filmed his victims.
   
   CLICK! ANOTHER MONITOR TURNS ON.
   
   It's Randy standing outside the newsvan with the
   cellular phone to his ear.
   
   CLICK! Another monitor turns on. It's of a man and
   woman back to the camera. The couple move in frame. It
   becomes apparent quick. It's Gale and Dewey. As they
   stand in the room - live. They're being taped.
   
   
   CLOSE ON DEWEY AND GALE
   
                       GALE
             Shit!
   
   Dewey spins around. He reaches for the gun he no longer
   carries.
   
                       DEWEY
             Dammit!
   
   He looks around the room, up to the two levels above
   them. He spots a small light on the second level. He
   squints his eyes and sees a FIGURE standing behind it.
   
                       GALE
             Let's go.
   
                       DEWEY
             No, wait here.
   
   Dewey hands her his flashlight and takes off for the
   stair rise that leads to the upper level.
   
                       GALE
             No, Dewey, let's call for backup.
   
   But Dewey is gone, leaving Gale alone. She turns to the
   monitor to see her face in fear-stricken CLOSEUP.
   
   
   ON THE UPPER LEVEL
   
   Dewey moves fast, limping his way to the level's edge.
   He approaches the railing and makes his way around to
   the shining light.
   
   He reaches it, finding nothing but a camera and tripod.
   It sits alone against the railing. Dewey surveys the
   second level. Empty seats everywhere. Completely bare.
   
   Dewey looks down to the main floor... to Gale who looks
   up to him.
   
                       GALE
             Dewey?
   
                       DEWEY
             There's nothing. I'm coming down.
   
   Dewey turns to leave, his eye catching a monitor that
   hangs level with the railing. On the monitor, Gale is
   in frame, looking up at Dewey, her face fear stained.
   She takes a step forward, moving out of frame,
   revealing
   
   
   THE GHOST
   
   Who stands right behind her. Dewey looks down to see
   the Ghost standing directly behind Gale.
   
                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             Watch out!
   
   
   DOWN BELOW
   
   Gale turns just in time to see the gleam of a killer's
   knife as it darts out of the darkness. Gale catapults,
   just dodging it. She moves like lightning up the aisle
   of seats.
   
   
   UP ABOVE
   
   Dewey races for the stairs, going as fast as his
   handicapped leg will allow.
   
   
   DOWN BELOW
   
   Gale tears out the exit door, the Killer right behind
   her.
   
   
   AT THE LECTURN
   
   Dewey arrives, searching, looking for Gale.
   
                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             Gale!
   
   He eyes the exit door as it slowly closes. He moves for
   it.
   
   
   INT. CORRIDOR - SAME
   
   Gale races down the hallway, eyeing the nearest door.
   She tears it open, disappearing into...
   
   
   INT. SOUND STAGE - SAME
   
   Gale finds herself in the student studios. She stands
   in a huge control booth that overlooks a dubbing stage.
   Lots of glass walls and doors. It has a maze quality.
   
   Gale moves out a side door and into a dubbing room.
   Darkness everywhere Gale stops for a second, listening
   as she main door CREAKS open. And then FOOTSTEPS are
   heard, making their way towards her.
   
   Gale proceeds deeper into the studio. She moves into a
   sound proof room and closes the door. Not seeing the...
   
   
   GHOST FIGURE
   
   That stands behind her. She turns around and SCREAMS.
   She starts out, but then realizes he's standing in the
   control booth. She's protected by a clear, large,
   plexiglass window that wraps around the room. The ghost
   moves out the side door, heading her way. He disappears
   out of view. Gale freaks. She races to the door, trying
   to secure it. There's no lock.
   
   
   AT THE MAIN DOOR
   
   Dewey slips through quietly, trying his best to be
   quick on his toes. Through the control booth window, he
   immediately spots Gale.
   
   
   INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
   
   Gale looks for objects to block the door with. She
   drags a shelf of sound equipment towards the door.
   
   
   OUTSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
   
   Dewey moves to the window.
   
                       DEWEY
             Gale! Gale!
   
   She doesn't hear him. The room is sound proof. He BEATS
   against the glass. Still, she doesn't turn to him.
   
   
   INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
   
   Gale shoves everything she can find against the door,
   not seeing or hearing Dewey as he POUNDS against the
   sound proof barrier behind her.
   
   She also doesn't see the Killer that appears behind
   Dewey. He moves on him swift and focused.
   
   
   INSIDE THE DUBBING STAGE
   
   Gale can't take her eyes off the door. Her face is
   terrified. If she'd only turn around, she would see
   Dewey - his face terror stricken as a knife is hurled
   into him repeatedely. With each thrust, blood is
   splattered against the glass.
   
   
   IN THE CONTROL BOOTH
   
   Dewey SCREAMS for his life, caught completely off
   guard. He falls forward onto the control panels.
   Suddenly, microphone feedback tears through the studios
   as Dewey's CRIES are heard throughout the stage.
   
   
   IN THE DUBBING STAGE
   
   Dewey's DEATH SCREAM rips through the room.
   
   Gale turns to the window to see Dewey, his face smashed
   against it, blood smeared across the glass. She moves
   to the window, her face only inches from his. A moment
   as their eyes meet. Dewey's life is near gone. His eyes
   reveal it.
   
   Gale BEATS against the glass window.
   
                       GALE
                   (through tears)
             NOOOOOOO!
   
   Dewey's body slides down, out of view. Gale is
   mortified. She looks to the Killer who has already made
   his way through the control booth. He's coming for her.
   She races to the door, throws the things away.
   
   She manages to pull the door open just enough to slide
   through. And she's off and running.
   
   Gale finds a door and plows through it, stopping only
   long enough to lock it.
   
   BAM! The Ghost RAMS it from the other side but it
   holds. Gale surveys her surroundings. She's in a
   storage room. She eyes another door. She moves through
   it and out into...
   
   
   THE HALLWAY
   
   Gale shoots down it.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. CAMPUS STREET - SECONDS LATER
   
   Sidney races down the deserted street. Not a soul in
   sight. She reaches a corner, moves off the road and
   passes through a series of trees and shrubs, coming out
   onto...
   
   
   EXT. SORORITY ROW - SAME
   
   The houses have long since gone to sleep. The Delta
   Zeta House stares at Sidney. Lights burn from within.
   Sid goes for it.
   
   
   EXT. DELTA ZETA FRONT PORCH - SAME
   
   Sid makes her way up the front porch. She POUNDS on the
   front door, SCREAMING her lungs out.
   
                       SIDNEY
             SOMEBODYPLEASEOPENUPSOMEBODY!
   
   Sid wastes no time, she moves along the wraparound
   porch, beating at the windows. But nothing. Everybody
   is off partying. Suddenly, Sid hears something. A
   WHIMPERING. She turns to find Murphy and Lois, laying,
   strewn across the end of the porch. Passed out.
   
   Sid runs to them.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Oh God, help me. We have to call
             the police.
   
   Sid kneels over Murphy, shaking her. Murphy's eyes open
   and she GIGGLES. The girl is completely wasted. She has
   no comprehension skills at all.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Do you have keys? I need to get
             inside.
   
   Sid looks to Lois. She's in worse shape.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Shit!
   
   Sid contemplates, not knowing what to do. She leaves
   them, moving down off the porch and around to the back
   of the house. She gets to the back door, tries it. It's
   locked too.
   
   Sidney checks out the yard. Off to the side, she spots
   a big tree with a...
   
   BODY, lying next to it in a heap on the ground She
   moves toward it.
   
   As Sid approaches she sees clearly that it's Mickey. He
   lay on his side, curled, knees to chest, his arm still
   chained to the tree.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Mickey? Mickey?
   
   A look of dread creeps across her face. He lay there
   very much dead.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Oh God, no, Mickey...
   
   She kneels over his body just as it stirs, lifting up,
   rising. Mickey's face comes into view, coated in dried
   funk, his eyes wide.
   
                       MICKEY
             Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've
             been here all night.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Listen to me. We've got to get
             help. The Killer's here.
   
                       MICKEY
             What are you talking about?
   
                       SIDNEY
             He's after me.
   
   Mickey pulls on his chained arm.
   
                       MICKEY
             Shit! You've got to cut me down,
             Sid.
   
   Sid inspects the chain. It's meant to hold.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'll be right back.
   
                       MICKEY
             Where you going?
   
   Sidney moves to the shed that's attached to the garage.
   Leaning against the side are a row of garden tools. Sid
   settles on a shovel.
   
   Sid returns to Mickey who has risen to his feet. He's
   pulling and twisting the bike chain that binds him.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Watch out.
   
   Sid lifts the shovel up and brings it down directly on
   the lock. It bends somewhat but stays in tact.
   
                       MICKEY
             Do it again.
   
   CLANK! A noise behind them. They both spin around
   peering into the night.
   
                       MICKEY (CONT'D)
             What was that?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Don't panic.
   
   Sidney, determined, raises the shovel high and brings
   it down with great force. It CRACKS the lock, loosening
   it.
   
   Mickey pulls on it. It won't quite give.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Watch out.
   
   Sid raises the shovel again, unfaltering. She doesn't
   see the Ghost Masked Figure that slides down from the
   tree branch behind her. The Figure moves quickly and
   gracefully, coming to a stance directly behind Sid.
   
   Mickey looks up, just in time.
   
                       MICKEY
             SIDNEYWATCHOUT!
   
   Sid turns just as the Killer strikes. But Sid is ready.
   Without thought, she swings the shovel at the Ghost,
   catching his mid-section, sending him flying.
   
   Mickey goes ballistic chained to the tree. He pulls,
   twists, squirms... anything to free himself.
   
   The Ghost rises, moving on Mickey. Sidney sees this.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hey.
   
   Sidney distracts the Ghost. She takes off, the Ghost
   following her. She moves around the tree, sprinting
   across the yard, running smack into...
   
   
   THE GHOST MASKED KILLER
   
   But Sidney spins around as two Ghosts appear on each
   side of her. She stands THUNDERSTRUCK as the two
   Killers descend on her. She dives between the two but
   they counter, keeping her surrounded.
   
   Sid watches as one of the Ghosts withdraws his knife.
   She turns to the other. His knife is already poised.
   They close in on her, ready to strike.
   
   She looks for an escape. There's not one. BAM!
   
   Suddenly, Mickey appears, barreling into one of the
   Ghosts. They go sprawling across the grass.
   
                       MICKEY
             Run, Sid...
   
   Sidney makes her break, she runs passed them, towards
   the front of the yard.
   
   Mickey leaps to his feat. The Killer right behind him.
   He now finds himself in Sid's predicament. He doesn't
   know where to run. The two Killer's close in on him.
   
   Sidney gets to the corner of the house. She stops...
   she doesn't want to leave Mickey. She turns back around
   just in time to see...
   
   Mickey sandwiched in between the two Ghosts. They're
   knives strike at the same time. One through the
   stomach, the other through the back. They withdraw
   their knives. Mickey's body suspends, momentarily
   hanging in the air. Then collapses to a heap on the
   ground.
   
   Both Ghosts turn to Sid at the same time. She takes off
   running, along the side of the house, through a row of
   shrub that take her to...
   
   
   EXT. STREET - SAME
   
   Sid is back on the campus street, running down the
   middle of it.
   
   She spots a car stopped at a red light half a block up.
   KIDS are inside, rock music BLARES. Sid SCREAMS and
   SCREAMS but they don't hear her. She runs, feet
   pounding, toward them but the light turns green and the
   car takes off. It's taillights fading in the night.
   
   She turns finding herself alone in a parking lot. The
   theatre sits in the distance. She spots someone
   entering the theatre. It looks like Hallie.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hallie?
   
   But Hallie doesn't hear her. Sid races forward.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. CAMPUS MINUTES LATER
   
   Gale races down the empty campus street. She eyes an
   emergency phone that's attached to a street lamp. She
   goes for it.
   
   Gale rips the phone from its cradle, presses the CALL
   button.
   
                       VOICE
                   (from phone)
             What is your emergency please?
   
                       GALE
             Someone's trying to kill me. I need
             the police.
   
                       VOICE
             Are you in danger now?
   
                       GALE
             Yes, goddammit!
   
                       VOICE
             Where is your attacker?
   
                       GALE
             I don't know.
   
                       VOICE
             Stay under the safety light. Help
             is on its way.
   
                       GALE
             The safety what? Fuck that!
   
   Just then, Gale hears a NOISE. A door opening. She
   looks up to see Sidney disappear through the side
   theatre door.
   
                       GALE
             SIDNEY!
   
   But Sidney has already disappeared inside. Gale yells
   into the phone.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             Fuckin' hurry.
   
   Gale throws the phone down and tears off for Sidney.
   
   
   INT. THEATRE SAME
   
   The theatre is big and old. Plush chairs, balcony, huge
   proscenium stage.
   
   Sidney enters through a side house door. She pulls on
   it, releasing the emeregency lock. She makes her way
   down the aisle toward the orchestra section.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hello?
   
   The stage is dark and bare with the exceptions of the
   furniture from the DEATHTRAP set. BUMP! A noise from
   the stage wings.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Hallie?
   
   Sidney moves down front to the little bridge that
   extends out over the orchestra pit. She crosses it and
   moves to stage center, peering into the wings on either
   side of her.
   
   Complete darkness.
   
   DRIP! DRIP!
   
   Something drips down from above and onto Sidney. She
   wipes it from her face when...
   
   CLICK! A spot light turns on from the back of the
   house, illuminating Sid center stage. She jumps at
   this, unnerved. She looks to her hand, covered in
   crimson. Then out to the house... the light is
   blinding.
   
   CLANK! A NOISE from above..ropes, pulleys moving. Sid
   looks up as a set wall comes PLOWING down at her. She
   leaps out of the way, falling to the floor.
   
   The wall falls into place on the stage. It is the back
   wall of the set that's dressed with framed pictures and
   antique weapons and...
   
   
   DEWEY
   
   Who hangs from it, pinned up against the wall, very
   much deadk, arms outstretched, crucified. His body a
   bloody mess. Sidney stops, stunned. She stands frozen
   in unspeakable horror. Her entire being ripped apart.
   She breaks into tears. And then...
   
   Sid backs up, moving, racing toward the wings when
   another wall flies in, sealing the backstage area off,
   trapping her. She looks in shock at...
   
   
   HALLIE
   
   Strung up, her body hanging lifeless. Sid SCREAMS,
   turning, running to the other side of the stage when a
   third wall comes flying in, creating the three walled
   set of DEATHTRAP.
   
   Attached to it, is the body of Joel. Dead. Blood
   everywhere. And then, Sid hears...
   
   CLAPPING!
   
   A single pair of hands from somewhere in the house...
   applauding. She turns around and spots a FIGURE moving
   down the aisle. She can't make out who it is.
   
   Sid bolts. She spots the set door up center, near
   Dewey's body. She goes for it, ripping it open to
   find...
   
   
   COTTON WEARY STANDING IN THE DOORFRAME
   
   Sid SCREAMS. But then sees his face, he looks scared.
   And then, Cotton's body falls forward to the floor, his
   arms and legs bound by electric tape.
   
   Sid turns back to the front of the stage. The Figure is
   now walking across the bridge, holding something... a
   light attached to a video camera. She's being filmed.
   Sid looks back to Cotton who looks up to her with
   pleading eyes.
   
                       COTTON
             Quick, untie me.
   
   Sid is paniced. She doesn't know what to do. She leans
   down to untie him but stops.
   
                       VOICE
                   (from behind video
                   camera)
             You've seen this movie before,
             haven't you?
   
   Sidney looks to the voice. The camera is pulled away to
   reveal...
   
   
   DEREK
   
   He smiles at her.
   
                       DEREK
             Smile for the camera.
   
   Sidney remains silent.
   
                       COTTON
             Sid, c'mon.
   
   Side backs away from Cotton. She doesn't trust either
   one of them. Derek watches her, amused.
   
                       DEREK
             Go on, untie him.
   
                       SIDNEY
             No. This is a set up.
   
                       DEREK
             That's quick.
   
                       COTTON
             Please, Sidney, he's going to kill
             us.
   
   Derek begins filming again.
   
                       DEREK
             You must be dealing with some
             serious trust issues right about
             now.
   
   Sidney says nothing. She egdes away, moving to the wall
   where Hallie hangs.
   
                       DEREK (CONT'D)
             Sidney, you can't keep your back to
             the audience like that. Could you
             cheat a little forward for me?
   
                       COTTON
             Please, Sidney.
   
                       DEREK
             You're really stumped, aren't you?
             You know there's two killers but
             you don't know who they are. I'm a
             given. The boyfriend. Way obvious.
             But now you're torn. Everyone else
             appears to be dead. Except for
             Cotton. Hmmm? Hmmm?
   
   Suddenly, Hallie comes to life behind Sid, reaching
   out, grabbing her. Sid JUMPS. She spins around to find
   Hallie breaking out in a torrent of GIGGLES. Very much
   alive.
   
                       HALLIE
             Paaaaiiin... yah, such pain... The
             story of your life, Sid.
   
   Sidney stares in mortal shock as Hallie cuts herself
   down from the wall with a big hunting knife.
   
                       DEREK
             Need some help, honey.
   
                       HALLIE
             I got it..
   
   Sidney's eyes go back and forth between the two.
   
                       DEREK
             You should really see your face
             right now, Sid. It's doing some
             freaky shit.
   
   Derek's right. Sid's face appears completely tortured.
   
                       HALLIE
             Yeah, you look quizzical yet
             pensive.
   
                       DEREK
             Yeah, how can we help? Do you have
             any questions regarding the sequel
             of your life?
   
   Sidney stares them down. She's been here before.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Why?
   
                       DEREK
             Good question. You took the bait.
   
                       HALLIE
             Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS?
             Well, Derek and I have this whole
             Mickey/Mallory-Woody
             Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing
             going on.
   
                       DEREK
             I really don't like that
             comparison, honey.
   
                       HALLIE
                   (to Sid)
             He hates Oliver Stone.
   
                       DEREK
             I find his work overwrought.
   
   Sid is waning.
   
                       HALLIE
             C'mon, Sid, don't fade on us. We've
             been planning this baby for a year.
             Humor us.
   
   Sid turns to Cotton. She kneels down and begins to
   untie him.
   
                       DEREK
             Nope. You had your chance.
   
   Derek dummy lunges at her with the knife. Sid backs
   off.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. THEATRE SAME
   
   Gale approaches the side theatre door. She pulls on it.
   It's locked.
   
                       GALE
             Shit.
   
   She moves down along the theatre to another door.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. THEATRE A MINUTE LATER
   
   Hallie and Derek move around Sid, taking turns filming
   her with the camera.
   
                       DEREK
             We met on the internet.
   
                       HALLIE
             He sent me the cutest e-mail.
   
                       DEREK
             I read her postings on the horror
             movie chat boards and fell
             hopelessly. Hook, line...
   
                       HALLIE
             We have our own website now. We
             dedicated a whole page to you.
   
                       DEREK
             You'd me amazed at how many of us
             there are out there. It's a whole
             world, Sid. You're really popular
             amongst the demented.
   
                       HALLIE
             You're the one who got away.
   
                       DEREK
             Until now.
   
                       COTTON
             You guys are fucked.
   
                       HALLIE
             Actually Cotton, and I think
             critics would agree, it's the other
             way around.
   
                       DEREK
             Poor Cotton, could life be a little
             more cruel?
   
                       SIDNEY
             You're not going to get away with
             this.
   
                       HALLIE
             Of course not. Who wants to? What's
             the point if we don't get caught?
             Where's the glamour in that?
   
                       DEREK
             The way I see it. We'll be
             arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on
             the home footage. Secure a book
             deal. If all goes as planned, our
             trial should coincide with the
             release of STAB II.
   
                       HALLIE
             A verdict and premiere all on the
             same day. I love it.
   
                       DEREK
             We're hoping for the death penalty.
             I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING
             swan song exit planned.
   
                       HALLIE
             And now, drum roll please...
   
                       DEREK
             Hope you're ready, Sid. We got one
             last surprise for you.
   
   Cotton pull and twists on his bound wrists. Sid had
   loosened them somewhat. He tries to finish undoing
   them.
   
                       HALLIE
             A twist ending if you will.
   
                       DEREK
             Yeah, we really had our work cut
             out for us. It really is the curse
             of the sequel. The Billy/Stu
             thing's been done.
   
                       HALLIE
             ... so we had to be different but
             yet the same because if you venture
             to far away from your orginal story
             you completely alienate the
             audience...
   
                       DEREK
             And we didn't want to do that, Sid.
             We wanted to give you your money's
             worth.
   
                       HALLIE
             So we found a compromise.
   
                       DEREK
             Or it found us.
   
                       HALLIE
             We have a surprise guest star
             waiting in the wings.
   
                       DEREK
             Just for you, Sid.
   
                       HALLIE
             Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to
             flip.
   
   Derek reaches in his pocket for a coin.
   
                       DEREK
             Oh yeah.
                   (to Sid)
             We figure the one of us that
             actually kills you will get a
             little more press. It's been an
             ongoing discussion.
                   (to Hallie)
             Heads or tails?
   
                       HALLIE
             Tails.
   
   He flips the coin.
   
                       DEREK
             Shit! You win.
   
   
   IN THE AUDITORIUM
   
   Gale emerges from the lobby. She found a way in. She
   eyes the proceedings on stage. She sees Sidney standing
   over Cotton. And then Hallie and Derek on either
   side... knives in hand. She races down the aisle.
   
                       GALE
             Sidney!
   
   
   ON STAGE
   
   They all turn, spotting Gale. Sid moves forward, happy
   to see her.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Gale!
   
   
   IN THE AUDITORIUM
   
   Gale moves down the aisle, not sure what's going on.
   
   
   ON STAGE
   
   Sidney moves down center. Derek cuts her off just as...
   
   
   THE CURTAIN DROPS
   
   Gale glimpsed the terror on Sidney's face just as the
   curtain separates them.
   
   
   ON STAGE
   
   Derek grabs Sidney, holding her, the knife at her
   throat.
   
                       HALLIE
             It's about time she showed up.
   
   
   IN THE AUDITORIUM
   
   Gale moves to the exit door and into the...
   
   
   INT. STAIR WELL SAME
   
   Gale eyes a door that's marked "STAGE DOOR". She opens
   it and steps in coming face to face with a...
   
   
   A LARGE AUTOMATIC REVOLVER
   
   Gale's eyes move down the end of the gun to find...
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             standing, lips pursed.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Hello, Gale, we've been waiting for
             you.
   
   Gale's face is a mass of confusion.
   
   
   INT. STAGE SAME
   
   Derek releases Sidney, shoving her, she falls to her
   knees, next to Cotton.
   
   
   CLOSE ON COTTON'S HAND
   
                       SIDNEY
             Okay, look, you guys - I applaud
             your methodical expertise but I
             have a question. What's going to
             happen after I die? I thought the
             heroine is supposed to live.
   
                       HALLIE
             Not this time.
   
   Hallie moves in on her.
   
                       DEREK
             Yeah, we're trying to send a
             message to Hollywood. I'm really
             getting tired of all the happy
             endings. It's just not reality. In
             the real world the good guys die,
             the innocent are punished, and the
             murderers inherit the earth.
   
                       SIDNEY
             But nobody wants to see that. It'll
             never go. They'll rewrite you. You
             don't want that.
   
                       HALLIE
             Oh, Sid, you're sounding desparate.
             I guess fearing death makes one
             anxious.
   
                       SIDNEY
             You fucking freaked out movie nut
             psychos...
   
                       VOICE
                   (off camera)
             Don't blame the movies, Sid. Movies
             don't create pyschos.
   
   Sid stops dead in her tracks as these words still her
   very soul. The Voice comes from the wings. They all
   turn as Gale Weathers appears. Behind her, with gun in
   hand, is Debbie Salt. Derek grabs the camera. He
   doesn't want to miss a second.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Don't you know that by now? It's
             about family. It all starts at
             home. It starts with the father...
             and the mother.
   
   Sidney mouth drops, her face aghast, as she looks to
   Debbie Salt. She recognizes her immediately.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Mrs. Loomis?
   
   Gale stops cold.
   
                       GALE
             What?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Oh my God.
   
   Gale turns to Debbie Salt.
   
                       GALE
             Jesus. It can't be.
   
                       HALLIE
             Told you we had a guest star.
             Didn't see that coming, did you?
   
                       DEREK
             Everything's taken on a hyper-
             reality, hasn't it?
   
                       GALE
             You're Billy's mother?
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             I couldn't believe you didn't
             recognize me. You even interviewed
             me for your book.
   
                       GALE
             You're all in this together?
   
                       DEREK
             We had to have financing.
   
                       HALLIE
             Tuition's expensive.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Why Mrs. Loomis?
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Where should we start? Your mother
             ruined my marriage by sleeping with
             my husband. You ruined my family by
             killing my son. Gale aired it to
             the world. Should I go on... isn't
             that enough?
   
                       GALE
             Jesus, you're just as whacked as
             your son.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Where do you think he got it?
             Mental illness is heriditary. Who
             do you think incouraged him to kill
             your mother? He was a smart kid but
             children need parental guidance.
   
   Sidney is completely horror stricken. She stands in
   total disbelief.
   
                       DEREK
             Yeah, she's been great, Sid. We
             never would have been able to it
             without her.
   
   Debbie Salt/Mrs. Loomis looks to both Derek and Hallie,
   smiling.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             And I couldn't have done it without
             you two. Now who won the coin toss?
   
   Hallie raises her hand.
   
                       HALLIE
             I did.
   
   Debbie points the gun at her, quickly, simply... and
   FIRES. Sid and Gale SCREAM as a bullet through the
   forehead sends Hallie flying back against the flat
   wall. Her body drops to the floor. Dead.
   
   Derek drops the camera, completely taken back. He looks
   to Debbie.
   
                       DEREK
             What are you...
   
   Debbie turns the gun on him. FIRES AGAIN. Derek moves,
   the bullet catches him in the stomach. He drops to his
   knees. Debbie FIRES again. Derek takes another bullet.
   This time dropping. Very dead. His body falls near
   Cotton who has remained suspiciously quiet through this
   ordeal. He eyes Derek's knife that now lay near his
   wrists.
   
   
   SIDNEY AND GALE
   
   Turn to Debbie in complete horror.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Nice kids but a little out there.
   
                       GALE
             What are you going to do?
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Finish what my son started.
   
                       GALE
             But you'll never get away with it.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Enter Cotton Weary.
   
   Cotton looks up.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT (CONT'D)
             Think about it. An innocent man
             wrongly accused. Spends time in
             prison where he justs sits with his
             righteous anger, waiting, planning
             his revenge. His life so
             incomprehensively ruined he's
             forced to take revenge on the
             people responsible. It's perfect.
   
                       COTTON
             No... not again.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Sorry, Cotton. I guess you were
             just meant to be a killer.
   
                       SIDNEY
             You'll never get away with this.
   
   Debbie moves to Cotton, shrugging.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Who would you like to shoot first,
             Cotton?
   
   Just then, Cotton leans up, freed from his bindings.
   With the knife in hand, he lunges for Debbie Salt. It
   strikes her, lodging into her chest. She goes back.
   Cotton doesn't stop, he stabs her again and again. She
   goes down. Dead.
   
                       GALE
             Thank God.
   
   Gale rushes to Cotton as he jumps to his feet. She
   helps him with the last of his bindings. Sid looks
   about at the body count on stage. It's mounting. She
   takes a deep breath. Relieved.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             God, Cotton, what a nightmare. I'm
             so sorry.
   
                       COTTON
             Yeah...
   
   Gale gives him a hug.
   
   
   CLOSE ON COTTON'S FACE
   
                       GALE
             Thank you.
   
   He hugs her back. She doesn't see as he rises the knife
   behind her, bringing it down in one swift, maniacal
   move. Gale's body jerks, a moment of shock and then she
   goes limp as the knife lodges in her back.
   
   Sidney turns just in time to see Cotton toss Gale's
   body down into the orchestra pit. He turns, facing
   Sidney. The bloody knife in hand.
   
                       SIDNEY
             NOOO!
   
   Cotton moves to Derek's body where the video camera
   lay, he pulls the tape from it.
   
                       COTTON
             It's perfect, Sidney. No one will
             ever suspect me. I have proof. I'm
             the victim.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Please, Cotton, don't do this.
   
   He holds up the video cassette. Murder in his eye.
   
                       COTTON
             I get my revenge and make some fast
             cash.
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's over, Cotton.
   
                       COTTON
             Not until you're dead.
   
   Cotton lunges for her. Sid tears off, slipping through
   the set door to...
   
   
   BACKSTAGE
   
   Sid runs to the rear of the stage. She moves in the
   narrow space that exists between the scrim and the back
   wail. She races down it.
   
   She almost reaches the end when COTTON RIPS THROUGH THE
   SCRIM!
   
   Sidney ducks, bypassing him. She comes to the stage
   door. It's locked. She turns, seeing the metal ladder
   that's attached to the wall. It leads to the catwalk
   above.
   
   Sid goes for it. She climbs up the ladder with
   lightning speed.
   
   Cotton, up and running, is close behind.
   
   
   INT. CATWALK SAME
   
   The catwalk sits above the open fly space where flats
   and a large chandelier are stored in the air.
   
   Sid reaches the top and takes off running down to the
   ending.
   
   AND THAT'S AS FAR AS I'VE GOTTEN.
   
   WHAT HAPPENS IS SID AND COTTON FIGHT TO THE FINISH, HE
   CHASES HER THROUGH HANGING FLATS, THEN DOWN THE FLY
   RAIL, BACK TO THE STAGE. SID GETS FINDS A KNIFE AND
   STABS COTTON.
   
   HE STABS HER BACK. THEY FIGHT, CONTINUING TO STAB EACH
   OTHER UNTIL THEY BOTH DROP CENTER STAGE. THEY LAY NEXT
   TO EACH OTHER, NEITHER ABLE TO MOVE. THEIR EYES SLOWLY
   CLOSE.
   
   
   
   THE END (FOR NOW)
Scream 3 - early draft

EHREN KRUGER

2nd DRAFT - REVISED

MAY 2, 1999

FADE IN:

A big dramatic crescendo as we --

								OPEN ON:

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - SUNSET - AERIAL

Friday night traffic as usual. Things appear to be backed up all the way to 
the valley. A cacophony of car horns rise up on the soundtrack as we slowly 
DISSOLVE INTO:

INT.  FORD EXPLORER - NIGHT

A new 99' Explorer sits in the midst of the gridlock. Behind the wheel is hot 
teen heartthrob and Hollywood everybody BEN DAMON. Ben is handsome, studly, in 
his early 20s. However, aside from being just another pretty face in the city 
of angels he's also a cocky, arrogant prick. Ben's in the middle of a heated 
argument on his cell with his Agent, Cathy.

				 BEN
				(into cell)
			God dammit Cathy I have no time for this crap!
			I'm supposed to be at the premiere of STAB 2 right
			Now, arm and arm with my girlfriend cause she's got
			a bit part in that over advertised piece of shit and
			I'm just going to humor her. You mena to tell me that
			in all your squandering the best you can do for me is
			A bit role in STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO?! Come on!
			It's just another cheap slasher flick! How dare you
			offer me such a role! I've done Shakespeare! I've
			worked with directors like DePalma and Scorcesse and
			you offer me this crap?! It's insulting. I should 
			fire you and go to ICM.

				CATHY(O.S.)
			   (off phone)
			Ben, I will not sit around and listen to you bad 
			mouth me! Without me you would've never gotten as
			famous as you are today. The least you can do is
			show me a little god damn respect.

				BEN
			   (into phone)
			You want Respect, Cathy? Here's your respect.
			FUCK YOU! You're fired.
			   (Ben hangs up)
			Unfucking believable.

Ben socks the steering wheel out of frustration. The horn blares 
uncomfortably.

				BEN
			Stab 3: Return To Woodsboro. 
			Pah. What's next, Friday The 13TH PART 15:
			JASON DOES BROADWAY?

Ben's phone rings. He answers it.
	
				BEN
			   (into phone)
			What's up, B.D. with the B.D.

				WOMAN'S VOICE
			   (off phone)
			Hardly as large as I'd like it to be.

				BEN
			Christine?

				CHRISTINE(O.S.)
			No, Jennifer Love Hewitt.
			Of course it's me, silly.
			And I feel like an ass standing
			in this theater lobby all by myself.
			Where are you babe, the movie starts
			in twenty minutes.

				BEN
			Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think
			there was some big accident. It could be
			a little while so I don't want you to start
			freaking if I don't get there at exactly,
				(checks watch)
			Eight thirty.

				CHRISTINE(O.S.)
			All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally
			p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.

				BEN
			   (putting up faux-enthusiasm)
			Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world.
			I bet you did such a great job.

				CHRISTINE(O.S.)
			I did. Hon, although I got a total of
			six minutes screen time, they're the
			best six minutes of the movie.

				 BEN
			Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are.
			Look, my battery's dying . . .
		
But of course, we notice Ben's battery is fine, he's just trying to cut the 
conversation short.

				CHRISTINE(O.S.)
			Alright Hon, talk to you when the lights go down.

Ben smiles.

				BEN
			 Sure thing.

Ben hangs up. He reclines back in his seat. Camera slowly pans out the 
windshield revealing the huge traffic pile up awaiting him. He's not going 
anywhere.

CLOSE ON GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

Ben opens the glove compartment. Papers scatter out. Ben reaches for a card.

CLOSE ON CARD -

A small white business card:   1-900-WET-4-COCK

Ben smiles, begins to dial out when suddenly, RING RING! The cell comes to 
life in his hand.

				BEN
			  (startled)
			Jesus.
			  (answers call)
			Hello?
	
				VOICE
			Hello.

				BEN
			Who is this?

				VOICE
			Who is this?

	At this point we know who the caller is. It's the nightmarish 	
	deep voice we've all come to know and hate from the first two	
	films. It's never sounded so evil. So sexy.


				BEN
			Well what number are you trying to reach?

				 VOICE
			 I don't know.

				 BEN
			I think you got the wrong number, buddy.

				 VOICE
			Do I?

				 BEN
			  (peeved)
			Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out.
			Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.

				VOICE
			Wait, wait. Don't hang up.

				BEN
			  (angrily)
			Asshole, Can't talk.

				VOICE
			But your voice sounds so familiar.

Ben smiles.

				BEN
			Does it now?


				VOICE
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben 
Damon.

				 BEN
			   (smiling profusely)
			Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.

				 VOICE
			Really? You're such a talented actor.

				BEN
			  (loves the praise)
			Thanks.

			 VOICE
			Now let's see you act your way out of this one.

The voice seems to have changed tones. It now sounds a lot harsher, angrier if 
you will.

				 BEN
			What do you mean?

				 VOICE
			I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES 
			ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend 
			Christine is in there.  She's all alone. 
			Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film 
			to start.
			   (laughs coldly)
			I've got my knife.

*NOTE: At this point we intercut shots of the empty lobby and halls of the 
PLAZA THEATER. A POV shot standing outside the LADIES ROOM door.

				 BEN
			 (turning pale)
			Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?

				 VOICE
			More of a game really. 

				 BEN
			What kind of a game?

				 VOICE
			You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies.
			Here's how we play. I ask you a question. 
			You get it right, your girlfriend lives. 
			You answer wrong, she dies.

				 BEN
			I swear to God if you lay a finger on her 
			I'll fucking kill you!

				 VOICE
			Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. 
			First question, Your girlfriend's counting on 
			you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?

Ben groans. He bangs his head against the steering wheel, if only  he'd have 
paid attention to Christine he might have known this.


				 VOICE
			Come on. Don't you know?
		

				 BEN
				  (hesitating)
			It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character 
			she plays in the movie!

				 VOICE
			Very good. Now we play ROUND 2. 

				BEN
			What?! But I did everything you said to do!

				VOICE
			That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're 
			taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me 
			beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. 
			I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.

				BEN
			What?!

				VOICE
			Good bye Ben.
	
Click. The killer hangs up. Ben flips open the phone, dials 911. Ringing and 
then . . .

				RECORDED MESSAGE
			   (off phone)
			Due to the high volume of calls this evening,
			Dispatch is temporarily shut down. If this is
			not a real emergency please call another dep-

Ben hangs up, dials CHRISTINE's number. RINGING, then--

				 VOICE
			You're not playing by the rules Ben.
			Don't you want her to live?

				 BEN
			I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!

				 VOICE
			No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want
			you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out.
			Do you understand? 

IN THE B.G. we hear CHRISTINE's horrific screaming.

The killer hangs up. Ben looks ahead, traffic is picking up. He puts the SUV 
into gear, peels out the nearest opening, narrowly avoiding collision. His car 
screeches down the off ramp.

								 CUT TO:

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

Ben comes screeching around the corner in his FORD EXPLORER.  Tires smoking. 
Sparks flying. The HOLLYWOOD sign stands like an impending pall in the 
awaiting b.g.

								 CUT TO:


EXT.  HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT

The SUV comes to a screeching halt alongside the hilly, narrow road. Ben jumps 
out of his car, cell phone in hand. He looks up at the towering sign standing 
ahead of him, contemplates. Does he really wanna go up there? He looks into 
his SUV, gets an idea.

THE BACK --

--is opened. Ben reaches in looking for a weapon. AN OLD BEACH CHAIR. Not 
gonna do the trick. A pair of old shoes. Nope. Then he finds it, a LOUISVILLE 
SLUGGER with "ACTORS AT BAT FOR BRAIN CANCER" written across it. 

				BEN
			   (to himself)
			Thank God I decided to do some community service.

Ben takes the bat, closes up the back of the SUV. He begins to walk towards 
the sign when suddenly --

HIS CELL RINGS.

Ben answers the call.

				BEN
			  (into phone)
			Yeah.

				VOICE
			Very good. You follow directions well.
			Now for the final part of the game.
			Put down the bat and approach the sign,
			slowly.

Ben makes a disgusted face, tosses the bat into the bushes. He approaches the 
sign, keeping his eyes trained in all directions.

				BEN
			  (into phone)
			Where are you?

				VOICE
			Closer than you think.

				BEN
			  (into phone)
			Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want
			from me?

				VOICE
			To see your reaction.

				BEN
			Reaction to what?

Ben passes under the huge, pallid "H" in the sign. What seems at first like a 
gentle raindrop, beads down Ben's forehead. He rolls back his head, his legs 
turning to jelly, his eyes widening in horror.


				BEN
			OHMYGOD! NO!
			CHRISTINE --

Has been gutted from neck to groin. She has been fastened to the cross-bar in 
the "H" with heavy rope. Her lifeless body sways ever so gently in the 
Southern California wind. Utterly horrified, Ben staggers into the shadows, 
not seeing --

THE GHOST as he rises from the void, knife in hand.  In one quick, brutal 
stab, the knife is driven into Ben's spine. Ben screams as he's turned around, 
face to face with his attacker.

				BEN
			  (screaming)
			BUT I'M THE KILLER IN STAB 3!
		
				THE GHOST
			You just lost the role Ben.
			Consider this your parting gift.

AND WITH that, the GHOST drives the bloodstained knife into Ben's heart, 
causing a vicious eruption of crimson.

									CUT TO:

	TITLE CARD.   "SCREAM 3"

									OPEN ON:

	EXT.  TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY

GALE WEATHERS, the flashy thirty-something news anchor and author of the 
WOODSBORO MURDERS. She sits behind a desk on the really ditzy, loud set for 
TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT, an ET style program with a live studio audience.

				 GALE
			Good morning Hollywood. And today
			officially starts the Summer movie
			season. Opening the box office this
			week is Jeff Bridges and Tim Robins
			in Arlington Street,  Eugene Levy
			and Jason Biggs in American Pastry,
			and Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer
			in STAB 2, based off my best selling
			book the WINDSOR MURDERS. 

CAMERA pans across the audience. Many of them are dressed as the GHOST. A sea 
of white screaming faces. Very eerie and unsettling.

				 GALE
			Well I see a lot of the audience has dressed
			to the occasion. Today we have director of the
			upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO, Roman
			Bridger. Why don't we give Mr. Bridger a nice
			welcome to the set of Total Entertainment.
	
The crowd goes wild with applause and faux-knife slashes as ROMAN BRIDGER, 
ravishingly handsome, 29, tall and stocky, enters stage dressed in a flashy 
white suit. He sits down on a chair beside Gale's desk, places a STAB 3 coffee 
mug beside Gale's hand.

				ROMAN
			Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.

				GALE
			It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.

				ROMAN
			   (addressing audience)
			Well it's a honor to be here amongst so
			many fans of the genre. And I must say
			that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp,
			or Tori or David not returning to complete
			the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is
			here. Aided with my excellent cast of
			newcomers I believe we're going to pull
			off one of the best Stabs yet.

				GALE
			Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly
			seems that way.
				(a beat)
			Honestly though, 
				(smiles) 
			tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?

				ROMAN
			  (a long pause)
			Honestly, my life.

A eclectic hush falls over the crowd. Roman appears somewhat sinister in this 
light. Gale gazes deeply into Roman's eyes.

				GALE
			Your life?

				ROMAN
			Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with 
			those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like 
			I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick 
			your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to 
			a Tobe Hooper flick.

Roman smiles. The true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into 
applause. Gale, somewhat distracted, other what not caring what this second 
rate director has to say, gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of 
the set, watching from a half-open exit door. Now it could be just her 
imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as 
if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming blade.

A LOUD BUZZING O.S.  Gale is startled out of her skin. She looks up at a sign 
hanging over the stage. THE WORD "COMMERCIAL BREAK" is illuminated in flashing 
red light. Gale sighs, looks back to the exit. The GHOST is gone. She turns to 
Roman.

				GALE
			Would you excuse me for a moment?

				ROMAN
			  (smiling)
			Sure.

Gale bolts for --

INT.  BACKSTAGE - TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY

Gale races around the corner of the set, smashing right into -

DETECTIVE MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. Mid-thirties. Handsome with piercing eyes. He 
grabs Gale by her shoulders, shepherding her aside.

				GALE	
			Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
	
				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to 
			introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.
			  (flashes badge)
			Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, 
			or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?

				GALE
			Well I interviewed Damon once for the show.
			He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the 
			second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part 
			in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Both of them were found brutally murdered this 
			morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy 
			reports having come back to me yet but the 
			bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.  

				GALE
			So is that why you're here? Is that why you're 
			holding me from my show, to tell me about some 
			brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but 
			there's more. The killer left a note.

				GALE
			A note?

Detective Kincaid reaches into his back pocket, pulls up a newspaper clipping 
in a ziplock evidence bag. He holds the bag up For Gale to see.

EXTREMELY CLOSE on the ARTICLE . . . "MAUREEN PRESCOTT, MOTHER AND WIFE, FOUND 
BRUTALLY RAPED AND MURDERED IN BEDROOM". A b/w photo of Sidney's mother 
Maureen stands hauntingly before the camera.

				GALE(O.S.)
			That's Sidney Prescott's mother.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID(O.S.)
			There's more.

Kincaid flips the article over. Someone has scrawled in black marker across 
the back "SIDNEY".

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott,
			but she's keeping herself very well hidden.
			You're my one and only hope in finding her.
			Her life may be in grave danger.

				GALE
			I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being
			sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but
			I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor
			she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other
			person that might know is, 
			  (gale hesitates), 
			not going to talk.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			And who would that be?

							CUT TO:

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS BACK LOT - DAY

A red BMW convertible speeds through the back lot. Behind the wheel is DEWEY 
RIELLY. Former Police Officer, turned Technical advisor on the red hot set of 
. . . STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO.

All around the lot are promotional banners and posters for the film. Dewey 
parks his car outside a soundstage, exits.

							CUT TO:

INT.  STAB 3 SET - DAY

A huge replication of Woodsboro in a building about the size of an airplane 
hanger.  In one corner we've got the Macher and Prescott homes. In another 
corner stands the infamous Becker house where the nightmare all began. In 
other regions are sights like the Town Square and Market, an exterior for the 
Woodsboro Police Station,  A TOP STORY news van, etc.

DEWEY, Enters set, bumping into his movie alter-ego --

TOM PRINZE, a Hollywood poster boy. Very cool. Not so debonair. A shoddy copy 
of Dewey at best. However, the conversation between the two is friendly, and 
they exchange greetings.

				TOM
			Hey Dew, did you hear?

				DEWEY
			No, what?

				TOM
			Somebody iced Ben Damon and his girlfriend.

				DEWEY
			That's Hollywood Tom. One day you're
			making movies in the hills, the next day 
			you're posing for the coroner downtown on a slab.

Dewey's obviously gotten a lot colder since the last film. He walks past a 
clique of STAB 3'S MAIN CAST:

There's:

SARAH DARLING: 30, playing a 25 year old bimbo. Very hot. Very blonde. Ample 
cleavage.

ANGELINA TYLER: 20. Extremely nadve looking. She won her part in STAB 3 
playing Sidney through a phone in radio contest. She's timid, with short dark 
hair. Out of the entire cast, she is the closet to Sidney, they got.

And also the loveable

TYSON JACKSON: late 20's, African-American, all attitude.

The three flip through pages of the STAB 3 script, conversing freely about the 
production.

				 SARAH
			Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with
			these re-writes. It's like every five
			minutes there's a new script. God, and
			you just know this all because of STAB 2's
			script winding up on the internet two months
			after it wrapped shooting.

				TYSON
			And still the film is Number One at the box
			office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty
			and Arlington Street.

				ANGELINA
			I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.

				TYSON
			Nah I think it's doing so damn well because
			one of it's players got iced. I just hope
			none of us end up dead.

				ANGELINA
			Oh that's right. Those poor poor people.
			God Ben Damon was such a hottie.

				TYSON
				 (sighs)
			And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either
			but I'm really concerned about my safety 
			now.

				SARAH
			What are you talking about?
			The murders were a completely isolated
			incident.

				TYSON
			(reading from script)
			SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT.
			"What are you talking about Ricky, the
			murders were a completely isolated incident".

				SARAH
			Would you give that script a rest?	
			It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.

				TYSON
			I'm just saying, though. What if there's
			someone out there stalking actors? Huh?
			Then what?

				ANGELINA
			There's always someone out there stalking
			actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.

				TYSON
			Melinda McGraw?

				ANGELINA
			No, the other one. The one who played his
			wife. 

				SARAH
			I know who you're talking about. Rebecca
			something.

				ANGELINA
			Yeah I think. Anyway, point is, she had a stalker.
			Sonny Bono had a stalker. David Letterman had one
			too. So did Heather Langenkamp, Brooke Sheilds,
			Jody Foster, --

				TYSON
			Listen Miss ingénue, your cheering me up to much,
			Give it a break.

Tom walks into frame, sits down next to Angelina, subtly putting his arm 
around her. She shoves him away.

				TOM
			What? What'd I do? Relax your crack sweetheart
			I didn't rip those two fucks up last night.
			Jeez.
			   (lights up a smoke)
			So what are you doing tonight?

Totally repulsed, Angelina gets up, races off set.

				TOM
			Talk about moody.

Tom leans back seductively, his crotch in full view, staring at Sarah with 
bedroom eyes.

				TOM
			And how about you good looking?
			Got any plans for later?

				SARAH
			Eww yeah, finding a guy to have sex
			with that doesn't look like you.

Sarah, following suit laid by Angelina, scampers off set. Tom looks up at 
Tyson, smoke blowing out his nostrils.

				TYSON
			Oh no. I ain't into that shit.

Tyson races off set. Tom laughs, covers his face.

							  CUT TO:

DETECTIVE KINCAID AND GALE.

They walk through the set. Gale's mesmerized. Kincaid is all business.

				 GALE
			Déjr vu-do.

The pair come to a halt on the driveway of what is supposed to be the Macher 
Residence. Everything from the smashed beer bottles in the garage, to the boat 
on the driveway is mimicked to a perfect t. Even a foam dummy Of TATUM RIELLY 
dangles from the doggy door, head squashed a bloody mess.

GALE stares at the swaying dummy, haunted.

				 VOICE(O.S.)
			Well well, someone dies and Gale Weathers
			comes running. What a shock.

GALE looks up. DEWEY stands beside her.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid.
			I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's
			Events?

				DEWEY
			Yeah. A real tragedy.

Dewey stares daggers through Gale. There is a real bitter coldness between the 
two.

				GALE
			Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, 
			this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.

				DEWEY
			What so you can just exploit her again with another
			book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.

				GALE
			  (to Kincaid)
			Show him.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Mr. Rielly, this was found alongside the bodies of 
			Ben and his girlfriend.

Kincaid hands Dewey the ziplocked clipping. Dewey examines it, his fear slowly 
growing.

				DEWEY
			I promised Sid I'd keep her in seclusion.
			I promised her nobody would ever find her.
			If you don't mind Detective, I'd like to
			approach her with this on my own and see
			what she'd like to do about it.

Kincaid nods.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else
			should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.

				DEWEY
			Understood.
			  (a beat)
			If you'll excuse me Detective.
			  (coldly)
			Gale.

Dewey walks off camera. Kincaid puts his hand on Gale's shoulder.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I'm going to have a little chat with the
			producers. Don't wander off. I may need you.

Gale nods as Kincaid disappears into the backdrop of the set. A Shrill voice 
O.S.

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			GALE WEATHERS! Oh my God!

Jennifer Jolie, an ambitious young starlet, playing GALE in the latest Stab, 
rushes towards her, with arms wide open. She's decked out in the flashy neon 
green ensemble Gale wore in the first film and even sports a fake shiner on 
her right eye. Gale is obviously pissed. She knows this actress and doesn't 
really want to be in her company very long.

				Gale
			Shit.

				Jennifer
			Listen, I know we've never met, and 
			I don't mind you never returning my calls, 
			but I have to tell you that after two films 
			I feel like I am in your mind.

				Gale
			Well, that would explain my constant headaches.  

				Jennifer
			  (defensively)
			You know I'm sorry that things didn't work out 
			on '60 Minutes II', but 'Total Entertainment' 
			that's a pretty good fall back.

				Gale
			Thank you.  I'm sorry that things didn't work out 
			with Brad Pitt, but being single, that's a pretty 
			good fall back.

				Jennifer
			Gives me more time for my work.  
			After all, Gale Weathers, you're such a complex 
			character.

				Gale
			And to be played by an actress with such 
			depth and range.  

Dewey steps back into the picture, cell phone in hand.

				Dewey
			No answer at Sid's. Where'd 
			the Detective go?

	
				JENNIFER
			   (excitedly)
			DEWEY!
	
Gale stares at the couple, just processing things in her head.

				Jennifer 
			  (fondles Dewey's butt)
			Gale, I think you'll really appreciate 
			my character work in this one, someone's 
			helped me understand the real you.

				Gale
			Someone?

				Jennifer
			The ruthless ambition, your private 
			self-loathing, and that lost and lonely 
			little girl inside.

				Gale
			Lost and lonely what?

				Jennifer
			You heard me. 
			  (takes Dewey's cellular) 
			Thanks Dewey.  I'll return it.

				Gale
			Lost and lonely what?

				Dewey
			Little girl inside.

				Gale
			I thought you were supposed to be in 
			Woodsboro!

				Dewey
			Well, I'm surprised you thought about me 
			at all.  Listen I gotta get back to 
			trying to get hold of Sid.
			Besides, she's more important than you ever were.

				Gale
			Wait! Dewey we can work on this together!
			As a team! Like in the past!

				Dewey
			No really Gale, that's a sweet offer, but this
			time I'd like to catch the killer before 
			the body count gets any higher.
			  (a beat)
			Toodles.

Dewey walks away leaving Gale alone. Kincaid enters frame, 	talking to two 
producers. The elder, sixty-five year old BUDDY SHAYNE, a towering, hefty man 
with gray hair. The second, bigwig horror producer JOHN MILTON, a creepy 
fifty-something with penetrating eyes and a menacing demeanor. The two talk, 
ignoring Gale the entire time.  She's almost eavesdropping on their 
conversation.

				MILTON
			I can assure you that security on the set
			will be at an all time high. Again, the
			deaths are sheer tragedy.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Well, I'd hate to see the production shut down.
				(laughs)
			I myself am a big STAB fan.

				BUDDY
			Really?
				(smiles)
			Have you ever thought about acting?
			You've got just the right face.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I am kind of dedicated to my job.
			Although I do enjoy taking acting
 			classes on my weekends. I grew up
			around these studios anyway. I know
			my way around. My Uncle was a screenwriter
			for PARAMOUNT.

				MILTON
			Really, what was his name?

Before Kincaid can finish, Gale buts in.

				GALE
			Excuse me Detective, I think we have some
			business to attend to.

				MILTON
			   (flabbergasted)
			GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here?
			No press on the set!
			   (to security)
			No press, no press on set!
			Get that woman out of here.

				SECURITY GAURD
			  (approaching)
			Yes, Mr. Milton.
			
				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			No, Mr. Milton, Miss Weathers is with me.

Milton nods his head, flags down the guard. He walks away.

				MILTON
			Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.

				GALE
			Oh come on! Why the hostility?

				MILTON
			Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and 
			all but last month I happened to catch 
			your little segment on me and how my wife 
			left me because I'm a sex addict who 
			enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. 
			It was a real eye opener my lawyers are 
			still thinking about bringing to your 
			superior's attentions.

				GALE
			  (shit-eating smile on her face)
			They're the ones who approved it.

Milton storms off camera, Buddy following close behind. Gale looks up at 
Kincaid.

				GALE
			Alright Kincaid, no where to?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I go to the police station and do my job,
			and you go back to being Gale Weathers.

				GALE
			Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, 
			give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.

Kincaid hands Gale his card, begins to walk out of the building.

				GALE
			Shit. Can I even get a ride home?

	INT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

SIDNEY PRESCOTT, the stoic, survivor. Now 24, she lies peacefully in bed, her 
black lab PETE curled up in a ball at her feet. A noise startles the animal 
awake. It sets off the bed barking hysterically at --

THE BEDROOM WINDOW

SIDNEY --

--awakens. She squints her eyes to try and make out what her dog is going into 
conniptions over. Then she sees, and her face loses any trace of color.

MAUREEN PRESCOTT'S GHOSTLY WRAITH is pressed up against the window. She's 
wearing a tattered, blood soaked night shift.  Her voice is muted but her lips 
are moving as if trying torelay a message to Sidney. Sid's hysterical crying. 
She slidesoff her bed, makes her way towards the window when suddenly --

MAUREEN slides down the glass, as if being pulled by somethingbeneath the 
window sill. Something we don't see . . . yet.

				SIDNEY
				(crying)
			   Mom!

Left behind in her wake are five bloody streaks running downthe glass. The 
streaks begin to bleed, as if each wounds themselves. They bleed right through 
the glass. Sidneyreaches out to touch them when suddenly --

THE GHOST springs up behind the window, shatters the glass panewith his fist. 
SIDNEY screams --

AWAKENING IN BED FROM HER NIGHTMARE.

Her dog's barking wildly.

THE WINDOW is fine. 

SID crawls out of bed, disappearing out of the room.

								  CUT TO:


	INT. SID'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Sid's washing up at the sink. She wipes the tears from her eyes.She shuts off 
the running water, looks up into the mirror. Her demeanor definitely shows the 
ware and tear of all that's happened to her in her past. 

CLOSE on SIDNEY'S WRISTS.  Two ugly scars run up Sid's wrists.Battle Scars of 
a war waged between her own personal demons if you wish. Former Suicide 
Attempts former engraved on time.

								 CUT TO:

	EXT.  SID'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Sid's house is deep within the Napa Valley. Secluded amongst verdant vineyards 
and orchards that are now covered by thedarkness of night. A full moon hangs 
ominously in the sky above.
A light burns from within the two story farmhouse. A phone dialing out rises 
in pre-lap as we --

  CUT TO:

INT.  SID'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sid sits in a cluttered office. On the wall hangs a poster forthe FALL OF TROY 
(her play from SCREAM 2) and a poster proclaiming WOMEN'S RIGHTS with 
CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S CRISIS center written beneath that.

A THREE-RING BINDER with a cover boasting CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S CRISIS CENTER is 
thrown open.

THE PHONE--

SID PUTS ON A HEADSET, dials a number. RINGING.

				SIDNEY
			   (into headset)
			This is Laura in Monterey reporting
			in for work.

				OPERATOR(O.S.)
			Alright Laura I'll patch you right 
			in to a call.

				SIDNEY
			Thanks.

A click. A woman's voice comes on the other line. It sounds very familiar.

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			Hello?

				SIDNEY
			Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor.
			How can I help you.

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			Laura I think I just killed somebody.

				SIDNEY
			Are you sure?

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone!
			OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!

				SIDNEY
			Well then the people you need to call are the police.

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			No I need to call you. Just you.

				SIDNEY
			I'm sorry, your voice.

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?
			  (a beat, Sid goes blank)
			Are you listening to me, huh?

				SIDNEY
			Who the fuck is this?

				WOMAN(O.S.)
			It's mother, Sidney, now be a good 
			girl and turn on the news. DO IT!

Sid reaches for the remote control, flips on a small TV lying across the 
office.

ON THE TV --

A REPORTER stands with the HOLLYWOOD SIGN in the b.g.

				REPORTER
			The mutilated bodies were discovered late 
			last night by the L.A.P.D, prominent actor 
			Ben Damon was slated for a role in the 
			upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO --

Sidney shuts off the TV as a familiar voice cuts through the din:

				VOICE
			Do you think it's over Sidney?
			Do you?

				SIDNEY
			W-what do you want?

				VOICE
			I want to finish what I started.
			I want to finish the game.

				SIDNEY
			You sick fuck I'm tracing this call
			as we speak! The police are gonna nail
			your ass!

				VOICE
			   (laughs coldly)
			Let them try. You'll never find me.
			I've already gotten away with murder before.
			For instance, Maureen Prescott.

				SIDNEY
			  (tears welling)
			No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis
			and Stu Macher did.

				VOICE
			Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think.
			It's all been building up to this Sid.
			Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of
			blood that's been spilled has all been
			leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.

				SIDNEY
			The final act? Well let's play asshole!

				VOICE
			No. We play in my court this time.
			Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting 
			corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set 
			on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.

The killer laughs coldly. Sidney wanes.

				SIDNEY
			  (crying)
			If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!

				VOICE
			Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you
			real soon Sidney. Real soon.

Click. The killer hangs up. Sid's left trembling. She rips the headset out of 
the phone, reaches into her desk for a loaded.38 special.  She stands up, and 
peers out her office window.

SIDNEY'S P.O.V. - THE DARK, OMINOUS NIGHT.

									 CUT TO:
EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS - NIGHT

Sarah Darling drives through the main gates in her porshe, rounds a corner.

EXT.  STAB 3 PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT

Sarah parks outside the production offices, gets out of her car.

KILLER'S P.O.V - watching from the rooftop, Sarah approaching the dimly lit 
offices.

									 CUT TO:

INT.  STAB 3 PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT

Sarah steps into the office. It's desolate. Silent. All over the place are 
promotional items (standees, posters, banners) for STABS 1-3. Sarah passes a 
big cardboard GHOST.

				SARAH
			STAB 3. Oh God I've gotta get myself 
			a better agent.

Sarah walks down a hallway.

				SARAH
			  (calling out)
			Anybody home?

Sarah passes Roman Bridger's office. It's half-open.

				SARAH
			Doubt that.
			  (door slams shut O.S.)
			Anyone here?


Sarah continues further down the hall when suddenly --

TYSON comes reeling out of a doorway, a huge knife jutting out his back, blood 
trickling down his mouth. Sarah lets out a bloodcurdling scream while Tyson 
breaks into hysterics.

				TYSON
			Stan! My man does great work.

Stan, a bearded, middle aged make-up effects guy steps out behind Tyson, slaps 
him a high-five.

				STAN
			Thank you. Thank you very much.

				SARAH
			Fuck you very much!
			Tyson go to hell!
			What the hell are you doing here?
			Where's Roman?

				TYSON
			Roman and everybody else went home for 
			the night. I'm here for a make-up test.

				SARAH
			Make-up. You need it.
			  (a beat)
			Hey, Roman isn't here?

				TYSON
			No.

				SARAH
			Damn. He called my roommate and told her 
			he had some important things he wanted to 
			go over with me in his office tonight.

				STAN
			  (jokingly)
			Yeah I bet.

Stan pantomimes the "blow job" gesture. Tyson laughs, slaps him another high-
five. Sarah makes a disgusted face as the two men leave the offices. Sarah 
sighs, ducks into Roman's office.

INT.  ROMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Roman's office is a clutter of old movie memorabilia. Sarah plops down behind 
Roman's desk, admires his old TRANSFORMER toys and two brass MUSIC VIDEO 
AWARDS. Sarah examines the award.

				SARAH
			   (reading inscription)
			For the honorary field of directing and 
			cinematography in music videos.
			How to the point. 

The phone rings scaring the shit out of Sarah. She drops the award, causing it 
to smash against the edge of the desk, snapping the head clean off. Sarah 
hesitates, answers the call, putting it on speaker phone.

				SARAH
			Oh shit.
			  (into phone)
			Hello? Director's office.

				ROMAN
			Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running 
			late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 
			minutes away.  

				SARAH
			Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at 
			your   music video awards.  

Sarah tries fixing the award with some scotch tape.


				ROMAN
			All right, since I got you on the phone, 
			let's talk about your character.

				SARAH
			What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who 
			gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes! 

				ROMAN
			You're not happy with your part.

				SARAH
			I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. 
			I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm 
			not happy that my character is too stupid not to 
			have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been 
			cut into McNuggets.

				ROMAN
			Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the 
			lines.

				SARAH
			Huh, fine.

				ROMAN
			Page 22, Candy's big moment.

				SARAH
			Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?

				ROMAN
			Hello.

				SARAH
			Who's this?

				ROMAN
			Who's this?

				SARAH
			This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some 
			clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have 
			to start the scene in the shower!  The whole 
			shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I 
			mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?

				ROMAN
			Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is 
			that like candy cane or candy apple?

				SARAH
			Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have 
			the wrong number.

				ROMAN
			But you know my favorite name? 

				SARAH
			I'm hanging up right now.

				ROMAN
			It's Sarah.

				SARAH
			Roman that's not the line.

				ROMAN
			It is in my script. 

				SARAH
			Has there been another goddamn rewrite?   
			How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our 
			lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes? 

				ROMAN
			It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.

				SARAH
			What?  What movie?

				ROMAN
			My movie.

A pause, then a familiar dark natured noise enters our ears, the killer's 
sinister voice.


				VOICE
			It's called, Sarah gets sliced like a 
			fucking pig.
			Still in character, Sarah?

Sarah tosses down the phone, bolts out of the office.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sarah stops in her tracks. Through the smoked glass of the front door she sees 
a shape approaching. She screams, spins around, runs for the prop room. 

INT.  PROP ROOM - NIGHT

Sarah locks the door, backs up right into --

AN ARMY OF GHOSTS!

AT LEAST THIRTY GHOST COSTUMES dangle from hooks on costume racks. Sarah 
catches her breath, dives into one of the racks.  She pulls up her cell phone, 
starts to dial.

INT.  STAB 3 - PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT

A SECURITY GUARD opens the front door, pokes his head into the offices.

				SECURITY GUARD
			Mr. Bridger?

No answer. The guard nods, backs out of the offices, locking them with SARAH 
and the killer inside!

  CUT TO:

INT.  PROP ROOM - NIGHT

Sarah's waiting on eggs as a digitized pre-programmed commissarymenu for 
Sunrise Studios drags out.

				SARAH
			Shit.

Sarah momentarily glances behind her, just noticing, a pair of black work 
boots stepping off the costume rack. Before Sarah has a chance to scream, the 
ghost jumps down and shoves the rack hard sending a screaming Sarah into the 
next room. She goes flying out, slamming into a metal table covered with prop 
weapons.

THE GHOST --

Stomps into the second prop room, knife raised. Sarah leaps up, starts to 
chuck the prop knives at her attacker, screaming furiously.

THE PROP knives, hit the ghost, and bend as they bounce off his body and onto 
the floor. The killer shakes his head angrily, stalks towards his prey.

				SARAH
			  (screaming)
			No! No! Noooo!

The ghost drives his knife into Sarah's chest, once, twice, and delivers a 
final killing blow to her Adam's apple. She staggers forward. Her killer grabs 
her by her long buxom hair, and hucks her into a glass door.

THE DOOR EXPLODES, SARAH'S BODY falling through, shards of glass tearing out 
her back.

THE KILLER, stands in the shattered doorway, bloody knife in hand. An alarm 
resonates in the b.g. The killer wipes his knife clean, races off screen.

A NICE PSYCHO-ESQUE close up of the dead Sarah's eye as Blood swirls into the 
pupil.

   SHOCK CUT TO:

The highway is desolate. It's late. Sidney speeds into frame in her HONDA 
CIVIC.

  CUT TO:

INT.  HONDA CIVIC - NIGHT

Sidney's tapping her thumbs nervously against the steering wheel as an eerie 
song filters off the radio. The only light comes from the unsettling neon 
green digital clock/radio read-out. Sidney increases speed.

INT.   STAB 3 PRODUCTION OFFICES - NIGHT

Kincaid and Gale stare at Sarah Darling's corpse as it's zippered up into a 
black rubber body bag and carried off by forensic technicians.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers.
			It looks like we're going to
			be getting a warrant to speak
			with Miss Prescott anyway.

				GALE
			Shit. Sarah Darling.
			   (a beat)
			I interviewed her too.
			God, it's happening again isn't it
			Detective?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Yes well we have a suspect, so don't
			get that worried.

Gale's eyes light up. She grabs Kincaid's shoulders.

				GALE
			Who?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I'm not at liberty to tell you that
			Miss Weathers. You're no longer working
			with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why
			you're standing in here right now. By
			all means I should have you thrown out.

				GALE
			But you won't. You're a good man detective.
			We think alike. I know you need my help.
			And I know you know I need your help.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			In my fifteen years as a homicide detective
			I've never met a single soul as pushy and
			brazen as you are Miss Weathers.

				GALE
			Please, call me Gale.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?

Gale smiles. DETECTIVE TOM WALLACE, Kincaid's cohort and partner. He's in his 
late thirties. Family man. Wallaceenters frame with a folder in his hands.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Mark, Bridger's in custody. We traced his
			phone records. He's the last person to
			speak to Sarah Darling before she died.
			Or at least call her home.

				GALE
			Wait a minute, Roman's your suspect?

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Listen, Diane Sawyer, this here is classified 
			information. Why don't you go investigate 
			the bad meat at the A.P.
			This is police work, not Pulitzer material.

				GALE
			Hey, fuck off.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			No, cool it Wallace. She's working with me.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			  (cocky)
				Well then. Looks like I'll go dust for
				finger prints with Barbara Walters.

Wallace arrogantly walks off camera. Gale looks at Kincaid.

				GALE
			So, what now?

CUT TO:

INT.  INTEROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

A frazzled Roman is seated at a long conference table while Wallace and 
Kincaid grill him with questions.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Mr. Bridger, you didn't tell us you spoke
			with Sarah Darling before she died.

				ROMAN
			That's because I didn't.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			The guard said she was there for a meeting with you.

				ROMAN
			What meeting?

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			We talked to her roommate, too.  Says you called Sarah
			and told her to come down to the studio.  Roommate 
			answered the phone, says it was you.

				ROMAN
			Wait a minute!  I never called her! I never told 
			her to go   anywhere!

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Roommate says she knows your voice, Mr. Bridger.  

				ROMAN
			Well, she wasn't speaking with me!  Look, I did 
			not call   Sarah Darling!  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Sarah Darling said you did.

				ROMAN
			Someone is trying to ruin my movie.  
			Someone wants to kill   my movie!

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Hey, look at it this way, if anything this'll 
			be something interesting to put on the 
			director's commentary for when the film hits DVD.

				ROMAN
			  (dry laugh)
			 Ha! Too late, studio's shutting down production.
			 Called my film a risk! Do you believe this shit?
			 They're actually shelving my film because there's 
			been one ensie little murder. God, three people died 
			during the filming of The Exorcist.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Well I doubt they were stabbed to death and I 
			strongly doubt the killer of them left messages 
			on the scene for the police to find.

Camera pans through a two-way mirror into . . .

INT.  VIEWING ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

GALE AND DEWEY stand, gazing through the two-way mirror. Roman can't see them. 
They watch nervously.

				DEWEY
			They found another note?

				GALE
			Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one  
			about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or 
			not it looks like we're going to have to  go 
			back into our past.

				DEWEY
			You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid.
			This has nothing to do with you Gale.

				GALE
			This has everything to do with me Dewey.
			I was the one who brought the nation's  
			attention to this shit anyway. I'll be  
			damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass  
			on the buck again.

				DEWEY
			Do you really mean it this time Gale?

				GALE
			Yes. Look, let's get something straight  
			Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police  
			came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to  
			make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.

				DEWEY
			Why would the police come to you?

				GALE
			Again, I am the author of the definitive book on 
			the Woodsboro murders.!
			  (a beat)
			What about you?

				DEWEY
			What about me?

				GALE
			You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only 
			place that's real!'  But now you're here.  
			Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited 
			until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, 
			it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is 
			like seven everywhere else.

				DEWEY
			So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a 
			month? L.A Forever?

				GALE
			It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I
			could've been the next Diane Sawyer!

				DEWEY
			What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers?  
			I liked her! 

				GALE
			It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.

				DEWEY
			You used to say that was our strength.

				GALE
			Dewey, you're not just here because of  
			that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video 
			version of me, are you? 

				DEWEY
			Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not 
			About you.

				GALE
			All of what Dewey?  You do know something, 
			don't you?

				DEWEY
			Off the record.

				GALE
			Always.

				DEWEY
			Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a
			woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to 
			see the file on Sid, for research.

				GALE
			And?

				DEWEY
			The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name.  
			A month later, the station gets broken into, 
			the file room ransacked.

				GALE
			Someone stole Sid's file?

				DEWEY
			I already removed it.  I think someone on the 
			film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only 
			reason I came here. To make do a little 
			private investigating of my own and make sure no 
			one here was planning anything.

				GALE
			  (whips out cellular)
			I'm sorry, this is too good!

				DEWEY
			What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?

				GALE
			Right. Sorry.
			  (a beat)
			Do you think he did it?
			  (RE: ROMAN)

				DEWEY
			  (his beeper goes off)
			I've got my suspicions but still, 
			nothing  you say can ever make me take 
			my eyes off one person.

				GALE
			And who is that?

But Dewey doesn't answer. Again, he's staring daggers through Gale.  Years and 
years of bottled up resentment is finally surfacing.

				DEWEY
			Jennifer needs me.

				GALE
			Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?

				DEWEY
			I'm on duty.

Dewey races out the room. Gale pauses, stares at the interrogation. Wallace 
has reduced Roman to tears. It's pathetic. Gale bolts after Dewey.

EXT.  SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT

The wind rushes past the camera. A huge panoramic view of L.A.  FULL MOON 
hangs in the sky. A coyote howls in the near distance.

CUT TO:


EXT.  JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A nice low ranch tucked away in the valley. Dewey rolls up Jennifer's driveway 
in his truck. Gale follows behind in her VW JETTA.

				DEWEY
			  (noticing Gale)
			Stop following me.

				GALE
			I happen to work for the police god dammit!

				DEWEY
			You're not a detective.

				GALE
			Neither are you, Magnum P.I.

				DEWEY
			Gale, your engine's still running.

				GALE
			Fuck!

Dewey shakes his head in disgust, disappears into the house. Gale runs back to 
shut off her car. From out of the bushes lunges --

TOM PRINZE, loaded off his ass, still holding a half-filled bottle of JOHNNY 
WALKER BLACK LABEL SCOTCH in his hand.

				TOM
			Gale Weathers. What a surprise.

				GALE
			Tom Prinze, tanked as usual.
			That's a shocker.

				TOM
			Hey I really liked that piece you did on me
			last month. The one where you said my car
			accident was caused by me drinking and drugs,
			and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my
			insurance wouldn't sky rocket.

				GALE
			Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya.
			Stage the news to boost ratings.

				TOM
			Really, cause that stunt lost me the
			lead role in Roman Polanski's latest
			picture. Huh, what a coincide I was
			picked up by Roman Bridger. Well,
			not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get
			my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck,
			because of your big mouth I'm here,
			drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second
			rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer
			Jollie and yourself!
			  (a beat, subtle)
			Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should
			Have a look at your break line. That your
			car over there?

Gale pushes Tom's chest. Stopping him.

				GALE
			I think we should go inside. I have to have
			a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.

				TOM
			  (laughs)
			You mean what's left of us.
			  (tosses empty bottle aside)
			Yeah I'm running on empty anyways.
			Gotta refuel.

Tom and Gale walk into the house. Something stirs in the bushes.

 CUT TO:

INT.  JENNIFER JOLLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gale and Tom enter. Jennifer is crying hysterically in Dewey's arms. She sees 
Gale, looks up with anger written all over her gaudy, over rouged face, her 
make-up running in a comical, almost homage to Mimi on the Drew Carey Show.

				JENNIFER
			You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!

				GALE
			Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? 
			What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those 
			USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly 
			you suck at acting?

				JENNIFER
			God damn you Gale Weathers! 
			Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his 
			victims as they die in the script!
			Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed.
			So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so 
			his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's 
			Candy, and now me!

				GALE
			Wait a second, whoa! Calm down!
			Number one there were five different 
			versions of the script given out.
			Ben Damon was given a fake script because 
			he was only being offered the role.
			It only had fragments of real scenes from the 
			actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?

Everyone is silent. Dewey nods his head. Gale rips the script from Jennifer's 
hands.

				GALE
			  (reading script)
			AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH!
			This is complete bullshit.
			Who wrote this piece of crap?

				JENNIFER
			I know right. It was kinda weak.
			That's cause Will Kennison only wrote 
			a rough treatment of it.
			The script was written by some new guy. 
			He wrote Arlington Street.

				GALE
			Still that was a much better movie,
			I saw it at the premiere last week.
			God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked 
			with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.

A teary-eyed Angelina Tyler rises up from the couch, approaches the group.

				ANGELINA
			  (crying)
			What are you talking about?
			Because of this shit I'll probably never 
			act in a Hollywood film again.

Tom throws his arm around Angelina, squeezes her tightly.

				TOM
			Hey good looking, if you play your cards right, 
			I may be able to sit you down on my casting couch 
			and try you out for a few films my  production 
			company is working on.
			  (a beat)
			How do you feel about a DEEP THROAT remake?

Angelina squeals in disgust, elbows Tom, racing out of the house.  Tom groans, 
follows after her.

				TOM
			I'll be right back.

CUT TO:




EXT.   JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Tom walks out into the darkness, looks around. Angelina's nowherein sight.

			Angelina! Hey! Where the hell are you?
			I was only playing! Hey look, I can really
			get you a bit part! Just come on out! Ok?
			  (pauses)
			Damn it. There goes my chances of getting
			some head from her.

 Tom whips out a joint, pops it in his mouth. He lights it, walks around the 
side of the house. A noise catches his attention.   A low, muffled squealing.

				TOM
			Aaaangelina?

Tom turns to a guest house. The door is half open, darkness  spilling out. Tom 
smirks, steps inside.

   CUT TO:

 INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

 The entire small interior of the GUEST HOUSE / DEWEY'S LIVING QUARTER'S IS 
BLACKENED BY THE NIGHT. Tom cockily waltzes about, not noticing one of the 
black shadows peeling off the wall.

IT'S THE GHOST!

				TOM
			Angelina?

 Tom stops in his tracks. He looks down. Lying in a pool of blood at his feet 
is ANGELINA TYLER! Tom screams, staggers backwards right into the arms of --

  THE GHOST --

				TOM
			You fucker!

 The GHOST slashes open Tom's arm. Tom screams, backs up into the kitchen. The 
ghost grabs him by the throat, begins choking him mid-air. He slowly begins to 
lift him off his feet, angling the knife, readying to make the kill blow. Tom 
gags. He can't even scream, the killer's crushing his voice-box, causing a  
trickle of blood down his lips.

				TOM
			  (gagging)
			Fucker!

THE GHOST brings the knife down, piercing Tom's heart, pinning him to the 
closet. Tom kicks around for a moment before finally going limp. The GHOST 
steps back, admiring his work.

  CUT TO:

INT.  JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jennifer, Gale, and Dewey are pacing around nervously.

				JENNIFER
			Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?

				GALE
			 I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important 
			is that we stick together.
			 No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.

				DEWEY
			What about Sidney?

				JENNIFER
			What about her?

Suddenly, a knock at the door. The three are startled. Dewey looks at the 
front door.

				DEWEY
			Ssh. Maybe it's Tom or Angelina.
			I'll get it.

				JENNIFER
			What if it's the killer?

				GALE
			Oh use your brain drama queen!
			Do the killers ever knock on the fucking door? 
			Ever see Jason do that before burying an axe in 
			some big titted blonde's head? Or maybe Michael or 
			Chucky? Huh?

Jennifer sticks her tongue out at Gale. Dewey reaches into a holster tucked 
away under his jacket, drawing up his 9mm.

				DEWEY
			Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.

				GALE
			Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!

Dewey nods his head, slowly makes his way towards the door. Gale and Jennifer 
huddle together, follow close behind.

				JENNIFER
			Do you smell something?

				DEWEY
			  (smirking)
			It's Gale. She farts when she gets nervous.

Gale makes an angry face, slaps Dewey upside the back of his headplay fully. 
Dewey steps up to the front door. IT'S NOT LOCKED.  He reaches for the knob, 
turns it when suddenly --

THE POWER SIZZLES OUT!

EVERYONE SCREAMS!

				DEWEY
			Alright don't panic! Just a fuse.

Dewey throws open the door. ANGELINA'S CORPSE drops into the doorway. A 
SYMPHONY OF SCREAMS.

				DEWEY
			Hurry! Everyone out the back way! Now!

Dewey, Gale, and Jennifer race for the French doors in the living room leading 
outside to the pool and backyard. A PHONE RINGS somewhere in the house.

				GALE
			Who's phone?

				JENNIFER
			Oh shit it's my cell!

				DEWEY
			Answer it!

Jennifer answers her cellular.

				JENNIFER
			  (into phone)
			Hello?

				VOICE
			Hello Jennifer. Wanna play a little game?

				JENNIFER
			It's him! It's the killer!

 Gale rips the phone out of Jennifer's hands.

				GALE
			  (into phone)
			Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck
			do you want?

				JENNIFER
			What's your favorite scary movie Gale?

				GALE
			I dunno but I can tell you that your's
			will be the home video footage of me
			sticking my foot up your ass! Now come
			out and fight like a real man you pussy!

				GHOST(O.S.)
			I just might!

THE GHOST comes running out of closet, knife swinging wildly. Jennifer 
screams, races for the patio door. The ghost lunges for Gale. Dewey draws up 
his gun, fires.

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The GHOST takes six slugs
In the chest.  He goes smashing through a coffee table, motionless. Dewey 
backs into Gale's arms, smoke rising fromthe muzzle of the gun.

				JENNIFER
			God damn it you two! Run! Hurry!
			He's dead!

				GALE
			No! He's not dead! He's still breathing!
			Look!

				DEWEY
			Gale he's dead. Come on. Let's get out
			of here.

Dewey turns Gale towards the patio door. A noise O.S. Dewey pauses, turns 
around --

THE GHOST IS GONE.

Dewey looks to the patio door.

SO IS JENNIFER.

				DEWEY
			OH. OH GOD. GALE --

				GALE
			What?

				DEWEY
			  (screaming)
			GALE BEHIND YOU!

The ghost barrels out from under the couch, knife raised. Dewey winds back, 
kicks a chair out in the Ghost's path. The ghost trips, goes crashing through 
the chair, coming smashing down onto the floor, knife burying into the 
hardwood. Dewey and Gale run for the patio when suddenly --

JENNIFER comes dodging out of the kitchen wielding a butcher knife.

				JENNIFER
			(screaming)
			DIE MOTHER FUCKER!
			DIE! DIE! DIE!

Jennifer slips on something, goes backflipping to the ground. Gale grabs her. 
Helps her up.

				GALE
			Come on!

THE GHOST comes to life, grabbing a lighter off an end table. He lights  a 
trail of gasoline, running from the floor to the kitchen (i.e. the smell 
Jennifer mentioned earlier and what she slipped on seconds ago). A HUGE flame 
trail lunges towards the two women. They scream.

				DEWEY
			OH SHIT! RUN!

CUT TO:

EXT.  BACKYARD - JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jennifer, Gale, and Dewey take off out the patio doors when suddenly KA-BOOM! 
THE WINDOWS BLOW OUT! THE ROOF SPLINTERS.

A HUGE CONFLAGRATION! The three dive into the swimming pool as debris rains 
down onto the Earth.

THE GHOST --

WATCHES FROM THE SHADOWS, FLAMES BOUNCING OFF HIS PALLID WHITE MASK.

SIRENS ARE HEARD IN THE NEAR DISTANCE.

AS THE GHOST RUNS OFF INTO THE NIGHT, HE DROPS ANOTHER NEWSPAPER CLIPPING ON

 WE ARE:

INT.  DETECTIVE KINCAID'S OFFICE - DAY

DETECTIVE KINCAID paces around his room. A battered and bruised Dewey and Gale 
sit beside his desk in Police Uniforms (since their old clothes has obviously 
been drenched).

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Whoever it is, now is taking credit 
			for Maureen Prescott's murder. 

				GALE
			But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, 
			Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they 
			even told Sidney how they did it!  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in 
			your book that Sidney got it wrong before.  
			She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, 
			and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a 
			third killer.  Sidney Might know something 

Kincaid's eyes appear as if questioning Dewey.

				DEWEY
			I told you, I don't know where Sidney is.  
			And even if there was a third killer, 
			Sidney doesn't know about it.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley,
			she is a key element in this case.  I have a press 
conference 
			in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead 
			celebrities.

				GALE
			Four? There are five.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling.
			Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned 
			how to count.

				DEWEY
			What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Police are still searching through the debris.
			Could be days before we find her . . . that is,
			if she's even there.

Kincaid seems to be getting a morbid charge out of all of this. He smirks ever 
so nefariously at Dewey.

				GALE
			OK, look.  We all know that this has something to 
			do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the 
			killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Actually, there was more this time.
			This time, we found a picture too.

				DEWEY/GALE
			  (together)
			What?

Kincaid holds up a second ziplocked evidence bag. Within is a blurry 5x4 of 
MAUREEN PRESCOTT exiting a motel room with COTTON WEARY. Kincaid turns it 
over. Also, written on it's back is 'I KILLED HER'

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Before you jump to conclusions, the man in 
			the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country 
			on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's
			got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's
			supposedly the biggest thing down under since
			Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.

				DEWEY
			What does this have to do with Sid?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her
			own daughter?

				DEWEY
			Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he 
			was married to Maureen.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			   (chiming in)
			What's your problem?  Last night you were almost 
			charcoal.  You gonna help us or what?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Do you wanna have this conversation with a polygraph?

				DEWEY
			Is that a threat, Detective?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			When it's a threat, you'll know it.

				DEWEY
			  (a beat)
			Is that a threat?

				GALE
			Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers 
			later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either 
			Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going 
			to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?

The two run into each other's arms, embrace tightly.

				DEWEY
			What are you doing here? I told you to

				SIDNEY
			Well it's not safe for me up there either.
			The killer found me Dewey. He called me

				DEWEY
			What?

				SIDNEY
			I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up

				DEWEY
			There's someone here who wants to help.

				GALE
			Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.

				SIDNEY 
			Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.

For a change, instead of an exchange of fists, the two share a warm hug.

				GALE
			Thank you.

				DEWEY
			Sid, this is detective Kincaid.  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Nice to finally meet you, Sidney. 

				DEWEY
			The killer called her.  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			What?  When?

				GALE
			What'd he say?

				SIDNEY
			Oh, you know, the usual small talk, 
			"What's new, how ya been, how do you want 
			to die?"  

				DEWEY
			Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've 
			gotten your number?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			He could've monitored the calls on a scanner.  
			Did you call her from the set?  

				DEWEY
			No.

				GALE
			Do you have her number stored in your memory?
			  (Dewey thinks)
			Phone memory!

				DEWEY
			Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.

				GALE
			Has anyone else every used your phone?

				DEWEY
			Just Jennifer.  
			   (To Kincaid_) 
			And you.  


				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Hey, I'm the cop here.  You're in my office, Riley.

Sidney notices the clippings and the photograph of Maureen.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each
			murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo
			of your mother. 

				SIDNEY
			Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey.  
			Why didn't you say something?

				DEWEY
			I was afraid they were bait, something to, 
			ya know,  trick you out of hiding.

			Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio

			Are you sure?

A figure lunges out of nowhere, startling all three of them. It's a young,

This is KAREN COLCHECK, 22. She holds something in her hand, a video tape 
marked SCARY MOVIES 101.

			Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me!

 WE ARE:

INT. TRAILER - STUDIO LOT - DAY

Sidney, Gale, Karen, and Dewey are gathered around the inside of the small, 
cramped trailer watching the tape. 

				SIDNEY
			 Oh MY god.

				RANDY
			Well, if you're watching this tape, it means 
			as I feared, I did not survive these killings 
			here at Windsor College.   Anyway, the reason 
			I am here is to help you, so that my death 
			will not be in vain.  That my life's work, will 
			help save some other poor soul from getting mutilated.  
			If this killer does come back, and he's for real, 
			there are a few things that you gotta remember.  
			Is this simply another sequel?  Well, if it is, same 
			rules apply.  But, here's the critical thing.  If you 
			find yourself dealing with an unexpected backstory, 
			and a preponderance of exposition,  then the sequel 
			rules do not apply.  Because you are not dealing 
			with a sequel, you are dealing with the concluding 
			chapter of a trilogy.

				DEWEY
			A trilogy?


				RANDY
			That's right.  It's a rarity in the horror field, 
			but it does exist, and it's a force to be reckoned 
			with, because true trilogies are all about going back 
			to the beginning and discovering something that wasn't 
			true from the get go.  'Godfather', 'Jedi', all revealed 
			something that we thought was true, that wasn't true.   So 
			if it is a trilogy you are dealing with, here are some 
			super trilogy rules.   One, you got a killer who's gonna be 
			super human.  Stabbing him won't work, shooting him 
			won't work, basically in the third one, you gotta 
			cryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him 
			up.   Number two; anyone including the main character can 
			die.  This means you, Sid.  I'm sorry, it's the final 
			chapter.  It can be fuckin  'Reservoir Dogs' by the 
			time this thing is through.  Number three; the past 
			will come back to bite you in the ass!  Whatever you 
			think you know about the past, forget it.  The past is 
			not at rest, any sins you think were committed in 
			the past are about to break out and destroy you. NUMBER 
			FOUR,Never, ever under any circumstances go running off 
			by yourself, cause if Friday the 13th has taught us 
			anything, it's that the next time we're gonna see you, 
			you're gonna have a fence post jutting out from your 
			back. So in closing, let me say good luck, God Speed, 
			and for some of you, I'll see you soon, cause the rules 
			say, some of you ain't gonna make it.  I didn't, not 
			if you're watching this tape.

Jennifer opens the door, steps in first. Gale follows, door closing ominously 
behind them with a loud CLACK.

CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT HALLWAY - ARCHIVES - DAY

Gale leads the way down the dark hall.

				JENNIFER
			Basements creep me out.

				GALE
			Really, you know you'd make a fascinating
			interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.

				JENNIFER
			Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more
			homes than I do.

				GALE
			  (smiling)
			Oh I wish I got that one on tape.
			It'd put a smile on my face everytime
			I'm down.

				JENNIFER
			  (underbreath)
			Bitch.

The two turn the corner, stepping into -

INT.  CLERICAL AREA - ARCHIVES - DAY

BIANCA BERNADETTE, an aging, former actress in her late forties, early 
fifties, sits behind a desk doing paperwork.

Sensing someone else's presence she stops what she is doing and looks up at 
Gale and Jennifer.

				BIANCA
			Can I help you?

				GALE
			I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro 
			and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman 
			for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?

Bianca shakes her head "no".

				BIANCA
			I don't watch TV and I hate books.
			Whatta you need?

				GALE
			Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?

				BIANCA
			Nope.

				GALE
			  (groans)
			Well can you tell me if the woman in this 
			picture looks familiar to you.

Gale reaches into her pocket, slams down the picture of Sid's mom on Bianca's 
desk. Bianca looks up, totally unenthused.

				BIANCA
			Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those 
			files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?

				GALE
			Well if you won't work for me, will you work 
			for the president?

Gale slaps a twenty dollar bill on the desk. Bianca looks up, a bit insulted, 
slides the money back.

				BIANCA
			The president . . . of the studio.

				JENNIFER
			Twenty dollars? Who are you Nancy Drew?

Jennifer turns to Bianca, slides off her ring. She slams the ring onto the 
desk. It's absolutely stunning.

				JENNIFER
			Go ahead. It's worth three grand easy.
			  (to Gale)
			My Gale Weather's will stop at nothing to get the story.

How can Bianca resist. She smiles, takes the ring, slips it on her finger.

				BIANCA
			Follow me.

Gale reaches for her Twenty. Bianca slaps her hand, takes it, folding it up, 
sliding it between her cleavage.

 CUT TO:

INT. FILE ROOM - ARCHIVES - DAY

				BIANCA
			  (staring at picture, flipping through file cabinet)
			I know every face in here, respect for the unknown
			actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking
			for Maureen Prescott --

				GALE
			  (interrupting)
			 It may be Maureen Reynolds --

				BIANCA
			Well you'll find neither.
			Rina Reynolds, however,
			You will.

				JENNIFER
			  (smiling)
			Rina Reynolds. What a stage name.

				BIANCA
			You should talk, Judy Jurgenstein.

Gale takes the folder from Bianca, opens it up. Inside are 8x10 headshots of 
MAUREEN PRESCOTT when she was younger. Behind the pictures is a Xeroxed 
listing of the films she's starred in.

				 GALE
			What are these movies? 'Amazombies',
			'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?

				BIANCA
			Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.

				GALE/JENNIFER
			  (together)
			What?

				BIANCA
			You know, JOHN MILTON, the horror producer?
			Those were some of his early flicks.

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - SUNRISE STUDIOS - DAY

Sidney stands beside Dewey and Detective Wallace.

				SIDNEY
			Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.

				DEWEY
			Do you want me to come with you Sid?
			I mean, remember what Randy said?

				SIDNEY
			No I'll be ok. I've got my mace.
			My knife.
			  (smiles, raises up her fists)
			These two lethal weapons.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Sure you don't need a police escort?
			That's what we're here for.

				SIDNEY
			No really, I'll be fine.

Dewey and Wallace nod. Sid begins to walk towards the soundstage.

				SIDNEY
			I'll be right back.

 CUT TO:

INT.  LADIES ROOM - SOUNDSTAGE BUILDING - DAY

Sidney stands at the sink washing her face. She shuts off the water reaches 
for a paper towel when suddenly, something catches her ear. Almost as if a 
man's whisperedher name 'Siiiiiddney'. Sid turns around, stares at the empty 
bathroom.

				SIDNEY
			H-hello? Anyone there?

Silence. Sid reaches into her pocket book, draws out a Gravity Knife. She 
flips open the blade, crouches down on her knees, scanning the row of stalls 
for feet.
What a relief . . . none. Sid smiles, dismisses what she thought she heard 
when she sees --

THE RUMBLING AIR CONDITIONING UNIT.

Sidney goes back to drying her face when suddenly --

				MAN(O.S.)
			  (whisper)
			Sidney.

This time it's apparent. There's somebody else in the bathroom. Sid begins to 
make her way towards the bathroom door when suddenly --

WHAM! A STALL door flies open. THE GHOST charging out at full-force. Sid hits 
the deck, sliding across the floor, deflecting the blow from the knife as the 
killer buries it into the sink counter. Sid races for the door, killer hot on 
her trail. SUDDENLY --

WHAM! The storage closet door flies open and a second GHOST comes charging 
out, knife gleaming. He dives for Sid. Sid takes up her knife, buries it in 
her attacker's shoulder. The GHOST goes reeling back into the closet. Sidney 
slams the door closed on him. She dives for the door knob when suddenly, the 
first ghost comes running back at her. She ducks as he swings his knife, 
burying it into the bathroom door. Sid bolts across the bathroom towards a 
tiny window in the far corner of the ceiling. Using the trash as a booster, 
she leaps up, slides open the window, and dives out, just as the deadly pair 
of attackers come back for more.

CUT TO:

EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY

Sidney comes charging around the corner of the soundstage building. She looks 
up, realizing she's just ran herself into a dead end.

				SIDNEY
			  (crying)
			Shit.

BAM! An exit door flies open. The GHOST comes charging out. Sidney screams, 
runs for a wooden fence. She begins to scale it, dropping over on the other 
side just as the killer pierces through it with his knife. Sid takes off 
running for WALLACE and DEWEY.

WALLACE AND DEWEY,

HEARING THE SCREAMS, spin around, drawing out their guns.  Wallace looks at 
Dewey.

				DEWEY
			  (re:gun)
			Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.

				SIDNEY
			  (hysterical)
			Jesus Christ Dewey help me!
			They tried to kill me in the bathroom!
			The killers!

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Wait a second? Killers? There's two
			of them now? Aw shit!

Wallace whips out his cellular, dials a number. Sidney falls into Dewey's 
arms, collapsing like a house of cards, crying hysterically.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			  (into phone)
			Yeah this is Wallace. We got a problem   down 
			here on the Sunrise Studios lot.
			No not another one. At least not yet.
			Yeah we've had an attack.
			  (to Sid)
			Do you need medical assistance?
			  (Sid nods her head 'no')
			No. Oh really. Alright, see you in a minute.

 Wallace closes up his phone.

				DEWEY
			What?

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Well I got some good news in a way.
			Roman Bridger didn't make those calls
			To Sarah Darling. Police let him go.
			Here's the bad news: The cellular was
			cloned, it's untraceable. We now have
			no suspects.

				GALE(O.S.)
			Dew!

Dewey and Sidney turn around to see an excited Jennifer   and Gale race into 
frame.

				GALE
			Sidney, what happened?

				DEWEY
			Nevermind, what'd you two find?


				GALE
			We did some researching in the archives.
			Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the
			book on your mother's murder. For two years
			of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically
			disappeared off the face of the Earth.

				SIDNEY
			What are you talking about?

				JENNIFER
			We've found out where she went.


				GALE
			She was an actress Sidney. Minor
			B-Movies. But now we have a new
			suspect in this twisted fucking
			web . . . John Milton.


				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			The head of the studio?


				GALE
			It makes sense doesn't it? It's his
			big grandiose swan song from the genre.
			What a better way to end than with a bloodbath?


				JENNIFER
			Sidney, what happened?


				SIDNEY
			I was attacked in the bathroom.


				DEWEY
			Wallace, shouldn't you be investigating
			the bathroom?


				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			  (looks at building)
			I'm waiting for back-up.
			I don't carry bullets in my
			gun unless I know I'm gonna use em.

 Dewey nods suspiciously.  Kincaid comes rushing into  frame.


				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened?
			I got a call on my cell from home.
			They told me that someone was attacked.

				DEWEY
			And what made you think it was Sidney?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			  (glaring)
			Sid, get in my car. You're coming   
			back to the station with me where it's   
			safe.

				GALE
			Dewey, Jennifer, I think we should pay     
			John Milton a little visit.

				DEWEY/JENNIFER
			  (together)
			Agreed.

INT.  JOHN MILTON'S OFFICE - DAY

Milton's on the phone with Roman.

				MILTON
			  (into phone)
			Roman I know you're upset. But there will
			be other movies. I know. Ah, VARIETY called
			you a Pariah? Well fuck them. I got a great
			script on my desk. It's called TRAGIC
			 MENAGE TRIOS and it was written by
			John Sayles. I'm thinking you for Director.
			What?
			  (knock at the door)
			Come in.
			  (into phone) 
			No, not to you Roman.
			Look I'll talk to you later. Bye.

Milton hangs up as Gale, Jennifer, and Dewey barge intohis office.

				DEWEY
			So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.

			MILTON
			Just what the hell do you people think
			you're doing, barging in here like this?
			I've got important calls to make. I run
			this studio.

				GALE
			Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?

				MILTON
			Who?

				JENNIFER
			Rina Reynolds.

				MILTON
			Do you know how many actors have worked
			for me? Hundreds, thousands. 

				GALE
			Nobody said she was an actor.

				JENNIFER
			Good twist.
 
				MILTON 
			What's your point?

				DEWEY
			No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.

				MILTON
			I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple 
			of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?

				JENNIFER
			Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story 
			of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and 
			you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!  

				GALE
			Settle down Beavis.
			  (to Milton)
			Why don't you tell us the truth?


				MILTON
			What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror 
			films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me 
			with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.  

				DEWEY
			But you know who she was.

				MILTON
			When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd 
			known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina.  
			I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?  

				GALE
			And now? I mean, murders on your set and 
			still you say nothing?

				MILTON
			Get real, that would make me a suspect!

				GALE
			Just because you knew her?

				MILTON
			Yeah.

				GALE
			I don't think so!  Just what happened to 
			Maureen when she was in Hollywood?

				MILTON
			Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go.  
			It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller 
			out behind the barn and shot him in the head a 
			long time ago.

				GALE
			Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug
			up and drug all over National TV? Why don't
			you start talking.

				MILTON
			It was in the 70's, everything was different.  
			I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were.  
			It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get 
			them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing 
			happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or 
			another, no matter what she said afterwards.

				GALE
			Are you saying she was-

				MILTON
			I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they 
			did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth 
			is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges 
			were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds 
			wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in 
			Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.

INT.   DETECTIVE KINCAID'S OFFICE - DAY

Kincaid stands at his desk trying to put the pieces of this puzzle together. 
Sidney's seated beside him, staring at a stack of books on 'SCRIPT WRITING and 
SELLING YOUR WORK IN HOLLYWOOD'.

				SIDNEY
			What do you know about trilogies?  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			You mean like, movie trilogies?

				SIDNEY
			You seem to like movies, Detective.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep 
			calling you Sidney.

				SIDNEY
			I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, 
			Detective.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, 
			all bets are off.

				SIDNEY
			  (noticing a huge file on her)
			Did you request this case?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal 
			with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my 
			way around the studios.  

				SIDNEY
			Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			To me Hollywood is about death.

				SIDNEY
			Excuse me?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you   
			see what I see day in and day out, the violence that 
			people do to each other, you get haunted.  
			I think you know about that.  

				SIDNEY
			What do you mean?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't  
			Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head,  
			whether you want to or not,  watching it alone. 

				SIDNEY
			Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop 
			being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, 
			you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, 
			Miss Prescott.

				SIDNEY
			Hmm.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			What did you know about your mother?

				SIDNEY
			I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect 
			family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a 
			secret life, and I tried to understand that, and 
			soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' 
			know who my mom was.
			  (a beat)
				Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my 
			mother for the first time. You know, with TV and 
			those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel 
			like I'm just learning about myself for the first 
			time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			  (a long beat)
			Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. 
			That's good news.

				SIDNEY
			How is that good news?

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, 
			flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle 
			guys like that.

				SIDNEY
			Oh yeah, how?  

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Catch him, or kill him. 

Kincaid readies himself to leave. He snags up his holstered gun, his car keys, 
jacket, etc.

				SIDNEY
			Hey Detective?  What's your favorite scary movie?


Detective Kincaid pauses, he leans over Sidney's chair, his penetrating eyes 
glaring right into hers.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			  (sotto)
			My life.

Kincaid exits, door slamming shut behind him. A beat, then --

				SIDNEY
			Mine too.

 INT.  RECEPTION AREA - MILTON'S OFFICE - SUNSET

Milton steps out of his office into his reception area.  Secretary's gone for 
the night. Milton starts out of the office, disappears. 

CLOSE ON A COAT CLOSET.

The door creaks open. Gale, Jennifer, and Dewey emerge from the darkness. 
Jennifer is gagging.

				JENNIFER
			Oh God Gale, Dewey was right.
			Stop getting so nervous and you
			might stop causing me to gag!

				DEWEY/GALE
			  (together)
			SHUT UP!

Jennifer's quiet.

				JENNIFER
			I think Milton's the killer.
			I think he just went out to kill another cast member.

				 GALE
			Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert.
			 He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack
			-off parties he has with his two best friends.

				JENNIFER
			 Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?

				GALE

			Do you get any of my witty humor?
			I mean, you did play me for three movies.

Dewey leans into Milton's office door, slowly opens it. Darkness spills out. 
The three disappear inside it.

INT.  HALLWAY - BUILDING - NIGHT

Milton's walking down the hallway. It's dark. Desolate. CAMERA tracks along 
the paisley velvet carpet as a phone rings O.S.

IT'S MILTON'S CELL. He answers it, pushes the elevator 'up' button anxiously.

				MILTON
			  (into phone)
			John Milton.

				VOICE
			Wanna play a game?

				MILTON
			Who is this?

				VOICE
			You tell me. You bankrolled three  movies about me.

				MILTON
			 It's you. The saboteur whose been fucking up my movie!
			  (a beat)
			 I swear to God if you don't stop I'll find you and 
			have you killed! I shut down production on that piece of 
			shit STAB 3! We had a no talent director and the 
			lousiest Sidney Prescott on the planet but that was 
			besides the point! You still killed MY movie! A John 
			Milton film! And if you ever try and cross me again you'll
			be sorry. My next movie is gonna be a grandiose step up 
			from this slasher shit! It's a film written and directed 
			by John Sayles.

Milton's going rapid fire.

				VOICE
			Oh poor John. There's not gonna be another film. 
			Well, at least not for you.


THE ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS with a ping. A flash of silver and in an instant, 
John's throat is slashed open, spilling blood. His corpse thuds to the ground. 
A pair of gloved hands drag him into the elevator. A moments pause and then--

THE GHOST storms out, disappearing down the hall.

THE ELEVATOR DOORS CLOSE ON MILTON'S CORPSE.

 CUT TO:

INT.  MILTON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Gale's trying to get a locked drawer on Milton's desk open. It won't budge. 
Dewey steps into frame, flashlight in hand. He shines the light down on the 
lock.

				DEWEY
			Hold on Gale, I'm a pro at this.

Dewey leans in, bumping his head with Gale's.

				GALE
			Oh Dewey I'm sorry.

The two look at each other and smile. Dewey laughs sweetly. Gale reaches up, 
rubs his head.

				GALE
			Here. Let me --

JENNIFER, chimes in. Clearly annoyed.

				JENNIFER
			Excuse me Gale! What the hell   
			do you think you're doing?

Gale and Dewey can't help gazing into each other's eyes. In an instant it 
almost seems as if a long lost love has been sparked back to life.

				DEWEY
			  (shaking it off)
			Let's get this drawer open.
			If it's locked, there must be something  
			inside he's trying to hide.

Dewey takes the butt of the flashlight, brings it down  hard on the locked 
drawer. The lock's smashed off.

				GALE
			Shit. That's gonna leave a mark.

Gale slides open the drawer, reaches in. She pulls up a manilla folder. Dewey 
shines the light on the folder as Gale opens it up and reads what's inside.

				JENNIFER
			What? What'd you find?

Gale's eyes widen.

				GALE
			Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never 
			going to believe who Milton's kid is. 

				DEWEY
			Who is it?

				JENNIFER
			  (nervously)
			Guys! I got a bad feeling.

				DEWEY/GALE

			NOT NOW!

				JENNIFER
			Guys there's someone else in the fucking room!

				DEWEY
			Huh?

Dewey and Gale look up and scream as --

THE GHOST rushes out of the shadows. Jennifer bolts for the door. The GHOST 
jams his knife in her back. She lets out a blood curdling death scream, drops 
to the floor motionless. GALE and DEWEY share a terrified scream. The killer 
wipes his blade clean, lunges for them.

				DEWEY
			  (frantic)
			Gale run!

Dewey jumps in the killer's path. The killer winds back, cracks the base of 
the knife across Dewey's skull. Dewey drops to the floor unmoving.

				GALE
			  (screaming)
			Dewey!

CLANG! The Killer's blade glistens in the moonlight. He charges for Gale. Gale 
screams, races out of the office door, slamming it closed on the killer 
sending him flying onto his back.

  CUT TO:

INT.  HALLWAY - OFFICES - NIGHT

Gale races down the hallway, frantically trying every door she passes. All of 
them locked. She reaches the elevator, hits the "down" button.  The door opens 
with a ping. Gale unleashes a horrendous scream --

MILTON --

--has been strung up from the ceiling ventilation duct, gutted from knob to 
gullet. His entrails lie in steaming heaps at his feet. 

GALE staggers away from the elevator, speechless. She screams again.

HER GHOSTLY ATTACKER is coming straight for her.

GALE fakes out the killer, dives into the elevator. He runs ahead, briefly, 
giving Gale enough time to trip him sending him landing flat on his face. Gale 
races out of the elevator doubles back down the hallway towards a door marked 
"stairs". She bolts through the door.

Gale races out of the office building. A car horn blares. She screams.

KINCAID jams on his breaks, gets out his car. He draws up his gun.

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Jesus Gale what happened?

				GALE
			  (frantic)
			He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!
			  (realizing)
			DEWEY! Dewey's in there too!
			He needs medical help!
			He's hurt!

				DETECTIVE KINCAID
			Alright, calm down. I'm going  
			to radio in for backup right now.

				VOICE(O.S.)
			Not so fast. We're not finished.

Kincaid spins around. Gale screams. The GHOST comes charging out of nowhere, 
slashes open Kincaid's throat, stabs him in the chest. Kincaid drops onto the 
hood of his car, dead.

GALE pauses. She's screaming hysterically. The killer raises the knife 
menacingly.

				VOICE
			I wouldn't run if I were you Gale.
			It's only gonna end up with you getting
			Skewered like a fucking pig. I need you.

				GALE
			  (nervously)
			Awfully late time to be doing an interview.

Gale closes her eyes, cries as the killer stalks towards her.

INT.  DETECTIVE KINCAID'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sidney sits in Kincaid's office flipping through the folder marked 'SIDNEY 
PRESCOTT' It's loaded with newspaper articles and police reports and is 
basically a scrapbook of obsession. Sidney smirks. Kincaid has drawn little 
magic marker hearts around a picture of her. She's awakened from her daydream.

			The question isn't who I am.  The question is, 
			who's with me. 

				GALE
			  (screaming)
			Sidney, stay away!

Sid's face floods with fear. She rushes towards the office door when suddenly, 
the voice draws her back, angrily and cautioning.

				VOICE
			Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract 
			attention, one thing, I'll kill them both.   
			Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?

				SIDNEY
			Yes.

				VOICE
			Go there.

Sidney stands up, goes into an inner office, Wallace's.

				VOICE
			Always hard being friends with you, Sidney.  
			When you're friends with Sidney, you die!  
			Well these friends don't have to, Sidney.  
			It's up to you.  

				SIDNEY
			How do I know their voices are --

				VOICE
			Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things?  
			How do you know I'm not someone in your head?  
			Somewhere, you know.  

				DEWEY
			  (frantic)
			Don't come here Sidney!  

We hear the killer haul back and hit Dewey hard.

				GALE
			Dewey! No!

				VOICE
			Or do you?  

				SIDNEY
			You're dead!

				VOICE
			I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. 
			You show yourself, they survive, you run, 
			they die! 

				GALE
			Oh God!  Oh God!

				VOICE
			Don't you want to know Sidney? Don't you want to 
			know who killed her?  Don't you want to know who 
			killed your mother? 

				COP(O.S.)
			Have you seen Kincaid?

				 COP 2(O.S.)
			NO.  But Wallace is around.

				SIDNEY
			Where?

				VOICE
			She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.

				SIDNEY
			WHERE?

				VOICE
			I'll call you, when you're on your way.  

Click. The killer hangs up. Sidney breaks down crying.

				SIDNEY
			Fuck!

Wallace's keys rest on his desk. Sid ponders, takes them. She stands up when 
something inside her makes her open Wallace's drawer and dig around. She pulls 
up a fully loaded handgun.

That's the ticket. She closes the drawer, slinks out the side exit.

  CUT TO:

INT.  WALLACE'S CAR - NIGHT

Sid speeds through rain-slicked streets. Her cellular rings.

				SIDNEY
			  (into phone)
			Yeah?

				VOICE
			You follow directions good.
			Now let's wrap this production.
			Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot.
			I'll call you when you get there.

Click. The killer hangs up.

   CUT TO:


EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS LOT - NIGHT

Sid parks Wallace's car alongside the studio gates. She gets out, stands on 
the hood of the car, begins to scale the wrought-iron fence.

     CUT TO:

EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - NIGHT

Sidney creeps through the darkened, abandon lot. Again, her cellular rings. 
Again, she answers it.

				SIDNEY
			  (into phone)
			Alright, I'm here. Now what?

				VOICE
			You're doing real good. Can't
			you figure it out? I wanna finish
			this where it all began. Woodsboro.

				SIDNEY
			I thought you wanted me here?

Click the killer hangs up. Sid pockets her phone. She looks up, and is 
startled out of fright.  Posted alongside the sound stageis a huge production 
poster for STAB 3 with a life-size GHOST wielding a big knife. Sid knows she's 
in the right place. The door leading inside is half-open. Sid taps the 
holstered gun, slowly steps into the darkness.

  CUT TO:

INT.  STAB 3 SETS - NIGHT

Sidney enters. She pauses. As a million things rush through her mind. To her 
this is like the ultimate return. Everything appears as she last remembers. 
Sid steps through the dark sets. Her phone rings. She answers it.

				SIDNEY
			  (into phone)
			Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can 
			finish this.

				VOICE
			It's good to see you again Sidney.
			I was growing real impatient.
			Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.

The killer hangs up. Sid pockets the phone. She walks past the MACHER GARAGE 
set. Instead of a foam TATUM body dangling from the doggy door, it's KINCAID'S 
CORPSE! Sidney flinches, covers her eyes. She walks on.

INT.  BECKER HOUSE - SET - NIGHT

Sid steps through the living room of the BECKER set. It mirrors the house 
perfectly. Everything from the shattered patio door to the burnt Jiffy Pop is 
there. Sid's phone rings. She answers it.

				SIDNEY
			Yeah?

				DEWEY(O.S.)
			  (off phone)
			Help me Sid! The killer's got me!

				 SIDNEY
			Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!

				DEWEY(O.S.)
			Sid I can see you!

				SIDNEY
			Where are you Dewey?

				DEWEY(O.S.)
			I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid!
			The killer's looking for you!
			Quick untie me!

Sid bolts through the shattered patio door out onto the backyard set. Seated 
before a heated in ground pool, tied to a patio chair, beaten and gagged, is 
DEWEY RIELLY. He's unconscious and almost appears at first glance like STEVEN 
ORTH from SCREAM. Sid's jaw drops. This can't be possible. She looks down at 
the phone.

				DEWEY(O.S.)
			Good work Sid. 

Sid screams, dropping the phone out of fright. She turns around coming face to 
face with --

THE GHOST 

HE STANDS in the patio doorway. A monstrous version of the voice-changing box 
in hand. He raises up the box, clicks a button and speaks.

				GHOST
			  (Sid's voice)
			You play a good game Sidney.
			Now it's time to get down to business.

				SIDNEY
			Who are you?

				GHOST
			  (click-now he's Maureen's voice)
			Your other half.

 The GHOST rushes Sid. She screams, takes off running. She bolts across the 
darkened set, running straight up the front porch of a mock-up of her own 
childhood home. She swings open the front door, slams it closed. 

INT.  PRESCOTT HOUSE - SET - NIGHT

Sid locks and bolts the front door. She backs away from it as the killer 
begins to pounce against it, struggling to get inside. Sid hears something 
upstairs. Like muffled cries. She races up to investigate.

CUT TO:

INT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - SET - NIGHT

Sid enters the set of her bedroom, slowly drawing out the gun she stole from 
Kincaid's office.

LYING on the bed, bound and gagged, is --

GALE WEATHERS

				SIDNEY
			GALE!

Sid races over, removes the gag from Gale's mouth.

				GALE
			Christ Sidney hurry up!
			That fucking lunatic is coming!

Sid fumbles with the bindings, manages to untie Gale. Gale sits up.

				SIDNEY
			Gale he's got Dewey!

				GALE
			I know! He killed Kincaid!

				SIDNEY
			I know!

				GALE
			Let's get out of here!

				SIDNEY
			   (screaming)
			GALE WATCHOUT!

KER-SMASH! The GHOST launches himself through the upstairs window. Gale and 
Sidney bolt for the bedroom door, killer hot on their tails.

 CUT TO:

DEWEY --

Dewey comes around. He lets his head loll for a moment before finally 
beginning to pull and tug on his bindings.

EXTREMELY CLOSE on Dewey freeing one of his hands from the heavy duct tape.

 CUT TO:

INT.  MAUREEN'S BEDROOM - PRESCOTT HOUSE SET - NIGHT

Gale and Sidney run into the master bedroom set, slamming the door shut and 
locking it. Sid looks around, her head already swimming from the chaos 
outside. However, what's inside utterly horrifies her. The walls, the 
furniture and the bed are splattered with blood. On the bed lies a corpse in a 
black rubber body bag (supposedly Maureen's body). The door buckles under the 
killer's blows. Gale and Sidney scream. They can't hold out much longer.

				GALE
			Jesus Christ Sidney get out of here!
			He can't get us both!

A knife splinters through the door, inches from Gale's face. She screams.

				GALE
			RUNNN!

Sid backs away, hysterical. She raises up the gun, fires into the door.  BLAM! 
BLAM! BLAM! Gale ducks out of the way. Silence.
The door ceases to move. AND THEN --

THE BODY BAG UNZIPS and the second GHOST emerges, knife in hand. The girls 
utter horrified screams. Sid raises up the gun, goes to fire when suddenly --

BAM!

The bedroom door's kicked down and the other killer enters, grabbing Sid by 
her shoulders, batting the gun from her hands.

Sid screams, punches her attacker in the chest. He winces.

The second Ghost grabs Gale, holds the knife to her throat, stopping her in 
her tracks. Sid makes a beeline for the window, leaps through the glass.

THE WINDOW SHATTERS.

Sid comes flying out onto the patio awning. She rolls over onto the astro-turf 
grass, momentarily motionless. And then she comes to. Her eyes flickering 
open, blurrily staring up at --

THE GHOST, leering out the shattered window frame.

SID stands up, takes off running towards --

THE MACHER HOUSE SET.

   CUT TO:

INT.  FOYER - MACHER HOUSE SET - NIGHT

Sid races into the foyer, slams the door closed behind her. Again, locking and 
bolting it. She looks around, everything is once again the same as it was in 
Woodsboro. This is where the climax of the original battle between good and 
evil wasfought. It's déjr vu all over again.  Footsteps O.S.

				DEWEY(O.S.)
			  (weakly)
			Sidney?

Sidney turns around --

DEWEY staggers through the living room doorway, gun in hand.

				SIDNEY
			  (eyes lighting up)
			Dewey!

Sidney embraces Dewey.

				DEWEY
			Where's Gale?

				SIDNEY
			They've got her!

				DEWEY
			Sid I want you to stay here!
			I'll be right back!
			I'm not gonna let them get Gale!

Dewey unlocks the front door, swings it open.

STANDING across the set is THE GHOST, knife raised.

				DEWEY
			  (tightening grip on gun)
			 Hold it right there you fucker!

Dewey goes to fire. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. Out of bullets.

				DEWEY
			  (nervously)
			OH shit!

THE GHOST winds back, launches the knife. It swirls through space before 
embedding into Dewey's arm, launching him back through the doorway. Sidney 
screams. Dewey's unconscious again. The GHOST races for the open door. Sid 
screams, kicks it closed. Locking and bolting it again. A crash O.S. Sid turns 
around --

A BODY rolls down the staircase, covered in blood. It comes to a halt at 
Sidney's feet, an unmoving, rumpled figure.

IT'S ANGELINA TYLER.

She's been brutally stabbed.

				SIDNEY
			  (crying)
			Oh God.

BUT ANGELINA'S EYES OPEN. A SICK RICTUS SMILE FORMING on her lips.She pulls 
out a gun, aims it at Sidney's face.

				ANGELINA
			Time to sort things out.
			Whatta you say?

CUT TO:

INT.  MACHER LIVING ROOM - SET - NIGHT

Angelina walks Sidney into the living room at gunpoint. Gale's been handcuffed 
and tossed onto the couch.

ON THE TV --

HOME VIDEO FOOTAGE of MAUREEN PRESCOTT plays.

				SIDNEY
			It's you?! All of this is because of you?

				ANGELINA
			No. Not all of it. Sid, someone really  
			wants to meet you.  

Sid tries to run, Angelina trains the gun on her. Causing her to stop in her 
tracks.

				ANGELINA
			Uh-un Sid. You're not gonna run off.
			Not now.

				VOICE(O.S.)
			You're not going anywhere Sidney.
			It's time you came to terms with me, and with  
			mother! Maybe you never knew her at all, Sid.
			Maybe you can't get past the surface of things.

The GHOST enters frame, ripping open his costume to reveal a KEVLAR bullet 
proof vest.

				SIDNEY
			Who the hell are you?

				THE GHOST
			The other half of you! I searched for a mother too, 
			an actress named Rina Reynolds. I tried to find her 
			my whole life. And four years ago I actually tracked 
			her down, knocked on her door, thinking she'd welcome 
			me back with open arms, but she had a new life and a 
			new name, Maureen Prescott! You were the only 
			child she claimed Sidney. She shut me out in the cold 
			forever, her own son!

THE GHOST rips off his mask. IT'S ROMAN. Sidney's deathly quiet.

				ROMAN 
			 Roman Bridger, director. And brother.
			  (a beat)
			She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was 
			Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, 
			what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little 
			home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, 
			mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one 
			thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, 
			that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing 
			his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And 
			once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was 
			a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case 
			you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like 
			her was making a movie.

				SIDNEY
			All the nightmares. All the hell I went through 
			was because of you, you spineless bastard!

				ROMAN
			I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, 
			Angelina over there,
			  (Angelina smiles)
			She's my partner. I can convince her to do 
			anything.  We've been dating since I met her in 
			Woodsboro.

				SIDNEY
			  (dryly)
			Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?

				ANGELINA
			That's me Sid. I always idolized you. You
			were always my hero. That's why I'm here Sidney. 
			I wanted to make you proud.

				ROMAN
			And I kinda keep her around cause it's a bit of
			a turn-on. You know, in the movies she's you Sid, so every
			time I jump her bones, I'm doing YOU, technically.

				SIDNEY
			   (repulsed)
			Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit 
			before! So lets get on with it!

				ROMAN
			Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun.
			You haven't seen the best part.
			  (pulls out tape recorder)
			With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've 
			been able to steal your voice.
			  (presses play)
			Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna 
			find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.

				SIDNEY
			   (off tape recorder)
			I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation
			of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to 
			make you all repent for your sins, and now
			I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.

Sid squirms.

				ROMAN
			   (clicking off tape recorder)
			Awesome. What'd I tell ya? Heh. Did youknow that 
			John Milton, was my daddy?
			Yep, he's the one who fucked mommy dearest in the long run.
			 His parties, his flings, exploited the Hollywood nobody!
			That's whyI had to make him pay. Daddy dearest is dead.
			Mommy's dead. Looks like I'm an orphan all alone
			in this world. What a good reason to --
			STAB MYSELF!

Roman stabs himself in the arm. He screams, goes stagger back into Angelina's 
arms.

				ROMAN
			See Sidney, as amateur as Billy and Stu were,
			they laid the groundwork for this! See Sidney,
			they also set the stage for you! Introducing
			to the world Sidney the victim! Sidney the
			survivor! Sidney the star!

Roman continues stabbing himself. In the shoulder. In the side.In the leg. 
Bleeding and hazed, he hands the gore drenched knife to Angelina.

				ROMAN
			See Sid, now comes the part where we get away
			with it! The part where we win! Cause face it
			Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!

				SIDNEY
			Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you
			kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and
			not because of any other fucking reason!

				ANGELINA
			  (screaming)
			Roman make her stop! Make her stop baby she's
			freaking me out!

				ROMAN
			   (screaming)
			God damn it Sidney!

Roman lunges at Sidney. Sid screams, takes off through the kitchen. Gale rolls 
herself off the couch. Angela runs over and kicks her in the ribs. 

				GALE
			  (coughing)
			Hey bitch, don't ever use prop cuffs to restrain 
			Gale Weathers.

Gale pops off the handcuffs.

				GALE
			  (leaping up)
			I know all the tricks!

Gale barrels into Angelina, tackling her into the coffee table before she has 
a chance to move. Angelina struggles to raise her knife.

MEANWHILE --

ROMAN,

--chases Sid into the foyer. She races past the spot where Dewey fell earlier. 
He's gone! Roman jumps at her. Sid disappears into another room.  THE CHASE 
continues.

GALE AND ANGELINA,

Continue the fight. Gale's slamming Angelina's head against the hardwood 
floor. Angelina swipes, slashing Gale along the side, deeply. Gale screams, 
begins to crawl away. She kicks Angelina in the face. Angelina drops the 
knife. Gale stands up, begins to back away.

SIDNEY--

Comes rounding into the foyer again. Roman's right behind her.

SUDDENLY,

WHAM! The laundry room door swings open and the GHOST emerges, KNIFE in hand. 
He buries the knife deep into Roman's chest, sending him flying backwards. 
Sidney screams. The ghost stops in his tracks, pulling off his mask --

IT'S ONLY DEWEY. He can barely stand up. He's bleeding profusely from his 
wounds.

Dewey and Sid embrace.

				SIDNEY
			Dewey my God I thought you were dead.

				DEWEY
			 Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.

SCREAMING O.S.  

				SIDNEY
			DEWEY! IT'S GALE!

Sidney and Dewey race into --

LIVING ROOM --

Gale's got Angelina in a headlock, right beneath the TV UNIT.

				 GALE
			  (screaming)
			THIS IS FOR THE STARDOM I NEVER HAD!
			BITCH!

Gale releases, leaps up, she pushes the TV set down onto Angelina's head. 
Angelina screams, her body trembling from the electric shocks and high 
voltage.

SID and DEWEY stand in the doorway, breathless. Gale approaches them. She and 
Dewey embrace tightly.

ANGELINA's twitching corpse goes limp.

SIDNEY, spots a gun on the mantle. She grabs it, cocks it.

--FOYER --

THE THREE SURVIVORS STEP INTO THE FOYER.  Sid looks down at Roman's corpse.

					DEWEY
			Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always 
			superhuman.

				SIDNEY
			He wasn't superhuman Dewey.
			He wasn't superhuman at all.

THEN A HORRIFYING SCREAM rips through the air.

ANGELINA comes racing out of the living room, face a blackened, Kentucky-fried 
mess. Everyone screams, one epic last scream. Sid raises up the gun, fires, 
hitting Angelina dead center between the eyes, sending a splash of blood and 
brain matter onto the wall behind her.

				GALE
			WHOA! HOLY SHIT IS THIS GONNA MAKE A GOOD BOOK!

Sid turns to Roman's lifeless body.

POV LOOKING UP ON SID TURNING THE GUN DOWN ON US --

				SIDNEY
			  (pissed)
			This shit is really getting repetitive,
			you know?

SID scrunches up her face in anger, pulls the trigger. BLAM! A CLEAN PERFECT 
SHOT TO ROMAN'S HEAD.

Sid drops the gun, walks off set.

   CUT TO:

EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS - THE NEXT MORNING

The police, fire, and ems are all on the scene of the crime.

Dewey's wheeled out of the studio on a stretcher, loaded into an ambulance.

INT.  AMBULANCE 

Gale's right beside him on a stretcher. She leans over, takes his hand.

				DEWEY
			Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what 
			if we try it out again.
			The whole relationship thing.

				GALE
			  (smiles)
			Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.

Dewey smiles. The two kiss feverishly.

 CUT TO:

WALLACE exiting his car. He surveys the damage. Sid passes him.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			Jesus Christ what happened?
			I leave for two seconds to take my
			kid to the doctor, I come back and it's
			the fucking WILD BUNCH.

				SIDNEY
			It was just something that's been itching 
			to be completed for the past four years.

				DETECTIVE WALLACE
			I guess so.

				SIDNEY
			Take care Detective. Give my regards
			to the wife and kids.

Wallace nods his thanks as Sidney walks off through the studio gates, the sun 
rising overhead, as calm and as casually as if nothing's happened. SLOWLY, we 
crane up to an aerial looking down upon HOLLYWOOD. ANOTHER DAY IS BEGINNING. 
AND THIS IS THE PERFECT END FOR A TRILOGY.

CUT TO BLACK

                                      The world is a fine place,
                                      and worth fighting for.

                                              1940







     EXT.  COUNTRY CHURCH -- DAY

     The white cross on the church steeple stands against blue sky.
     The church bell rings, resonating.

     Mass has let out.  Small church, small congregation.  The dirt
     road in front is lined with pick-up trucks and parishioners on
     foot heading to outlying farms and homes.  An old two-story
     house sits across the road.  Lone.

     INT.  OLD HOUSE -- DAY

     Sunlight comes through the soot on the windows, more brown than
     bright.  SOMERSET, 45, in a suit and tie, stands in this empty
     second-story room.  He looks around, at the ceiling, at the worn
     wooden floor, at the peeling wallpaper on the walls.

     Somerset walks to one wall where the current wallpaper is peeled
     away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath.  He runs his finger
     across one of the pale red roses that decorates the older paper.
     He pushes the grime away, brings the rose out more clearly.

     He pulls at the edge of the paper, carefully ripping off a
     roughly squared section with the rose at its center.

     He studies it in his hand.

     EXT.  OLD HOUSE -- DAY

     Birds sing.  Somerset stands, pondering the forested landscape.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                   Is something wrong?

     Somerset does not respond. The MAN, in an ill-fitting real
     estate jacket, is seated on the hood of a dirty Ford
     Thunderbird.  He holds a check and a booklet of receipts.

                                 MAN (CONT)
                   Is something the matter?

                                 SOMERSET
                   No... no.  There's nothing wrong.

     Somerset still seems distant.

                                 MAN
                           (writes receipt)
                   Not that it's any of my business... but,
                   are you figuring on moving out here
                   eventually?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Soon.

                                 MAN
                   I just never seen a man mortgaging an
                   empty house before.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Everything here still seems... seems so
                   strange to me.  All this.

                                 MAN
                   I don't know.  I'd say this place is
                   about as normal as places get.

     The man walks over to hand over a receipt.  Somerset accepts the
     receipt, folds it.  Somerset smiles.

                                 SOMERSET
                   That is exactly what I mean.  Strange.

     Somerset looks back at the house.  The man does not understand.


     INT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- DAY -- (CREDIT SEQUENCE BEGINS)

     Somerset is in a window seat, smoking a cigarette, looking out
     the speeding train.  He is near the back of the car, away from
     the few other passengers.

     Outside, farms, small homes and lawns pass.  The entire panorama
     is dappled by the rays of the soon setting sun.

     The light flickers across Somerset's placid face.

     INT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- LATER DAY

     The train is nearly full.  Somerset has his suitcase on the
     aisle seat beside him.  He has a hardcover book unopened on his
     lap.  He still stares out the window, but his disposition has
     soured.  The train is passing an ugly, swampy field.

     A car's burnt-out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken.  A little
     further on, two dogs are fighting, circling, attacking, their
     coats matted with blood.

     Somerset turns his head to watch the dogs.

     Away in the field, another dog sprints to join the fight.

     INT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- EARLY EVENING

     Passing urban streets below.  Slums.  Smashed cars.  People
     stand on the corners, under the bleak glow of street lamps.

     Somerset's suitcase is by the window.  Somerset is now in the
     aisle seat, reading his book.


     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT -- LATER NIGHT -- (END CREDITS)

     Curtains closed.  The SOUNDS of the CITY are here as they will
     be everywhere in this story.  A CAR ALARM SHRIEKS.  Somerset's
     life is packed in many moving boxes, except for clothing in a
     closet and hundreds of books on shelves.

     Somerset, dressed only in his underwear, lays back on the bed.
     He reaches to the nightstand, to a wooden, pyramidical
     metronome.

     He frees the metronome's weighted swingarm so it moves back and
     forth.  Swings to the left... TICK, swings to the right... TICK.
     Tick, tick, tick, measured and steady.

     Somerset situates on the bed, closes his eyes.  The metronome's
     ticking competes with the sound of the car alarm.  Somerset's
     face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome.

     His eyes close tighter.

     Tick, tick, tick... the swingarm moves evenly.  Somerset's
     breathing deepens.  The car ALARM seems QUIETER.

     Tick, tick, tick.  Somerset continues his concentration.

     The METRONOME is the ONLY SOUND.  Somerset's face relaxes
     slightly as he begins to fall asleep.  Tick, tick, tick...


     EXT.  CHINESE BODEGA/CITY STREETS -- NIGHT

     DAVID MILLS, 31, exits with a bagged 40oz bottle of beer.  He is
     a lean, attractive man, constantly coiled, eyes always
     smoldering.  FOLLOW as he walks quickly past iron-gated
     storefronts.  He crosses the street under elevated subway
     tracks.  A train roars overhead.

     Mills watches it as he walks on.

     Blue sparks spit off the third rail and illuminate Mills,
     throwing his shadow long down the deserted street.

     EXT.  URBAN STREET OF ROW HOMES -- NIGHT

     This rotting neighborhood lives in the shadow of a single fat
     skyscraper.  Mills walks, looks at the broken refrigerators and
     pieces of junk in the gutter.

     Ahead in the street, TWO YOUNG THUGS struggle with a crowbar to
     break into the trunk of a parked car.

     Mills draws near.  One thug looks up, doesn't think Mills will
     be a problem, continues prying.  Mills stops, calm.

                                 MILLS
                   Is that your car, man?

                                 FIRST THUG
                   What the fuck do you care?

     Mills pauses, switches his beer bottle to his other hand.

                                 MILLS
                   Does that car belong to you?

     The thugs look at each other, gauging.  They face Mills.

                                 FIRST THUG
                   Yeah, it's my car, alright?  Fuck off.

                                 MILLS
                   You're telling me that's your car?

     The second thug starts the long way round the car.

                                 SECOND THUG
                   Well, for some strange reason, I don't
                   believe you.

     Mills gives a "isn't that silly" laugh, shifts his gaze --

     Sees the first thug slide the crowbar so it's held as a weapon.

                                 FIRST THUG
                           (steps forward)
                   You can fucking suck my...

     Mills swiftly finishes that sentence by smashing his bottle
     against the first thug's head.  The thug falls, swings blindly.

     The second thug moves from the side, brings out a knife.

     Mills averts, swings, pounds the side of his fist into the
     second thug's face -- CRACK.  Broken nose.

     The second thug stumbles back, drops the knife, his nose
     squirting blood.

     Mills turns, enraged, breathing hard.

     The first thug is screaming, trying to stand.  Mills takes one
     step, punts the first thug's head.  The crowbar clatters away.

     Mills is in the process of kicking a man when he's down, when
     the second thug grabs him from behind, pulls him backwards.

     Mills clutches at the thug's arm, trying to avoid a choke-hold.
     They both struggle spastically.  The thug's winning.

     Gurgling, gasping for air, Mills shifts his weight, drops to one
     knee and spins the thug, slamming him against the car.

     Mills breaks loose, grabs a handful of the second thug's hair
     and holds the man's head against the car's side window.  Mills'
     free hand pounds the thug's face: once, twice -- third time's
     the charm as the window shatters.  The thug goes out cold.

     Mills backs off, still incensed.  He rubs his throat, looking at
     the two prone men.  Slowly, he regains some composure.

     He takes a keychain from his pocket.  He unlocks the door of the
     car, loads one of the thugs into the back seat.  He walks to
     collect the other thug off the street.


     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- MORNING

     Somerset picks items off a moving box:  keys, wallet, homicide
     badge.  Finally, he opens the hardcover book from the train.

     From the pages, he takes the pale, wallpaper rose.


     INT.  TENEMENT APARTMENT -- DAY

     A wall is stained by a starburst of blood.  Somerset stands,
     melancholy, looking at a body on the floor under a sheet near a
     sawed-off shotgun.  The apartment is gloomy.  DETECTIVE TAYLOR,
     52, looks through a notepad.

                                  TAYLOR
                   Neighbors heard them screaming at each
                   other.  It was nothing new or unusual.
                   But, then they heard the gun go off.
                   Boom, boom... both barrels.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Did his wife confess?  Did she actually
                   speak the words?

                                  TAYLOR
                   When the patrolman got here she was
                   trying to put his head back together.
                   She was crying too hard to say anything.
                           (shuts notebook)
                   Crime of passion.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered
                   up on the wall here.

     Taylor shifts his weight, impatient, annoyed.

                                  TAYLOR
                   This is a done deal.  All but the
                   paperwork.

     Somerset looks at a coloring-book open on the coffee table.
     There are crayons beside it.  Somerset picks the book up.

     He flips through: crudely colored pictures.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Did their son see it happen?

                                  TAYLOR
                   What kind of question is that?  Huh?
                           (pointing)
                   He's dead.  His wife killed him.  There
                   it is.  That's all.  Anything else has
                   nothing to do with nothing.

     Somerset replaces the book, digs up a cigarette from his pocket.

                                  TAYLOR (CONT)
                   You and your fucking questions,
                   Somerset.  I'm glad I'm getting rid of
                   you today.  You know that, you fuck?

     David Mills enters, dressed in a suit.  He looks a bit lost.

                                  MILLS
                   Uh... Lieutenant Somerset?

     Somerset lights his cigarette, looks to Mills.

                                  MILLS (CONT)
                   I'm David Mills... your new partner.


     EXT.  TENEMENT/CITY STREET -- DAY

     A body-bag is carried through the crowd around the tenement
     doors.  Somerset follows.  Mills follows Somerset.  They walk
     towards the end of the filthy block.

                                  MILLS
                   I'm a little thrown.  I just finished
                   orientation at central, and they dumped
                   me off down here.

                                  SOMERSET
                   I heard you brought in two small-timers
                   last night.

                                  MILLS
                   Yeah.  Two real idiots.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Since we are just starting out, I
                   thought we could go to a bar.  Sit and
                   talk for awhile.  That way we can...

                                  MILLS
                   Excuse me, but I'd rather start sniffing
                   for a case, if it's all the same to you.
                   Seeing how we only have a week for this
                   whole transition thing.
                           (waits)
                   I want to get into the shit a.s.a.p.,
                   know what I mean?

     Somerset walks, no reply.  Mills searches to get a read on him.

                                  SOMERSET
                   I meant to ask you something... when we
                   spoke on the phone.  I can't help
                   wondering...
                           (pause)
                   Why are you here?

                                  MILLS
                           (wary)
                   I... I don't follow.

                                  SOMERSET
                   All this effort you've gone through, to
                   be transferred from Philadelphia to
                   here.  It's the first question that pops
                   into my head.

     Mills formulates his response.

                                  MILLS
                   I'm here for the same reasons as you, I
                   guess.  Or... at least the same reasons
                   you used to have for being here...
                           (cutting)
                   ...before you decided to give up.

     Somerset stops and faces Mills.

                                  SOMERSET
                   You think you know me?  You just met me
                   two minutes ago.

                                  MILLS
                   Maybe I don't understand the question.

                                  SOMERSET
                   It's very simple.  You've come from the
                   "City of Brotherly Love" to the "City of
                   Brotherly Hate," detective.  I've never
                   seen it done that way.

                                  MILLS
                   I don't know.  Maybe I thought I could
                   do more good here than there.
                           (pause)
                   You know, it'd be great by me if we
                   didn't start right out kicking each
                   other in the balls.  But, you're calling
                   the shots, lieutenant, so however you
                   want it to go.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Let me tell you how I want this to go.
                   I want you to look, and I want you to
                   listen.

                                  MILLS
                   I wasn't standing around Philly guarding
                   the fucking Liberty Bell.

                                  SOMERSET
                   But, you've never worked homicide in
                   this city.

                                  MILLS
                   I realize that.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Well, please do me the favor of
                   remembering it.

     Mills just stares back at Somerset.  Somerset walks.  Mills
     rolls his eyes, looks to heaven like, "what'd I do to deserve
     this?"  He follows Somerset.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     MONDAY

     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING

     Somerset lies asleep on the bed.  It is still dark outside.
     Relatively quiet.  The PHONE beside the inactive metronome RINGS
     HARSHLY.  Somerset awakens suddenly, rankled.


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING

     It is barely becoming light outside.  Mills can't sleep.

     Alone in a double bed.  He sits up, frustrated.  Sits on the
     edge of the bed and looks around.  The room is a shambles,
     filled with moving boxes.

     The light coming through the window glows upon a football trophy
     on one box.  Large and noble, a golden player stands in frozen
     motion at the trophy's pinnacle.

     Mills looks at the trophy and a fond smile forms on his face.
     The CLINKING of DISHES and SILVERWARE is HEARD from another
     room.  Mills looks at the closed bedroom door, troubled.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- EARLY MORNING

     Across a living room full of boxes, TRACY MILLS, 30, a beautiful
     woman, stands in her bathrobe.  She's upset about something,
     takes dishes out of boxes, puts them on the kitchenette counter.

     She pulls a mug from a clump of newspaper and pours some tea
     from a pot on the stove.  Blowing on the steaming tea, she leans
     back on the counter, looks over at the closed bedroom door.

     The tea is too hot to sip, and as Tracy is placing the mug on
     the counter behind her the PHONE RINGS.  Startled, she releases
     the mug too close to the edge.  It falls --

     Crashes to the floor, shatters.


     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, HALLWAY -- MORNING

     A dark hall.  Somerset and Mills stand with OFFICER DAVIS, 28, a
     beefy, uniformed cop.  Light from a camera's flash spills in
     from the nearby kitchen.  Davis hands Somerset two flashlights.

                                 SOMERSET
                   At what time did you confirm the death?

                                 DAVIS
                   Like I said, we didn't touch anything,
                   but we were on scene at like o-five-
                   hundred, so he's had his face in a plate
                   of spaghetti for about half an hour.

                                 MILLS
                   Wait, wait, wait.  You didn't check him?
                   You didn't check vital signs?

                                 DAVIS
                   Believe me, he's gone.  Unless he's
                   breathing spaghetti sauce now.

                                 MILLS
                   No.  The point is, when you're first man
                   in, you check vital signs.

                                 DAVIS
                   This guy's sitting in a pile of his own
                   shit and piss.  If he ain't dead he
                   would have stood up by now.

                                 MILLS
                           (getting angry)
                   Listen, Godzilla...

     Somerset steps in, heads Mills off.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Thank you, Officer Davis.  We'll see you
                   again after we've had a look.

                                 DAVIS
                   Yes, sir.

     Davis leaves, eyeing Mills.  Mills watches him.  Somerset hands
     Mills a flashlight, takes out surgical gloves.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I wonder what exactly was the point of
                   the conversation you were about to get
                   into?

                                 MILLS
                   And, I wonder how many times Officer
                   Davis there has found a supposedly dead
                   man who didn't really die until Davis
                   was back in the patrol car calling the
                   morgue and eating a powdered donut.

     Somerset snaps one glove over his hand and checks the fit.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Drop it.  We have more important
                   concerns just now, don't we?

                                 MILLS
                   Fine... for now.

     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     The POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER packs up, hoists his camera and
     equipment bag.  Somerset and Mills enter.  Mills puts on his own
     pair of rubber gloves.  The grubby kitchen is small; barely room
     for four people to move around in.  The photographer exits:

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                   Bon appetit.

     The only light is a murky green illumination from the ceiling.

     The light bathes an OBESE MAN who is slumped forward in a
     kitchen chair, face-down-dead in a plate of spaghetti.

     The sizable kitchen table's green tablecloth is covered with
     soiled paper plates.  The plates hold bits of half-eaten
     sandwiches, potatoes, donuts and other junk-food remnants.

     Mills and Somerset turn on their flashlights.  Mills points his
     at the green bulb above.  Aluminum foil has been wrapped around
     the bulb to focus the light on the corpse.

     Somerset sweeps the room with his flashlight.  He goes to the
     body and kneels beside it.  There's a rope tied around the
     man's wide gut.  Mills comes to stand beside Somerset.

                                 MILLS
                   I guess that makes it homicide.

     Somerset crouches lower, uses a pen to lift one of the dead
     man's pants cuffs.  Rope is tied around the purplish ankle.

     Mills examines the knots behind the chair's back.  Shines his
     flashlight on the man's belly.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Still, he could have tied himself in.
                   To make it look like murder.

     Somerset isn't listening, focused on the corpse.  He studies the
     man's head and neck without touching.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   I don't see any blood or bruises yet.
                   No wounds.  You see anything?

                                 SOMERSET
                           (irritated)
                   Not yet.

     Somerset stands, points his flashlight: the obese man's stiff
     hands are clutching utensils.  A knife in the left hand, a fork
     sticking straight up in the right with a hunk of meat hanging
     skewered.  Cockroaches swarm.

     Mills turns to the sink and stove.  Each burner of the stove has
     a used pot or pan on it.  There's food slopped everywhere.

                                 MILLS
                   I saw a guy once... committed suicide,
                   but he wanted to make sure his family
                   could collect insurance money, right?

     Somerset walks to the room's only window.  The window has been
     painted over with black paint.  he touches the window with his
     pinkie finger.  The paint is still wet.

     Mills goes to a trash can by the refrigerator.  The trash can is
     full to the brim with empty food containers.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   So, this guy took this big knife... and
                   he held it behind him, put the tip of it
                   in his back, and he ran backwards into
                   the wall.  Cause, he thought it was
                   going to look like someone stabbed him
                   in the back.

     Mills opens the refrigerator.  It's nearly empty.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Except, he poked a big fucking hole in
                   the dry wall when he did it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   If you could... spare me the anecdotes
                   for now.  Leave the refrigerator open
                   for the light.

                                 MILLS
                           (sarcastic)
                   Oh, forgive me.  I thought we had this
                   male-bonding thing going.  My mistake.

     Somerset looks at the floor, deep in thought.  His flashlight
     beam follows a trail of dripped sauces, soups and bits of food
     running from the stove to the table.

                                 SOMERSET
                   What do you smell?  Other than him, and
                   all the food.

                                 MILLS
                           (sniffs)
                   I don't know... there's something.

     Somerset goes close to the table, then leans to peer under.

                                 SOMERSET
                   A bucket.

     Somerset points the flashlight and Mills crouches, pulls up the
     tablecloth on his side of the table.  Two large dead rats lay on
     the floor beside a metal bucket.

     Mills grimaces, slides under the table, careful to avoid the
     rats.  He looks in the bucket.  He leans back, baffled.

                                 MILLS
                   It's vomit.

     He looks at Somerset under the table.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   It's a bucket of vomit.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Is there any blood in it?

                                 MILLS
                   Can't tell by looking.

     Somerset stands, perplexed, stares at the dead man.  There is a
     knock at the door.  The detectives look to DOCTOR THOMAS
     O'NEILL, 52, the medical examiner.  O'Neill is a frumpy man,
     seems a bit gone, looking at the green bulb.

                                 O'NEILL
                   Mood lighting.  Very sixties.

     He drops his bag on the floor, sorts through the contents.

                                 MILLS
                           (to Somerset)
                   You think he was poisoned?

     Mills goes to the trash can, pokes the garbage with a pencil.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   And, those rats there somehow ate the
                   poison off the floor?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Guessing this early is useless.

                                 O'NEILL
                   You girls have got the forensics guys
                   out there chompin' at the bit.  Don't
                   know if we'll all fit in here though.

     Mills continues searching the garbage.

                                 MILLS
                   There's room.  Light's the problem.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Well, three is certainly a crowd in
                   here.  And, with four, someone's bound
                   to be stepping on evidence.
                           (pause)
                   Detective Mills, go help the officers
                   question the neighbors.

                                 MILLS
                           (not pleased)
                   Thanks, but no thanks.  I'll stay on
                   this.

     Somerset watches O'Neill at the corpse.  O'Neill points a thin
     flashlight with his mouth, his hands free for the examination.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (not looking up)
                   Send one forensic in on your way out.

     Mills is pissed.  He lifts his flashlight to shine it on the
     side of Somerset's face.

     A moment passes.  Somerset looks at Mills, light shining
     directly in Somerset's eyes.  A longer moment.  Mills switches
     the light off.  He leaves.

     O'Neill unceremoniously places both hands on the dead man's
     head, lifts the swollen visage from the spaghetti.

                                 O'NEILL
                   He is dead.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, BASEMENT GYM -- DAY

     THWACK, THWACK... THWACK.  Mills punches the heavy bag with
     hard, quick punches.  Sweat drips off his face.  He's in work-
     out clothing, a bundle of nerves wearing boxing gloves.

     The walls are covered in mirrors.  Other cops watch Mills as
     they pass, checking out the new kid.  Mills keeps punching,
     skillfully.

     He stops when he sees Somerset reflected in one of the mirrors.
     Somerset walks over, carrying a pizza box with paper piled on
     top.  He sits on a near bench, takes out a cigarette.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Pizza and paperwork, Detective Mills.

                                 MILLS
                   We need to chat.

     INT.  BASEMENT GYM, BOXING RING -- DAY

     Mills opens a door and enters with Somerset behind.  They are
     alone.  Chairs face an old, limp-roped boxing ring.  Practice
     pads hang from pegs on a wall.  Mills clasps a pair in his
     gloves, offers them to Somerset.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.

                                 MILLS
                   You just hold them up.  I do all the
                   work.

     Somerset takes the pads reluctantly, puts them on.  He still has
     the un-lit cigarette hanging from his mouth.  Mills climbs into
     the ring.  He holds the ropes open for Somerset, waits.

     Somerset doesn't want to do this, but he climbs up.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   You've seen my files... seen the things
                   I've done?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Yes.  Impressive work.

     Mills motions to Somerset and Somerset holds up the practice
     pads.  Mills starts working them, lightly, warming up.
     THWACK... THWACK...

                                 MILLS
                   So, what's your problem?  I've done my
                   time on door-to-doors, and walking a
                   beat.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I know it.  That doesn't mean...

                                 MILLS
                   I did all that shit a long time ago.

     THWACK... THWACK... Somerset's very stiff, uncomfortable.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I made a decision, because I have to
                   worry about the integrity of the scene.

                                 MILLS
                   That's bullshit.

                                 SOMERSET
                   When I'm on scene, I'm not going to
                   worry whether you think you're getting
                   enough time on the playing field.  I'm
                   there to do the work.

     Mills punches a little more aggressively.  Somerset's backing,
     flinching, keeping the pads high.  THWACK... THWACK... THWACK...

                                 MILLS
                   The badge in my pocket says "detective,"
                   just like yours.  I've been Homicide for
                   four and a half years.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You've worked Homicide for four years,
                   or for five years...
                   Don't count the half-years, unless you
                   want to sound like a rookie.

     Mills unloads a mighty wallop and one practice pad recoils into
     Somerset's face, knocks Somerset on his ass.

                                 MILLS
                   Oops.  My hand slipped.

     Mills walks, climbs out of the ring.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   You fucked me over today, and you know
                   it.  You know it.

     Somerset looks at the broken cigarette in his mouth.  He
     contains his anger.  He seems to realize Mills has a point.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Just don't jerk me off.  That's all I
                   ask.  It's not much.  Don't jerk me off.
                           (pause)
                   Please, do me the favor of remembering
                   that.

     Mills exits.  Somerset spits out the broken cigarette.


     INT.  URBAN SCHOOL, OFFICE -- DAY

     Tracy looks out a window from behind steel bars.

     Below her, young children play in a playground.  They're playing
     hop-scotch, throwing balls, chasing each other.  The swing sets
     are broken.  The handball wall is graffitied.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                   I'm sorry, Mrs. Mills.  We don't have
                   anything right now.

     Tracy looks away from the window to the haggard WOMAN.  The
     school's office is ill-equipped, busy, disorganized.

                                 WOMAN (CONT)
                   We'll try to give you a call if we need
                   substitutes next month.

                                 TRACY
                   Thank you.

     Tracy looks back at the playground: on the other side of a
     chain-link fence, a butcher in a bloody apron walks down the
     ramp of a freezer truck.  he carries a big, whole, slaughtered
     pig on his shoulder.

     The pig's head flops as the butcher walks.  Some children stop
     their games and run to watch the man and the pig corpse pass.


     INT.  UNDERGROUND SUBWAY TRAIN -- DAY

     The train clatters through a tunnel, packed full, WHEELS
     SCREECHING.  The lights go on and off.  Passengers read
     tabloids, stare at their feet, study advertisements on the
     walls; anything to avoid making eye-contact with others.

     All races, creeds and colors; all ugly, forlorn human beings.
     Tracy stands fatigued, holding a handrail.

     A bag-lady, crusted with dirt, reeking, pushes her way through
     the crowd.  A man presses against Tracy in an attempt to let the
     bag-lady pass.  Tracy switches hands on the rail, turns sideways
     to make room.  She looks down.

     On one seat, a man, quite normal looking, sits holding a porno
     magazine, THREE-WAY FUCK, in one hand.  His other hand is in his
     pocket.  He's obviously masturbating himself in his pants.  No
     one else notices or seems to care.

     Tracy looks away, disgusted.  She closes her eyes.  The train's
     wheels SCREECH LOUDER as the train takes a curve.


     INT.  INDOOR FRUIT STAND -- NIGHT

     The front and one side of the shop are entirely open to the busy
     sidewalk and street.  A transparent plastic canopy frames the
     entrance.  A STRANGE MAN, 20, stands at the edge of the canopy.
     He wears a stained sweatsuit outfit and hums a song, oblivious.

     Tracy and Mills look together over the piles of fruits and
     vegetables piled on wooden stands which form tight aisles.

                                 MILLS
                   It was okay.  I mean... it was certainly
                   better than yesterday.  I think Somerset
                   and I came to a small understanding...

     Mills holds his thumb and forefinger about a quarter of an inch
     apart to illustrate.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   ...about this big.

                                 TRACY
                   He sounds interesting.

                                 MILLS
                   He is that, if nothing else.

     Mills throws some oranges in the basket hanging from Tracy's
     arm.  He goes to check out the carrots.  Tracy looks up from
     heads of lettuce to the strange man at the entrance.

     The strange man hums on, rocking back and forth slowly, his eyes
     glassy.  Customers come and go, paying him no mind.

     Mills notices Tracy's interest.  He keeps comparing carrots.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   We started a big homicide case today.
                   I'll spare you the grisly details.

     The strange man suddenly stops humming and looks into the store
     with a crooked grin.

                                 STRANGE MAN
                   Name that tune?  Anybody name that tune?
                   Name that tune...

     The man keeps repeating this, over and over, still ignored.

                                 TRACY
                   It's... it's like they emptied all the
                   insane asylums into the streets.

     She looks back to the heads of lettuce.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   That's what it's like.  Like they just
                   gave up, and let everyone out.

     Mills nods, his back to Tracy.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   There are a lot of frightening people in
                   this city.

                                 MILLS
                   There are a lot of frightening people in
                   the world.

     Tracy looks again to the strange man.

                                 STRANGE MAN
                   Name that tune?  Anybody name that tune?

                                 TRACY
                   It seems worse than Philadelphia,
                   because everything is pushed right up
                   against you.  In your face.

     Mills edges past Tracy towards the front of the store, tries to
     be pleasant.

                                 MILLS
                   Listen, honey.  I don't want to fight
                   tonight.  Okay?  Can we just go one
                   night without fighting about something?

     He looks over apples, thinks that's the end of that.

                                 TRACY
                   I'm not trying to start a fight.
                           (pause)
                   How am I trying to start a fight?

                                 MILLS
                   We're here now.  Okay.  Are we supposed
                   to pack it all in and go back?  How are
                   we going to do that?

                                 TRACY
                   Do I have to act like I love this place?
                   Is that what a "good wife" would do?

                                 MILLS
                           (doleful)
                   There's a lot of pressure on me... I...

                                 TRACY
                   And, there's a lot of pressure on me.
                   I'm here with you.

                                 MILLS
                   I know.  I know...

     Mills steps towards the open air entrance.  He's watching
     something.  The strange man is still heard offscreen.

     Tracy reaches to a high wooden shelf, trying to reach a bag of
     rice, her back to Mills.

                                 TRACY
                   I'm not going to close my eyes and block
                   everything out, David.  I'm not going to
                   act like you delivered us to some sort
                   of paradise.  I can't...

     She gets the rice and turns.  Mills is not there.  She sighs,
     angry, looks around.  She walks towards the entrance and sees
     him --

     TRACY'S P.O.V. -- THE STREET

     In front of the stand, Mills has run to the corner of the
     sidewalk to help a very old woman with a cane.  The elderly
     woman smiles up at Mills, takes his arm as he helps her off the
     curb and across the street.  He talks to her as they go.

     INT.  INDOOR FRUIT STAND -- NIGHT

     Tracy's anger fades.  She shakes her head, touched, amazed by
     the plain boy scoutishness of her husband.

     TRACY'S P.O.V. -- THE STREET

     Mills deposits the old woman on the other side.  She thanks him,
     patting him on the cheek.  Mills starts back towards the fruit
     stand, proud of himself.  A car screeches to a halt, just
     missing him.  The driver leans out the window, yelling at Mills.
     Mills kicks the side of the car.

                                 MILLS
                   Fuck you.
                           (as car leaves)
                   Fuck you, you son of a bitch!  I'm
                   walking here.

     INT.  INDOOR FRUIT STAND -- NIGHT

     Tracy rolls her eyes in amused disappointment.  She sighs again.

     Mills passes the babbling strange man, comes up to Tracy.

                                 MILLS
                   I'm sorry... I couldn't pass it up.  I
                   never had a chance to actually do that.
                   But, we can start the argument right
                   back up where we left off, right?

     Tracy looks at him, charmed, no longer willing to fight.

                                 MILLS
                           (playing dumb)
                   What?

     Tracy wraps an arm around Mills and kisses him.  He holds her.

                                 STRANGE MAN
                   That was the theme from tv's Mod Squad.
                   I'm surprised nobody got that one.

     The strange man starts humming a new tune.  An old man tries to
     get through the aisle where Mills and Tracy are kissing.

                                 OLD MAN
                           (infuriated)
                   Excuse me.  Excuse me!


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     A small transistor RADIO PLAYS on the bedside table.

     Mills and Tracy are in bed, making love under the sheets.  They
     move rhythmically, kissing, sweating hard.

     Mills holds Tracy's hair in his hands, pulls her head back as
     she gasps and he thrusts his entire body against hers.

     Mills' hair is soaked.  He is anything but mellow as a lover,
     quickening while Tracy twists underneath him.  Tracy holds tight
     to the back of his neck with one hand.

     Finally, Mills pushes himself up on his arms, holding his head
     down against Tracy's chest.  Holds for a long moment, till he is
     spent and lowers himself against her, into her arms.  He rests a
     long time.  She kisses his forehead, keeping her eyes closed.

     Finally, Mills rolls off her, gets behind her and wraps the both
     of them in the sheets.  He folds himself against her, and they
     stay that way.

                                 TRACY
                   Goodnight.

                                 MILLS
                   Goodnight.

     After a long moment, Mills shifts back, sits up.  Tracy looks
     over her shoulder at him as he takes a towel off a chair and
     stands.  Mills wraps the towel around his waist.

     He leans over to give Tracy a last kiss.  She watches him leave
     the room.  She is about to say something, but does not.  A light
     comes on in the other room, leaking through the door.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Mills sits down at his desk.  He starts looking through police
     paperwork.  The RADIO in the other room goes OFF in mid song.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     TUESDAY

     INT.  AUTOPSY ROOM -- EARLY MORNING

     The room is cold, clean.  Stainless steel.  White tile.  Many
     pathologists work at slabs.  Mills and Somerset are with DOCTOR
     SANTIAGO, 35, who stands over the mostly dissected obese corpse.

                                 SANTIAGO
                   If you take a look here, buddies...
                   I can tell you, it was not a poison.
                   If you can see...
                   I have emptied all of everything out of
                   the stomach.  But, look at it, now that
                   I took away the liver.

     Santiago reaches into the belly of the cavernous corpse.  Mills
     moves closer beside Somerset, but not too close, trying to hide
     his disgust.  We hear squashy sounds as Santiago works, but we
     don't see in.

                                 SANTIAGO (CONT)
                   I move the lungs over.  First, see how
                   big this fat son-of-a-bitch stomach is.
                   Now... here is the strange thing, on the
                   stomach.  Stretches.
                           (pointing)
                   And, here is it distended.  Look at the
                   size of that, because of the foods.

                                 MILLS
                   I can see what you're pointing at...

                                 SANTIAGO
                   On the stomach.  The lines of
                   distention.

     Somerset's looking in, not believing what he sees.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Doctor, are you saying this man... ate
                   till he burst?

                                 SANTIAGO
                   Yes, well, he didn't actually burst.  He
                   was bleeding, inside of himself.
                   And, there's a hemotoma on the
                   outside... on the belly.

     Somerset walks around the slab, looking the body over.

                                 MILLS
                   He died by eating?

                                 SANTIAGO
                   Someone punched him, or kicked him.

     Somerset notices something on the partially shaved head.

     He leans close to look at five or six small bruises on the back
     of the dead man's head; circular bruises, some darker than
     others, all about the same diameter as a dime.

                                 SANTIAGO (CONT)
                   Oh, and there is this here... something
                   else you have to look at and see.

     Somerset stands straight, realizes something about the bruises.

                                 SANTIAGO (CONT)
                   Most of his stomach contents are in the
                   lab now... but, this.  I found these in
                   the fat man's stomach.

     Santiago looks amongst tools, buckets and jars of liquid.  He
     picks up a glass jar and shows it to Mills.  In the jar: many
     little bits of blue plastic.  Like scrapings.

                                 MILLS
                   Plastic?

     Mills gets Somerset's attention, hands him the jar.  Somerset
     looks at it a long time.

                                 SANTIAGO
                   Why these were in a fat man's stomach, I
                   don't know.


     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, HALLWAY -- MORNING

     Outside the door to the murder scene, Mills and Somerset cut
     through the RESTRICTED AREA/CRIME SCENE seal.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Those bruises on the back of the
                   victim's head were caused by the muzzle
                   of a gun.

                                 MILLS
                   So, the killer had him at gunpoint, and
                   gave him a choice: eat, or get your head
                   blown off.

     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- MORNING

     Somerset and Mills enter.  Somerset takes out the jar of plastic
     scrapings, turns on the now normal light.  They begin to search.

                                 SOMERSET
                   He was force-fed... till his body
                   started rejecting the food.  He
                   literally couldn't eat another bite.

                                 MILLS
                   So, the killer held a bucket under him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   His throat was swollen from the effort.
                   He was bleeding internally.
                   He must have blacked out... and, if
                   you're the killer, you're not going to
                   want to wait around for him to die.

     Somerset examines the counter tops and wall.  Mills gets down on
     his knees, examines the linoleum floor.

                                 MILLS
                   You kick him, pop him like a fucking
                   balloon.
                           (touches floor)
                   Somerset, look here.

     Somerset gets down, holds the jar against the linoleum.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Same color and texture.

     They both crawl on hands and knees, study every inch of floor.

                                 MILLS
                   If this is what that is... it doesn't
                   make sense.  It doesn't figure.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Always look for one thing to focus on.
                   There's always one singular thing, and
                   it might be as small as a speck of dust,
                   but find it and focus... till it's an
                   exhausted possibility.

                                 MILLS
                   How are pieces of the floor going to get
                   in the guy's stomach?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Exactly.  Why would so many pieces be
                   inside his stomach unless they were
                   placed there intentionally?

     Somerset notices deep scratches in the linoleum, fingers the
     grooves.  He takes a piece of plastic from the jar, holds it to
     the scratches, fiddles with it, fits it in.  He looks up to see,
     these scratches are in front of the refrigerator.  It looks like
     they were caused by the refrigerator having been pulled away
     from the wall and pushed back at some time.

     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- LATER MORNING

     We are BEHIND THE REFRIGERATOR as it is rocked back and forth.
     It's pulled away from the wall.  Somerset and Mills strain, pull
     a few more feet, then release.  They lean to look --

     The refrigerator had hidden a space on the wall where the dust
     has been cleared.  In that space: a circle, smeared in grease,
     and a note taped in the center of the circle.

     Somerset's BEEPER starts BEEPING.  Mills leans to read:

                                 MILLS
                   "Dear Detectives.  Long is the way, and
                   hard, that out of hell leads up to the
                   light."
                           (looks at Somerset)
                   This is not good.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Milton.

                                 MILLS
                   What?

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's a quote from a book.  Milton's
                   Paradise Lost.

     Somerset takes out his beeper, looks at the LED window.  He
     looks up at Mills, like they've received very bad news.


     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENTS, HALLWAY -- MORNING

     A marble hallway.  A DETECTIVE, 50, nervously chewing his nails,
     quickly leads Mills and Somerset past cops and forensics.

                                 DETECTIVE
                   I said to myself, I'm not going to screw
                   around with this.  Nope.  Fuck that.
                   It's still pretty fresh meat.  I called
                   the medical examiner... he's coming.
                           (stops at door)
                   When I got to it, I knew.  As soon as I
                   laid eyes on it, I knew...

     The detective opens the door.  FOLLOW Somerset and Mills --

     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

     Gross, deep yellow light comes through the only window with its
     blinds up.  The light anoints a NUDE MAN displayed, dead.

                                 DETECTIVE (O.S.)
                   ...this is your guy who did this.

     The nude dead man's legs are folded under him as if he were
     kneeling, and he's bent forward, chin on the floor.  His eyes
     are open, his arms outstretched before him.  Mills and Somerset
     walk to either side of the man.

     The detective closes the door, bites his thumbnail.  The
     apartment is on a high floor, so it's quiet.

     Somerset sees the window has been covered with a sheet of yellow
     gel, stapled in place to produce the colored light.

     Mills examines the corpse.  There's a chair one foot behind the
     nude man.  It's an elegant leather chair, drenched in blood.
     There's a carving knife on the carpet in the middle of a huge
     stain of blood under the chair.  Mills looks at pieces of cut
     rope on the floor behind the chair.  The rope is knotted.

     Somerset crouches beside the body.  There's a big piece of flesh
     missing from the man's left side, as if the love-handle had been
     lopped off.  Hundreds of pennies lie scattered under and around
     the man.  The man's hands are palms up, fingers wrapped around
     more pennies.

     Mills walks over to examine a scale on the floor between the
     corpse and the doorway.  It's an old-fashioned counter-balance
     scale with two suspended dishes on a see-saw arm.  In the high
     dish: the hunk of flesh missing from the man's side.  In the low
     dish: a one pound counterweight.

                                 MILLS
                           (to Somerset)
                   A pound of flesh.

     Somerset stands and walks backwards to view the entire scene
     from near the door.

     He looks worried, vaguely frightened.  He turns his head, looks
     to a far wall.  Beside a big, abstract, constructivist painting,
     there's a note pinned up inside a triangular smear of blood.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING

     An office full of pictures, books and mugsheets, yet it is
     meticulously well kept.  The CAPTAIN, 50, sits at his tidy desk.
     He's dressed conservatively.  Mills and Somerset sit before him.
     Somerset reads from a photocopy of the note they just found.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (reading)
                   "One pound of flesh, no more no less. No
                   cartilage, no bone, but only flesh.
                   This task done, and he would go free."

     The captain is a calm man, but whenever not speaking, without
     fail, he clenches his jaw repeatedly, causing the muscles in his
     neck and jaw to pulse.

     Somerset stands, paces.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   This victim, Mr. Gold, was tied down
                   nude, holding a carving knife.  And he
                   was given a long time... to decide.
                   Where to make the first cut?  There's a
                   gun to your head... but, what part or
                   parts of your body are expendable?

     Mills sits back in his chair, arms crossed, seems anxious,
     doesn't know why they're here.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Mr. Gold tried for the whole pound at
                   once, his love handle.  But, he went
                   into shock.  Bled to death.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   What is the point, Somerset?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Look at both killings together.  This
                   murderer is an artist.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   An artist?

                                 SOMERSET
                   He uses colors and symbols.  He
                   positions the bodies after death, so
                   he's working with composition.  It's
                   been premeditated so meticulously... and
                   this is just the beginning.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Wrong.  For all we know, we might never
                   hear from him again, and I don't want
                   that kind of talk floating around.

     Somerset shakes his head "no."

                                 SOMERSET
                   The rats and the pennies.  The circle
                   and the triangle on the wall.  There's
                   something about them... these murders
                   mean something.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   So?  What?

     Somerset has no answer.  The captain is irked, jaw clenching.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT)
                           (to Mills)
                   You with him, or you just here to watch?

                                 MILLS
                   This is his stuff, captain.  I've been
                   out in the cold most of the day.

                                 CAPTAIN
                           (to Somerset)
                   Always working overtime up in that big
                   brain of yours, huh?  Always cooking.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I need you to know... I want us
                   reassigned.  We're declining this case.

                                 MILLS
                           (sits up, angry)
                   What?!

                                 CAPTAIN
                   What the hell are you talking about?

                                 SOMERSET
                   This cannot be my last duty here.  It's
                   going to go on and on.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   You've left unfinished business before.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Everything else was taken as close to a
                   conclusion as humanly possible.

                                 MILLS
                   Can I just say something?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Also... I don't think this should be
                   Mills' first case.

                                 MILLS
                   This is not my first case, fuckhead!

                                 CAPTAIN
                   I don't have anyone else to give this
                   to, Somerset.  And nobody's going to
                   swap with you.

                                 MILLS
                   Give it to me, then.  There's nothing
                   that says I have to fly with him.

     The captain considers this.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   If Somerset wants out, fuck him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It would be too much for him, too soon.

                                 MILLS
                           (to captain)
                   Could we talk about this in private?

     The captain looks at Somerset, then at Mills.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   That's not necessary.  You're in.

                                 MILLS
                   Thank you, sir.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Start picking up the pieces.  I'll
                   shuffle some paper and try to get you a
                   new partner.

     Mills stands.  Somerset will not look him in the eye.  Mills
     leaves, slams the door.  Somerset seems deflated.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT)
                   You win, Somerset.  You're out.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     WEDNESDAY

     EXT.  CITY STREET -- MORNING

     A vendor lays out a pile of tabloid newspapers at his busy
     newsstand.  The headline: SECOND BIZARRE MURDER!, in huge print.

     The vendor lays out another tabloid pile.  Headline: "GIVE ME MY
     POUND OF FLESH," SAYS BLOODTHRISTY KILLER, in big, red letters.
     The vendor places a third pile beside the others:  SICKENING
     MURDERS - EXCLUSIVE DETAILS INSIDE!!!


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- MORNING

     Old office.  Moving boxes on the floor.  The single window faces
     a billboard.  Somerset works on a manual typewriter.  He types
     hunt-and-peck, slowly.  His paperwork is on the desk in two
     sloppy piles.  A jarring SOUND is HEARD OFFSCREEN, like fingers
     on a blackboard.  Somerset looks up, irritated.

     A WORKMAN is working at the open door, holding the source of the
     sound, a razor blade he's using to scrape the words DETECTIVE
     SOMERSET off the door's window.

                                 WORKMAN
                   Sorry.

     Somerset turns back to typing.  The captain steps in, looks at
     the workman, then drops more papers on Somerset's desk.

     As always, the neatly groomed captain clenches his jaw.  He
     looks around.  Two of boxes on the floor have DETECTIVE MILLS
     written across them.  The captain picks one up, puts it on top
     of the other.  He sits, watching Somerset, starts straightening
     the forms on the desk.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   What are you going to do with yourself
                   out there, Somerset?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'll get a job.  Maybe on a farm.  I'll
                   fix up my house.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Can't you feel it yet?
                           (pause)
                   Can't you feel that feeling... that you
                   won't be special anymore?

                                 SOMERSET
                           (lying)
                   I don't know what you mean.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   You know.

     Somerset reclines, looks at the captain.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Did you read in the paper today, about
                   the man who took his dog for a walk?
                   And how he was mugged?  And, his wallet
                   was taken, and his watch.  Then, while
                   he was still lying unconscious, his
                   attacker stabbed him with a knife in
                   both eyes.  It happened last night.  Not
                   far from here.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   I heard.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I have no understanding of this place.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   It's always been like this.

     Somerset saddles up to the typewriter.  Hunt-and-peck.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Yes.  You're absolutely right.

     The captain lays the paperwork down in two neat stacks.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   You were made for this work, Somerset.
                   I can't believe you're going to trade it
                   all in for a tool belt and a fishing
                   rod.  But, I guess I'm wrong.

     The captain leaves.  Somerset looks up now that the captain's
     gone.  He grabs the paper piles and ruffles them back to their
     disheveled state.  He looks at the workman.

     The workman is looking at Somerset, has a rag in his hand to
     remove the last remnants of Somerset's name.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (angrily)
                   Put a little elbow grease into it!

     The workman is startled, continues his work.


     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     The grandly furnished apartment where the second murder took
     place has been dusted for prints and searched.

     Two female forensics are at work.

     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, MASTER BEDROOM -- DAY

     Mills is seated in front of a long writing desk with many
     drawers.  All the drawers are open.  Mills looks through letters
     and stationary.  Nothing of use.  He tosses the pile back.

     He sits back, frustrated, yanks off one rubber glove, looks
     around the room.  Books have been taken off their shelves, the
     bed has been stripped.  The room has been given the once over.

     The victim's family photographs hang in expensive frames on one
     wall.  There are at least thirty photos of various sizes:
     ancestors, sons and daughters, grandchildren and friends.  An
     over-weight forensic, CHRIS, 35, leans in through the doorway.

     Mills looks up and Chris shakes his head glumly.

                                 MILLS
                   He must have left us another puzzle to
                   solve... somewhere.

                                 CHRIS
                   We'll keep looking, but we're running
                   out of possibilities.

     Chris leaves and Mills stands to stretch.  Something catches
     Mills' eye.  He walks over to the door, curious.  At the base of
     the open door, there's a ball of paper wedged under to act as a
     doorjamb.  Mills puts his glove back on, pulls the ball out.

     He uncrumples the paper as the door slowly swings shut.  The
     page has a drawing on it, of the sun with waves of heat at its
     edges.  There is a single eye in the center of the sun.

     An arrow is drawn in dried blood on the back of the closing
     door.  Mills notices this and pushes the door closed.

     The blood arrow points to the side and up, seems to be pointing
     to the photo gallery wall.  Mills goes to examine the photos.

     His eyes search each photo... one by one... till he sees it:

                                 MILLS
                   Christ...

     A framed photo of a falsely pretty, middle-aged woman smiling
     and wearing pearls.  Under the glass, on the photo itself,
     circles have been drawn in blood around the woman's eyes.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS, DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT

     An assault on the senses.  Crowded streets and sidewalks.  On
     every corner, in every doorway, on every stairwell -- freaks,
     junkies, punks, leather boys and motorcycle girls.  A few
     tourists wander in the mix, heedful of the dangers around them.
     Buildings border narrowly.

     Somerset walks against the stream.  He carries a file.

     CAR HORNS HOWL.  MUSIC BLASTS from the entrances of clubs.
     REGGAE from one club is soon OVERTAKEN by RAP from a second
     story window.  TECHNO-POP blasts from the tattoo parlor.

     Somerset does not like this place, views it with disdain.  He
     walks to avoid two men fighting on the ground.  The men are
     pulling hair and pounding each other idiotically.

     Somerset takes a cigarette from a full pack, lights it as he
     crosses through the traffic jam in the street.  A VAGRANT steps
     up with his hand out.

                                 VAGRANT
                   Spare me a cigarette, money-grip?  Spare
                   me a cigarette?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Sorry.  Last one.

     He walks on.  We BEGIN to HEAR JAZZ MUSIC.

     INT.  JAZZ CLUB -- NIGHT

     A club at capacity.  The JAZZ MUSIC CONTINUES like a slow, cool
     breeze from a JAZZ TRIO on a platform.

     The air is thick with smoke.  Yuppies sit elbow to elbow with
     the last members of the beat generation.  Everyone's drinking
     beer, smoking pot.

     Somerset crosses the club, looking for someone.  He takes a
     tissue from his pocket, rips pieces off and jams the pieces in
     his ears.  At the back of the club, a major-league bouncer
     stands in front of a closed door.  Somerset shows his badge and
     the bouncer steps aside with reservation.

     INT.  NARROW STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

     The walls are black.  Somerset opens the door, enters, walks
     down the long flight of stairs.  As Somerset descends, the JAZZ
     MUSIC FADES and is ENGULFED by the sound of SPEED METAL.
     DEAFENING.

     At the bottom, Somerset opens another door.  He enters --

     INT.  UNDERGROUND ART GALLERY -- NIGHT

     A narrow room.  SPEED METAL is even LOUDER.  This is a private
     art party.  The people are lizard-like, pale.  Men and women
     priding themselves on their gauntness.

     Somerset passes canvases on the walls.  Pointlessly abstract
     paintings.  Splatters, smears and blobs of color.

     Party-people stand in front of these "works," engrossed.
     Somerset slides past, not interested in the art, jamming the
     tissue further in his ears.  He spots his objective.

     WILLIAM McCRACKEN, 42, stands inside a circle of admirers.  He is
     dressed like a pauper, his baggy clothing stained with many
     colors of paint.  He wears dark sunglasses, bored by the
     bleached-blonde girl whispering in his ear.

     Somerset worms his way to stand in front of William.  The party-
     goers turn their attention to this intrusion.

     William looks up, pushes the girl away.  He takes off his
     sunglasses.  His eyes are badly bloodshot and listless.

     He looks Somerset over... and then grins, glad to see him.


     INT.  MILL'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Mills stands brooding over a photocopy of the picture of the
     woman with her eyes circled in blood.  He looks overworked,
     drinks coffee.  His desk is swamped with files.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                   I have voiced the same concerns to our
                   law enforcement officials, and they
                   assure me he is of the highest caliber.

     Mills looks to a t.v. on a table, picks up a remote, increases
     the volume.  On the screen, MARTIN TALBOT, 47, source of the
     voice, stands before reporters.  He's a powerful presence, with
     a gold tooth in the front of his mouth.

                                 A REPORTER (V.O.)
                           (from t.v.)
                   As District Attorney, don't you feel
                   some responsibility?  Detective David
                   Mills lacks the experience...

                                 TALBOT (V.O.)
                           (from t.v.)
                   I've always said... I've always said,
                   don't send a boy to do a man's job.

     Mills is hanging on every word.

                                 TALBOT (V.O.,CONT)
                   But, David Mills has a sterling record
                   with the Philadelphia force.  I stand
                   behind him one hundred percent.

                                 MILLS
                           (relieved)
                   You tell 'em boss.  Detective David
                   Mills is a wonderful human being...

                                 TALBOT (V.O.)
                   However... however... let me say this...

     Mills looks back at the television.

                                 TALBOT (V.O.,CONT)
                   If Detective Mills, at any point in this
                   investigation... if he is not pulling
                   his weight, I will be the first in line
                   to pull his plug.

     Mills points the remote, turns the t.v. off as reporters crowd
     Talbot.  Mills stares at the blank screen, dispirited.

     Across the room, Tracy stands in the doorway.  Mills does not
     see her.  He looks at the photocopy and sits at his desk.

     Tracy watches him, great concern in her sad eyes.


     INT.  WILLIAM'S STUDIO/APARTMENT -- NIGHT

     Somerset walks through this vast artist's studio, a converted
     warehouse space filled with canvases.  It's clear the works at
     the underground art gallery were William's.  William climbs a
     ladder to a loft storage space.  He moves cautiously, like he's
     not quite up to the task.

                                 WILLIAM
                   I always figured that's the only reason
                   you and I used to be friends.  Because I
                   was a friend of hers.

     William yanks a painting wrapped in dusty paper, climbs down.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   Speaking of which...

     William hands the painting to Somerset, walks to a director's
     chair facing a paint-splashed canvas on an easel.  He is a used-
     up man, bound in an apathy-induced haze.  He sits, picks up a
     squeeze bottle of orange paint from a table of supplies.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   I painted that about five years ago.  I
                   always told myself I'd give it to you
                   next time I saw you.

     Somerset starts unwrapping the painting.

     William "paints," using the squeeze bottles and by flicking
     saturated brushes so that the paint flies against the canvas.
     Most times, he's not even looking at the canvas or colors he's
     using.  He looks over his shoulder at Somerset.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   Things are different these days, pal.
                   You wouldn't believe it...

     Somerset looks at the unwrapped painting and is hit by a swell
     of memories.  Horribly sad memories.  It's a portrait in oils of
     a pretty, red-headed woman.

     William shoots red paint with one hand, concentrates on
     lighting a filterless cigarette with the other.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   People buy my paintings now... they
                   drive down in their BMWs and Rolls
                   Royces.  It's the new money generation.
                   I guess they think they're touching the
                   avant-garde...

     William looks at his creation, then calmly kicks the easel over.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   There's another thousand dollar William
                   McCracken expression of anarchy.

     William gets up, walks across the wet canvas, leaving
     footprints.  He looks down at what he's done.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   Make that two thousand.

     He laughs.  Somerset holds up the delicately rendered portrait.

                                 SOMERSET
                   How is she?  Have you seen her recently?

                                 WILLIAM
                   Huh... oh.  No.  She moved out of the
                   city.  Last winter.  She married some
                   businessman, or something like that.

     Somerset fights the anguish this causes, puts the painting down.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Good for her.
                           (pause)
                   I'm leaving soon myself.  I'm finally
                   getting out.

                                 WILLIAM
                   Yeah?  What happened to the idealistic
                   super-cop I used to know?

                                 SOMERSET
                   He became a realist.

     William grunts, flicks his cigarette away, takes out a bag of
     pills.  He palms a few, notices the judgment in Somerset's eyes.

                                 WILLIAM
                   Oh... sorry.

     William turns his back to Somerset, pops the pills.  Out of
     sight, out of mind.  Somerset is disappointed, disgusted.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (sarcastic)
                   Not that I don't appreciate your recent
                   artistic endeavors... but, what happened
                   to the painter I used to know?

     William smiles like a dolt, laughs a little.

                                 WILLIAM
                   I can't remember.

     INT.  WILLIAM'S STUDIO/APARTMENT -- LATER NIGHT

     Color photos of the first and second murder sit on a drawing
     table.  The top photos are like establishing shots, each taking
     in the entire display the murderer created.

     William examines with Somerset looking over his shoulder.

                                 WILLIAM
                   Man... can I buy these from you?

                                 SOMERSET
                   They're not for sale.

     Somerset lays out photos of the notes, triangle and circle:

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   What is it?  What's the murderer trying
                   to say?

     William narrows his eyes.  Does not know.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   What picture is he painting?

                                 WILLIAM
                           (figuring)
                   Wait a minute...

     William has an idea.  He ambles over to a row of cabinets where
     oversized art books are stacked.  He hunts through a pile,
     shoves some books aside.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   I... I've seen things like that...

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where?

     William keeps digging, finds one book, finds another.  He opens
     one as he walks back to the drawing table.

                                 WILLIAM
                   It's church stuff.  Christianity.

     William lays a book down, finds a page.  He opens it to
     Somerset.  There is a circle to the side of the text.  It says
     GLUTTONY under the circle.

     Somerset creases his brow, turns the page.  William opens
     another book.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   When it first started... Christian
                   artwork was all from Bible stories.  It
                   was like... nobody had any imagination.
                   It was all... standardized.

     William pages through and we catch glimpses of the bizarre,
     worlds of Hieronymus Bosch.  Horrifying religious visions.

                                 WILLIAM (O.S.,CONT)
                   But, later, everyone started painting to
                   tell their own stories... to teach
                   lessons.  Guys like Bosch, Bregel the
                   elder... Van Eycks.

     William shoves the open book to Somerset.  Somerset looks:

     Seven paintings in a circular pattern showing characters giving
     in to sins.  Wicked, grotesque people.

     Somerset turns the book to examine each painting right side up.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   The seven deadly sins.

                                 WILLIAM (O.S.)
                   That's what these murders remind me of.
                   Paintings like these.
                           (points)
                   Gluttony... greed...

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   Envy, wrath, pride, lust and sloth.
                   Seven deadly sins.

                                 WILLIAM
                   Amen, brother.

     William goes to continue pulling other books.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   I can find more examples.  There's lots
                   of paintings like those... painted over
                   hundreds of years.
                           (moves books)
                   And you're right... that murderer is an
                   artist.

     Somerset is chilled by all this, immersed in the Bosch book.

                                 SOMERSET
                   And, it's two down... five to go.


     EXT.  CITY STREET, PORNO DISTRICT -- NIGHT

     A bright, tawdry intersection.  Neon swirls and circuit-bulbs on
     porno theatres provide the flash.  Cars, taxies, and barkers
     urging sexual indulgence from doorways provide the noise.

     The streets and sidewalks are crowded with lonely humans, mostly
     men, looking around, sizing up promises made on porno placards:
     FUN WITH NUDES, BIG BOOBS, NAKED DESIRE, etc.  The usual
     contingent of abnormal cretins wanders in the crowd, looking for
     someone to hurt.

     MOVE through the crowds.  Meet JOHN, a balding, middle-aged man,
     wearing thick glasses.  There is not a single thing strange or
     unusual about his appearance.  FOLLOW him as he walks.  He's
     nervous, looking at the porno palaces.

     His sweaty hand clutches a Bible tight against his chest.  He
     doesn't feel comfortable being here.

     John walks to a corner, waits for the light so he may cross.  A
     grotesque STREET PREACHER approaches waving his own Bible.
     People walk away from him, so he confronts John.

                                 PREACHER
                   ...are you, Sir?  Is Jesus Christ your
                   Lord and Master?  Do you believe in Him?

     John tries to ignore, traffic blocking his escape.

                                 PREACHER (CONT)
                           (pleading)
                   Don't ignore me.  Listen to what I have
                   to say.  Christ can be your savior!

                                 JOHN
                           (quiet anger)
                   Leave me alone.

                                 PREACHER
                   Think about God, sir.  I can help you
                   let Him into your life.

     Finally the light changes.  John turns and spits in the
     preacher's face.  The preacher recoils as John crosses quickly.

     John hurries between cars in the crosswalk.  The preacher curses
     from the corner, his voice drowned out in traffic.

     EXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET, PORNO DISTRICT -- NIGHT

     People pass on the sidewalk.  John is amongst them, but he
     stops, looking up at something offscreen.

     He's looking at a bright red storefront adorned with red neon:
     THE HOT HOUSE.  Massage parlor.  The Hot House's BARKER notices
     John's interest.

                                 BARKER
                   Interesting isn't it, friend?  You like
                   that, you like girls, then come on in.

     John doesn't hear the barker.  Steps up to study fading pictures
     of naked women massaging happy men.  Nudity.

                                 BARKER (CONT)
                   You'll see a lot more inside.  You'll
                   see a lot more than that.

     John's just looking, his face bathed in bright red light, the
     neon reflected in his thick glasses.


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Somerset, holding more than an armful of art books and novels,
     pounds on the apartment door.  Tracy opens it with the chain on.

                                 TRACY
                   Can I help you?

     She takes a second to drink Somerset in.  Somerset is surprised,
     having expected Mills.  Tracy is so exquisite that he falters.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Uh... I was looking for Mills.  David, I
                   mean.

                                 TRACY
                   He's not here right now.

     Somerset tries not to drop any books while he digs up his badge.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Mrs. Mills, my name is Somerset.  If I
                   could leave these books for him.

                                 TRACY
                           (undoes chain)
                   Please, come in.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT

     Tracy leads Somerset into the disarray of the apartment.

                                 TRACY
                   David went for a walk.  To clear his
                   head.  Oh, you can put those here.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Thank you.

     Tracy motions and Somerset puts the books on Mills' desk.
     He starts looking through one book, checking paperclipped pages.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Could you tell him... tell him this is
                   his reading assignment.  It's urgent.
                   I've marked the most important pages.

                                 TRACY
                   Would you like some coffee, or a drink.
                   David should be back any minute.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I do have to get going.

     Somerset sees a medal encased in glass on the desk amongst pens
     and pencils.  He picks it up: it's a medal for valor from the
     Philadelphia Police Department.

                                 TRACY
                   At least I got to meet you.  David has
                   told me a lot about you.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Really?  Good things, I hope.

                                 TRACY
                   Oh, yes.  He said you were very smart.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Really?

                                 TRACY
                   I think he's a bit intimidated by you.

     Somerset thinks about this, finds it hard to believe.  He goes
     through his pocket, pulls out a notepad and some paper scraps.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm going to leave him a list of
                   specifics.  It all relates to the case
                   he's on.

     He lays the various scraps and receipts aside on the desk, sits
     to start writing on the notepad.  Tracy goes to the kitchenette
     to get a chair.

                                 TRACY
                   You two aren't working together anymore.
                   Isn't that so?

                                 SOMERSET
                   To be perfectly honest, Mrs. Mills...

                                 TRACY
                   Tracy.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Tracy.  David and I weren't exactly what
                   you could call fast friends.

                                 TRACY
                   That's too bad.

     Tracy brings the chair over by the desk and sits.  Somerset
     looks up from his writing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I doubt your husband shares that
                   opinion.

     Tracy nods, leaning forward, semi-conspiratorially.

                                 TRACY
                   You know, Somerset, David is very...
                   determined.  I'm sure you've seen, it's
                   not likely he'll ever be compared to
                   Gandhi.

                                 SOMERSET
                   He's a good cop.  He just...

                                 TRACY
                   He sees policework as a crusade.  That's
                   what he wants it to be, and, that might
                   sound naive, but he's made a conscious
                   choice to be naive.
                           (pause)
                   Believe me, his heart's in the right
                   place.

     Somerset pauses, enchanted by her.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I hear you and he were high school
                   sweethearts.

                                 TRACY
                   Yeah.  Pretty hokey, huh?  But, what
                   girl wouldn't want the captain of the
                   football team as their lifelong mate?

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's rare these days... that kind of
                   commitment.

                                 TRACY
                   I guess so.

     Tracy's smile falters a bit.  Somerset notices this.  He breaks
     from her spell, turns to continue writing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Well... this will only take a minute.

                                 TRACY
                   Take your time.

     Somerset writes.  Tracy looks over the stack of books:

     Titles on the spines: BOSCH, A HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN ART, BREGEL
     THE ELDER, etc.  Hardcover novels: DANTE'S PURGATORY and THE
     CANTERBURY TALES.

     Tracy stands to look at the novels on top, then sees the pile of
     paper scraps from Somerset's pocket.  She picks up the piece of
     wallpaper with the pale red rose at its center.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   What is this?

     Somerset looks up.  Sees her holding the paper rose.  He takes
     it, slightly self-conscious, looks at it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   My future.

     Tracy tilts her head, looking at Somerset.

                                 TRACY
                   You have a strange way about you,
                   Somerset... I mean in a good way...
                   unusual.

     Somerset doesn't know what to say.  He pockets the paper rose.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   I apologize.  I'll get out of your hair.

     Tracy stands, takes the chair back to the kitchenette.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   It's just... it's nice to hear a man who
                   talks like that.  If David saw that
                   paper, he'd say you're acting like a
                   homosexual.  That's how he is.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (mock indignation)
                   Well!  I guess I won't be showing this to
                   him then.

                                 TRACY
                   I suppose not.

     Somerset continues writing.  Tracy sits at the kitchenette
     table, watches him.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     THURSDAY

     EXT.  CITY MORGUE -- MORNING

     It's raining hard.  Mills exits the morgue building with a few
     art books and a paper cup of coffee.  He holds one art book over
     his head as he dashes through deep puddles in the street.

     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- MORNING

     Mills gets in, puts his coffee on the dash and tosses the art
     books in a box.  He closes the door.  Alone with the sound of
     the rain.  He wipes water off his face, looks at his tired eyes
     in the rearview mirror.

     He reaches in the box of books, takes out copies of The
     Canterbury Tales and Dante's Purgatory.  He makes a face, opens
     Dante's Purgatory:

     |_______________________________/_____________________________|

     Mills turns to a bookmark, rests the book on the steering wheel.
     He reads.  He bites his lip, leaning close to the words.  He
     concentrates, mouths some of the words to himself.  He finally
     closes the book, shaking his head, not understanding anything
     he's reading.  He starts pounding the book against the steering
     wheel with all his might.

                                 MILLS
                   Fucking Dante.  Goddamn, poetry writing
                   freak, mother-fuck...

     A figure outside the window knocks on the glass.  Mills rolls it
     down.  A COP in raincoat hands a wet paper bag through.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Good work, Officer.  Good work.

     The cop leaves as Mills quickly rolls the window up and rips the
     bag open.  Inside: Cliff Notes for Dante's Purgatory and The
     Canterbury Tales.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Thank God.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- DAY

     It still rains outside.  Somerset enters, stops to notice
     DETECTIVE MILLS painted on the door where his name used to be.
     He walks, sees all his belongings have been moved from his desk
     and piled on a small temporary desk in the corner.

     Somerset sits at the temporary desk, starts organizing the files
     and papers.  Mills enters carrying the box of books.

                                 SOMERSET
                   How's it coming?

                                 MILLS
                   Great.

     Mills puts the box on the large desk.  They both settle in,
     attending to their work.  Two men, about five feet apart, each
     trying not to acknowledge the other's presence.

     Mills takes out his Cliff Notes, looks to see Somerset is
     occupied, hides them in a desk drawer.

     Somerset finishes one form, flips it and looks up.  There's a
     chalk board nailed to the wall.

     On the chalkboard:     1 gluttony(x)    5 wrath
                            2 greed(x)       6 pride
                            3 sloth          7 lust
                            4 envy

     The PHONE RINGS.  Both men look at it.  Phone RINGS again.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's your name on the door.

     Mills picks up.  Somerset returns to his work.

                                 MILLS
                           (into phone)
                   Detective Mills here.
                           (lowers voice)
                   Honey, I asked you not to call unless...
                           (listens)
                   What... why?  Okay... okay.  Hold on.

     Mills is confused.  He holds the phone out to Somerset.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   It's my wife.

     Somerset looks quizzical.  Mills shrugs.  Somerset takes it.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (into phone)
                   Hello?
                           (listens)
                   Yes, well... I appreciate the thought,
                   but... I...
                           (listens)
                   Well, I guess I'd be delighted to.
                   Thank you... goodbye.

     Somerset gets up, hangs up, puzzled.  Mills is waiting.

                                 MILLS
                   Well?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm invited to have a late supper with
                   you and your wife.  And I accept.

                                 MILLS
                   How's that?

                                 SOMERSET
                           (sits back down)
                   Tonight.

     Mills looks at the phone, lost.


     INT.  MILL'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT

     A record player on a moving box PLAYS QUIET MUSIC.

     There's a basketball game with NO VOLUME on the t.v. screen.
     Tracy, Mills and Somerset eat at the kitchen table.  Mills has a
     beeper by his beer and occasionally fingers it absently.

                                 TRACY
                   Why aren't you married, Somerset?

                                 MILLS
                   Tracy.  What the hell?

     Somerset adjusts his napkin on his lap, thinking.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I was close.  It just didn't happen.

                                 TRACY
                   It surprises me you're not married.  It
                   really does.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Any person who spends a significant
                   amount of time with me finds me...
                   disagreeable.  Just ask your husband.

                                 MILLS
                   No argument.

     Mills grins, but he means it.  he sips beer.  The conversation
     lapses into long silence.  Somerset concentrates on his plate.
     Tracy looks at Mills, who eats while watching the basketball
     game.

                                 TRACY
                           (to Somerset)
                   How long have you lived here?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Too long.  Much too long.
                           (drinks)
                   What do you think of our fair city?

                                 TRACY
                   You take the bad with the good, I
                   suppose.  It's... it's...

                                 MILLS
                   It takes time to settle in.

     Tracy looks at Mills.  Somerset can see it is a sore subject.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (to Tracy)
                   You'll get used to it pretty quickly.
                   There are things in any big city that
                   stand out at first.  But...

     A LOW RUMBLING is HEARD as plates begin to rattle and clatter.

                                 TRACY
                   Subway train.  It's right below us/

     The dishes clatter more.  Coffee cups clink against their
     saucers.  Tracy holds her cup to stop it, tries to act like it
     is nothing, but she is clearly bothered.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   It'll go away in a minute.

     They wait.  The t.v. picture goes fuzzy.  The RUMBLING grows
     LOUDER, knocks something over in the sink.  Mills continues
     eating.  Somerset fiddles with his food.  The record player
     skips, then plays on.  The RUMBLING finally DIES DOWN, till
     everything is normal.

                                 MILLS
                           (uncomfortable)
                   This real estate guy... a real scum,
                   brought us to see this place a few
                   times.  And, it was nice enough, and the
                   price was right.  I was thinking it was
                   nothing, but I started to notice, he
                   kept hurrying us along.  I mean what
                   could it be?  Why would he only show it
                   like five minutes at a time, before he'd
                   hustle us out the door?

     Mills laughs, lamely.

                                 TRACY
                   We found out the first night.

     Somerset tries to stay straight, but he can't help laughing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm sorry... it's a nice apartment.

     He pulls himself together, but only for a moment.  He can't stop
     it, laughs harder, covering his mouth.  Tracy and Mills laugh.

                                 MILLS
                           (sighs)
                   Oh, fuck.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- LATER NIGHT

     The record player spins a different album, DIFFERENT MUSIC.
     Tracy's clearing the last dishes into the sink.  Mills and
     Somerset have beers.

                                 SOMERSET
                   All television does is teach children
                   that it's really cool to be stupid and
                   eat candy bars all day.

                                 TRACY
                   I don't think I've ever met anyone who
                   didn't have a television.

     Tracy takes a pot of coffee to the table and pours.

                                 MILLS
                   That's weird.  It's un-American.

     Somerset shrugs.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What about sports?

                                 SOMERSET
                   What about them?

     Tracy brings over a plate of cookies and puts it on the table.

                                 MILLS
                   You go to movies at least.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I read.  Remember reading?  What's the
                   last book you read, Mills?

                                 MILLS
                   T.V. Guide.

     Mills laughs.  Burps.  he turns to Tracy.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Excuse me.
                           (to Somerset)
                   I just have to say, I can't respect any
                   man who's never seen Green Acres.

     Somerset gives a blank stare.  Tracy walks away.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   You've never seen The Odd Couple?  The
                   Flintstones?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I vaguely recall Wilma, and someone
                   named... Dino.

     Across the room, Tracy turns the t.v. and the record player off.
     She goes into the bedroom, shuts the door behind her without a
     word.  Somerset and Mills turn to the closed door.

     They look at each other, then sit for a time.  Somerset drinks
     coffee.  Mills drums his fingers on his beeper.  Big silence.


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

     Mills walks up the creaky stairs.  He carries his briefcase, a
     six-pack and art books.  Somerset follows, reading a case file.

                                 MILLS
                   We think he acted like he was delivering
                   a package.  The doorman at Mr. Gold's
                   building says he doesn't even look at
                   anyone who goes in anymore.

     Mills opens a door to the roof --

     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

     Mills and Somerset walk onto the roof.  It is a spectacular view
     on all sides.  Miles of city lights.  Breathtaking.  SOUNDS of
     the CITY reach them.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No connection between the two victims?

     Mills shakes his head, unloads what he's holding onto a rusty
     table.  He sits in one of two lawn chairs.  Somerset sits across
     from him.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   No witnesses of any kind?

                                 MILLS
                   None.  Which I can't understand.  It's
                   like this guy's invisible.


                                 SOMERSET
                   In this city, minding your own business
                   is a perfected science.

     Somerset takes a picture from the file, the drawing of the sun
     with an eye at its center.  He opens a book, CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS,
     which is full of illustrations.  He starts paging through.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   At the precinct, Sunday nights, they
                   offer a public crime prevention course.
                   And, the very first thing they teach is
                   that you should never scream "help" if
                   you're in trouble.  Scream "fire."
                   Because people don't want to get caught
                   up in anything.  But, a fire... that's
                   entertainment.  They come running.

     Somerset holds the books up to Mills, points to a picture of the

                   "The Sun in Splendor with the Eye."  It
                   refers to God the father, and to Saint
                   Thomas Aquinas.

                                 MILLS
                   Which saint is he?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Aquinas wrote a summary of theology,
                   Summa Theologica.  And he wrote about
                   the seven deadly sins.

     Mills takes the book and looks it over.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Now, what else have you got?

                                 MILLS
                   Look, I appreciate being able to talk
                   this out, but... it's my case.

                                 SOMERSET
                   So... satisfying my curiosity.  I'm
                   still leaving town on Sunday.

     Mills is pondering, very tired.  He unlatches his briefcase,
     takes a photocopy of the photo of the falsely pretty woman and
     hands it to Somerset.

                                 MILLS
                   The eyes were circled.  With Mr. Gold's

                   She was away on business.  She got back
                   the day he was killed.  If this means
                   she saw anything, I don't know what.
                   We've questioned her about ten times.

                                 SOMERSET

                                 MILLS
                   We put her in a safe house.

                                 SOMERSET
                   This is the one thing.

     EXT.  SLUM TENEMENTS -- NIGHT

     Two twenty-story tenement buildings stand practically underneath
     the span of a bridge.  The streets are littered with garbage.
     Teenagers stand in cliques in front of a liquor store.  Cars
     pass slowly, CAR STEREOS PUMPING out HIP HOP.

     Under the bridge, in shadow, a car is parked between two
     dumpsters.  The trunk is open.

     AT THE BACK OF THE CAR

     The trunk is full of cardboard boxes which are in turn full of
     tall, orange candles.  Hundreds of candles.  JOHN leans in under
     the trunk's bulb, opens a leather pouch and checks the contents:

     A plastic bottle of prescription pills.  A bottle of aspirin.  A
     hypodermic needle filled with liquid.  Lastly, many jars of baby
     food: STRAINED CARROTS, STRAINED SPINACH, CREAMED CORN, etc.

     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

     John climbs the stairs holding the leather case and a closed
     shoebox.  He wears clip-on sunglasses, a hat pulled low, a thin
     overcoat on his plump body.

     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     John comes from the stairwell door, looks, walks up the hall.
     The walls are graffitied.  The soiled floor is wet in spots.
     ARGUMENTS and LOUD CHILDREN are HEARD from behind closed doors.
     John comes to apartment 303.  He's winded from the climb.  He
     takes out keys, lets himself in.  Closes the door.


     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

     Somerset stands at the edge, holding the photo of Mrs. Gold.  He
     puffs on a cigarette, looks out at the city lights.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's like he's preaching.
                           (pause)
                   The sins were used in medieval sermons.
                   There were seven cardinal virtues, and
                   then seven deadly sins, as a learning
                   tool.  The sins distract man from true
                   worship.  True faith.

     Mills is seated at the table with art books open.

     A breeze fans the pages of the books.  The flipping pages reveal
     views of heaven, hell, adoration, crucifixion and sin.

                                 MILLS
                   Like in these paintings, and in Dante's
                   Purgatory, right?  But, in Purgatory,
                   Dante and his buddy climb that big
                   mountain...

                   Anyway... pride comes first, not
                   gluttony.  And in all the paintings,
                   the sins are in a different order.  I
                   can't find a pattern.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Because there's creativity in the mix.
                   Consider these books as the murderer's
                   inspiration.  Or aspiration.

     Somerset drops his cigarette to the empty street, watching the
     glowing tip fall.  He looks at the woman's circled eyes.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   He sees himself contributing to the body

                                 MILLS
                   She didn't find it.  The door to the
                   apartment was open and a neighbor...

                   No.  She got back after you and I had
                   already been there.

     Somerset thinks, coming up with something.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What?

     Somerset holds up the photo of Mrs. Gold.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Maybe she is supposed to see
                   something... she just hasn't had a
                   chance to see it yet.


     INT.  SAFE HOUSE -- NIGHT

     The room is like a bland hotel room.  Mills stands beside MRS
     GOLD.  He shows her photos from the murder scene.  Mrs. Gold is
     crying.  Somerset stands across the room.

                                 MILLS
                   Please, look for anything strange or out

                   I... I don't understand.  Why now?

     Mills helps her go through the photos.  He is shaken himself,
     not wanting to put her through this.

                                 MILLS
                   I need your help if we're going to get
                   the guy who killed your husband.  If
                   there's anything in these pictures...

     Mrs. Gold sobs quietly, wipes her tears.

                                 MRS GOLD
                   I don't see anything.

     Mills looks at Somerset.  Somerset holds other photos.

                                 MILLS
                   We have to show her those.  There might
                   be something she's missing.

     Somerset looks at the photos in his hand, hesitant.  These
     photos show Mr. Gold's corpse, not covered in any way.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Have her look one last time.

                   Wait.  Here... here's something...

                                 MILLS
                   What is it?

     Mrs. Gold points at the constructivist painting on the wall in
     one photo.  The painting is an abstraction of colored squares.

                                 MRS GOLD
                   This painting... in the living room...

                                 MILLS
                   What?

                                 MRS GOLD
                   Why is it hanging upside-down?

     Mills jerks his head to look at Somerset.  Big score.


     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     This is where the greed murder took place.  Somerset and Mills
     are taking the constructivist painting off the wall.  Nothing on
     the wall behind the painting.  Blank space.

                                 MILLS
                   Nothing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   This has got to be it.

     Somerset puts the painting down, resting it on its bottom edge.
     The frame is backed by a thick sheet of brown paper.  He points
     to where the wire used to be screwed into the frame, and to
     where it has been re-screwed.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   It has to be.  He changed the wire to
                   rehang it.

     Somerset tears along the edge of the brown paper to get to the
     space between it and the canvas.  He tears out the entire sheet.
     Mills helps pull it away, but there's nothing there.  Empty.
     Mills looks at both sides of the paper, then tosses it away.

                                 MILLS
                   It's nothing.

     Somerset pays the painting down, face up.  He pokes his finger
     on the painted surface.  Mills watches as Somerset kneels, takes
     out a credit card and presses it's edge against the canvas,
     trying to peel up some of the paint.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Give it up.  The killer didn't paint the
                   fucking thing.

     Somerset pushes the painting away, stands, frustrated.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   He fucked us.

     Somerset backs away from the wall, staring at the space where
     the painting hung.  There is only a nail.  He stares intently,
     then turns and walks out of the room.

     Mills holds his hands to his temples, furious.  SOMERSET can be
     HEARD from the other room, going through drawers, dropping
     things.  GLASS is HEARD BREAKING.  Mills grabs a lamp and throws
     it on the floor.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Son of a bitch!

     Somerset comes back in, holding something.  He steps over the
     lamp and goes to the blank wall space.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Bear with me.

     Mills watches.  Somerset has a woman's make-up compact in hand.
     He opens it, uses the soft brush to begin applying the red rouge
     powder to the wall around the nail.

                                 MILLS
                           (incredulous)
                   Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Shut up and wait!

     Somerset brushes with wider strokes.  He blows, leans very close
     to the wall to study the powder.  Leans closer still.  Pause.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Call the print lab.  Now.


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Tracy is asleep with lights on.  She stirs, opens her eyes.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT

     Tracy opens the door, enters.  It's quiet.  She sees Mills and
     Somerset are gone.  She's all alone.  Unhappy.

     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, FIRE ESCAPE -- NIGHT

     Through the window, we can see into the bedroom.  Tracy comes
     back from the living room.  She goes to her side of the bed,
     kneels.  She reaches between the mattress and bedspring, takes
     out a paperback book she has hidden there.

     She comes to the window, opens it and climbs out onto the fire
     escape.  She sits, dangles her feet through the metal bars.  She
     opens the book and tries to read by the street light, resting
     her head against the railing.  A WOMAN is HEARD SCREAMING
     distantly.

     Tracy looks down the empty street, unsettled.  The woman is not
     heard again.

     Tracy lays back, looks at the sky, holding herself.  We can now
     see the title of the book: PREPARING FOR PARENTHOOD.  There is a
     picture of a baby on the cover.

     Tracy cries, quietly.


     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     A MALE FORENSIC uses a magnifying glass to study a very clear
     fingerprint in black powder on the wall.

                                 FORENSIC
                   Oh, boy...

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Talk to me.

     The forensic bites his lip, still studying.

     Mills and Somerset watch the forensic who works offscreen.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                           (to Somerset)
                   Listen, honestly... have you ever seen
                   anything like this?  Been involved in
                   anything remotely like this?

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.  I have not.

                                 FORENSIC (O.S.)
                   Well, I can tell you this, detectives...

     The forensic steps down from a stool.  Behind him, where the
     painting once was, there are fingerprints, clear and distinct.
     The prints have been left side by side, to form letters which
     form the words: HELP ME.

                                 FORENSIC (CONT)
                   ...just by studying the underloop...
                   these are not the victim's prints.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, PRINT LAB -- NIGHT

     Dark.  A TECHNICIAN sits before an old computer.  The computer's
     green screen shows fingerprints being aligned, compared and then
     rejected; whir - click - whir - click - whir - click.  Mills and
     Somerset watch, bathed in the green glow.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It doesn't work for me.  I can't believe
                   he wants us to help him stop.

                                 MILLS
                   Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of
                   schizoids out there doing dirty deeds
                   they don't want to do.  With tiny voices
                   whispering nasty things in their ears.

     Somerset doesn't buy it.  The technician adjusts a knob.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                   I've seen this baby take three days to
                   finish a cycle, so you guys can go cross
                   your fingers somewhere else.

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Somerset and Mills come from the print lab.  A janitor is
     mopping the hall.  The computer is HEARD WHIRRING AND CLICKING
     onwards.  Somerset sits with a groan on a couch outside the
     door.  Mills flops beside him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You really meant what you said to Mrs.
                   Gold.  You really believe we'll get him,
                   don't you?

                                 MILLS
                   And you don't?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I wish I still thought like you.  I'm so
                   far gone from that.

                                 MILLS
                   So, tell me what you think we're doing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   All we do is pick up the pieces.  We
                   take all the evidence... all the
                   pictures, statements.  Write everything
                   down and note what time things happened.
                   We take it all, make a nice, neat pile
                   and file it away.  Just in case it's
                   ever needed in a courtroom.

                                 MILLS
                   You're unbelievable.  In my entire life,
                   you're the oldest man I've ever met.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I've seen even the most promising clues
                   lead to dead ends.  Hundreds of times.

                                 MILLS
                   I've seen the same.  I'm not the country
                   hick-boy you seem to think I am.

     Somerset takes out a cigarette and lights it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   In this city, if all the skeletons came
                   out of all the closets... if every un-
                   revenged corpse were to suddenly rise
                   and walk again, there would be no more
                   room for the living.

     Mills slumps back, crosses his arms, closes his eyes to sleep.

                                 MILLS
                   Don't try to tell me you didn't get that
                   rush tonight... that adrenalin.  Like we
                   were getting somewhere.
                           (pause)
                   And, don't try to tell me it was because
                   you thought we found something that
                   would play well in a courtroom.

     Somerset looks at Mills, puffs the cigarette.  The computer is
     heard: whir - click - whir - click...


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     FRIDAY

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, HALLWAY -- EARLY MORNING

     Our detectives are fast asleep on the couch, leaning against
     each other.  People pass and look at them strangely.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Wake up, Glimmer Twins.  We have a
                   winner.

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, READY ROOM -- EARLY MORNING

     A windowless classroom.  The captain stands in front with a
     white screen at his side.  The face of a black man, 25, ZERO, is
     projected on the screen from a slide projector.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   His street name is Zero, as some of you
                   know.  His prints were found at the
                   scene by Detectives Mills and Somerset.

     FIVE hardened POLICE OFFICERS, four men, one woman, sit in
     chairs facing the captain.  They all wear bullet-proof vests
     with "POLICE" stencil-painted across them.  Somerset and Mills
     sit in back, drinking coffee, still trying to wake up.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT)
                   Now, Zero has a long, long history of
                   mental illness.  Serious illness.  He
                   was all over your television sets two
                   years ago after he raped and killed a
                   seventy-three year old woman.  He got
                   off, as the saying goes, on a
                   technicality.  So we watched him on the
                   streets, and he went out of circulation
                   about a year ago.

                                 FEMALE COP
                   If he disappeared, what do you want from
                   us?

                                 CAPTAIN
                   His last place of residence is still in
                   his name.  A search warrant is being
                   pushed through the court as we speak.

     A red-headed cop, CALIFORNIA, 28, raises his meaty hand.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   So, have the housing cops walk up and
                   ring the doorbell.  Problem solved.

     The cops laugh.  The captain clenches his jaw.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Listen, California.  When you go in, if
                   Zero isn't home, some of his buddies
                   might be house-sitting.  And besides
                   using, Zero deals, so, you will be very
                   uninvited guests.

     There is chatter among the cops.  Somerset leans to Mills while
     the captain continues the briefing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Does not seem like our killer, does it?

                                 MILLS
                   You tell me.  I'm new in town.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Zero does possess the requisite degree
                   of insanity... but, he doesn't have the
                   desire somehow.  Our killer seems to
                   have more purpose.  More purpose than
                   Zero could ever conceive of.

                                 MILLS
                   We'll tag along.

     Somerset wants no part of that.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Why would we?

                                 MILLS
                   Satisfy our curiosity?


     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- MORNING

     Mills drives, follows a police van.  Somerset rides shotgun.
     Mills is pumped, ready.  Somerset takes one Rolaids tablet off a
     fresh roll and chews it.

                                 MILLS
                   You ever take one?

     Somerset pulls out his gun, checks the load.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.  Never in twenty-four years.  I took
                   my gun out only five times with the
                   actual intention of using it.  I never
                   fired it.  Not once.

                                 MILLS
                   I pulled it once, fired it once.  I
                   never took a bullet.

                                 SOMERSET
                   And?

     Mills turns a corner, tires screeching.

                                 MILLS
                   It was my first one of these.  We were a
                   secondary unit, in vice.  I was pretty
                   shaky going in.  When we busted the
                   door, looking for a junkie, the fucking
                   guy opened fire.  One cop was hit in the
                   arm.  He went flying... like in slow
                   motion.
                           (pause)
                   I remember riding in the ambulance.  His
                   arm was like... a piece of meat.  I
                   thought, it's just his arm.  But, he
                   bled to death right there anyway.

     A pause.  Somerset opens the window, feels the air on his face.

                                 SOMERSET
                   How did the fire-fight end?

                                 MILLS
                   Well, I was doing really good in Philly
                   up till then.  Lots of simple busts.
                   I've always had this weird luck... but,
                   this was wild.
                           (pause)
                   I got that fuck with one shot... right
                   between the eyes.  And the next week,
                   the mayor's pinning a medal on me.
                   Picture in the paper, the whole nine
                   yards.

                                 SOMERSET
                   How was it?

                                 MILLS
                   I expected it to be bad, because I heard
                   about other guys.  You know... I took a
                   human life.  But, I slept like a baby
                   that night.

     Somerset eats another antacid.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I
                   can't remember where, but he wrote that,
                   in order to live in a city, you have to
                   have the ability to kill.  I think he
                   meant you truly must be able to do it,
                   not just faking it, to survive.

                                 MILLS
                   Sounds like he knew what he was talking
                   about.


     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- MORNING

     Crack vials and hypodermic needles crunch under heavy boots.

     The five cops from the briefing, fully geared up, rifles and
     handguns held, move quickly up the stairs, single-file.
     Somerset and Mills follow, guns out.  Somerset is sweating
     bullets.  Mills is juiced.

     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- MORNING

     The cops enter the dank hallway, the same hall we saw John in
     before.  They move cautiously, stepping over a drunken, helpless
     man.  A door opens and a woman peeks out.  The female cop points
     her gun and the woman obeys, slamming the door.

     California leads, steps up to apartment 303.  He has a search
     warrant scotch-taped to the front of his bullet-proof vest.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                           (to black cop)
                   This is it.  Give it up.

     A black cop hoists a battering ram.  The other cops get on both
     sides of the door.  Mills moves front.  Somerset hangs back.

                                 CALIFORNIA (CONT)
                   Police!!  Open the door!

     The black cop brings the ram forward with a splintering thud.
     The door flies open.  The cops storm in.

     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING

     The cops charge down a short hall into this incredibly dusty
     room.  A bed sits against a far wall.  Mills and California move
     up to the bed.  Someone lies under an indigo blanket.  Three
     other cops move, training their weapons on the bed.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Good morning, Sweetheart!

     A blond cop goes into another room.  Mills kicks the bed.

                                 MILLS
                   Get up now, motherfucker!  Now!

     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, ADJOINING ROOM -- MORNING

     The blond cop enters, gun trained, looks around in confusion.

     The room's tables, chairs and floor are covered with hundreds of
     colorful, plastic air fresheners.

     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING

     Somerset moves in, looks around.  He notices the area around the
     bed, the ceiling, walls and floor, has been painted indigo,
     while the rest of the room is its original white.  On a wall, a
     white sheet is pinned up with a square drawn on it in excrement.

                                 MILLS
                   I said get up, Sleepyhead!

     Mills pulls the indigo blanket off the bed, reveals the
     shriveled, sore-covered form of a black man who is blindfolded
     and tied to the bed with a thin wire wrapped time and time again
     around the bed.  Tubes lead from the stained loincloth around
     the man's waist and snake under the bed.  The victim is
     partially covered by what seem to be piles of black spaghetti.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Oh, fuck me!

     Somerset pushes past the cops who recoil from the stench.

                                 MILLS
                   Holy shit.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Sloth... it's sloth.

     The black cop touches the black spaghetti.  Holds a piece.

                                 BLACK COP
                   What the hell... those are dead worms.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                           (to Somerset)
                   Check this out, dick.

     California points with his gun to the end of the black man's
     right arm.  The hand is gone, severed at the wrist long ago.

                                 MILLS
                   It's him.  It's Zero.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Someone call an ambulance.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Someone call a hearse, more like.

     The female cop has gone to the wall where the sheet is pinned
     up.  She pulls the sheet aside and finds: fifty-two polaroid
     pictures; all pictures of Zero tied to the bed, with a date
     written at the bottom of each.  it is a visual history of Zero's
     physical decay.  The blond cop enters from the other room.

                                 BLOND COP
                   What the fuck is going on?

                                 MILLS
                   Hey, California.  Get your people out.

     Somerset takes out rubber gloves and puts them on.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   You heard him.  Hit the hall, and don't
                   touch anything.

     The other cops file out as Mills goes to examine the polaroids
     under the sheet.  Somerset replaces the sheet over Zero's body.
     California stays by his side.

                                 CALIFORNIA (CONT)
                   It looks like he's some kind of friggin'
                   wax sculpture.

     Somerset places his finger along Zero's throat.

                                 MILLS
                   Somerset, you... you better look here.

     Mills studies the polaroids.  Somerset walks to join him.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   All pictures of Zero tied to the bed.
                           (crouches)
                   The last one's dated three days ago.

     Somerset looks at the first photo.  In it, Zero is bound and
     gagged, but he is fit, healthy.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (awed)
                   The first photo... it's dated one year
                   ago.  Almost to the day.

     California lifts Zero's blanket to peek under, examining with
     morbid curiosity.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Mo-ther...

     Mills kneels and lifts the bottom of the sheet off the floor,
     finds an open shoebox.  On the box: TO THE DETECTIVES.

                                 MILLS
                   What's this?

     California leans close to Zero's gaunt, blindfolded face.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   You got what you deserved, Zero.

     Somerset leans down beside Mills.  Mills looks through the
     shoebox.  Inside are plastic, zip-lock bags.  One bag contains
     small clumps of hair, one contains a yellow liquid...

                                 MILLS
                   A urine sample... hair sample...
                   fingernail clippings.  He's laughing at
                   us.

     California is still close to Zero's face when suddenly Zero's
     lips twist.  Zero lets out a loud, guttural bark.  California
     jerks back in fear, shouting, falling over a chair.

     Mills and Somerset reel, standing.  They see California on the
     ground, scared out of his mind, pointing.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   He's alive!

     Mills and Somerset look towards the bed.

     Zero's lips move feebly as he lets out a sick, gurgling moan.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   He's still alive!


     EXT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING -- MORNING

     A crowd has gathered.  Mills' car, the police van and two
     ambulances are parked on the sidewalk.

     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, HALLWAY -- MORNING

     The siege cops are in the hall, holding neighbors at bay.

     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING

     Three ambulance attendants are at the bed, working on Zero.  One
     attendant uses wire-cutters to clip Zero's bonds.

     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- MORNING

     Mills and Somerset stand in the middle of one flight of stairs.
     They are both highly agitated.

                                 SOMERSET
                   The way this has gone, I didn't think it
                   was possible, but we may have
                   underestimated this guy.  The type of
                   intestinal fortitude it must take... to
                   keep a man bound for a full year.  To
                   sever his hand and use it to plant
                   fingerprints.

                                 MILLS
                   I want him bad.  I don't just want to
                   catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Listen... we have to divorce ourselves
                   from our emotions here.  We have to keep
                   focusing on the small details.

                                 MILLS
                   I don't know about you, Somerset, but I
                   feed off my emotions.

                                 SOMERSET
                   He'll string us along all the way if
                   we're not careful.

     Mills is looking at the floor, burning with anger.  Somerset
     grabs him by the jacket.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Are you listening to me?!

     Mills pushes Somerset's hand off.

                                 MILLS
                   I hear you.

     There is a sudden brilliant flash of light and the SOUND of a
     CAMERA ADVANCING.  Mills and Somerset look --

     Down the stairs, John is posing as a reporter.  He has his
     camera and flash up, pointed at the detectives.

                                 JOHN
                   Say cheese.

     He takes another picture, flashbulb flashing.  Mills charges
     downwards, grabs John by his wrinkled clothing.

                                 MILLS
                   What the fuck are you doing?

     John squirms, holds up a laminated PRESS identification pass.

                                 JOHN
                   I have a right, Officer.  I...

     Mills shoves him and John stumbles a few steps, then falls to
     the landing below with a thud.  His glasses fly off.

                                 MILLS
                   That doesn't mean anything.  This is a
                   closed crime scene now!

     Somerset steps down and pulls Mills back.  John stands.

                                 JOHN
                   You can't do this!  You can't...

                                 MILLS
                   Get the fuck out of here!

     John gets his glasses, scrambles downstairs, out of sight.

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                   The public has a right to know!

     Somerset yanks Mills harder, till Mills sits on the stairs.

                                 MILLS
                   How do those cockroaches get here so
                   quick?

                                 SOMERSET
                   They pay cops for the inside scoop, and
                   they pay well.  You can hate them, but
                   you better give them something, or
                   they'll make it all up.

                                 MILLS
                           (calming)
                   I'm sorry... I just...

                                 SOMERSET
                   Oh, it's alright.  It's always
                   impressive to see a man feeding off his
                   emotions.


     INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

     Mills stands with the blase DR. BEARDSLEY, who reviews a medical
     chart on a clipboard.  Zero lies inside an oxygen tent with
     tubes running into him.  The room is dark.

                                 BEARDSLEY
                   A year of immobility seems about right,
                   judging by the deterioration of the
                   muscles and spinal cord.  Blood tests
                   show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his
                   system.  Heroin... crack... even an
                   antibiotic which was administered to
                   keep the bed sores from infecting.

     Mills looks into the oxygen.

                                 MILLS
                   He hasn't said anything, or tried to
                   express himself in any way?

                                 BEARDSLEY
                   Even if his brain were not mush, which
                   it is... he chewed his own tongue off a
                   long time ago.

     Mills winces, moves away from the bed.

                                 MILLS
                   There's no way he'll survive?

                                 BEARDSLEY
                   Detective, he'd die right now of shock
                   if you were to shine a flashlight in his
                   eyes.


     EXT.  CITY STREET, CATHOLIC CHURCH -- AFTERNOON

     A tall church on a bustling street.  Smoggy air has eaten at the
     stonework.  The homeless are camped out on the stairs.

     INT.  CATHOLIC CHURCH, PRIEST'S QUARTERS -- AFTERNOON

     The priest's accommodations are quite spacious and comfortable.
     The parish's wealth is evident.  FATHER BLEEKER, 38, stands
     looking at several 8" by 10" glossies.  He's dressed in his
     "civilian" clothing, wears his hair short and proper.  These
     photos are making him heartsick.

     Bleeker hands them to Somerset who is seated by a fireplace.

                                 BLEEKER
                   Put them away.  I wish you hadn't
                   brought them into the church.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I needed for you to see them.

     Father Bleeker shakes his head, as if he were trying to forget
     the images.  Somerset replaces the murder photos in a file.

                                 BLEEKER
                   There were five principal phases in the
                   development of early Christian art.
                   From Hellenistic through the
                   Renaissance... each period was affected
                   by the decrees of religious leaders.

                                 SOMERSET
                   If this killer belongs to a certain
                   branch of the church... if he collects
                   religious art from a certain period, I
                   want to know.  I have to narrow it down.

     Bleeker walks to an ornate, gold cabinet.  He puts on a pair of
     cotton gloves.

                                 BLEEKER
                   The influences on these... things he's
                   done, couldn't have come before the
                   Gothic period.  What's in those pictures
                   is presented far too asymmetrically.

     Bleeker crosses himself before using a key to open the cabinet.
     He takes out an ancient devotional book and a piece of cloth.

                                 BLEEKER (CONT)
                   The colors will tell the tale.

     Bleeker takes the book to a table.  Somerset follows.  Bleeker
     lays the cloth under the book, opens the book, tenderly.

                                 BLEEKER (CONT)
                   Each sin had a symbolic color.  But the
                   specific color designations changed
                   throughout the ages.

     Somerset leans to examine Bleeker's illuminated manuscript:

     Two pages of prayer.  The prose is elaborately formed,
     surrounded by colorful illustrations of the seven deadly sins.
     Bleeker's finger points to a rendering of a man seated on a
     rock, guzzling from a jug.  It's been painted in orange.

                                 BLEEKER (O.S.,CONT)
                   This is an example.  Gluttony is the
                   sin, and the color is orange.  This
                   particular manuscript is preserved from
                   the 18th century.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   In the murders, gluttony is green.
                   Greed is yellow.  Sloth is indigo.

     Bleeker steps away and Somerset gets closer to the pages.

                                 BLEEKER
                   So, if this murderer is as precise as
                   you say, then you need to find out at
                   what period in history was gluttony
                   green... and so on.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where do I look?  If the colors changed
                   so often?

                                 BLEEKER
                           (contemplates)
                   There is one man... Father Stone.
                           (pause)
                   I haven't heard from him for quite some
                   time.  This was his passion.  He spent
                   his life studying the sins... and
                   preaching against them.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

     The chalkboard on the wall:  1 gluttony (x)       5 wrath
                                  2 greed (x)          6 pride
                                  3 sloth (x)          7 lust
                                  4 envy

     Mills is behind his paperwork covered desk, listening to a
     uniformed OFFICER who looks over a report sheet.

                                 OFFICER
                   Zero's landlord said an envelope of cash
                   was in the office mailbox each month.
                   He says, quote, "I never heard a single
                   complaint from this guy and nobody ever
                   complained about him.  He's the best
                   tenant I ever had."

                                 MILLS
                   There's a landlord's dream tenant.  A
                   paralyzed man with no tongue.

                                 OFFICER
                   Who pays his rent on time.

                                 MILLS
                   Bring me everything as soon as it's
                   transcribed.

     The officer leaves.  Mills starts sorting through piles on his
     desk.  He doesn't know where to begin.

     He sits back in his chair, looks at the collage-like collection
     of pictures pinned on the walls: photos and diagrams of the
     murder scenes, the drawing of the sun and eye, color pages and
     black and white copies of pages from art books.

     He stares, thinking.  He stands, takes a photocopy off the wall.
     The killer's first note:

              Dear Detectives,
                   Long is the way, and hard, that out
                   of hell leads up to the light.

                                 MILLS
                           (to himself)
                   Milton.


     INT.  CENTRAL LIBRARY -- AFTERNOON

     Big brass lamps hang from the high ceiling.  Mahogany chairs and
     tables run down the center floor which is bordered by three
     levels of balconies.  People wander like ants in an ant farm.

     Mills walks, taking it all in.  He goes to the circulation desk.
     Impatient patrons wait in a long line.  He watches the bored
     HEAD LIBRARIAN, female, 64, help an old man at the desk.

     She opens the old man's books, runs a laser pen over a bar code
     sticker, pushes a few buttons on a computer.

     INT.  CENTRAL LIBRARY, TOP BALCONY -- LATER AFTERNOON

     Near the balcony railing, overlooking the main floor, Mills sits
     before a computer card catalog.  He reads the computer screen,
     unsure.  He sets down his pad and pencil, cracks his knuckles,
     begins typing on the keyboard.  The computer gives off a quiet
     BEEP.  Pleased, Mills reads the screen.  Types.

     On the screen:                 TITLE / PARADISE LOST_

     He hits return.  Reads the screen as information on the book
     appears.  He copies it on his pad, puts the pencil in his mouth.

     He types.  On the screen:      SUBJECT / JACK THE RIPPER_

     Hits return.  Again, he copies info from the screen.


     INT.  INNER CITY CLOISTER -- AFTERNOON

     A monk opens a formidable gateway door, letting Father Bleeker
     and Somerset into a garden courtyard.  Bleeker now wears his
     priestly garb and collar.  The monastery's main building looms
     at the end of a pathway.  The building is stately, ivy-covered.

                                 BLEEKER
                   Father Stone had a church and
                   congregation of his own.  But, he...
                   there were some problems.  The church is
                   deserted now.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Problems?

     Bleeker continues walking.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Father?

     INT.  INNER CITY CLOISTER, HALLWAY -- AFTERNOON

     The walls of the hallway are carved with images of saints.
     Bleeker whispers to Somerset beside a windowless door.

                                 BLEEKER
                   There was a small orphanage attached to
                   the church, overseen by Father Stone.
                   This was almost thirty years ago.
                           (hesitant)
                   He was an excellent priest, devoted in
                   every way.  Many in his parish demanded
                   his return.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Tell me what happened.

     Bleeker sees a NUN down the hall, coming towards them.

                                 BLEEKER
                   Allegations were made... Stone was
                   accused of abusing the children in his
                   care.  But, those charges were never
                   substantiated.

                                 SOMERSET
                   What abuse?

                                 BLEEKER
                   It was claimed... that the children were
                   beaten.  And, punished severely.

     The nun is too close for Bleeker to speak freely.

     INT.  INNER CITY CLOISTER, STONE'S ROOM -- AFTERNOON

     The door is unlocked and opened by the nun.  Somerset enters and
     Bleeker waits outside as the nun closes the door.  It's dark.

     FATHER STONE, 73, is in a wheelchair.  Feeble and frail, eyes
     sunken in their sockets.  He looks up at Somerset.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Father Stone.  I'm a policeman.  I'd
                   like to ask you a few questions, if it's
                   alright?

     The whites of Stone's eyes have yellowed.  He seems to nod.
     Somerset sits on a stool, close.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I want to ask you about the seven deadly
                   sins.

                                 STONE
                   The sins.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Yes, father.

     Stone reaches out a hand to touch Somerset's face.  Stone's
     extremely long fingernails trail against Somerset's cheek and
     Somerset tries to hide his revulsion.

                                 STONE
                   Are you one of mine?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I don't...

                                 STONE
                   Are you saved?  Do you have God?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I... I need to ask about the sins.  Do
                   you understand what I'm saying?

     Stone takes his hand away, seems to be getting angry.

                                 STONE
                   Are you a sinner?

     Stone's weak arms wheel him away, towards a corner.

                                 STONE (CONT)
                   There are sinners here.  Even here.
                   And, pain waits for them.  Hell is
                   hungry for them.

     Stone bites his lip, moaning, disoriented.

                                 STONE (CONT)
                   They don't realize... they don't know.
                           (pause)
                   Fuck them all!

     Somerset is shocked by the strength and volume of Stone's jagged
     voice.  The nun goes to place a comforting hand on Stone's
     shoulder.  Stone is beginning to cry.

                                 NUN
                           (to Somerset)
                   They shouldn't have let you disturb him.
                   This shouldn't have been allowed.

                                 STONE
                   Where are the children?
                           (much louder)
                   Where are the children?!


     INT.  CENTRAL LIBRARY, OUTSIDE LIBRARIAN'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

     From a mahogany hallway lined with book-carts, we look THROUGH a
     big WINDOW into the head librarian's office.  The elderly head
     librarian is at a computer, chain-smoking, working the keyboard.
     Mills alternates talking on the telephone and reading things off
     his pad to the librarian.

     We cannot hear them, but it's clear Mills is excited as he walks
     back and forth, hovering over the librarian, looking at her
     computer screen, making suggestions, then walking to monitor a
     dot-matrix printer which spews a waterfall of computer paper
     onto the floor.  Back and forth goes Mills, carrying the phone.
     He closes the pad, puts it in his pocket.

     The librarian finishes typing, sits back, done.  Mills hangs up
     the phone, goes to put it on the librarian's desk, but the cord
     drags, knocks a pile of books off a table.

     The librarian is irritated, goes to pick up the books.  Mills is
     apologizing.  He goes to watch the printer.  He tears the last
     sheet's perforated edge, gathers the huge pile of printed paper
     off the floor.

     Prize in hand, Mills is so grateful he bends to give the old
     woman a kiss on the cheek, but she pushes him away, now even
     more annoyed.  Mills goes to leave, knocks over another pile of
     books.  Before he can assist, the angry librarian points to the
     door.  Mills obeys like a scolded child, exits.

     The librarian shakes her head in disgust.


     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- AFTERNOON

     A once exemplary church, now boarded up, neglected.  Gothic in
     style, it stands with deserted brownstones and empty lots of
     rubble as neighbors.  Smokestacks spew smoke distantly.  Cars
     and trucks drive by on a nearby elevated highway, but down here
     on the street it's a ghost town.

     There's a building attached to the rear of the church.
     Somerset's car is parked beside it.

     INT.  ABANDONED ORPHANAGE, CLASSROOM -- AFTERNOON

     The windows are covered over.  Somerset and Father Bleeker move
     through.  Somerset has a flashlight with a wide beam.  The room
     is empty except for broken, cob-web covered school desks and a
     few file cabinets.  There are cracked blackboards on the walls.
     Rats skitter away from the light.

     Somerset opens a file cabinet drawer.  It's empty.  He walks to
     a door, starts pulling at the rotting boards which seal it shut.

                                 BLEEKER
                   What are you looking for?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm just looking.

     INT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- AFTERNOON

     Somerset pushes the door.  He and Bleeker enter from the
     classroom into the far back corner of the church.  Big church.
     Shafts of colored light needle through the holes in the pieces
     of wood and cloth that cover the broken stained glass windows.

     Somerset walks down the center aisle between deteriorated pews.
     rats run.  Pigeons flap about, dirt drifting off their wings.

     Somerset shines his flashlight forward to the rather barren
     altar.  To the right, at the top of the altar stairs, there is a
     stone statue of a saint with his arms outstretched, welcoming.

     The life-size saint is covered in spider-webs.  Tiny spiders
     crawl across his eyes, which look down on Somerset.

                                 BLEEKER
                   Saint Jerome Emiliani.  The patron saint
                   of orphans.

     Somerset shines the flashlight against the back altar wall,
     revealing a wooden carving of Christ crucified.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Is this still the Lord's house?

                                 BLEEKER
                   Of course it is.

                                 SOMERSET
                   And, even if Father Stone was guilty of
                   everything... if he was hurting children
                   here?  It's still the Lord's house?

     Father Bleeker finds this talk insulting and offensive.

                                 BLEEKER
                   You have no faith, Somerset?  Have you
                   given up on the church entirely?

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.
                           (pause)
                   That's not what I've given up on.

     Somerset notices two ends of a thick rope suspended from the
     ceiling above the center of the altar.  He looks up, following
     the rope with the flashlight, when he notices something else.
     His mouth drops.  Bleeker looks, and is equally horrified.

     Above them, in the beam of light: seven large paintings on
     panels tilted forward at the curve of the ceiling above the
     altar.  Seven ancient paintings; seven deadly sins.

     The beam of light moves to the panel to the immediate right: a
     painting of a man kneeling, grasping at gold coins all around
     him.  The man is naked, as was the victim of the greed murder.
     The chief color in this panel is a vulgar yellow.

     The third in the series is sloth.  The painting, in indigo,
     shows a man at rest in a pliant bed.  The skeletal man's eyes
     are rolled up in their sockets.  He is covered in slimy worms.


     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON

     The streets are full of patrol cars.  Cops and forensics enter
     and exit the church from various doorways.  Saw-horses are
     loaded off a flat-bed truck as a police barricade is erected.

     INT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Much activity, as forensics with flashlights go about their
     business, checking every nook and cranny of the church, looking
     for any sign that someone's been here recently.  Small temporary
     floodlights are hoisted on tripods.

     Two photographers stand at the tops of tall ladders.  Flash-
     photo after flash-photo is taken of the seven paneled tableau.

     Near the open church doors, Mills speaks with great animation,
     holding his ream of computer paper.  Somerset looks at the altar
     and the tableau, preoccupied.

                                 MILLS
                   Our guy's a bookworm, right?  And, I
                   know it's a long shot, but you have to
                   give a picture id and current phone bill
                   to get a library card.  Hey...

     Mills snaps his fingers in Somerset's face, gets his attention.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   I made two separate lists of books.  One
                   relating to the sins... Dante's
                   Purgatory, Canterbury Tales... The
                   Dictionary of Catholicism... all the
                   religious stuff.  The second list was
                   books about torture methods, mass
                   murderers... sadomasochism.  Whatever
                   our killer might study to do the things
                   he's done.  Whatever his other interests
                   are.

     Somerset takes the computer list.

                                 SOMERSET
                   So, what is this?

                                 MILLS
                   Alright.  Everything at the library goes
                   into a computer.  So, you can get in the
                   system and cross-reference...

     Mills fumbles in his pocket, takes out his pad and reads.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Let's say you take, Dante's Purgatory,
                   call number eight-five-one-D, and... The
                   Biography of the Marquis de Sade,
                   ninety-two S-A-D-E.  Put those books in
                   the system, and the computer can give
                   you the name of anyone who's ever taken
                   out both those books.  And, it doesn't
                   just give you their name and address, it
                   gives you a complete history of their
                   library reading habits.

     Mills slaps the list in Somerset's hand.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                           (psyched up)
                   If somebody's out there reading Paradise
                   Lost and studying The Life and Times of
                   Charlie Manson, I want to talk to them.

     Somerset looks up from the list, warming to it.  He starts
     looking around, searching for someone.

     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Somerset and Mills exit down the stairs.  Somerset's still
     searching, holding the list.  He spies a uniformed cop, DARIO.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Dario!  Come here.

     Dario runs up.  Somerset puts his hand on his shoulder and makes
     him walk with him.  Mills continues on to his car.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   According to the Father, this orphanage
                   wasn't around for more than five or six
                   years in the late fifties.  So, I want
                   someone to go to the Department of Child
                   Welfare or City Hall and dig up all the
                   records on this place.  Understand?

                                 DARIO
                   I got it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Get a list of every child who attended
                   this orphanage before it shut down.  Get
                   it on my desk within the hour.

     Somerset releases Dario, who runs to obey.  Somerset goes to his
     own car.  Mills is driving to leave, stops, revs the engine.
     Somerset hands the computer list through the window.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   You thought of this all by yourself?
                   This was your brainstorm?

                                 MILLS
                   Yeah.  Is that so hard for you to
                   believe?

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's a pleasant surprise.

                                 MILLS
                   I'm not as stupid as I look.

     Mills peels away.  Somerset heads to his own car.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (to himself)
                   I guess not.


     INT.  SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING

     Seven large photos hang with the other materials on the wall:

     The seven tableau paintings.  Gluttony, greed and sloth,
     followed by vanity.  Vanity shows a woman standing in front of a
     mirror, staring at her image.  The floor around her is scattered
     with flowers.  The primary color is violet, and as in all the
     paintings, there is a quality of ugliness in the character.

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Ramirez.  Manuel Ramirez.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   No... I don't see any Ramirez.

     The lust painting is next.  It shows a man standing over a
     woman.  The woman is nude, under a sheet, and the man's features
     are bizarre, lecherous.  He wants that woman.  There are apples
     on the floor and on the bed.  The color is red.

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Elinski.  Dennis Elinski.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   No.

     Envy is particularly gruesome.  The Devil is seen hovering in
     the air, wearing a crown, his body orange and slick, wrapped in
     a cloak of flames.  His arms held high, his right hand grips a
     sword, a bolt of lightning, arrows, wheat, thistles, etc.  His
     left hand, holds a plain globe around which a serpent has
     wrapped itself.  He looks down at several pitiful mortals in a
     pit of fire.  The mortals reach for him, yearn for him, the skin
     on their bodies is stretched taut over their bones.

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Atwater?  Paul Atwater.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   No.

     Wrath shows a man surrounded by vaporous, satanic demons.  He
     stands in a puddle of blood, looking at his hands stained with
     and dripping blood.  Other than the rich red, the color is blue.

     Mills is at his desk, a good portion of the print-out list
     draped to the floor.  He rubs his eyes, sighing, gets back to
     it.  Somerset, at the temporary desk, studies his orphan list.

                                 MILLS
                   Okay, here we go.  Listen to the books
                   this guy's been taking out...
                           (reading list)
                   Basic Homicide Investigation.  Forensic
                   Toxicology... The Encyclopedia of Modern
                   Serial Killers...
                           (looks up, excited)
                   Of Human Bondage.

                                 SOMERSET
                   That's not what you think it is.

     Mills is disappointed, runs his finger further down the page.

                                 MILLS
                   Holy shit.  Somerset...
                           (reading list)
                   The Writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas.

     Mills points to the drawing of "the Sun in splendor with the
     eye" which hangs on the wall.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Aquinas.  Right?

                                 SOMERSET
                   That's right.  Let me have it.

     Mills looks at the page... searching...

                                 MILLS
                   Fuck... he used a false name.

                                 SOMERSET
                   How do you know?

                                 MILLS
                   His library card lists him as Jonathan
                   Doe.  John Doe.

     Mills sits back, angry.  Something strikes Somerset as odd.
     Familiar.  He starts leafing quickly through the orphanage list.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What?

     Somerset finds what he's looking for.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Christ... it's like a sick joke.

                                 MILLS
                   What are you talking about?

                                 SOMERSET
                   There is one boy here.  He was
                   abandoned... no one knew who his
                   parents were, so he was named at the
                   orphanage...
                           (looks at Mills)
                   John Doe.  It's his legal name.


     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- EARLY EVENING

     Somerset and Mills climb stairs, turn a corner into this hall.

                                 MILLS
                   It's impossible odds that this is him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   We're focusing.

                                 MILLS
                   I know, I know.  On one little thing.
                   I'm not complaining.  I'll follow
                   anything we get and I'll take it any way
                   we can get it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   We'll look at him.  Ask a few questions.
                   Try to get a feeling whether we should
                   keep tabs on him.

     They reach a door, apartment 3A.  Somerset knocks.  Mills takes
     out his gun and looks at Somerset to ask "what do you think?"
     Somerset nods that he should have the gun ready.  Mills steps to
     the side of the door, knocks hard.  Waits.

                                 MILLS
                           (quietly)
                   I'll do the talking, right?  Let me
                   practice here... um, excuse me Mr. Doe,
                   but, are you by any chance a serial
                   killer?  Oh... oh, you are?  Well, come
                   with us then, if you don't mind.

     Mills smiles at his own wit.  A STAIR is HEARD CREAKING
     offscreen.  Mills turns to look towards the stairs.

     A MALE FIGURE stands at the top of the stairs, wearing a hat,
     standing in shadows.  The man looks at them, lets out a scream
     of horror and reaches into his coat.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Somerset!

     GUNFIRE SOUNDS and a bullet slams into door 3A behind Mills.  He
     and Somerset recoil in shock, going to the floor as another
     bullet explodes, blasting plaster off the wall.  The man is
     HEARD RUNNING back down the stairs.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   It's him!  Jesus Christ, we can get this
                   fucker!

     Mills jumps up.  He moves towards the railing.  Somerset sits up
     and takes out his own gun.  The stairwell is silent.

     Mills peers over the railing into the stairwell's center, gun
     pointed.  A HEAVY METALLIC CLICK is HEARD.  Echoes.  Mills leaps
     backwards as bullets begin raining up from below, accompanied by
     the SOUND of an UZI SUB-MACHINE GUN FIRING.

     Somerset lays flat as he and Mills crawl away from the railing,
     which is being shredded along with the floor around it.  Bullets
     soar unceasingly.  Mills and Somerset hold their hands over
     their ears.  Pieces of wood and plaster fly everywhere.  The uzi
     stops and the man can be HEARD RUNNING again.

     Mills gets up, covered in debris.  He runs down into the smoky
     stairwell.  Somerset rolls over, gets up more slowly.

     EXT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, REAR -- EARLY EVENING

     Mills rushes out into this weedy, overgrown courtyard.  He sees
     a thin vagrant sleeping on the building's junk-pile, then looks
     all directions.  His eyes are wild.  His gun hand is shaking.

     The courtyard is surrounded by alleyways.  The shooter could
     have gone anywhere and is nowhere in sight.  Somerset comes out,
     face wet with sweat.  Mills holsters his gun.

                                 MILLS
                   Are you alright?  Are you okay?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Yeah.  I think so.

     They look at each other for a long time.  Both realizing they
     came very close to dying.

     EXT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, FRONT -- NIGHT

     Police cars on scene.  Curious civilians have gathered.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

     UP THE STAIRWELL, several forensics are collecting shell
     casings, putting them in bags.  The casings are scattered all
     the way up the stairs.  ONE FORENSIC walks up beside a COP.

                                 ONE FORENSIC
                   I hear he's running around with an uzi
                   in one hand and a book of poetry in the
                   other.

                                 COP
                   A real, modern-day renaissance man, huh?

     AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, two forensics, SARAH and BILLY, wait
     behind Mills and Somerset.  Surgical gloves on all hands.  Mills
     kicks at the door to apartment 3A with all his might.  Again.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOMONE -- NIGHT

     BOOM -- door flies open.  Mills enters with Somerset.  Darkness.

                                 MILLS
                           (to forensics)
                   Give us first crack at it.

     Sarah and Billy wait in the hall.  Somerset hits a switch on the
     wall and a lamp illuminates on a desk.  The desk is in the
     center of the room, facing them.  The walls, floor to ceiling,
     are covered with visual stimuli; pictures, paintings, newspaper
     articles, sketches, writings on napkins and notebook sheets,
     etc.  Mostly religious images.

     The far wall is made of shelves full of books.  Mills goes to
     the desk while Somerset goes to the books.  Books: An Overview
     of Theology, Handbook of Firearms, A History of the World, Summa
     Theologica, U.S. Criminal Law Review, etc.

     Mills looks at the desktop.  The surface is marked by dried oil
     colors.  There are tubes of paint laying out, boxes of water
     colors and pastels.  Mills looks at one corner of the desk.  An
     orange candle has been allowed to burn down.  The wax trail goes
     all the way down the edge of the desk to a puddle on the floor.

     Somerset walks, studying one wall of pin-ups.  There are
     articles about the seven deadly sins, pages from art books,
     pencil drawings of Satan and Christ, and drawings of the seven
     paneled tableau paintings which inspired the murders.  Somerset
     lifts several sheets to note the paper scraps are spaced so
     tightly and completely that they cover the window.

     At the desk, Mills opens the top middle drawer.  It's empty
     except for The Holy Bible.  he opens another drawer, which is
     filled with at least forty empty aspirin bottles.

     Somerset looks at a door which is papered over by all the
     newspaper articles and photographs about the seven deadly sin
     murders.  He opens the door --

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO -- NIGHT

     Somerset enters.  The ceiling light is on.  There are
     bookshelves on each wall, filled with thousands of notebooks.

     Somerset takes one notebook down.  It is a thick composition
     book with a marbled black and white cover.  Inside, the pages
     are covered in small handwritten sentences and drawings.

     Somerset takes down another notebook and opens it.  Same as the
     first; scribbled sentences and sketches.

     He walks to another wall, pulls another notebook.  Same deal.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Jesus Christ.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM ONE -- NIGHT

     Mills opens a final drawer to find a rosary and a revolver.

     He looks around, nervous and excited, being in the murderer's
     lair.  He goes to a closed door across the room, notices John
     Doe's bed in the corner.  Sees Doe has a cross nailed to the
     ceiling directly above the bed's pillow.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- NIGHT

     Mills enters the bathroom.  It has been converted into a
     darkroom, lit by red bulbs, with strips of film hanging from the
     ceiling.  WATER is HEARD DRIPPING.

     Mills opens the shower curtain.  Prints hang drying, clipped to
     wires over the tub.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, THE PAINTROOM -- NIGHT

     Somerset enters from the room of notebooks.  This is John Doe's
     art studio.  Windowless, with several easels holding paintings
     in various states of completion.  The walls are covered with
     photos and finished canvases, except for one wall which is blank
     white.  Somerset turns the lights off.

     There is a 16mm film projector on a table, facing the blank
     wall.  Somerset turns the projector on.  It clatters to life,
     running a piece of film.

     The film is spliced into a non-stop loop. Somerset watches the
     wall, light strobing across him.

     The projector shows an image of clouds drifting, with strange,
     superimposed angels in flowing robes floating jerkily.  It's
     like an old, Hollywood version of heaven.

     The image switches abruptly to fire and tormented souls laboring
     around a pit of molten goo.  Like Heaven, it's a scratched piece
     of film from Hollywood's early days.

     Somerset turns to examine one of the paintings on an easel.  The
     painting has been skillfully rendered, in small, controlled
     brush strokes.  It shows a modern city street, stylized, dark.
     The city is peopled by mutated humans and freakish beasts.
     Sinners in the streets, killing, raping, pillaging.  Buildings
     are burning, blood is being spilled.  It's dense with detail.

     Somerset walks to another painting which is covered by a drop
     cloth.  He removes the cloth, uncovers a huge canvas.  We do not
     see the painting, but when Somerset does his features turn grim.

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Somerset!

     Mills enters, tormented, weary.  He stands in the projector's
     bright beam, holds an 8" by 10" print.

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Somerset, we had him.  Goddamn it.

     He hands a press pass and the photo to Somerset.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   The pass is a fake... we had him.

     Somerset looks at the photo, a picture of Mills and Somerset on
     the stairwell of the slum apartment building; the picture John
     took when he posed as a reporter.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   We were that close to him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I know.

     Somerset motions to the huge canvas.  Mills looks:

     The painting is frightening collage, thick with paint.  The
     photo of Mills and Somerset has been incorporated in bits and
     pieces.  Duplicate images: enlarged eyes, hands, faces.  The
     faces have been ripped, scratched, mutilated.  Grainy eyes with
     holes jabbed in them are mounted in paint beside chopped broken
     arms.  Mills' head is on Somerset's body, and vice versa.  It's
     like a sick, fragmented vision of a slaughter house floor.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS -- NIGHT

     A block of burnt-out row homes and warehouses.  Stray, wild dogs
     roam in a pack.  A car turns down this street.  It's John Doe's
     car, moving fast.  Its headlights go out and it cruises,
     avoiding garbage cans in the street.

     FOLLOW the dark car.  Ahead, a few blocks away, we can see the
     only lights in this neighborhood, the flashing reds, whites and
     blues of police activity.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S CAR -- NIGHT

     John Doe brings the car to a stop.  He watches the police at
     work around the abandoned church.  He gives no discernable
     reaction, puts the car in reverse.  He looks behind as he drives
     back the way he came.


     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     The refrigerator door is open.  A male forensic uses tongs to
     remove Zero's severed hand from behind soda cans and mayonnaise.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM ONE -- NIGHT

     The forensic walks through with the hand in a clear plastic bag,
     past a FEMALE SKETCH ARTIST who puts the finishing touches on a
     fairly accurate drawing of the balding John Doe.

                                 SKETCH ARTIST
                   This is the guy?

     Mills stands over the artist.  Sarah, Billy and two deputy
     detectives are at work in the room, photographing, searching.

                                 MILLS
                   Make sure it gets around.

                                 SKETCH ARTIST
                   You got it.  Tomorrow morning, this
                   city's good citizens will be on the
                   lookout for Elmer Fudd.

                                 SARAH
                           (to Mills)
                   We can't find anything to hang onto.  No
                   pay-stubs, no appointment books or
                   calendars.  Not even a book of phone
                   numbers.  And, you're not going to
                   believe this...

                                 MILLS
                   Keep looking.

                                 SARA
                   It's just... we haven't found any
                   fingerprints yet.  Not one.

                                 MILLS
                   You know, you're right.  I don't believe
                   it.  Keep looking.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO -- NIGHT

     Somerset reads one of Doe's notebooks.  Three cops are looking
     through other notebooks from the shelves.  Mills enters.

                                 SOMERSET
                   We need to put more men on this.

                                 MILLS
                   I'm working on it, alright.  What have
                   we got.

     Somerset bristles slightly at Mills' abrupt demeanor.

                                 SOMERSET
                   We've got about five thousand notebooks
                   in this room.  And, as near as I can
                   tell, each notebook contains two hundred
                   and fifty pages.

                                 MILLS
                   Then, he must write about the murders.

     Somerset looks at the notebook, reads.

                                 SOMERSET
                   "What sick, silly puppets we are, and
                   what a gross stage we dance on.  What
                   fun we have, dancing around, not a care
                   in the world.  Not knowing that we are
                   nothing.  We are not what God intended."
                           (turns pages)
                   "On the subway today, a man came up to
                   start a conversation.  He was making
                   small talk, this lonely man, talking
                   about the weather and other things.  I
                   tried to be accommodating, but my head
                   began to hurt from his banality.  I
                   almost didn't notice it had happened,
                   but I threw up all over him.  And I
                   couldn't stop myself from laughing."
                           (closes book)
                   No dates indicated.  They're placed on
                   the shelves in no discernible order.  He
                   describes a scab on his arm for five
                   pages, then writes about existential
                   philosophy on the next.

     Mills walks.  He looks into the adjoining paint room.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   It's just his mind poured out on paper.

     Mills leans in the doorway, looking at Doe's strange artworks.

                                 MILLS
                   You were right.  He is preaching.

     The PHONE RINGS in the other room.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT

     All attention is focused on the phone on Doe's desk.  A tape
     recorder is rigged to the receiver.  Mills and Somerset enter.
     Mills walks over, pushes a button on the recorder, picks up.

                                 MILLS
                           (into phone)
                   Hello... hello?

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)
                           (from recorder)
                   I admire you, David.  Imagine my
                   surprise on finding you at my doorstep.
                   I admire you more and more every day.

                                 MILLS
                           (into phone)
                   Okay, John.  Let's...

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)
                           (from recorder)
                   No, no, no!  You listen and don't talk.
                   I suppose you found the painting and the
                   photos.  This is just as well.  Now we
                   all know we've all seen each other.
                           (pause)
                   I mean what I say.  I do admire you.

     Long pause.  Mills waits.

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.,CONT)
                   Oh, there is one other thing.  Fourteen
                   hundred thirty.  West Eighty-sixth
                   street.  Apartment six-o-four.

     John Doe hangs up.


     INT.  APARTMENT 604, BATHROOM -- NIGHT

     Somerset looks around this femininely decorated bathroom.

     In the sink, objects covered in blood: a pair of scissors, a
     hypodermic needle, first-aid tape and gauze bandages, a bottle
     of anesthetic for use with the needle, a straight razor.

     Somerset moves from the sink, looks in the bathtub.  The tub and
     shower walls are splattered with blood.  The tub has a few
     inches of water in it.  The water is cloudy red and bits of
     gauze float in it.  Somerset jiggles the drain's knob.

     Some bubbles pop up from the clogged drain.

     INT.  APARTMENT 604 -- NIGHT

     Mills is in a dark mood.  He and Dr. O'Neill stand by a WOMAN
     who hangs by a noose from the ceiling.  The woman's head has
     been bandaged sloppily with white gauze and tape.  Her eyes have
     been left uncovered.  The gauze is stained red in small spots.

     The woman hangs low, so her feet are inches from the floor where
     piles of dried flowers and a cordless telephone lay.  There's a
     chair knocked over behind her.

     O'Neill's going through his black bag.  A violet, velvet curtain
     has been draped on the wall in the corner, behind a full length
     mirror.  The mirror reflects the corpse.  A seven-pointed star
     is smeared in lipstick on the mirror's surface, with the words I
     DID NOT KILL HER, SHE WAS GIVEN A CHOICE below.

     Somerset enters from the bathroom, looks at the murder display.

                                 MILLS
                   Pride.  Just like in the painting.

     Somerset nods.  He walks to a dresser.  The woman's purse sits
     open and Somerset extracts her driver's license.  He looks at
     the photo.  The woman in the picture is beautiful.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You can see what he did.

     O'Neill steps up to the woman.  He brandishes dull scissors.
     The captain enters with two uniform cops.  He looks around,
     grim, clenching his jaw.

                                 MILLS
                   Cut her up... dressed the wounds.  He
                   put the noose around her neck and stood
                   her on the chair.

                                 SOMERSET
                   She had the telephone.

                                 MILLS
                   Call for help, and you'll live.  But,
                   you'll be mutilated.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Or, kick out the chair, and spare
                   yourself a lifetime of hideousness.

     O'Neill's cutting the bandages on the woman's face.  He pulls
     them away in front.  Mills looks, disgusted by the sight.

     Somerset sits in a chair, runs his fingers through his hair.

                                 O'NEILL
                   He cut off her nose to spite her face.
                   And he did it very recently.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Alright, boys, you're running on empty.
                   Go home.  Just make sure you sleep with
                   the phone between your knees.


     INT.  BOOKSTORE -- NIGHT

     The bookstore is a labyrinth.  Tables and shelves, mountains and
     valleys of books.  Books, new and used, hard and soft, in
     disorganized groups.  CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS.  A few customers
     search for titles.

     Somerset walks, downcast, winds out of one aisle into another.
     he has his jacket over his shoulder, runs his fingers along the
     books as he goes.  He pulls one book, The Merchant of Venice,
     looks at it, replaces it.  He looks down the aisle and is
     surprised to see Tracy.

     Tracy stands solemn, scanning book spines.  Somerset approaches.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Tracy?

     Tracy brightens a bit upon recognizing him.

                                 TRACY
                   Somerset.  How are you?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm alright.  I'm glad to see you found
                   this place.  I almost should have
                   expected to run into you here, knowing
                   that you teach English.

     Tracy looks up and around.

                                 TRACY
                   It's so huge.  It's amazing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   This is why I moved into this
                   neighborhood.

                                 TRACY
                   Don't you love the smell of all the old
                   books.  It smells like... like... I
                   guess just old books, but, I love it.

     Somerset notices Tracy noticing his gun.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   Forgive me.  No matter how often I see
                   guns, I can't get used to them.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Same here.

     Tracy laughs.  She looks at her watch.

                                 TRACY
                   If David's going to be back home soon, I
                   should get back.

     She starts down the aisle and Somerset walks with her.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   I hope you'll come to dinner another
                   night.  Before you leave.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You can stay and browse a little longer,
                   can't you?  I mean...

     Tracy considers this as they enter an open area.

                                  SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I... I hardly know anyone I can talk
                   about books with anymore.  I'd
                   appreciate the company.

     Tracy stops.  Somerset looks hopeful.  Tracy is very tempted.

     INT.  BOOKSTORE -- LATER NIGHT

     Shelves and empty aisles of books.  CLASSICAL MUSIC still PLAYS.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   The irony is, that after a day of the
                   type of work he did, he'd come home and
                   read me these morbid crime stories.  Le
                   Fanu's Green Tea.  Murders in the Rue
                   Morgue.

     MOVE TO the aisle marked MYSTERY, where Somerset and Tracy are
     leaning against shelves.  They both hold books they've selected.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   My mother would give him hell... because
                   I was young, and he was keeping me up
                   till all hours, giving me nightmares.

                                 TRACY
                   Sounds like a father who wanted his son
                   to follow in his footsteps.

                                 SOMERSET
                   One birthday, he gave me a hardcover
                   book called The Century of the
                   Detective, by Jurgen Thorwald.  It
                   traced the history of detection as a
                   science and it sealed my fate.  Because
                   it was real, and that a drop of blood or
                   a piece of hair could solve a crime...
                   was incredible to me.

     A CLERK looks down the aisle, then walks on.

                                 CLERK (O.S.)
                   We're closing up, Somerset.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Okay, thanks.

                                 TRACY
                   David's going to wonder where I am.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'll give you a ride.

                                 TRACY
                   No.  Please, don't bother.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I have to insist.  If your husband found
                   out I let you ride the subway at this
                   hour he'd tear my head off.

     They make their way out of the aisle.  Somerset chuckles.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I mean, literally.


     EXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT

     Somerset's car stops at the corner of Mills' street.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset puts the car in park.  Tracy sits for a long time, then
     turns to face Somerset.

                                 TRACY
                   You've lived here for so long, Somerset.
                   You know this city.  I...

     Tracy can't quite figure how to put it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's a hard place, Tracy.

                                 TRACY
                   When David and I lived in Philadelphia,
                   we could afford to live on the
                   outskirts.  But now...
                           (pause)
                   I hate it here.  I feel scared, and I
                   feel sick and... I hate it.

     Tracy wants to laugh, like it's silly, but can't pull it off.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You have to put blinders on sometimes.
                   Most times.  But, keep in mind, Tracy,
                   like tonight, there are small pockets of
                   sanity.  Some bars and bookstores.
                   Museums.  Several last vestiges of
                   civilization.

     EXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT

     In Somerset's car, Tracy and Somerset continue talking.

     On the other side of the street, closer to the middle of the
     block, John Doe's car is parallel parked at the curb.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Behind the wheel, John Doe is slumped low, calmly watching
     Somerset and Tracy.  He can see them clearly from here.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Tracy looks out through the windshield, fighting tears.

                                 TRACY
                   I've visited so many of the schools,
                   looking for work, you know.  And, the
                   conditions are... horrible.  I can't
                   believe how bad it is.
                           (pause)
                   Children shouldn't have to grow up here.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You can always look into the private
                   schools.  You'll find something.

     Somerset gives her a handkerchief.  She wipes her tears.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   You're too hard on yourself, Tracy.

     She will not look at him, keeping herself under control.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   It's okay to hate this city.  It's
                   natural.  But, there is a bright side in
                   all this.  There is.  You want to hear
                   it?

     Tracy is able to muster a small smile.

                                 TRACY
                   Oh, God, yes.  Please.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I can't think of another place that
                   needs education more than this city.
                   And you're a teacher.  You can make a
                   difference in a few people's lives.
                   It's a very good thing.

     Tracy leans to give him a kiss on the cheek.

                                 TRACY
                   Goodnight, Somerset.

     They remain close, looking into each other's eyes.

                                 SOMERSET
                  Goodnight.

     Somerset reaches to touch Tracy's face.  They kiss.  They kiss a
     long time.  Tracy wraps her arms around Somerset's neck.
     Somerset runs his fingers through Tracy's hair.  They share
     their sorrow.  Tracy's tears run down her face.  Finally, they
     part, opening their eyes.

     They know this is wrong.  Somerset's hands are shaking.  He
     grips the wheel, feels helpless.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I'm sorry, Tracy.  I'm sorry.

     Tracy's face is flushed.  She is confused.

                                 TRACY
                   I... I better go.

     Tracy gets out, neglects to close the door, not looking back.

     Somerset tries to come to his senses.  He doesn't understand
     either, and his heart is aching.  He adjusts the rearview mirror
     to watch Tracy go.

     INSERT -- THROUGH REARVIEW MIRROR -- SOMERSET'S P.O.V.

     Tracy walks down the block, straightening her hair.  She runs.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset looks away from the mirror.  he holds his head in his
     hands for a moment.

     EXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT

     Somerset leans to pull the door shut, puts the car in gear.
     He drives, turns the corner.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S CAR -- NIGHT

     John Doe watches Somerset's car leave.  Doe turns his attention
     to Tracy, who hurries along the other side of the street.  Tracy
     looks back, enters her apartment building, digs out her keys.
     She gets through the door and climbs stairs, disappearing.

     EXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT

     Doe gets out of his car.

     He looks both ways down the street, walks towards Mills' and
     Tracy's building.


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Mills and Tracy are asleep in their bed.  Mills' eyes shift
     under their lids.  Rapid eye movement.

     A SOUND is HEARD from the other room.  Mills awakens.  He lays
     still a moment, then gets up, slowly, reaches to take his gun
     off the bedside table.  He grabs his pants from a chair, slides
     into them.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT

     Mills opens the bedroom door and enters quietly, gun held up.
     He moves, crouching.

     In the dark, objects in the room and shadows from windows form
     complex, confusing patterns.

     Mills walks between moving boxes, attempting to remain silent.
     He aims the gun from point to point as he advances.

     He gets to a closet.  Staying on one side, he opens the door and
     points his gun.  He carefully separates the clothing hanging
     there.  Nothing.  No one.

     He turns to look over the room.  It's the first time we see it
     in Mills' eyes -- real fear.

     The door to the apartment is wide open.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Mills moves from his apartment, gun out, into the dark hallway.
     The coast is clear.  He stays low, moves down the hall.  He
     stops, looks up.

     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

     Mills shoves the rooftop door open.  It creaks as it swings.

     Mills moves out, backwards, looking to top the raised rooftop
     entrance, covering it with his gun.  He moves around, sees
     nothing, walks to the edge of the roof and looks over.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Mills returns to the bedroom, still holding his gun up.  He
     looks at Tracy asleep in the bed.  The room begins to RATTLE a
     little as a subway train is again passing underground.

     He walks to the window and checks the lock.  He halts.  He opens
     the window and reaches out.  The rattling is a bit LOUDER.

     From the fire escape, he picks up a bundle of thorny thistles
     wrapped with a rubber band.  Mills realizes, Doe was here.


     INT.  SAFE HOUSE -- NIGHT

     The room is plain, like the room Mrs. Gold was kept in.  The
     door opens and Tracy and Mills enter.  They look sleepy,
     carrying suitcases.  A uniformed cop closes the door for them.

     Mills goes to lay a suitcase on a table while Tracy looks
     around, depressed, distant.  The lighting is bad.  There are no
     decorations, no windows.  A wide crack runs down one wall.

     Tracy sits down on the bed.  Mills notices her discontent.

                                 MILLS
                   It won't be for long, honey.  I swear.
                   This is just till this is over.

                                 TRACY
                   I know.

     Mills goes to sit beside her.  He puts his hand on her shoulder.

                                 MILLS
                   I'm sorry.

     Tracy nods.  She stands, goes to start turning down the covers.

                                 TRACY
                   I know.  It can't be helped.

     Mills feels useless, powerless.  He goes to the suitcase and
     starts unpacking the contents.  Tracy continues turning down the
     sheets.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     SATURDAY

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- EARLY MORNING

     The chalkboard:            1 gluttony (x)      5 lust

     Somerset is seated, holding the photo of the lust painting from
     the tableau.  Mills is behind his own desk.  They both look like
     they haven't gotten much sleep.

                                 MILLS
                   There's two people in that painting.
                   So, maybe he's planning to kill two
                   people this time.  Maybe.

     Mills looks at Somerset, who doesn't seem to be listening.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What's wrong this morning?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Nothing.  Sorry.

     Somerset looks up, sips from a cup of coffee, looks at the
     photo.  Mills swings his chair, looks out the window at the
     morning light on the billboard.

                                 MILLS
                   Lust is next.  Lust is sex.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Apples on the floor.  Original sin.

                                 MILLS
                   Adam and Eve.

     Somerset puts the photo down, leans back, takes out a cigarette.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Sex, sex, sex.  Fucking sex.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Lust is everywhere.  That's the hard
                   part.  I think lust is the most
                   prevalent sin, even more than greed.

     Somerset looks at the burning tip of his cigarette.  He gets up
     to stretch his legs.

     Mills picks up the lust photo, puts his feet up on the desk.

                                 MILLS
                   Lust is red.

     Long pause.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Bright red.

                                 MILLS
                   Blood red.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

                                 MILLS
                   Red blooded.  Red head.  Dead.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Red light district.

     Pause.  Realization.  Somerset and Mills look at each other.

                                 MILLS
                   That would make sense.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It would be fitting.

                                 MILLS
                   You're damn right it would.

     Mills picks up the phone.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS, PORNO DISTRICTS -- AFTERNOON

     Porno theaters and Adult Bookstores rule these busy sidewalks.
     Marquees offer SEXY STUFF, PUSSY FEST and movies like MIDNIGHT
     PLOWBOY and NATIONAL LAM-PORN'S CHRISTMAS INSERTION.  Cops are
     walking through the pedestrian flow, handing out photocopies.
     There are many patrol cars on the street.  Definitely a larger
     than usual police presence.

     Cops are questioning the proprietors of porn at the entrances of
     their shops and theaters.

     Cops are taping photocopies onto lamp posts.  These photocopies
     are warnings, with the drawing of John Doe's face above a line
     of information and the words HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?


     INT.  WILD BILL'S LEATHER SHOPPE -- AFTERNOON

     Somerset's holding up the composite sketch of John Doe.

                                 WILD BILL (O.S.)
                   Yeah, he was here.  This morning.

     Mills and Somerset are across the sales counter from WILD BILL,
     37.  Wild Bill is shirtless, covered in tattoos.  A thick scar
     runs down his forehead to his bent nose.  Leather belts, whips
     and jackets hang from the walls.

                                 MILLS
                   It was definitely him?  You're positive?

                                 WILD BILL
                   Yeah.  John Doe.  Easy name to remember.

                                 SOMERSET
                   What was this job you did for him?

     Wild Bill pulls a box from behind the counter, digs in it.

                                 WILD BILL
                   I got a picture of it.  That's what he
                   came for this morning.  I figured he
                   must be one of those art guys... like
                   those guys who piss in a cup and drink
                   it on stage.  Performance art.

     Wild Bill gives a polaroid to Mills.  We don't see the image.

                                 MILLS
                   Oh, fuck...

                                 WILD BILL
                   I think I undercharged him.  I was up
                   all night working to finish it.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (looks at photo)
                   You built this for him?  You built this?

                                 WILD BILL
                   I've built weirder shit than that.

     A BEEL CHIMES as a POLICEMAN enters the store.

                                 POLICEMAN
                   Somerset... we have a situation.

     Mills and Somerset follow the policeman out.

                                 WILD BILL
                   Hey, my picture!

     They're gone.  Wild Bill scratches his scar.

                                 WILD BILL (CONT)
                   Fucking pigs.


     EXT.  THE HOT HOUSE MASSAGE PARLOR -- AFTERNOON

     It's a madhouse outside The Hot House.  Police action in
     progress.  Cops have formed a barrier, holding off a crowd and
     creating an aisle to the back of a jail-van.  Cops and
     detectives escort various men, women and transvestites into the
     large vehicle.  The crowd, consisting of the dregs of society,
     is angry.  Some spit and throw trash at the cops.

     INT.  THE HOT HOUSE, RECEPTION AREA -- AFTERNOON

     An ANGRY COP pounds his nightstick on a glass cage.  Inside the
     cage sits an oily FAT MAN in front of a wall of sex toys.

                                 FAT MAN
                   Just wait!

                                 COP
                   Get out of the fucking booth!

                                 FAT MAN
                   Just wait!  I'll come out, just wait!

     INT.  THE HOT HOUSE, CORRIDORS -- AFTERNOON

     All the lights and walls are red.  Mills and Somerset follow a
     COP through the twisting corridors.  ROCK MUSIC THROBS.  They
     reach a door.

                                 COP
                   I don't want to go in there again.

     INT.  THE HOT HOUSE, RED ROOM -- AFTERNOON

     Mills and Somerset enter.  ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES, LOUD.  A strobe
     light flashes from the ceiling onto TWO AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS.
     The first attendant places a sheet over a bed, hiding the corpse
     of a WOMAN with long blonde hair.  The second attendant tries to
     examine the pupils of a CRAZED MAN, 55, who sits naked on the
     floor, wrapped in a sheet.  A COP holds the crazed man down.

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   He... he... he made me do it!

                                 SECOND ATTENDANT
                   I have to look at you.  I have to look
                   at you.

     An X is scratched into the red paint on the wall.  Mills and
     Somerset move towards the covered body.

     There are apples on the bed and floor.  The ROCK MUSIC from
     outside SUDDENLY STOPS.

                                 FIRST ATTENDANT
                   You're not going to want to see this
                   more than once.

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   He had a gun!  He... he made me do it!

     The sheet is lifted for the detectives.  They grimace at what
     they see.  We do not see.  Somerset closes his eyes and walks to
     face a wall, shaken.  The first attendant replaces the sheet.

     Mills steps back, takes out his handkerchief and sucks on it.

                                 CRAZED MAN (O.S.,CONT)
                   He made me do it!


     INT.  SANATORIUM, WHITE ROOM -- AFTERNOON

     A polaroid is on a white table.  It is the photo Wild Bill gave
     to Mills and Somerset.  It is a picture of a belt, made with
     extra leather straps so it can be worn securely around the
     groin.  It is a strap-on phallus, but there is no plastic
     protuberance.  Instead, there is a metal knife.  It is a strap-
     on butcher's knife.

     Somerset is seated beside the white table in this white room.
     Mills stands behind him.  The crazed man from the lust murder is
     in a chair across the room.  The crazed man is crying.

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   And... and... and he said... he asked if
                   I was married.  And, I could see he had
                   a gun in his hand.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where was the girl?

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   What?  What?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where was the prostitute?

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   She was... she was on the bed.  She was
                   just sitting on the bed.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Who tied her down?  You or him?

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   He had a gun.  He had a gun, and he made
                   it happen.  He made me do it!
                   He made me put it on... that thing.  Oh,
                   God... he made me wear it.  He had the
                   gun in my mouth.

     The man slides off the chair and hides his face in his hands.

                                 CRAZED MAN (CONT)
                   The gun was in my throat.

     Mills looks at the mirror in the room.

     Somerset stands, picks up the Polaroid as two men in white
     uniforms enter to collect the crazed man from off the floor.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING

     Somerset and Mills are shell-shocked, seated at their desks.
     Somerset is looking out the window.  Mills stares at the wall.

     Somerset looks to his temporary desk.  He picks up a small pile
     of mail, sorts through it.  An 8" by 10" manila envelope
     interests him.  It reads DETECTIVE SOMERSET on the outside,
     handwritten in red marker.  He opens it.

     He takes out a grainy photograph of he and Tracy kissing in his
     car.  It's obviously been taken with a special night-lens.

     Somerset goes pale, suppressing a gasp.  He holds the photo to
     hide it from Mills, looks to see Mills has not noticed.  He
     feels panicky, crumples the photo and envelope in his hand.

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Somerset enters, latches the door.  He takes the crushed photo
     and envelope from his pocket.  He quickly checks under the
     stalls to see he is alone.  He opens a window, goes to the sink.

     He takes out his cigarette lighter, lights the envelope and
     photo, watches them catch.  Once they're burning steady he
     throws them in the sink.

     He backs away, leans against the wall, watching, feeling sick.


     INT.  SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset and Mills sit with a full pitcher of beer between them.
     The JUKEBOX plays QUIETLY for other customers.  The walls of the
     bar are lined with trophies, ribbons and other victory symbols.

                                 SOMERSET
                   There's not going to be a happy ending.
                   It's not possible.

                                 MILLS
                   If we get him, I'll be happy enough.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's
                   good guys against the bad guys in this
                   city.

     Mills drinks deep, pours more.

                                 MILLS
                   How can you say that?  Especially after
                   today?

                                 SOMERSET
                   You tell me... when you walk into an
                   apartment, and a man has beaten his wife
                   to death, or, a wife murdered her
                   husband in cold blood... and you have to
                   wash the blood off their children.  You
                   put the killer in jail.  Who won?

                                 MILLS
                   If I thought like you, I'd have slit my
                   wrists a long time ago.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where's the victory?

                                 MILLS
                   You do your job.  Follow the law and do
                   the best you can.  It's all there.

                                 SOMERSET
                   If we caught John Doe tomorrow, and it
                   turned out he was the devil... if it
                   turned out he was literally Satan, then,
                   that might live up to our expectations.
                   No human being could do these horrible
                   things, right?!  But, this is not the
                   devil.  It's only a man.

                                 MILLS
                   Why don't you shut the fuck up for a
                   while?!  Huh?  You make these
                   speeches... like you know everything
                   there is to know.

     Somerset sits back, looking at Mills.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   You think you're preparing me for the
                   hard times ahead?
                   You think you're toughening me up?
                   Well, you're not!
                           (pause)
                   You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying
                   to fight.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Who are you fighting for?  People don't
                   want a champion.  They just want to keep
                   playing the lottery and eating
                   hamburgers.

                                 MILLS
                   What the fuck is wrong with you, huh?
                   What burnt you out?

                                 SOMERSET
                   There's no one thing, if that's what you
                   mean.  I just... I can't live anymore
                   where stupidity is embraced and nurtured
                   as if it were a virtue.

                                 MILLS
                   You're so much better than everyone,
                   right?  No one's worthy of you.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Wrong!  I sympathize completely.
                   Because if you can't win... then, if you
                   don't ignore everything and everyone
                   around you, you go insane.  It's easier
                   to smoke crack, and not worry that your
                   wife and kids are starving to death.
                   And, it's so much easier to bear a child
                   till that child finally shuts up,
                   because it takes so much work to love.
                   And, if you bothered to think about the
                   abuse, and the damage, you'd be sad.

                                 MILLS
                   You're talking about people who are
                   mentally ill.  You're...

                                 SOMERSET
                           (cuts in, furious)
                   No, I am not!  I'm talking about common,
                   everyday life here.  Where Ignorance
                   isn't bliss, it's a matter of survival.

                                 MILLS
                   Listen to yourself.  You say, "the
                   problem with people is they don't care,
                   so I don't care about people."  But, if
                   you're not part of the solution...

                                 SOMERSET
                           (cuts him off)
                   People who are in arguments over their
                   heads always use meaningless slogans.
                   But, life doesn't conform to analogies.

                                 MILLS
                   You're already here, and you've been
                   here a long time.  So, there's a part of
                   you that knows, even if everything you
                   say is true, none of it matters.

                                 SOMERSET
                   That part of me is dead.

     Mills stands.

                                 MILLS
                   Fuck you.  You want me to agree with
                   you.  "Yeah, you're right, Somerset,
                   this place is fucked.  Let's go live in
                   a fucking log cabin!"  Well, I don't
                   agree with you.  You're quitting, and it
                   makes me sick.  Cause, you're the best
                   I've ever seen.

     Mills digs out some money and throws it on the table.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Thanks for the beer.

     Mills leaves.  Other patrons watch him go.  Somerset takes out a
     cigarette.  He goes to light it.  The lighter will not light,
     and when it does, Somerset's hand is shaking.


     INT.  SAFE HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Mills comes quietly into the bedroom.  Tracy is asleep in the
     bed.  Mills takes off his jacket, puts it down.  He sits on a
     chair and unties one shoe, takes it off.  He looks at Tracy,
     looks at her a long time.

     He puts the shoe on the floor and goes to get on the bed.  He
     kisses Tracy's forehead, looks at her sleeping innocently.  He
     is touched, saddened.  He kisses her cheek, then wraps his arms
     under and around her.  He holds tight, kisses her again.  Tracy
     stirs.

                                 TRACY
                   David?

     Mills his face against her, holding tighter still.

                                 MILLS
                   I love you.

     Tracy holds his face in her hands, sees that he is crying.

                                 TRACY
                   David?

                                 MILLS
                   I love you.

     Mills clings to her.  She wraps her arms around him as he cries
     quietly against her, and she kisses him, tries to comfort him.
     He sobs.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS, INDUSTRIAL AREA -- NIGHT

     John Doe walks in this section of huge industrial complexes.
     Factories and foundries are lined side by side, seemingly for
     miles.  We can HEAR TUGBOAT HORNS sounding low and deep.  We're
     near the water.

     Doe seems to know where he's going.  He passes stacks of
     industrial piping and steel drums piled to the sky.

     He walks through an industrial junk-yard filled with trashed
     bulldozers, trucks and discarded factory equipment.  It's like a
     stroll through a bone-yard of dead dinosaurs.

     At the end of this field of metal, there is a tall, narrow
     alleyway formed by two warehouses.  Doe enters, looking up at
     the single lit bulb on the wall above.

     He looks at the ground, picks up a rock and a beaten hubcap,
     walks under the bulb.  He throws the hubcap with all his might.
     It soars, but misses the bulb, falls to the ground behind.

     Doe takes aim with the rock.  He throws, grunting.

     The rock smashes the bulb, bringing darkness to the alley.

     Doe walks back to the mouth of the alley.  He stops and turns to
     start from there.  He walks, deliberately, looking down at his
     feet.    FOLLOW as he walks.

     He stops, looks back to the way he came, then looks down at the
     ground in front of him again.  He takes off his thick glasses.

     He holds the glasses in his hand.


     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Somerset is in bed.  The metronome is sounding: tick, tick,
     tick... The SOUNDS of the CITY are LOUD.

     Somerset closes his eyes, concentrating on the metronome.  Tick,
     tick, tick... A MAN and a WOMAN are HEARD SCREAMING at each
     other incoherently from outside.  Somerset rolls over, restless. 
     Tick, tick, tick...

     A THIRD VOICE is HEARD from outside.  This man is screaming at
     the other two people to shut up.  Somerset opens his eyes, sits
     up.  He reaches over, grabs the metronome and throws it against
     the wall.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     SUNDAY

     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING

     Somerset sits away from the bed.  He's smoking a cigarette.  The
     PHONE RINGS.  Somerset gets up, not in the best of moods.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (into phone)
                   Hello.

                                 TRACY (V.O.)
                           (from phone, upset)
                   Hello, Somerset.  It's Tracy.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Is everything alright?

                                 TRACY (V.O.)
                   Yes.  Everything's fine.  Could... could
                   you meet me somewhere.  To talk.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (pause)
                   I don't think that's a good idea.

                                 TRACY (V.O.)
                   I need to talk to someone, Somerset.
                   You're the only friend I have here.  I
                   don't know anyone else.


     INT.  COFFEE CAFE -- MORNING

     Somerset and Tracy are seated in a booth by the window.  The
     city's morning rush passes by outside.  The cafe is noisy.
     Tracy is very upset.  Somerset is very uneasy.

                                 SOMERSET
                   David doesn't know about this?  You
                   haven't told him?

     Tracy shakes her head.  Somerset sighs.  Long silence.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I have to tell you, Tracy, I'm not the
                   one to talk to about this.

                                 TRACY
                   I just can't think straight.  I don't
                   know why I called you, except I can't
                   stand to hold it as a secret anymore.  I
                   had to get it out... and I can't tell
                   David yet.  Not yet.

     Somerset takes out his cigarettes, but thinks better of it and
     puts them away.  He watches Tracy stir her coffee.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I... I had a relationship once, very
                   much like a marriage.  And, there was a
                   baby.  A long time ago.  Things were
                   good.  And I got up one morning, and I
                   went on a case... a murder, like any
                   other.  Except it was my first since
                   hearing about the baby.  And, I felt
                   this fear and anxiety coming over me.  I
                   looked around and I thought, how can I
                   raise a child here?  So, that night, I
                   told her I didn't want us to have
                   children,  And, over the next few
                   weeks... I convinced her...

     Tears come to Somerset's eyes.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I mean, I wore her down... slowly.

                                 TRACY
                   I want to have children.  But...

                                 SOMERSET
                   I can tell you, I know... I'm positive I
                   made the right decision.  I'm positive
                   it was the right thing to do.  But,
                   there's never a day that goes by that I
                   don't wish I had decided differently.

     Tracy reaches to hold Somerset's hand, but he withdraws it,
     wipes his tears away.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   If you... if you decide not to have the
                   baby... if that's what you decide, then
                   never tell Mills you were pregnant.
                   I mean that.  Never tell.
                           (pause)
                   Your marriage would just wither, and die
                   altogether.

     Tracy looks around the cafe, tears in her eyes.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   But, if you decide to have the baby,
                   then, at that very instant, when you're
                   absolutely sure... tell him.  Tell him
                   that exact second.  And, spoil that kid
                   every chance you get.

                                 TRACY
                   Somerset...

     Somerset stands.  He forces a smile.

                                 SOMERSET
                   That's all the wisdom I can share with
                   you, Tracy.  I barely know you.

                                 TRACY
                   Will I see you again, before you leave?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Probably not.  But, it's probably better
                   that way.

     Somerset steps away, leaves.  Tracy watches him go.


     EXT.  CITY STREET -- DAY

     Mills and Somerset walk towards the precinct house.  They wade
     through cars to cross the street.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I've decided... I want to stay on, till
                   this is over.  Till either it's done, or
                   we can see it will never end.

     Mills remains impassive.

                                 MILLS
                   Oh, you want to stay now?

                                 SOMERSET
                   One of two things is going to happen.
                   We're either going to get John Doe...
                   or, he will finish his series of seven,
                   and he'll never be found.

                                MILLS
                   You think if you stay you're doing me
                   some big favor?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm requesting you keep me on as your
                   partner a few more days.  You'd be doing
                   me the favor.

                                 MILLS
                   You knew I'd say yes.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.  I wasn't sure at all.

     They enter the precinct house.  Down the sidewalk, from a
     distance, comes John Doe.  His brown workboots and clothing are
     splattered with blood.

     He walks towards the precinct house, hands in his pockets, like
     he's merely out for a walk on a Sunday afternoon.  People on the
     sidewalk stop upon seeing him, avoiding him.

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, RECEIVING LOBBY/BOOKING -- DAY

     Mills and Somerset walk past booking cubicles and benches of
     handcuffed low-lifes.  The place is swimming with activity.

     The two detectives head to a duty desk at the end of the room.

                                 SOMERSET
                   As soon as this is over, I'll be gone.

                                 MILLS
                   What a great big surprise that is.

     They pass through a gate and Somerset goes to the staircase
     leading to the second floor.  Mills stops at the duty desk.
     Other cops are fighting for the DUTY SERGEANT'S attention.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Mills and Somerset are on the premises.

                                 SERGEANT
                   Wonder-fucking-ful.

     Mills stops, looks.  Somerset stops, looks back down the stairs.

     John Doe stands inside the precinct house doors.  He holds out
     his arms as if to say "presto, here I am."

     Near silence comes to the room as all eyes go to the figure of
     John Doe.

     Mills is riveted, finding this impossible to comprehend.

     One UNIFORMED COP takes out his gun, points it at John Doe.

                                 UNIFORMED COP
                   It's him!

     Several other cops drop what they're doing and draw weapons.
     Mills, still off-balance, walks back through the gate, takes his
     gun out and points it at Doe.

                                 MILLS
                   Get down on the floor.

     Somerset comes back down the stairs.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Be careful!

     Cops move slowly in on Doe from all sides.

                                 ANOTHER COP
                   You heard him!  Get on the floor!

     John Doe gets on his knees, hands up.  Mills moves close, but
     not too.  ONE COP comes from behind, nudges Doe with his foot.

                                 ONE COP
                   Spread your legs and get your hands out
                   in front of you.

                                 MILLS
                   Get down!  Face down!

     John Doe gets on his stomach, obeys.  Mills comes right up to
     Doe, steps on his neck, puts his gun against Doe's head.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Don't move.  Don't move a fucking inch.

     Cops frisk and handcuff Doe.  Somerset comes beside Mills.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I don't believe it.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Hello, Lieutenant Somerset.

                                 COP
                   What the hell is this?

     The cop putting the handcuffs on Doe holds up Doe's hands.  Doe
     winces.  Every single one of Doe's fingers has a bandage wrapped
     around it.  John Doe looks up, his face pressed against the
     floor, glasses askew, Mills' gun at his temple.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   I want to speak with my lawyer.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, OBSERVATION ROOM -- DAY

     Mills, Somerset and the captain stand in darkness.

     On the other side of a two-way mirror, John Doe is seated in a
     restraining chair in an interrogation room.  His hands and legs
     are bound with leather straps to the chair's arm and legs.  A
     strap hold tight around Doe's throat.  This is not some
     superman/serial killer.  He looks more like an eccentric college
     professor.  His lawyer MARK SWARR, 43, sits at a table, taking
     notes.

     Mills holds a fingerprint card.  The black ink prints are just
     useless blobs with traces of blood in them.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   He cuts off the skin of his fingertips.
                   That's why we can't find a single usable
                   print in his apartment.  For a long
                   time, he's been cutting before the
                   papillary lines can grow back.

                                 MILLS
                   What about the trace on his bank
                   account?  The guns?

                                 CAPTAIN
                   The orphanage is all we have.  His bank
                   account is only five years old and it
                   started as cash.  There's no credit
                   history, no employment history.  We even
                   tried to trace his furniture.  All we
                   know for sure is he's wealthy, well
                   educated and totally insane.  We may
                   never know how he got that way.

     Somerset stands looking in at Doe.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Because he is John Doe, by choice.

                                 MILLS
                   When do we get to question him?

                                 CAPTAIN
                   You don't.  This goes to court now.

                                 MILLS
                   This doesn't make sense, captain.  He
                   wouldn't just turn himself in!

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed
                   to make sense.

                                 MILLS
                   He's not finished!

                                 CAPTAIN
                   You're wound way too tight on this,
                   Mills.

                                 MILLS
                   Somerset... help me out here.

     Somerset looks at them.  Says nothing.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   It's over.

     The captain leaves.  Mills is furious.

                                 MILLS
                   Damn it, Somerset.  You know Johnny's
                   fucking with us.  He's pissing in our
                   faces again!

                                 SOMERSET
                   Slow up.  You and I are, probably for
                   the first time ever, in total agreement.
                   He wouldn't just stop.

                                 MILLS
                   Well... what the fuck, man?

                                 SOMERSET
                   John Doe's only two murders away from
                   finishing his masterpiece, right?  But,
                   can you even conceive of what might
                   happen next?  I mean, can you tell me
                   how he's going to go about it?

                                 MILLS
                           (pause)
                   No.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I can tell you this; I recognize his
                   lawyer.  His name is Mark Swarr.  He's
                   the one who kept Zero out of prison.
                           (pause)
                   We'll wait for John Doe's plea.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- DAY

     Mills is at the desk with his feet up, stares at the chalkboard:

                    1 gluttony (x)       5 lust (x)
                    2 greed (x)          6 wrath
                    3 sloth (x)          7 envy
                    4 pride (x)

     Clock on the wall says 4:45.  Somerset packs books into boxes,
     preparing for his eventual departure.  The captain opens the
     door and steps into the office.  He clears his throat, looking
     like there is something very wrong.

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- DAY

     Mills and Somerset stand together.  The captain is behind his
     desk with the D.A., Martin Talbot, seated in front of him.  Mark
     Swarr addresses them all, seems nervous, but in control.

                                 SWARR
                   My client says there are two more
                   bodies... two more dead, hidden away.
                   He will take Detective Mills to these
                   bodies, but only Detective Mills.  Only
                   at six o'clock, today.

     Swarr wipes his brow with a handkerchief.

                                 TALBOT
                   Oh, Christ.

                                 MILLS
                   Why me?

                                 SWARR
                   He says he admires you.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (to captain)
                   This is all part of his game plan.

                                 SWARR
                   Mr. Doe claims that if the detective
                   does not accept this offer, the bodies
                   will never be found.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Frankly, counselor, I'm inclined to let
                   them rot.

     Mills walks up into Swarr's face.

                                 MILLS
                   You like what you do for a living?

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Back off, Mills.

                                 SWARR
                   I'm required by law to serve my clients
                   to the best of my ability, and to serve
                   their interests.

     Mills eases off.  Talbot is agitated, tapping a finger on the
     gold tooth in his mouth.  He looks at Swarr.

                                 TALBOT
                   We don't make deals like this.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   We're going to have to pass.

                                 SWARR
                   My client... he also wishes that I
                   inform you, if you do not accept, he
                   will plead insanity, across the board.

                                 TALBOT
                   Let him try.  I'd like to see him try!

                                 SWARR
                   Come now, Martin.  Even he knows, with
                   the nature of these crimes, I could get
                   him off with such a plea.

     Talbot stands, wringing his hands.  Mills and Somerset are
     looking at each other, thinking it over.

                                 TALBOT
                   I'm not letting this conviction slide.
                   I can tell you that, right here and
                   right now!

                                 SWARR
                   He says, if you accept, under his
                   specific conditions, he will sign a full
                   confession and plead guilty... right
                   here, and right now.

     Talbot looks at Swarr with hatred.

                                 MILLS
                   I'll do it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Hold on... just a minute.

     Somerset turns to Talbot.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   If he were to plead insanity... this
                   conversation is admissible.  The fact
                   that he's blackmailing us with his
                   plea...

                                 SWARR
                   And, my client reminds you, two more
                   people are dead.  The press would have a
                   field day if they found out the police
                   didn't seem too concerned about finding
                   them... giving them proper burial.

                                 MILLS
                   I'll do it.  I want to finish it.

     Somerset is thinking it through.  He looks at Mills.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (to captain)
                   Well... let's get the fucking lawyer out
                   of the room, and we can talk about how
                   this whole thing's going to go down.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, BATHROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Mills' hand reaches to the sink to pick up a razor.  He's
     shirtless, his chest covered in shaving cream.  He starts
     shaving in front of a mirror.  Somerset is behind him, smoking.

                                 SOMERSET
                   If John Doe's head splits open, and a
                   U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have
                   expected it.

                                 MILLS
                   I will.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No emotion.  Stay as cold as ice.

                                 MILLS
                   I will.

     Somerset flicks ash in the sink.  Mills finishes shaving.  He
     steps away from the sink and wipes his chest off with a towel.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                           (very serious)
                   Listen, Somerset... we've been through a
                   lot together.  And, I uh...

                                 SOMERSET
                   What is it?

                                 MILLS
                   I would like to make sweet love to you.

     Somerset walks away.  Mills laughs.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Please...

     As they leave.

                                 MILLS
                   Give me a kiss on the lips.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Give me a break.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, READY ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Mills has his shirt off.  A female technician, Josie, tapes a
     radio transmitter and microphone to his chest.

     Somerset sits nearby at one of the ready room desks.  He wears a
     bullet-proof vest, is just finishing a check of his gun.  He's
     putting the bullets back into it.

     Josie finishes prepping Mills.  Mills presses the adhesive,
     making sure it will hold.  He puts on a shirt and bullet-proof
     vest, fastens the velcro.

     Somerset stands, puts the gun in his hip holster.

     Mills picks up his own gun, checks it, holsters it.  He watches
     Somerset take out a roll of antacids.  Somerset pops a few.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Ready?

                                 MILLS
                   Extremely.

     They look at each other.  Mills holds out his hand.  They shake
     on it.


     INT.  CITY STREET, IN FRONT OF PRECINCT HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON

     The street is full of shadows as the sun is falling low.  On the
     steps of the precinct house, a throng of reporters shifts
     anxiously.  A line of policemen holds them back.  The precinct
     doors open.  Martin Talbot arrives, escorted by cops.  The
     press swarm lurches forward, flashbulbs explode.

     Talbot holds out his hands, quieting them, about to speak.

     EXT.  CITY STREET, AT BACK OF PRECINCT HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Mills' car pulls out of the fenced parking lot.  John Doe is
     seated in the rear.

     The car speeds up on the street, turns onto an avenue, heading
     into a canyon formed by tall buildings.  At the corner, a car is
     parked.

     Somerset is at the wheel.  He pulls out, follows Mills' car.

     EXT.  SKYSCRAPER ROOFTOP -- LATE AFTERNOON

     California is dressed in full battle gear.  He looks through
     binoculars at the city below.  The wind blows hard.

     He turns and runs to a sleek helicopter on the roof's heli-pad,
     climbs in the side door.  The PILOT leans back from the cockpit
     to hand him a helmet.  California dons it, starts strapping
     himself in so he can lean out the open door.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Is this wind going to hurt us?

     The pilot cranks the helicopter's whining engine and the blades
     start to spin, churning the air.

                                 PILOT
                   Just makes the ride a little more fun.

     California hefts a high-powered automatic rifle as the chopper
     lifts from the pad and takes off.

     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Mills drives, looking to the back seat through the rearview
     mirror.  A steel mesh partition separates front from back.

     John Doe sits with his hands cuffed.  He is dressed in gray
     pants and a gray shirt.  His feet are cuffed to a metal fastener
     on the floor of the car.  Rivulets of sweat pour down his face.
     He seems wired.

                                 MILLS
                   What's your story, Johnny?  Who are you,
                   really?

     Doe pushes his glasses back up the bridge of his nose, looks at
     Mills' eyes in the rearview mirror.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am
                   means absolutely nothing.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Somerset adjusts the volume on a radio receiver mounted on the
     dash.  He watches the road ahead, tailing Mills.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   What's your deal?  You seem pretty
                   fucking nervous.

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   I want this to go well.  It's very
                   important to me, obviously.

     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- LATE AFTERNOON

     The chopper hovers amongst skyscrapers.  California and the
     pilot are listening, through their helmet headsets.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   You want this to go well?  What is this?

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   Turn right on this street.  Stay in the
                   left lane.

     California leans out the chopper door, using his binoculars.

     EXT.  CITY STREET -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Mills' car weaves through traffic.

     Somerset's car isn't far behind, goes through a red light,
     barely missing a truck.  Other cars blow their horns.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

     A cellular phone on the passenger side is BEEPING.  Somerset
     pushes a button on the phone's panel.  He puts on a
     headset/telephone, speaks into the mouthpiece.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm here.

                                 CALIFORNIA (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   Downtown and moving west.  Looks like
                   you're going to be crossing water.

                                 SOMERSET
                   If we're on the bridge, you keep your
                   distance.  You hear me?

     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- LATE AFTERNOON

     The helicopter hovers steady.  California stows his binoculars.

                                 SOMERSET (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   Cross the river before us if necessary.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   You got it.

     California taps the pilot's helmet.

     EXT.  CITY SKY -- LATE AFTERNOON

     The helicopter dips, flying like a bullet over the city skyline,
     heading towards the river and the setting sun.

     EXT.  CITY STREETS -- LATE AFTERNOON

     FROM HIGH ABOVE, we see traffic on the highway at the polluted
     river's edge.  Cards and trucks move like blood through veins.

     DOWN CLOSER, we can see Mills' car in the flow.  The car turns
     into a lane of traffic on its way to the huge suspension bridge.

     Somerset's car is in close pursuit.

     UNDER THE BRIDGE, the police helicopter travels close to the
     water, moving parallel to the bridge, but low, so that it's out
     of the sightline of the vehicles above.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Traffic is bumper to bumper.  Somerset moves his headset
     mouthpiece to smoke a cigarette.  He steers onto the bridge,
     under the massive girders.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   For us to go pick up two more dead
                   bodies, and have that be the end of
                   it... just seems too boring for you.

     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Beyond the crest of the bridge, the sunset is crimson.

                                 MILLS
                   Wouldn't be sensational enough.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Wanting people to pay attention, you
                   can't just tap them on the shoulder.

     John Doe strains to turn, looks out the back window.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   Sometimes you have to hit them in the
                   head with a sledgehammer... and then you
                   get their strict attention.

                                 MILLS
                   What are you looking at, Johnny?

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Looking back... at the city proper...

     Doe situates forward, holds his hands in front of his face,
     looking at his bandaged fingers.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   And yet, no pillar of salt.
                           (smiles to himself)
                   Lost on you, isn't it?  You've never
                   read the Bible, have you, David?

                                 MILLS
                   I remember a lot of people reading it at
                   me when I was a kid.  I preferred the
                   classic comic version myself.

     This is an affront to Doe, angers him.  Mills sees it, likes it.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   I used to have "Godspell" on an eight-
                   track tape.  Does that count?

     Doe leans forwards, fury building in him.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   You make me sick.

                                 MILLS
                   Sit back, freak.

     Mills slams his fist against the partition.  Doe sits back.

                                 JOHN DOE
                           (under his breath)
                   Ignorant heathen.

                                 MILLS
                   Right, right.  I forgot.  You think
                   these murders were for God.  Right?
                           (pause)
                   I'm asking you seriously.  You really
                   think what you did was God's good work?

     Doe looks out the window at other cars, refuses to answer.

     He's pressing the tips of his forefingers into his thumbs,
     causing blood to drip from under the bandages.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   The Lord works in mysterious ways.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS, INDUSTRIAL AREA -- NIGHT

     It's getting dark.  We've been in this section of factories
     before, with John Doe.  The police helicopter soars overhead.

     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- NIGHT

     California's looking down, wearing night-vision goggles.

     INSERT -- CALIFORNIA'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH GOGGLES

     The goggles allow California to see clearly into the maze formed
     by buildings, yards and worksheds below.  No one in sight.

                                 CALIFORNIA (O.S.)
                   Fuck, man... there's about a thousand
                   places to be ambushed out here.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     The headlights are off.  Mills' car's red brake lights are far
     ahead on this industrial road.

                                 CALIFORNIA (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   I don't see anything... not yet.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (in mouthpiece)
                   A quick sweep is all we get.  Clear out
                   now.  You're right in front of us.

     Somerset reaches to turn up the volume on his radio receiver.
     Mills is HEARD SINGING "Jesus Christ Superstar," loud.  Somerset
     allows a very faint smile.

     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- NIGHT

     Mills drives along, singing.

                                 MILLS
                   Jesus Christ, Superstar... who in the
                   world do you think you are?  Jesus
                   Christ, Superstar...

     Doe's in the back seat, trying to bear it, steaming.

     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL SKIES -- NIGHT

     The chopper goes high, away, over the industrial area.

     It moves to the other side of the factories and settles in low
     over the river.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Mills' tune comes to a conclusion.  Somerset slows the car as he
     sees Mills' brake lights go on ahead.

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   We can walk from here.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (in mouthpiece)
                   You stay out of this unless I call you
                   in, California.  Understand?

                                 CALIFORNIA (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   You're in charge.

     Somerset takes off the headset/phone, stops the car.

     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL ROAD, AT SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset gets out.  He looks through binoculars.

     INSERT -- SOMERSET'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH BINOCULARS

     Mills' car has stopped under the lights of a junk-yard.  Mills
     gets out.  He walks to unlock the passenger door.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   Alright, Somerset.  Going for a stroll.

     AT MILLS' CAR

     Mills opens the passenger door.  Doe looks out.

                                 MILLS
                   Lean on your side.  Hands behind your
                   head and lock your fingers together.

     Doe obliges.  Mills moves to unchain Doe's feet, cautious.

     INSERT -- SOMERSET'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH BINOCULARS

     Mills lets Doe out.  Doe does a deep knee bend to loosen his
     legs.  Mills takes out his gun.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   Where are we going?

     Doe points with handcuffed hands, at a path through the junk-
     yard, towards warehouses.  Mills motions with his gun.

                                 MILLS (V.O.,CONT)
                           (from receiver)
                   Lead the way.

     Doe starts walking.  Mills follows, keeping the gun on Doe.  We
     lose sight of them behind the junk-yard's massive pieces.

     AT SOMERSET'S CAR

     Somerset lowers his binoculars.  He gets back in the car, leaves
     the lights off, drives slowly towards Mills' car.

     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL AREA, JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT

     Mills follows Doe past rusting collections of machines.  We took
     this walk with Doe before, through this metallic bone-yard.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   It's right this way.

     Mills is on edge.  His eyes search the towering, twisted junk.
     Sharp edges reach for the sky.  Glass breaks under their feet.

                                 MILLS
                   So far, so good.

     SOUNDS of BOATS on the river can be HEARD.  Doe's heading for
     the alleyway created by two warehouses beyond the junk-yard.

     Doe nears the alleyway.  It is pitch dark.  Doe stops before
     entering, turns to Mills.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   In here.

     Mills steps up, keeping his distance from Doe.  He can't see a
     thing in the blackness ahead.

                                 MILLS
                   You go first.

     Doe faces the alley.  He starts walking.  We MOVE with him as he
     goes.  He's counting silently to himself, moving his lips.

     Mills walks behind Doe, keeping a sharp eye out in all
     directions.  He's about ten feet behind Doe, keeping his gun
     trained on the back of Doe's skull.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Tell me where we're going.

     Doe continues walking, counting his steps, a bit quicker.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset has pulled along Mills' car, at the junk-yard.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   Slow down, Johnny.  Stop right there.
                           (pause)
                   I said stop!

     EXT.  WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

     Doe walks on.  Mills is behind, walking to close the gap.  We
     can HEAR the faint SOUND of RUSHING WATER.

                                 MILLS
                   I'll blow your head off right now!

     Doe stops abruptly.  He spins on his heels, facing Mills.

     Mills is getting closer, pumped, ready to pull the trigger.

     Doe reaches up with his hands, takes off his glasses.  He holds
     them in one hand.  The SOUND of the WATER is LOUDER.

     Mills is about six feet from Doe, and knows something's wrong.

     John Doe smiles.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What...

     Doe takes one step backwards and falls, straight down,
     disappears in the blink of an eye.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   No!

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset looks towards the far off alleyway, horrified.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   Motherfucker!  No!

     INT.  WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

     Mills stands facing the open manhole cover Doe disappeared into.

     A torrent of water rushes by underground.  Mills fires a few
     futile shots into the water, out of his mind with rage.  He
     pulls back the top of his bullet-proof vest, exposing the
     microphone.

                                 MILLS
                   He's gone, Somerset!  He's in the water!

     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL ROAD, SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset leaps out, takes out his gun.  FOLLOW as he runs into
     the junk-yard as fast as he can.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   I'm going in!

     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- NIGHT

     The chopper's over the river.  California listens intently.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   I have to go in after him!

     STATIC CRACKLES LOUD in his headset, then it GOES DEAD.
     California grips his mouthpiece.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Somerset, what's going on down there?!

     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWAY -- NIGHT

     An underground pipe-way.  Mills tries to swim, is mostly carried
     in the flow.  He's battered against the sides of the pipe,
     holding his breath desperately.

     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT

     FOLLOW Somerset as he charges onwards through the junk-yard,
     stumbling over pieces of metal.  He runs towards the alleyway.

     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS -- NIGHT

     WATER ROARS.  A square pool of water churns.  A moment, then
     Mills rises, gasping, choking.  He's disoriented, furious,
     waving his gun, expecting Doe to be right on top of him.

     No one around.  Mills looks.  This is some sort of unmanned
     water switching station.  the walls are covered in catwalks,
     drainage pipes and tunnels.  Some tunnels and pipes spew water
     down into the central pool, others are sealed shut.

     Mills pulls himself from the central pool to a concrete
     spillway.  He stands up, searching.  Doe could be anywhere.

                                 MILLS
                   Come on, Johnny!  I'm right here!

     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS TUNNEL -- NIGHT

     There is a plastic bag with an automatic pistol and extra clip
     inside hanging from a protruding shut-off valve.  John Doe's
     hands tear the bag open, taking the contents.

     EXT.  WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

     Somerset enters the alley, short of breath.  He points his gun
     in front of him, fearful.  Moving slowly.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Mills!

     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- NIGHT

     California is enraged, looks towards the pilot.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   God damn it!  Let's do something!

                                 PILOT
                   Somerset said wait!

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Fuck that!  Let's go!

                                 PILOT
                   Where?

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   I don't know!  Just go!

     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS -- NIGHT

     Mills climbs onto a catwalk.  He passes tunnels, looking down
     each, intense, ready to kill.  A waterfall flows and over the
     other end of the catwalk.

     Mills stands, looking over the railing at the central pool and
     other tunnels.  He points his gun and fires into a far tunnel.

                                 MILLS
                   Come on!  Let's do it!  You and me!

     A figure appears in the center of the waterfall behind Mills.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   I'm not going to let you win this!

     John Doe steps out of the waterfall, putting on his glasses.

     He seems calm, unloads his gun into Mills' back... BLAM, BLAM...

     Mills twists, blown forward by the bullets slamming into his
     bullet-proof vest.  BLAM, BLAM, BLAM... he stumbles, trying to
     turn and fire back, but bullets strike him down and he falls to
     the floor of the catwalk, gun falling from his hand.

     CLICK.  Doe's gun is empty.  The gunshots echo.  Mills lays
     there on his stomach, pounded, blacking out, the hot bullets in
     his vest smoking and sizzling from the water splashing them.

     Doe moves quickly, starts searching Mills' pockets.

     EXT.  WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

     Somerset comes upon the open manhole.  Water rushes by.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Christ.

     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS -- NIGHT

     The central pool bubbles, undulating.  Somerset surfaces,
     inhaling, bringing his gun up.  He looks.  No one in sight.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Mills!  Pull out!

     His voice reverberates, barely heard against the roaring water.
     he swims to the edge, climbs out.  He walks, looking...

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                           (pleading)
                   Pull out now!

     Somerset looks up, and freezes up on seeing --

     -- Doe's handcuffs hang, swinging, on the rail of the catwalk
     above, with Mills' radio transmitter and wire tied to them.


     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT

     Somerset runs to his car, driven, gasping for breath, still
     soaking wet.  He stops for one second, looks.

     Not too far away, the police helicopter flies low to the ground,
     turning in wide circles.

     Somerset climbs into the car, starts it up.  He drives away,
     leaving his lights off.  The engine protests loudly, forced to
     its limit.  The car disappears in darkness.

     The police helicopter circles, useless.


     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- NIGHT

     The church stands elegant at night, when its decayed state is
     partially hidden.  Small shafts of light escape from holes in
     the facade and just into the blackness.

     Somerset is out of his car.  He strides towards the church,
     checks his gun as he goes.  FOLLOW with him, getting closer to
     the church.  He climbs the stairs.

     Somerset steps up and kicks the church doors open, met by a
     tremendous blast of light --

     INT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Flickering orange light from hundreds of once tall orange
     candles, now burnt low.  They greet Somerset, in the church's
     old candle racks, on the floor, on the altar and all through out
     the pews.

     Somerset's eyes try to adjust to the light.  He holds his gun
     ready, walks down the long center aisle.

                                 JOHN DOE (O.S.)
                   Hello, Somerset.

     Doe sounds far, his voice echoing from the front of the church.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where's David?

                                 JOHN DOE (O.S.)
                   He's here.  With me.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Tell me what you want.

     Somerset can see through the heat warp.  Doe stands facing him
     from the altar.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   What do I want?  The same you... I want
                   an ending.  Stay where you are.  Put
                   your gun on the floor and slide it all
                   the way down here.

     Somerset obeys, bends, slides the gun down the aisle till it
     hits the bottom altar stair.  He keeps walking, slowly.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I want to see him.  Show me Mills.

     On the altar, Doe is sweating hard, standing over Mills.  Mills
     is slumped forward on the floor, unconscious.  His bullet-proof
     vest has been removed.

     Mills' hands are tied tight together in front of him, tied to
     one end of the thick rope suspended from the ceiling.  Doe holds
     the other end of the rope, has his gun tucked under his belt.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   You're an intelligent man, Somerset.
                   You understand what you're a part of,
                   don't you?  When this is finished, it
                   will seem surreal, but it will be a
                   whole, crystalline reality.  And, no one
                   will be able to deny it, no matter how
                   hard they try.

     Doe's voice is thick with passion.  Somerset is about halfway
     down the aisle, still moving.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You're a murderer.  That's all.  The
                   only way you've distinguished yourself
                   is by your particular brutality.

     Doe walks across the altar.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   You know that's not true.  You know.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You're killing innocent people, and I
                   should admire you?  You're doing it
                   because it gives you pleasure.  That's
                   the only purpose... your sick pleasure.

     Doe picks up a container of gasoline, looks out at Somerset.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Stay where you are!

     Somerset stops.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   I won't deny my personal desires.  I
                   won't.

     Doe begins dousing Mills with gasoline, covering Mills' body and
     clothing.  Mills stirs, coming to.  He coughs, choking on the
     gas and fumes.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   But, I don't mourn the victims in this
                   any more than I mourn the thousands who
                   died in Sodom and Gomorrah.

     Somerset looks fearful.  He starts approaching again.

                                 SOMERSET
                   All you've done is cause more misery and
                   pain!  You've given people all the more
                   reason to believe there is no God!

     Somerset eyes his gun at the bottom of the stairs.

     Doe sees Somerset moving, throws the gas can away, takes out his
     gun.  Doe walks to the edge of the altar, all the time holding
     his end of the rope.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Stop!

     Somerset is twitching with anger, looking at the gun about
     fifteen feet in front of him.

     Mills manages to look up, weak, his eyes barely able to open
     because of the stinging gasoline.

                                 MILLS
                   Somerset?

     Doe takes one step down off the altar.  Somerset is still edging
     forward, hands out away from his body.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Do you really think I'm just going to
                   let this happen?!  You think I'm going
                   to let him die?

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Yes.

     Doe fires his gun and the bullet slams into the front of
     Somerset's bullet-proof vest.  Somerset flies back, knocking
     over a rack of candles on his way to the floor.

     Doe walks quickly back onto the altar.

                                 MILLS
                   Motherfucker!

     Mills tries to grab at Doe as he passes, but Doe turns and kicks
     Mills in the ribs.  Mills cringes in pain.

     Somerset lays in the aisle, on his stomach, gasping.  He can't
     catch his breath, his twisted face pressed against the floor.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   How can you speak of God, Somerset?
                   When was the last time you spoke His
                   name?

     Mills tries to rub the gas out of his eyes with his bound hands.

     His mind works feverishly.  He looks around to see where he is,
     then he searches the floor.  We can see, inside his open shirt,
     the bleeding, upside-down cross Doe has cut into his chest.

     Doe walks back to shout angrily down at Somerset.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   When did you last speak His name?  Was
                   it in prayer?  Or, did you say the
                   Lord's name after you stubbed your big
                   toe?  Or, did you use His name to curse
                   another man?

     Somerset holds his chest, blinking, trying not to black out.

     Mills finds a piece of broken stained glass on the floor.  He
     picks it up, palms it, still choking on gasoline.

     Doe walks over to the statue of Saint Jerome Emiliani, pulling
     the rope from above so it goes taut and Mills' arms raise above
     his head.  Doe wraps the rope around Emiliani's arm.

                                 MILLS
                   I'm going to kill you, Johnny.  I'm
                   going to see you dead.

     Doe begins twisting the loose end of the rope around the statue.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   The irony, David, is that you policemen
                   and I want the same things.  But, you
                   are so short sighted.  In this city,
                   where you can see a deadly sin on every
                   street corner... and in every home, we
                   want repentance.

     Mills clutches the glass piece and starts cutting the rope just
     above his hands.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   We want good over evil.  We want values
                   instilled in the children.  We want a
                   world where a man or woman can lead a
                   decent life.
                           (pause)
                   Wisdom, understanding, counsel,
                   fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of
                   the Lord.  Such simple concepts.  Why
                   are they non-existent?

     Somerset manages to life his head, struggles to his knees.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (weakly)
                   Let him go, God damn you.

     Doe checks to make sure the rope around Saint Emiliani is secure,
     tightening the knots.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   There were two men once, who had
                   wonderful gardens.  Two gardens of
                   flowers that went on as far as the eye
                   could see.  Beautiful gardens... the
                   fragrance was inspiration in itself.

     Doe stands behind Emiliani, heaves against the statue.

     Mills watches, gritting his teeth, rubbing the glass against the
     rope, fingers bleeding.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   But, both gardens were beset by
                   problems.  Weeds started to take root,
                   and there were infestations of insects
                   and diseases.  The gardens started to
                   turn putrid.  And, one man fought to
                   save his garden, because he could never
                   forget how it once was.  Everyday he cut
                   the weeds, and killed the insects.
                   Fought the diseases.

     Doe finally topples the statue, down the altar stairs, and the
     other end of the rope pulls Mills upwards, screaming in pain.
     Mills is held, about eight feet in the air, legs dangling.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   That man never had a beautiful garden
                   again.

                                 MILLS
                   Fuck you!

                                 JOHN DOE
                   The other man plowed his garden under.
                           (pause)
                   He plowed it under the soil.  He started
                   over.

     Somerset gets to his feet, steadying himself on a pew.

     Doe walks across the altar, picks up a long metal pole with a
     thick wick and candle snuffer on the end.  He lights the wick
     from a near candle.  The flame burns long and thin.  He looks
     down at Somerset, takes out his gun.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   Stay there, Somerset.  Or, I'll kill him
                   right now.

     Doe holds the flaming pole up, near Mills.

     Somerset stops.  He looks up at Mills.

     Mills is straining.  He nods to Somerset, and Somerset sees
     Mills cutting at the rope.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Alright... you don't have to do this,
                   John.  You've already made your point.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Do you think I chose this?  Can you even
                   begin to understand how painful my
                   existence has been?  It's like... like
                   having every sense heightened beyond
                   comprehension.

     Doe lowers the flame, standing below and beside Mills, with his
     attention focused on Somerset.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   So that the stench of the street coats
                   your throat like bile.  So, sugar is so
                   sweet it... it makes your bones ache to
                   the marrow.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You're insane.  That's why.

                                 JOHN DOE
                           (seething)
                   No!  You're wrong!

     Mills continues cutting, bleeding, almost through the rope.  He
     begins to swing his feet slightly, his body swaying.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   I was chosen.  And I've wished a
                   thousand times I could have been a
                   normal man.  Like David Mills, a common
                   man... with a common life.  But, wishing
                   that is my sin.  I can't have it and I
                   shouldn't.

     Doe steps towards Mills.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Don't do this!

                                 JOHN DOE
                   I meant what I said.  I admire David
                   Mills.  I envy David Mills.
                           (pause)
                   Envy is my sin.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No!

     Just as Doe is to put the flame to Mills, the rope is finally
     cut through.  Mills drops, swinging his legs forward, smashing
     Doe in the face, knocking Doe's glasses off.

     Mills hits the floor with a thud.

     Somerset runs forward.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   David, get out!

     Doe has fallen back, dropping the metal pole.  Mills scrambles
     to his feet and charges at Doe, shouting.

     Doe squints, screaming, raises his gun.  Fires twice!

     The bullets catch Mills in mid-run, and carry him off his feet,
     backwards.

     Somerset grips his own gun, just as Mills' body falls, tumbles
     off the altar area and down the stairs in front of him.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   No!

     Somerset lets out a scream of pain and rage that chokes in his
     throat.  He falls to his knees and halts Mills' body.

     Somerset's shaking, unable to breathe, turning Mills over and
     cradling his head in his arms.  Tears come to his eyes.

                                SOMERSET (CONT)
                   David... David?  Please...

     On the altar, Doe throws his gun away.  he starts feeling around
     him, unsteady, looking for his glasses.

     Mills' eyes are closed.  He is still, bloody.  He swallows.

     With one gasp, without a word, he is dead.

     Somerset looks up at Doe, vision blurred by rage and tears.

     Doe stands, putting on his glasses, faces Somerset.

     Somerset lays Mills' body down.  Stands, walks up towards the
     altar, raises his gun.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   You.

     Doe stands, quaking, teeth clenched, fists balled up.  He waits
     for the bullets, falls to his knees.

     The gun trembles in Somerset's hand as Somerset brings the
     barrel to Doe's face.  A millisecond's pause.  Somerset changes
     the angle of fire.  BLAM, he blows John Doe's arm to pieces in a
     splattering explosion.

     Doe screams, falling back, on the altar floor.

     VIEWED FROM FAR BACK IN THE CHURCH

     The entire church with its candles frames the torture:

     Somerset walks to where Doe flops horribly, bleeding.  Somerset
     aims, shoots Doe in the leg.  Doe screams, rolling, trying to
     crawl away, knocking over candle racks.  Somerset follows.  He
     shoots Doe's other leg.  He shoots Doe in the other arm.  Flames
     begin to rise and spread quickly amongst the pews.  Doe
     continues to spasm, wrenching, hand slapping the bloody floor.
     BLAM, BLAM, BLAM.  Somerset steps back from Doe, overturns a
     rack of candles on top of him.  He steps away.  Watching.
     Flames begin rising on Doe's clothing.

     CLOSE ON JOHN DOE'S FACE

     Doe's face, covered in blood, twisted in agony, helpless, flames
     rising.  He continues screaming.

     His glasses crack from the heat.


     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- NIGHT

     Smoke billows from the windows.  The fire is moving quickly,
     ravenous.  It's just starting to light up the night.

     From the front door, Somerset walks weeping, carrying Mills'
     body in his arms.

     INT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- NIGHT

     The seven deadly sin tableau burns.

     Flames cause the paint to bubble and blacken.  Gluttony, greed
     and sloth are already halfway gone.

     Flames eat at pride, lust.

     Wrath and envy are being consumed.  Wrath goes last.  A man with
     bloodied hands, in tones of blue.  Flames devour it.


     EXT.  CEMETERY -- DAY

     A field of blue.  Cops in orderly rows.  The funeral of David
     Mills.  Many police officials and politicians stand in tribute.

     Somerset is here, in his dress blue uniform.  He stares forward,
     still numb, beaten.  Rifles are raised by a corps of riflemen.
     Blanks explode from the barrels.  They reload in unison.

     Somerset looks towards the grace where Mills' casket lies under
     an American flag.  Tracy is there.

     Tracy stands surrounded by strangers at the grave-site.  Her
     head is lowered.  She cries.  Each blast of the rifle salute
     causes her to react with a start.

     EXT.  CEMETERY -- LATER DAY

     The funeral is over.  Somerset stands at the edge of the
     graveyard, looking at the distant city.  Behind him, the
     mourners are still filing out to their cars.

     The captain approaches.  He comes to stand beside Somerset,
     similarly solemn.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   I don't know if I should do this.
                           (pause)
                   We found the motel room Doe must have
                   been staying in after you found his
                   apartment.

     Somerset hasn't acknowledged the captain, still looking away.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT)
                   Anyway... we found this in his
                   belongings.

     The captain takes out a sealed envelope.  Somerset takes it.

     On the envelope: DETECTIVE SOMERSET, handwritten, in red marker.


     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY

     Tracy and Somerset stand near a moving truck in front of the
     apartment building.  MOVERS carry Tracy's belongings to the
     truck.  Mills' car is attached to be towed behind.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I wish I could say something...
                           (pause)
                   Something to... I don't know...

                                 TRACY
                   I'll be okay.

     Somerset nods.

                                 SOMERSET
                   We'll keep in touch.  I'll come visit.

                                 TRACY
                   I'll write to you when we get there.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Take care of yourself.
                           (pause)
                   Take care of the baby.

     Tracy nods.  There's nothing left for them to say.  They're both
     empty.  It's time for them to give a gesture, a kiss, or a hug,
     to say goodbye, but neither makes the first move.

                                 MOVER
                   That's all, Mrs. Mills.  We got
                   everything.

     Movers latch up the back of the truck while the driver climbs
     in and fires up the engine.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Goodbye, Tracy.

                                 TRACY
                   Goodbye, Somerset.

     Somerset walks away.  Tracy walks away, gets in the passenger
     side of the moving truck.


     EXT.  CITY STREET -- LATER DAY

     Sidewalks jammed with people, hurrying.  Somerset walks in a
     fog, hands in his pockets.  He stops at a corner, but does not
     cross.  He stands there, looks up.

     At the city around him.  The buildings towering over him.

     At the cars, buses and taxies racing in the streets, blowing
     their horns and spouting soot.

     Somerset reaches into his jacket pocket, takes out the envelope
     from John Doe.  He studies it in his hand.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (to himself)
                   Oh... man...

     He opens it.  He takes out a small note, handwritten.  It reads:

                                          PLOW THEM UNDER.

     Somerset looks up again, mortified, fighting to keep control of
     his emotions.  He looks around:

     At the miserable people, walking past him.

     At a man at the top of the subway station stairs, sitting in a
     cardboard box, holding out a cup, rattling the change inside.

     A father passes by, holding his young son's hand.  Somerset
     turns to watch them as they pass.  The gather reaches to pick
     the boy up and carry him.  The boy holds tight.

     For some reason, this makes Somerset ache with sorrow.

     The father hugs his son to him, kisses him on the cheek.  The
     boy returns the kiss, with great affection.

     Somerset watches them disappear in the mass of humanity.  He
     looks back at the note in his hand.

     He tears the note up, into little pieces.


     INT.  MOVING TRUCK -- DAY

     The truck moves along in steady traffic.  Tracy sits beside the
     driver.  She looks out at the city across the river.

     She reaches into her pocket, takes out a small manila envelope.
     She opens the envelope and slides two keys on a keychain out
     into her palm.

     She's looking at the keys when she notices something about the
     envelope.  She reopens it, takes out a small folded piece of
     paper.  She unfolds it:

     It is the piece of wallpaper with the pale rose at its center.

     She smiles very faintly.


     EXT.  PRECINCT HOUSE -- EARLY EVENING

     Cars roll by in the street.  Cops come and go.

     Somerset walks up the stairs into the precinct house.

                                              January 27,1992











                                      The world is a fine place,
                                      and worth fighting for.

                                              1940







     EXT.  COUNTRY CHURCH -- DAY

     The white cross on the church steeple stands against blue sky.
     The church bell rings, resonating.

     Mass has let out.  Small church, small congregation.  The dirt
     road in front is lined with pick-up trucks and parishioners on
     foot heading to outlying farms and homes.  An old two-story
     house sits across the road.  Lone.

     INT.  OLD HOUSE -- DAY

     Sunlight comes through the soot on the windows, more brown than
     bright.  SOMERSET, 45, in a suit and tie, stands in this empty
     second-story room.  He looks around, at the ceiling, at the worn
     wooden floor, at the peeling wallpaper on the walls.

     Somerset walks to one wall where the current wallpaper is peeled
     away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath.  He runs his finger
     across one of the pale red roses that decorates the older paper.
     He pushes the grime away, brings the rose out more clearly.

     He pulls at the edge of the paper, carefully ripping off a
     roughly squared section with the rose at its center.

     He studies it in his hand.

     EXT.  OLD HOUSE -- DAY

     Birds sing.  Somerset stands, pondering the forested landscape.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                   Is something wrong?

     Somerset does not respond. The MAN, in an ill-fitting real
     estate jacket, is seated on the hood of a dirty Ford
     Thunderbird.  He holds a check and a booklet of receipts.

                                 MAN (CONT)
                   Is something the matter?

                                 SOMERSET
                   No... no.  There's nothing wrong.

     Somerset still seems distant.

                                 MAN
                           (writes receipt)
                   Not that it's any of my business... but,
                   are you figuring on moving out here
                   eventually?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Soon.

                                 MAN
                   I just never seen a man mortgaging an
                   empty house before.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Everything here still seems... seems so
                   strange to me.  All this.

                                 MAN
                   I don't know.  I'd say this place is
                   about as normal as places get.

     The man walks over to hand over a receipt.  Somerset accepts the
     receipt, folds it.  Somerset smiles.

                                 SOMERSET
                   That is exactly what I mean.  Strange.

     Somerset looks back at the house.  The man does not understand.


     INT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- DAY -- (CREDIT SEQUENCE BEGINS)

     Somerset is in a window seat, smoking a cigarette, looking out
     the speeding train.  He is near the back of the car, away from
     the few other passengers.

     Outside, farms, small homes and lawns pass.  The entire panorama
     is dappled by the rays of the soon setting sun.

     The light flickers across Somerset's placid face.

     INT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- LATER DAY

     The train is nearly full.  Somerset has his suitcase on the
     aisle seat beside him.  He has a hardcover book unopened on his
     lap.  He still stares out the window, but his disposition has
     soured.  The train is passing an ugly, swampy field.

     A car's burnt-out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken.  A little
     further on, two dogs are fighting, circling, attacking, their
     coats matted with blood.

     Somerset turns his head to watch the dogs.

     Away in the field, another dog sprints to join the fight.

     INT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- EARLY EVENING

     Passing urban streets below.  Slums.  Smashed cars.  People
     stand on the corners, under the bleak glow of street lamps.

     Somerset's suitcase is by the window.  Somerset is now in the
     aisle seat, reading his book.


     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT -- LATER NIGHT -- (END CREDITS)

     Curtains closed.  The SOUNDS of the CITY are here as they will
     be everywhere in this story.  A CAR ALARM SHRIEKS.  Somerset's
     life is packed in many moving boxes, except for clothing in a
     closet and hundreds of books on shelves.

     Somerset, dressed only in his underwear, lays back on the bed.
     He reaches to the nightstand, to a wooden, pyramidical
     metronome.

     He frees the metronome's weighted swingarm so it moves back and
     forth.  Swings to the left... TICK, swings to the right... TICK.
     Tick, tick, tick, measured and steady.

     Somerset situates on the bed, closes his eyes.  The metronome's
     ticking competes with the sound of the car alarm.  Somerset's
     face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome.

     His eyes close tighter.

     Tick, tick, tick... the swingarm moves evenly.  Somerset's
     breathing deepens.  The car ALARM seems QUIETER.

     Tick, tick, tick.  Somerset continues his concentration.

     The METRONOME is the ONLY SOUND.  Somerset's face relaxes
     slightly as he begins to fall asleep.  Tick, tick, tick...


     EXT.  CHINESE BODEGA/CITY STREETS -- NIGHT

     DAVID MILLS, 31, exits with a bagged 40oz bottle of beer.  He is
     a lean, attractive man, constantly coiled, eyes always
     smoldering.  FOLLOW as he walks quickly past iron-gated
     storefronts.  He crosses the street under elevated subway
     tracks.  A train roars overhead.

     Mills watches it as he walks on.

     Blue sparks spit off the third rail and illuminate Mills,
     throwing his shadow long down the deserted street.

     EXT.  URBAN STREET OF ROW HOMES -- NIGHT

     This rotting neighborhood lives in the shadow of a single fat
     skyscraper.  Mills walks, looks at the broken refrigerators and
     pieces of junk in the gutter.

     Ahead in the street, TWO YOUNG THUGS struggle with a crowbar to
     break into the trunk of a parked car.

     Mills draws near.  One thug looks up, doesn't think Mills will
     be a problem, continues prying.  Mills stops, calm.

                                 MILLS
                   Is that your car, man?

                                 FIRST THUG
                   What the fuck do you care?

     Mills pauses, switches his beer bottle to his other hand.

                                 MILLS
                   Does that car belong to you?

     The thugs look at each other, gauging.  They face Mills.

                                 FIRST THUG
                   Yeah, it's my car, alright?  Fuck off.

                                 MILLS
                   You're telling me that's your car?

     The second thug starts the long way round the car.

                                 SECOND THUG
                   Well, for some strange reason, I don't
                   believe you.

     Mills gives a "isn't that silly" laugh, shifts his gaze --

     Sees the first thug slide the crowbar so it's held as a weapon.

                                 FIRST THUG
                           (steps forward)
                   You can fucking suck my...

     Mills swiftly finishes that sentence by smashing his bottle
     against the first thug's head.  The thug falls, swings blindly.

     The second thug moves from the side, brings out a knife.

     Mills averts, swings, pounds the side of his fist into the
     second thug's face -- CRACK.  Broken nose.

     The second thug stumbles back, drops the knife, his nose
     squirting blood.

     Mills turns, enraged, breathing hard.

     The first thug is screaming, trying to stand.  Mills takes one
     step, punts the first thug's head.  The crowbar clatters away.

     Mills is in the process of kicking a man when he's down, when
     the second thug grabs him from behind, pulls him backwards.

     Mills clutches at the thug's arm, trying to avoid a choke-hold.
     They both struggle spastically.  The thug's winning.

     Gurgling, gasping for air, Mills shifts his weight, drops to one
     knee and spins the thug, slamming him against the car.

     Mills breaks loose, grabs a handful of the second thug's hair
     and holds the man's head against the car's side window.  Mills'
     free hand pounds the thug's face: once, twice -- third time's
     the charm as the window shatters.  The thug goes out cold.

     Mills backs off, still incensed.  He rubs his throat, looking at
     the two prone men.  Slowly, he regains some composure.

     He takes a keychain from his pocket.  He unlocks the door of the
     car, loads one of the thugs into the back seat.  He walks to
     collect the other thug off the street.


     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- MORNING

     Somerset picks items off a moving box:  keys, wallet, homicide
     badge.  Finally, he opens the hardcover book from the train.

     From the pages, he takes the pale, wallpaper rose.


     INT.  TENEMENT APARTMENT -- DAY

     A wall is stained by a starburst of blood.  Somerset stands,
     melancholy, looking at a body on the floor under a sheet near a
     sawed-off shotgun.  The apartment is gloomy.  DETECTIVE TAYLOR,
     52, looks through a notepad.

                                  TAYLOR
                   Neighbors heard them screaming at each
                   other.  It was nothing new or unusual.
                   But, then they heard the gun go off.
                   Boom, boom... both barrels.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Did his wife confess?  Did she actually
                   speak the words?

                                  TAYLOR
                   When the patrolman got here she was
                   trying to put his head back together.
                   She was crying too hard to say anything.
                           (shuts notebook)
                   Crime of passion.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered
                   up on the wall here.

     Taylor shifts his weight, impatient, annoyed.

                                  TAYLOR
                   This is a done deal.  All but the
                   paperwork.

     Somerset looks at a coloring-book open on the coffee table.
     There are crayons beside it.  Somerset picks the book up.

     He flips through: crudely colored pictures.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Did their son see it happen?

                                  TAYLOR
                   What kind of question is that?  Huh?
                           (pointing)
                   He's dead.  His wife killed him.  There
                   it is.  That's all.  Anything else has
                   nothing to do with nothing.

     Somerset replaces the book, digs up a cigarette from his pocket.

                                  TAYLOR (CONT)
                   You and your fucking questions,
                   Somerset.  I'm glad I'm getting rid of
                   you today.  You know that, you fuck?

     David Mills enters, dressed in a suit.  He looks a bit lost.

                                  MILLS
                   Uh... Lieutenant Somerset?

     Somerset lights his cigarette, looks to Mills.

                                  MILLS (CONT)
                   I'm David Mills... your new partner.


     EXT.  TENEMENT/CITY STREET -- DAY

     A body-bag is carried through the crowd around the tenement
     doors.  Somerset follows.  Mills follows Somerset.  They walk
     towards the end of the filthy block.

                                  MILLS
                   I'm a little thrown.  I just finished
                   orientation at central, and they dumped
                   me off down here.

                                  SOMERSET
                   I heard you brought in two small-timers
                   last night.

                                  MILLS
                   Yeah.  Two real idiots.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Since we are just starting out, I
                   thought we could go to a bar.  Sit and
                   talk for awhile.  That way we can...

                                  MILLS
                   Excuse me, but I'd rather start sniffing
                   for a case, if it's all the same to you.
                   Seeing how we only have a week for this
                   whole transition thing.
                           (waits)
                   I want to get into the shit a.s.a.p.,
                   know what I mean?

     Somerset walks, no reply.  Mills searches to get a read on him.

                                  SOMERSET
                   I meant to ask you something... when we
                   spoke on the phone.  I can't help
                   wondering...
                           (pause)
                   Why are you here?

                                  MILLS
                           (wary)
                   I... I don't follow.

                                  SOMERSET
                   All this effort you've gone through, to
                   be transferred from Philadelphia to
                   here.  It's the first question that pops
                   into my head.

     Mills formulates his response.

                                  MILLS
                   I'm here for the same reasons as you, I
                   guess.  Or... at least the same reasons
                   you used to have for being here...
                           (cutting)
                   ...before you decided to give up.

     Somerset stops and faces Mills.

                                  SOMERSET
                   You think you know me?  You just met me
                   two minutes ago.

                                  MILLS
                   Maybe I don't understand the question.

                                  SOMERSET
                   It's very simple.  You've come from the
                   "City of Brotherly Love" to the "City of
                   Brotherly Hate," detective.  I've never
                   seen it done that way.

                                  MILLS
                   I don't know.  Maybe I thought I could
                   do more good here than there.
                           (pause)
                   You know, it'd be great by me if we
                   didn't start right out kicking each
                   other in the balls.  But, you're calling
                   the shots, lieutenant, so however you
                   want it to go.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Let me tell you how I want this to go.
                   I want you to look, and I want you to
                   listen.

                                  MILLS
                   I wasn't standing around Philly guarding
                   the fucking Liberty Bell.

                                  SOMERSET
                   But, you've never worked homicide in
                   this city.

                                  MILLS
                   I realize that.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Well, please do me the favor of
                   remembering it.

     Mills just stares back at Somerset.  Somerset walks.  Mills
     rolls his eyes, looks to heaven like, "what'd I do to deserve
     this?"  He follows Somerset.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     MONDAY

     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING

     Somerset lies asleep on the bed.  It is still dark outside.
     Relatively quiet.  The PHONE beside the inactive metronome RINGS
     HARSHLY.  Somerset awakens suddenly, rankled.


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING

     It is barely becoming light outside.  Mills can't sleep.

     Alone in a double bed.  He sits up, frustrated.  Sits on the
     edge of the bed and looks around.  The room is a shambles,
     filled with moving boxes.

     The light coming through the window glows upon a football trophy
     on one box.  Large and noble, a golden player stands in frozen
     motion at the trophy's pinnacle.

     Mills looks at the trophy and a fond smile forms on his face.
     The CLINKING of DISHES and SILVERWARE is HEARD from another
     room.  Mills looks at the closed bedroom door, troubled.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- EARLY MORNING

     Across a living room full of boxes, TRACY MILLS, 30, a beautiful
     woman, stands in her bathrobe.  She's upset about something,
     takes dishes out of boxes, puts them on the kitchenette counter.

     She pulls a mug from a clump of newspaper and pours some tea
     from a pot on the stove.  Blowing on the steaming tea, she leans
     back on the counter, looks over at the closed bedroom door.

     The tea is too hot to sip, and as Tracy is placing the mug on
     the counter behind her the PHONE RINGS.  Startled, she releases
     the mug too close to the edge.  It falls --

     Crashes to the floor, shatters.


     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, HALLWAY -- MORNING

     A dark hall.  Somerset and Mills stand with OFFICER DAVIS, 28, a
     beefy, uniformed cop.  Light from a camera's flash spills in
     from the nearby kitchen.  Davis hands Somerset two flashlights.

                                 SOMERSET
                   At what time did you confirm the death?

                                 DAVIS
                   Like I said, we didn't touch anything,
                   but we were on scene at like o-five-
                   hundred, so he's had his face in a plate
                   of spaghetti for about half an hour.

                                 MILLS
                   Wait, wait, wait.  You didn't check him?
                   You didn't check vital signs?

                                 DAVIS
                   Believe me, he's gone.  Unless he's
                   breathing spaghetti sauce now.

                                 MILLS
                   No.  The point is, when you're first man
                   in, you check vital signs.

                                 DAVIS
                   This guy's sitting in a pile of his own
                   shit and piss.  If he ain't dead he
                   would have stood up by now.

                                 MILLS
                           (getting angry)
                   Listen, Godzilla...

     Somerset steps in, heads Mills off.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Thank you, Officer Davis.  We'll see you
                   again after we've had a look.

                                 DAVIS
                   Yes, sir.

     Davis leaves, eyeing Mills.  Mills watches him.  Somerset hands
     Mills a flashlight, takes out surgical gloves.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I wonder what exactly was the point of
                   the conversation you were about to get
                   into?

                                 MILLS
                   And, I wonder how many times Officer
                   Davis there has found a supposedly dead
                   man who didn't really die until Davis
                   was back in the patrol car calling the
                   morgue and eating a powdered donut.

     Somerset snaps one glove over his hand and checks the fit.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Drop it.  We have more important
                   concerns just now, don't we?

                                 MILLS
                   Fine... for now.

     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     The POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER packs up, hoists his camera and
     equipment bag.  Somerset and Mills enter.  Mills puts on his own
     pair of rubber gloves.  The grubby kitchen is small; barely room
     for four people to move around in.  The photographer exits:

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                   Bon appetit.

     The only light is a murky green illumination from the ceiling.

     The light bathes an OBESE MAN who is slumped forward in a
     kitchen chair, face-down-dead in a plate of spaghetti.

     The sizable kitchen table's green tablecloth is covered with
     soiled paper plates.  The plates hold bits of half-eaten
     sandwiches, potatoes, donuts and other junk-food remnants.

     Mills and Somerset turn on their flashlights.  Mills points his
     at the green bulb above.  Aluminum foil has been wrapped around
     the bulb to focus the light on the corpse.

     Somerset sweeps the room with his flashlight.  He goes to the
     body and kneels beside it.  There's a rope tied around the
     man's wide gut.  Mills comes to stand beside Somerset.

                                 MILLS
                   I guess that makes it homicide.

     Somerset crouches lower, uses a pen to lift one of the dead
     man's pants cuffs.  Rope is tied around the purplish ankle.

     Mills examines the knots behind the chair's back.  Shines his
     flashlight on the man's belly.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Still, he could have tied himself in.
                   To make it look like murder.

     Somerset isn't listening, focused on the corpse.  He studies the
     man's head and neck without touching.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   I don't see any blood or bruises yet.
                   No wounds.  You see anything?

                                 SOMERSET
                           (irritated)
                   Not yet.

     Somerset stands, points his flashlight: the obese man's stiff
     hands are clutching utensils.  A knife in the left hand, a fork
     sticking straight up in the right with a hunk of meat hanging
     skewered.  Cockroaches swarm.

     Mills turns to the sink and stove.  Each burner of the stove has
     a used pot or pan on it.  There's food slopped everywhere.

                                 MILLS
                   I saw a guy once... committed suicide,
                   but he wanted to make sure his family
                   could collect insurance money, right?

     Somerset walks to the room's only window.  The window has been
     painted over with black paint.  he touches the window with his
     pinkie finger.  The paint is still wet.

     Mills goes to a trash can by the refrigerator.  The trash can is
     full to the brim with empty food containers.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   So, this guy took this big knife... and
                   he held it behind him, put the tip of it
                   in his back, and he ran backwards into
                   the wall.  Cause, he thought it was
                   going to look like someone stabbed him
                   in the back.

     Mills opens the refrigerator.  It's nearly empty.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Except, he poked a big fucking hole in
                   the dry wall when he did it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   If you could... spare me the anecdotes
                   for now.  Leave the refrigerator open
                   for the light.

                                 MILLS
                           (sarcastic)
                   Oh, forgive me.  I thought we had this
                   male-bonding thing going.  My mistake.

     Somerset looks at the floor, deep in thought.  His flashlight
     beam follows a trail of dripped sauces, soups and bits of food
     running from the stove to the table.

                                 SOMERSET
                   What do you smell?  Other than him, and
                   all the food.

                                 MILLS
                           (sniffs)
                   I don't know... there's something.

     Somerset goes close to the table, then leans to peer under.

                                 SOMERSET
                   A bucket.

     Somerset points the flashlight and Mills crouches, pulls up the
     tablecloth on his side of the table.  Two large dead rats lay on
     the floor beside a metal bucket.

     Mills grimaces, slides under the table, careful to avoid the
     rats.  He looks in the bucket.  He leans back, baffled.

                                 MILLS
                   It's vomit.

     He looks at Somerset under the table.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   It's a bucket of vomit.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Is there any blood in it?

                                 MILLS
                   Can't tell by looking.

     Somerset stands, perplexed, stares at the dead man.  There is a
     knock at the door.  The detectives look to DOCTOR THOMAS
     O'NEILL, 52, the medical examiner.  O'Neill is a frumpy man,
     seems a bit gone, looking at the green bulb.

                                 O'NEILL
                   Mood lighting.  Very sixties.

     He drops his bag on the floor, sorts through the contents.

                                 MILLS
                           (to Somerset)
                   You think he was poisoned?

     Mills goes to the trash can, pokes the garbage with a pencil.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   And, those rats there somehow ate the
                   poison off the floor?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Guessing this early is useless.

                                 O'NEILL
                   You girls have got the forensics guys
                   out there chompin' at the bit.  Don't
                   know if we'll all fit in here though.

     Mills continues searching the garbage.

                                 MILLS
                   There's room.  Light's the problem.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Well, three is certainly a crowd in
                   here.  And, with four, someone's bound
                   to be stepping on evidence.
                           (pause)
                   Detective Mills, go help the officers
                   question the neighbors.

                                 MILLS
                           (not pleased)
                   Thanks, but no thanks.  I'll stay on
                   this.

     Somerset watches O'Neill at the corpse.  O'Neill points a thin
     flashlight with his mouth, his hands free for the examination.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (not looking up)
                   Send one forensic in on your way out.

     Mills is pissed.  He lifts his flashlight to shine it on the
     side of Somerset's face.

     A moment passes.  Somerset looks at Mills, light shining
     directly in Somerset's eyes.  A longer moment.  Mills switches
     the light off.  He leaves.

     O'Neill unceremoniously places both hands on the dead man's
     head, lifts the swollen visage from the spaghetti.

                                 O'NEILL
                   He is dead.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, BASEMENT GYM -- DAY

     THWACK, THWACK... THWACK.  Mills punches the heavy bag with
     hard, quick punches.  Sweat drips off his face.  He's in work-
     out clothing, a bundle of nerves wearing boxing gloves.

     The walls are covered in mirrors.  Other cops watch Mills as
     they pass, checking out the new kid.  Mills keeps punching,
     skillfully.

     He stops when he sees Somerset reflected in one of the mirrors.
     Somerset walks over, carrying a pizza box with paper piled on
     top.  He sits on a near bench, takes out a cigarette.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Pizza and paperwork, Detective Mills.

                                 MILLS
                   We need to chat.

     INT.  BASEMENT GYM, BOXING RING -- DAY

     Mills opens a door and enters with Somerset behind.  They are
     alone.  Chairs face an old, limp-roped boxing ring.  Practice
     pads hang from pegs on a wall.  Mills clasps a pair in his
     gloves, offers them to Somerset.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.

                                 MILLS
                   You just hold them up.  I do all the
                   work.

     Somerset takes the pads reluctantly, puts them on.  He still has
     the un-lit cigarette hanging from his mouth.  Mills climbs into
     the ring.  He holds the ropes open for Somerset, waits.

     Somerset doesn't want to do this, but he climbs up.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   You've seen my files... seen the things
                   I've done?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Yes.  Impressive work.

     Mills motions to Somerset and Somerset holds up the practice
     pads.  Mills starts working them, lightly, warming up.
     THWACK... THWACK...

                                 MILLS
                   So, what's your problem?  I've done my
                   time on door-to-doors, and walking a
                   beat.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I know it.  That doesn't mean...

                                 MILLS
                   I did all that shit a long time ago.

     THWACK... THWACK... Somerset's very stiff, uncomfortable.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I made a decision, because I have to
                   worry about the integrity of the scene.

                                 MILLS
                   That's bullshit.

                                 SOMERSET
                   When I'm on scene, I'm not going to
                   worry whether you think you're getting
                   enough time on the playing field.  I'm
                   there to do the work.

     Mills punches a little more aggressively.  Somerset's backing,
     flinching, keeping the pads high.  THWACK... THWACK... THWACK...

                                 MILLS
                   The badge in my pocket says "detective,"
                   just like yours.  I've been Homicide for
                   four and a half years.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You've worked Homicide for four years,
                   or for five years...
                   Don't count the half-years, unless you
                   want to sound like a rookie.

     Mills unloads a mighty wallop and one practice pad recoils into
     Somerset's face, knocks Somerset on his ass.

                                 MILLS
                   Oops.  My hand slipped.

     Mills walks, climbs out of the ring.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   You fucked me over today, and you know
                   it.  You know it.

     Somerset looks at the broken cigarette in his mouth.  He
     contains his anger.  He seems to realize Mills has a point.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Just don't jerk me off.  That's all I
                   ask.  It's not much.  Don't jerk me off.
                           (pause)
                   Please, do me the favor of remembering
                   that.

     Mills exits.  Somerset spits out the broken cigarette.


     INT.  URBAN SCHOOL, OFFICE -- DAY

     Tracy looks out a window from behind steel bars.

     Below her, young children play in a playground.  They're playing
     hop-scotch, throwing balls, chasing each other.  The swing sets
     are broken.  The handball wall is graffitied.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                   I'm sorry, Mrs. Mills.  We don't have
                   anything right now.

     Tracy looks away from the window to the haggard WOMAN.  The
     school's office is ill-equipped, busy, disorganized.

                                 WOMAN (CONT)
                   We'll try to give you a call if we need
                   substitutes next month.

                                 TRACY
                   Thank you.

     Tracy looks back at the playground: on the other side of a
     chain-link fence, a butcher in a bloody apron walks down the
     ramp of a freezer truck.  he carries a big, whole, slaughtered
     pig on his shoulder.

     The pig's head flops as the butcher walks.  Some children stop
     their games and run to watch the man and the pig corpse pass.


     INT.  UNDERGROUND SUBWAY TRAIN -- DAY

     The train clatters through a tunnel, packed full, WHEELS
     SCREECHING.  The lights go on and off.  Passengers read
     tabloids, stare at their feet, study advertisements on the
     walls; anything to avoid making eye-contact with others.

     All races, creeds and colors; all ugly, forlorn human beings.
     Tracy stands fatigued, holding a handrail.

     A bag-lady, crusted with dirt, reeking, pushes her way through
     the crowd.  A man presses against Tracy in an attempt to let the
     bag-lady pass.  Tracy switches hands on the rail, turns sideways
     to make room.  She looks down.

     On one seat, a man, quite normal looking, sits holding a porno
     magazine, THREE-WAY FUCK, in one hand.  His other hand is in his
     pocket.  He's obviously masturbating himself in his pants.  No
     one else notices or seems to care.

     Tracy looks away, disgusted.  She closes her eyes.  The train's
     wheels SCREECH LOUDER as the train takes a curve.


     INT.  INDOOR FRUIT STAND -- NIGHT

     The front and one side of the shop are entirely open to the busy
     sidewalk and street.  A transparent plastic canopy frames the
     entrance.  A STRANGE MAN, 20, stands at the edge of the canopy.
     He wears a stained sweatsuit outfit and hums a song, oblivious.

     Tracy and Mills look together over the piles of fruits and
     vegetables piled on wooden stands which form tight aisles.

                                 MILLS
                   It was okay.  I mean... it was certainly
                   better than yesterday.  I think Somerset
                   and I came to a small understanding...

     Mills holds his thumb and forefinger about a quarter of an inch
     apart to illustrate.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   ...about this big.

                                 TRACY
                   He sounds interesting.

                                 MILLS
                   He is that, if nothing else.

     Mills throws some oranges in the basket hanging from Tracy's
     arm.  He goes to check out the carrots.  Tracy looks up from
     heads of lettuce to the strange man at the entrance.

     The strange man hums on, rocking back and forth slowly, his eyes
     glassy.  Customers come and go, paying him no mind.

     Mills notices Tracy's interest.  He keeps comparing carrots.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   We started a big homicide case today.
                   I'll spare you the grisly details.

     The strange man suddenly stops humming and looks into the store
     with a crooked grin.

                                 STRANGE MAN
                   Name that tune?  Anybody name that tune?
                   Name that tune...

     The man keeps repeating this, over and over, still ignored.

                                 TRACY
                   It's... it's like they emptied all the
                   insane asylums into the streets.

     She looks back to the heads of lettuce.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   That's what it's like.  Like they just
                   gave up, and let everyone out.

     Mills nods, his back to Tracy.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   There are a lot of frightening people in
                   this city.

                                 MILLS
                   There are a lot of frightening people in
                   the world.

     Tracy looks again to the strange man.

                                 STRANGE MAN
                   Name that tune?  Anybody name that tune?

                                 TRACY
                   It seems worse than Philadelphia,
                   because everything is pushed right up
                   against you.  In your face.

     Mills edges past Tracy towards the front of the store, tries to
     be pleasant.

                                 MILLS
                   Listen, honey.  I don't want to fight
                   tonight.  Okay?  Can we just go one
                   night without fighting about something?

     He looks over apples, thinks that's the end of that.

                                 TRACY
                   I'm not trying to start a fight.
                           (pause)
                   How am I trying to start a fight?

                                 MILLS
                   We're here now.  Okay.  Are we supposed
                   to pack it all in and go back?  How are
                   we going to do that?

                                 TRACY
                   Do I have to act like I love this place?
                   Is that what a "good wife" would do?

                                 MILLS
                           (doleful)
                   There's a lot of pressure on me... I...

                                 TRACY
                   And, there's a lot of pressure on me.
                   I'm here with you.

                                 MILLS
                   I know.  I know...

     Mills steps towards the open air entrance.  He's watching
     something.  The strange man is still heard offscreen.

     Tracy reaches to a high wooden shelf, trying to reach a bag of
     rice, her back to Mills.

                                 TRACY
                   I'm not going to close my eyes and block
                   everything out, David.  I'm not going to
                   act like you delivered us to some sort
                   of paradise.  I can't...

     She gets the rice and turns.  Mills is not there.  She sighs,
     angry, looks around.  She walks towards the entrance and sees
     him --

     TRACY'S P.O.V. -- THE STREET

     In front of the stand, Mills has run to the corner of the
     sidewalk to help a very old woman with a cane.  The elderly
     woman smiles up at Mills, takes his arm as he helps her off the
     curb and across the street.  He talks to her as they go.

     INT.  INDOOR FRUIT STAND -- NIGHT

     Tracy's anger fades.  She shakes her head, touched, amazed by
     the plain boy scoutishness of her husband.

     TRACY'S P.O.V. -- THE STREET

     Mills deposits the old woman on the other side.  She thanks him,
     patting him on the cheek.  Mills starts back towards the fruit
     stand, proud of himself.  A car screeches to a halt, just
     missing him.  The driver leans out the window, yelling at Mills.
     Mills kicks the side of the car.

                                 MILLS
                   Fuck you.
                           (as car leaves)
                   Fuck you, you son of a bitch!  I'm
                   walking here.

     INT.  INDOOR FRUIT STAND -- NIGHT

     Tracy rolls her eyes in amused disappointment.  She sighs again.

     Mills passes the babbling strange man, comes up to Tracy.

                                 MILLS
                   I'm sorry... I couldn't pass it up.  I
                   never had a chance to actually do that.
                   But, we can start the argument right
                   back up where we left off, right?

     Tracy looks at him, charmed, no longer willing to fight.

                                 MILLS
                           (playing dumb)
                   What?

     Tracy wraps an arm around Mills and kisses him.  He holds her.

                                 STRANGE MAN
                   That was the theme from tv's Mod Squad.
                   I'm surprised nobody got that one.

     The strange man starts humming a new tune.  An old man tries to
     get through the aisle where Mills and Tracy are kissing.

                                 OLD MAN
                           (infuriated)
                   Excuse me.  Excuse me!


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     A small transistor RADIO PLAYS on the bedside table.

     Mills and Tracy are in bed, making love under the sheets.  They
     move rhythmically, kissing, sweating hard.

     Mills holds Tracy's hair in his hands, pulls her head back as
     she gasps and he thrusts his entire body against hers.

     Mills' hair is soaked.  He is anything but mellow as a lover,
     quickening while Tracy twists underneath him.  Tracy holds tight
     to the back of his neck with one hand.

     Finally, Mills pushes himself up on his arms, holding his head
     down against Tracy's chest.  Holds for a long moment, till he is
     spent and lowers himself against her, into her arms.  He rests a
     long time.  She kisses his forehead, keeping her eyes closed.

     Finally, Mills rolls off her, gets behind her and wraps the both
     of them in the sheets.  He folds himself against her, and they
     stay that way.

                                 TRACY
                   Goodnight.

                                 MILLS
                   Goodnight.

     After a long moment, Mills shifts back, sits up.  Tracy looks
     over her shoulder at him as he takes a towel off a chair and
     stands.  Mills wraps the towel around his waist.

     He leans over to give Tracy a last kiss.  She watches him leave
     the room.  She is about to say something, but does not.  A light
     comes on in the other room, leaking through the door.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Mills sits down at his desk.  He starts looking through police
     paperwork.  The RADIO in the other room goes OFF in mid song.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     TUESDAY

     INT.  AUTOPSY ROOM -- EARLY MORNING

     The room is cold, clean.  Stainless steel.  White tile.  Many
     pathologists work at slabs.  Mills and Somerset are with DOCTOR
     SANTIAGO, 35, who stands over the mostly dissected obese corpse.

                                 SANTIAGO
                   If you take a look here, buddies...
                   I can tell you, it was not a poison.
                   If you can see...
                   I have emptied all of everything out of
                   the stomach.  But, look at it, now that
                   I took away the liver.

     Santiago reaches into the belly of the cavernous corpse.  Mills
     moves closer beside Somerset, but not too close, trying to hide
     his disgust.  We hear squashy sounds as Santiago works, but we
     don't see in.

                                 SANTIAGO (CONT)
                   I move the lungs over.  First, see how
                   big this fat son-of-a-bitch stomach is.
                   Now... here is the strange thing, on the
                   stomach.  Stretches.
                           (pointing)
                   And, here is it distended.  Look at the
                   size of that, because of the foods.

                                 MILLS
                   I can see what you're pointing at...

                                 SANTIAGO
                   On the stomach.  The lines of
                   distention.

     Somerset's looking in, not believing what he sees.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Doctor, are you saying this man... ate
                   till he burst?

                                 SANTIAGO
                   Yes, well, he didn't actually burst.  He
                   was bleeding, inside of himself.
                   And, there's a hemotoma on the
                   outside... on the belly.

     Somerset walks around the slab, looking the body over.

                                 MILLS
                   He died by eating?

                                 SANTIAGO
                   Someone punched him, or kicked him.

     Somerset notices something on the partially shaved head.

     He leans close to look at five or six small bruises on the back
     of the dead man's head; circular bruises, some darker than
     others, all about the same diameter as a dime.

                                 SANTIAGO (CONT)
                   Oh, and there is this here... something
                   else you have to look at and see.

     Somerset stands straight, realizes something about the bruises.

                                 SANTIAGO (CONT)
                   Most of his stomach contents are in the
                   lab now... but, this.  I found these in
                   the fat man's stomach.

     Santiago looks amongst tools, buckets and jars of liquid.  He
     picks up a glass jar and shows it to Mills.  In the jar: many
     little bits of blue plastic.  Like scrapings.

                                 MILLS
                   Plastic?

     Mills gets Somerset's attention, hands him the jar.  Somerset
     looks at it a long time.

                                 SANTIAGO
                   Why these were in a fat man's stomach, I
                   don't know.


     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, HALLWAY -- MORNING

     Outside the door to the murder scene, Mills and Somerset cut
     through the RESTRICTED AREA/CRIME SCENE seal.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Those bruises on the back of the
                   victim's head were caused by the muzzle
                   of a gun.

                                 MILLS
                   So, the killer had him at gunpoint, and
                   gave him a choice: eat, or get your head
                   blown off.

     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- MORNING

     Somerset and Mills enter.  Somerset takes out the jar of plastic
     scrapings, turns on the now normal light.  They begin to search.

                                 SOMERSET
                   He was force-fed... till his body
                   started rejecting the food.  He
                   literally couldn't eat another bite.

                                 MILLS
                   So, the killer held a bucket under him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   His throat was swollen from the effort.
                   He was bleeding internally.
                   He must have blacked out... and, if
                   you're the killer, you're not going to
                   want to wait around for him to die.

     Somerset examines the counter tops and wall.  Mills gets down on
     his knees, examines the linoleum floor.

                                 MILLS
                   You kick him, pop him like a fucking
                   balloon.
                           (touches floor)
                   Somerset, look here.

     Somerset gets down, holds the jar against the linoleum.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Same color and texture.

     They both crawl on hands and knees, study every inch of floor.

                                 MILLS
                   If this is what that is... it doesn't
                   make sense.  It doesn't figure.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Always look for one thing to focus on.
                   There's always one singular thing, and
                   it might be as small as a speck of dust,
                   but find it and focus... till it's an
                   exhausted possibility.

                                 MILLS
                   How are pieces of the floor going to get
                   in the guy's stomach?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Exactly.  Why would so many pieces be
                   inside his stomach unless they were
                   placed there intentionally?

     Somerset notices deep scratches in the linoleum, fingers the
     grooves.  He takes a piece of plastic from the jar, holds it to
     the scratches, fiddles with it, fits it in.  He looks up to see,
     these scratches are in front of the refrigerator.  It looks like
     they were caused by the refrigerator having been pulled away
     from the wall and pushed back at some time.

     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- LATER MORNING

     We are BEHIND THE REFRIGERATOR as it is rocked back and forth.
     It's pulled away from the wall.  Somerset and Mills strain, pull
     a few more feet, then release.  They lean to look --

     The refrigerator had hidden a space on the wall where the dust
     has been cleared.  In that space: a circle, smeared in grease,
     and a note taped in the center of the circle.

     Somerset's BEEPER starts BEEPING.  Mills leans to read:

                                 MILLS
                   "Dear Detectives.  Long is the way, and
                   hard, that out of hell leads up to the
                   light."
                           (looks at Somerset)
                   This is not good.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Milton.

                                 MILLS
                   What?

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's a quote from a book.  Milton's
                   Paradise Lost.

     Somerset takes out his beeper, looks at the LED window.  He
     looks up at Mills, like they've received very bad news.


     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENTS, HALLWAY -- MORNING

     A marble hallway.  A DETECTIVE, 50, nervously chewing his nails,
     quickly leads Mills and Somerset past cops and forensics.

                                 DETECTIVE
                   I said to myself, I'm not going to screw
                   around with this.  Nope.  Fuck that.
                   It's still pretty fresh meat.  I called
                   the medical examiner... he's coming.
                           (stops at door)
                   When I got to it, I knew.  As soon as I
                   laid eyes on it, I knew...

     The detective opens the door.  FOLLOW Somerset and Mills --

     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

     Gross, deep yellow light comes through the only window with its
     blinds up.  The light anoints a NUDE MAN displayed, dead.

                                 DETECTIVE (O.S.)
                   ...this is your guy who did this.

     The nude dead man's legs are folded under him as if he were
     kneeling, and he's bent forward, chin on the floor.  His eyes
     are open, his arms outstretched before him.  Mills and Somerset
     walk to either side of the man.

     The detective closes the door, bites his thumbnail.  The
     apartment is on a high floor, so it's quiet.

     Somerset sees the window has been covered with a sheet of yellow
     gel, stapled in place to produce the colored light.

     Mills examines the corpse.  There's a chair one foot behind the
     nude man.  It's an elegant leather chair, drenched in blood.
     There's a carving knife on the carpet in the middle of a huge
     stain of blood under the chair.  Mills looks at pieces of cut
     rope on the floor behind the chair.  The rope is knotted.

     Somerset crouches beside the body.  There's a big piece of flesh
     missing from the man's left side, as if the love-handle had been
     lopped off.  Hundreds of pennies lie scattered under and around
     the man.  The man's hands are palms up, fingers wrapped around
     more pennies.

     Mills walks over to examine a scale on the floor between the
     corpse and the doorway.  It's an old-fashioned counter-balance
     scale with two suspended dishes on a see-saw arm.  In the high
     dish: the hunk of flesh missing from the man's side.  In the low
     dish: a one pound counterweight.

                                 MILLS
                           (to Somerset)
                   A pound of flesh.

     Somerset stands and walks backwards to view the entire scene
     from near the door.

     He looks worried, vaguely frightened.  He turns his head, looks
     to a far wall.  Beside a big, abstract, constructivist painting,
     there's a note pinned up inside a triangular smear of blood.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING

     An office full of pictures, books and mugsheets, yet it is
     meticulously well kept.  The CAPTAIN, 50, sits at his tidy desk.
     He's dressed conservatively.  Mills and Somerset sit before him.
     Somerset reads from a photocopy of the note they just found.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (reading)
                   "One pound of flesh, no more no less. No
                   cartilage, no bone, but only flesh.
                   This task done, and he would go free."

     The captain is a calm man, but whenever not speaking, without
     fail, he clenches his jaw repeatedly, causing the muscles in his
     neck and jaw to pulse.

     Somerset stands, paces.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   This victim, Mr. Gold, was tied down
                   nude, holding a carving knife.  And he
                   was given a long time... to decide.
                   Where to make the first cut?  There's a
                   gun to your head... but, what part or
                   parts of your body are expendable?

     Mills sits back in his chair, arms crossed, seems anxious,
     doesn't know why they're here.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Mr. Gold tried for the whole pound at
                   once, his love handle.  But, he went
                   into shock.  Bled to death.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   What is the point, Somerset?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Look at both killings together.  This
                   murderer is an artist.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   An artist?

                                 SOMERSET
                   He uses colors and symbols.  He
                   positions the bodies after death, so
                   he's working with composition.  It's
                   been premeditated so meticulously... and
                   this is just the beginning.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Wrong.  For all we know, we might never
                   hear from him again, and I don't want
                   that kind of talk floating around.

     Somerset shakes his head "no."

                                 SOMERSET
                   The rats and the pennies.  The circle
                   and the triangle on the wall.  There's
                   something about them... these murders
                   mean something.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   So?  What?

     Somerset has no answer.  The captain is irked, jaw clenching.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT)
                           (to Mills)
                   You with him, or you just here to watch?

                                 MILLS
                   This is his stuff, captain.  I've been
                   out in the cold most of the day.

                                 CAPTAIN
                           (to Somerset)
                   Always working overtime up in that big
                   brain of yours, huh?  Always cooking.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I need you to know... I want us
                   reassigned.  We're declining this case.

                                 MILLS
                           (sits up, angry)
                   What?!

                                 CAPTAIN
                   What the hell are you talking about?

                                 SOMERSET
                   This cannot be my last duty here.  It's
                   going to go on and on.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   You've left unfinished business before.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Everything else was taken as close to a
                   conclusion as humanly possible.

                                 MILLS
                   Can I just say something?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Also... I don't think this should be
                   Mills' first case.

                                 MILLS
                   This is not my first case, fuckhead!

                                 CAPTAIN
                   I don't have anyone else to give this
                   to, Somerset.  And nobody's going to
                   swap with you.

                                 MILLS
                   Give it to me, then.  There's nothing
                   that says I have to fly with him.

     The captain considers this.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   If Somerset wants out, fuck him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It would be too much for him, too soon.

                                 MILLS
                           (to captain)
                   Could we talk about this in private?

     The captain looks at Somerset, then at Mills.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   That's not necessary.  You're in.

                                 MILLS
                   Thank you, sir.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Start picking up the pieces.  I'll
                   shuffle some paper and try to get you a
                   new partner.

     Mills stands.  Somerset will not look him in the eye.  Mills
     leaves, slams the door.  Somerset seems deflated.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT)
                   You win, Somerset.  You're out.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     WEDNESDAY

     EXT.  CITY STREET -- MORNING

     A vendor lays out a pile of tabloid newspapers at his busy
     newsstand.  The headline: SECOND BIZARRE MURDER!, in huge print.

     The vendor lays out another tabloid pile.  Headline: "GIVE ME MY
     POUND OF FLESH," SAYS BLOODTHRISTY KILLER, in big, red letters.
     The vendor places a third pile beside the others:  SICKENING
     MURDERS - EXCLUSIVE DETAILS INSIDE!!!


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- MORNING

     Old office.  Moving boxes on the floor.  The single window faces
     a billboard.  Somerset works on a manual typewriter.  He types
     hunt-and-peck, slowly.  His paperwork is on the desk in two
     sloppy piles.  A jarring SOUND is HEARD OFFSCREEN, like fingers
     on a blackboard.  Somerset looks up, irritated.

     A WORKMAN is working at the open door, holding the source of the
     sound, a razor blade he's using to scrape the words DETECTIVE
     SOMERSET off the door's window.

                                 WORKMAN
                   Sorry.

     Somerset turns back to typing.  The captain steps in, looks at
     the workman, then drops more papers on Somerset's desk.

     As always, the neatly groomed captain clenches his jaw.  He
     looks around.  Two of boxes on the floor have DETECTIVE MILLS
     written across them.  The captain picks one up, puts it on top
     of the other.  He sits, watching Somerset, starts straightening
     the forms on the desk.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   What are you going to do with yourself
                   out there, Somerset?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'll get a job.  Maybe on a farm.  I'll
                   fix up my house.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Can't you feel it yet?
                           (pause)
                   Can't you feel that feeling... that you
                   won't be special anymore?

                                 SOMERSET
                           (lying)
                   I don't know what you mean.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   You know.

     Somerset reclines, looks at the captain.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Did you read in the paper today, about
                   the man who took his dog for a walk?
                   And how he was mugged?  And, his wallet
                   was taken, and his watch.  Then, while
                   he was still lying unconscious, his
                   attacker stabbed him with a knife in
                   both eyes.  It happened last night.  Not
                   far from here.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   I heard.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I have no understanding of this place.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   It's always been like this.

     Somerset saddles up to the typewriter.  Hunt-and-peck.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Yes.  You're absolutely right.

     The captain lays the paperwork down in two neat stacks.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   You were made for this work, Somerset.
                   I can't believe you're going to trade it
                   all in for a tool belt and a fishing
                   rod.  But, I guess I'm wrong.

     The captain leaves.  Somerset looks up now that the captain's
     gone.  He grabs the paper piles and ruffles them back to their
     disheveled state.  He looks at the workman.

     The workman is looking at Somerset, has a rag in his hand to
     remove the last remnants of Somerset's name.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (angrily)
                   Put a little elbow grease into it!

     The workman is startled, continues his work.


     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     The grandly furnished apartment where the second murder took
     place has been dusted for prints and searched.

     Two female forensics are at work.

     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, MASTER BEDROOM -- DAY

     Mills is seated in front of a long writing desk with many
     drawers.  All the drawers are open.  Mills looks through letters
     and stationary.  Nothing of use.  He tosses the pile back.

     He sits back, frustrated, yanks off one rubber glove, looks
     around the room.  Books have been taken off their shelves, the
     bed has been stripped.  The room has been given the once over.

     The victim's family photographs hang in expensive frames on one
     wall.  There are at least thirty photos of various sizes:
     ancestors, sons and daughters, grandchildren and friends.  An
     over-weight forensic, CHRIS, 35, leans in through the doorway.

     Mills looks up and Chris shakes his head glumly.

                                 MILLS
                   He must have left us another puzzle to
                   solve... somewhere.

                                 CHRIS
                   We'll keep looking, but we're running
                   out of possibilities.

     Chris leaves and Mills stands to stretch.  Something catches
     Mills' eye.  He walks over to the door, curious.  At the base of
     the open door, there's a ball of paper wedged under to act as a
     doorjamb.  Mills puts his glove back on, pulls the ball out.

     He uncrumples the paper as the door slowly swings shut.  The
     page has a drawing on it, of the sun with waves of heat at its
     edges.  There is a single eye in the center of the sun.

     An arrow is drawn in dried blood on the back of the closing
     door.  Mills notices this and pushes the door closed.

     The blood arrow points to the side and up, seems to be pointing
     to the photo gallery wall.  Mills goes to examine the photos.

     His eyes search each photo... one by one... till he sees it:

                                 MILLS
                   Christ...

     A framed photo of a falsely pretty, middle-aged woman smiling
     and wearing pearls.  Under the glass, on the photo itself,
     circles have been drawn in blood around the woman's eyes.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS, DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT

     An assault on the senses.  Crowded streets and sidewalks.  On
     every corner, in every doorway, on every stairwell -- freaks,
     junkies, punks, leather boys and motorcycle girls.  A few
     tourists wander in the mix, heedful of the dangers around them.
     Buildings border narrowly.

     Somerset walks against the stream.  He carries a file.

     CAR HORNS HOWL.  MUSIC BLASTS from the entrances of clubs.
     REGGAE from one club is soon OVERTAKEN by RAP from a second
     story window.  TECHNO-POP blasts from the tattoo parlor.

     Somerset does not like this place, views it with disdain.  He
     walks to avoid two men fighting on the ground.  The men are
     pulling hair and pounding each other idiotically.

     Somerset takes a cigarette from a full pack, lights it as he
     crosses through the traffic jam in the street.  A VAGRANT steps
     up with his hand out.

                                 VAGRANT
                   Spare me a cigarette, money-grip?  Spare
                   me a cigarette?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Sorry.  Last one.

     He walks on.  We BEGIN to HEAR JAZZ MUSIC.

     INT.  JAZZ CLUB -- NIGHT

     A club at capacity.  The JAZZ MUSIC CONTINUES like a slow, cool
     breeze from a JAZZ TRIO on a platform.

     The air is thick with smoke.  Yuppies sit elbow to elbow with
     the last members of the beat generation.  Everyone's drinking
     beer, smoking pot.

     Somerset crosses the club, looking for someone.  He takes a
     tissue from his pocket, rips pieces off and jams the pieces in
     his ears.  At the back of the club, a major-league bouncer
     stands in front of a closed door.  Somerset shows his badge and
     the bouncer steps aside with reservation.

     INT.  NARROW STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

     The walls are black.  Somerset opens the door, enters, walks
     down the long flight of stairs.  As Somerset descends, the JAZZ
     MUSIC FADES and is ENGULFED by the sound of SPEED METAL.
     DEAFENING.

     At the bottom, Somerset opens another door.  He enters --

     INT.  UNDERGROUND ART GALLERY -- NIGHT

     A narrow room.  SPEED METAL is even LOUDER.  This is a private
     art party.  The people are lizard-like, pale.  Men and women
     priding themselves on their gauntness.

     Somerset passes canvases on the walls.  Pointlessly abstract
     paintings.  Splatters, smears and blobs of color.

     Party-people stand in front of these "works," engrossed.
     Somerset slides past, not interested in the art, jamming the
     tissue further in his ears.  He spots his objective.

     WILLIAM McCRACKEN, 42, stands inside a circle of admirers.  He is
     dressed like a pauper, his baggy clothing stained with many
     colors of paint.  He wears dark sunglasses, bored by the
     bleached-blonde girl whispering in his ear.

     Somerset worms his way to stand in front of William.  The party-
     goers turn their attention to this intrusion.

     William looks up, pushes the girl away.  He takes off his
     sunglasses.  His eyes are badly bloodshot and listless.

     He looks Somerset over... and then grins, glad to see him.


     INT.  MILL'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Mills stands brooding over a photocopy of the picture of the
     woman with her eyes circled in blood.  He looks overworked,
     drinks coffee.  His desk is swamped with files.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                   I have voiced the same concerns to our
                   law enforcement officials, and they
                   assure me he is of the highest caliber.

     Mills looks to a t.v. on a table, picks up a remote, increases
     the volume.  On the screen, MARTIN TALBOT, 47, source of the
     voice, stands before reporters.  He's a powerful presence, with
     a gold tooth in the front of his mouth.

                                 A REPORTER (V.O.)
                           (from t.v.)
                   As District Attorney, don't you feel
                   some responsibility?  Detective David
                   Mills lacks the experience...

                                 TALBOT (V.O.)
                           (from t.v.)
                   I've always said... I've always said,
                   don't send a boy to do a man's job.

     Mills is hanging on every word.

                                 TALBOT (V.O.,CONT)
                   But, David Mills has a sterling record
                   with the Philadelphia force.  I stand
                   behind him one hundred percent.

                                 MILLS
                           (relieved)
                   You tell 'em boss.  Detective David
                   Mills is a wonderful human being...

                                 TALBOT (V.O.)
                   However... however... let me say this...

     Mills looks back at the television.

                                 TALBOT (V.O.,CONT)
                   If Detective Mills, at any point in this
                   investigation... if he is not pulling
                   his weight, I will be the first in line
                   to pull his plug.

     Mills points the remote, turns the t.v. off as reporters crowd
     Talbot.  Mills stares at the blank screen, dispirited.

     Across the room, Tracy stands in the doorway.  Mills does not
     see her.  He looks at the photocopy and sits at his desk.

     Tracy watches him, great concern in her sad eyes.


     INT.  WILLIAM'S STUDIO/APARTMENT -- NIGHT

     Somerset walks through this vast artist's studio, a converted
     warehouse space filled with canvases.  It's clear the works at
     the underground art gallery were William's.  William climbs a
     ladder to a loft storage space.  He moves cautiously, like he's
     not quite up to the task.

                                 WILLIAM
                   I always figured that's the only reason
                   you and I used to be friends.  Because I
                   was a friend of hers.

     William yanks a painting wrapped in dusty paper, climbs down.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   Speaking of which...

     William hands the painting to Somerset, walks to a director's
     chair facing a paint-splashed canvas on an easel.  He is a used-
     up man, bound in an apathy-induced haze.  He sits, picks up a
     squeeze bottle of orange paint from a table of supplies.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   I painted that about five years ago.  I
                   always told myself I'd give it to you
                   next time I saw you.

     Somerset starts unwrapping the painting.

     William "paints," using the squeeze bottles and by flicking
     saturated brushes so that the paint flies against the canvas.
     Most times, he's not even looking at the canvas or colors he's
     using.  He looks over his shoulder at Somerset.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   Things are different these days, pal.
                   You wouldn't believe it...

     Somerset looks at the unwrapped painting and is hit by a swell
     of memories.  Horribly sad memories.  It's a portrait in oils of
     a pretty, red-headed woman.

     William shoots red paint with one hand, concentrates on
     lighting a filterless cigarette with the other.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   People buy my paintings now... they
                   drive down in their BMWs and Rolls
                   Royces.  It's the new money generation.
                   I guess they think they're touching the
                   avant-garde...

     William looks at his creation, then calmly kicks the easel over.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   There's another thousand dollar William
                   McCracken expression of anarchy.

     William gets up, walks across the wet canvas, leaving
     footprints.  He looks down at what he's done.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   Make that two thousand.

     He laughs.  Somerset holds up the delicately rendered portrait.

                                 SOMERSET
                   How is she?  Have you seen her recently?

                                 WILLIAM
                   Huh... oh.  No.  She moved out of the
                   city.  Last winter.  She married some
                   businessman, or something like that.

     Somerset fights the anguish this causes, puts the painting down.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Good for her.
                           (pause)
                   I'm leaving soon myself.  I'm finally
                   getting out.

                                 WILLIAM
                   Yeah?  What happened to the idealistic
                   super-cop I used to know?

                                 SOMERSET
                   He became a realist.

     William grunts, flicks his cigarette away, takes out a bag of
     pills.  He palms a few, notices the judgment in Somerset's eyes.

                                 WILLIAM
                   Oh... sorry.

     William turns his back to Somerset, pops the pills.  Out of
     sight, out of mind.  Somerset is disappointed, disgusted.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (sarcastic)
                   Not that I don't appreciate your recent
                   artistic endeavors... but, what happened
                   to the painter I used to know?

     William smiles like a dolt, laughs a little.

                                 WILLIAM
                   I can't remember.

     INT.  WILLIAM'S STUDIO/APARTMENT -- LATER NIGHT

     Color photos of the first and second murder sit on a drawing
     table.  The top photos are like establishing shots, each taking
     in the entire display the murderer created.

     William examines with Somerset looking over his shoulder.

                                 WILLIAM
                   Man... can I buy these from you?

                                 SOMERSET
                   They're not for sale.

     Somerset lays out photos of the notes, triangle and circle:

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   What is it?  What's the murderer trying
                   to say?

     William narrows his eyes.  Does not know.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   What picture is he painting?

                                 WILLIAM
                           (figuring)
                   Wait a minute...

     William has an idea.  He ambles over to a row of cabinets where
     oversized art books are stacked.  He hunts through a pile,
     shoves some books aside.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   I... I've seen things like that...

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where?

     William keeps digging, finds one book, finds another.  He opens
     one as he walks back to the drawing table.

                                 WILLIAM
                   It's church stuff.  Christianity.

     William lays a book down, finds a page.  He opens it to
     Somerset.  There is a circle to the side of the text.  It says
     GLUTTONY under the circle.

     Somerset creases his brow, turns the page.  William opens
     another book.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   When it first started... Christian
                   artwork was all from Bible stories.  It
                   was like... nobody had any imagination.
                   It was all... standardized.

     William pages through and we catch glimpses of the bizarre,
     worlds of Hieronymus Bosch.  Horrifying religious visions.

                                 WILLIAM (O.S.,CONT)
                   But, later, everyone started painting to
                   tell their own stories... to teach
                   lessons.  Guys like Bosch, Bregel the
                   elder... Van Eycks.

     William shoves the open book to Somerset.  Somerset looks:

     Seven paintings in a circular pattern showing characters giving
     in to sins.  Wicked, grotesque people.

     Somerset turns the book to examine each painting right side up.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   The seven deadly sins.

                                 WILLIAM (O.S.)
                   That's what these murders remind me of.
                   Paintings like these.
                           (points)
                   Gluttony... greed...

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   Envy, wrath, pride, lust and sloth.
                   Seven deadly sins.

                                 WILLIAM
                   Amen, brother.

     William goes to continue pulling other books.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   I can find more examples.  There's lots
                   of paintings like those... painted over
                   hundreds of years.
                           (moves books)
                   And you're right... that murderer is an
                   artist.

     Somerset is chilled by all this, immersed in the Bosch book.

                                 SOMERSET
                   And, it's two down... five to go.


     EXT.  CITY STREET, PORNO DISTRICT -- NIGHT

     A bright, tawdry intersection.  Neon swirls and circuit-bulbs on
     porno theatres provide the flash.  Cars, taxies, and barkers
     urging sexual indulgence from doorways provide the noise.

     The streets and sidewalks are crowded with lonely humans, mostly
     men, looking around, sizing up promises made on porno placards:
     FUN WITH NUDES, BIG BOOBS, NAKED DESIRE, etc.  The usual
     contingent of abnormal cretins wanders in the crowd, looking for
     someone to hurt.

     MOVE through the crowds.  Meet JOHN, a balding, middle-aged man,
     wearing thick glasses.  There is not a single thing strange or
     unusual about his appearance.  FOLLOW him as he walks.  He's
     nervous, looking at the porno palaces.

     His sweaty hand clutches a Bible tight against his chest.  He
     doesn't feel comfortable being here.

     John walks to a corner, waits for the light so he may cross.  A
     grotesque STREET PREACHER approaches waving his own Bible.
     People walk away from him, so he confronts John.

                                 PREACHER
                   ...are you, Sir?  Is Jesus Christ your
                   Lord and Master?  Do you believe in Him?

     John tries to ignore, traffic blocking his escape.

                                 PREACHER (CONT)
                           (pleading)
                   Don't ignore me.  Listen to what I have
                   to say.  Christ can be your savior!

                                 JOHN
                           (quiet anger)
                   Leave me alone.

                                 PREACHER
                   Think about God, sir.  I can help you
                   let Him into your life.

     Finally the light changes.  John turns and spits in the
     preacher's face.  The preacher recoils as John crosses quickly.

     John hurries between cars in the crosswalk.  The preacher curses
     from the corner, his voice drowned out in traffic.

     EXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET, PORNO DISTRICT -- NIGHT

     People pass on the sidewalk.  John is amongst them, but he
     stops, looking up at something offscreen.

     He's looking at a bright red storefront adorned with red neon:
     THE HOT HOUSE.  Massage parlor.  The Hot House's BARKER notices
     John's interest.

                                 BARKER
                   Interesting isn't it, friend?  You like
                   that, you like girls, then come on in.

     John doesn't hear the barker.  Steps up to study fading pictures
     of naked women massaging happy men.  Nudity.

                                 BARKER (CONT)
                   You'll see a lot more inside.  You'll
                   see a lot more than that.

     John's just looking, his face bathed in bright red light, the
     neon reflected in his thick glasses.


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Somerset, holding more than an armful of art books and novels,
     pounds on the apartment door.  Tracy opens it with the chain on.

                                 TRACY
                   Can I help you?

     She takes a second to drink Somerset in.  Somerset is surprised,
     having expected Mills.  Tracy is so exquisite that he falters.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Uh... I was looking for Mills.  David, I
                   mean.

                                 TRACY
                   He's not here right now.

     Somerset tries not to drop any books while he digs up his badge.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Mrs. Mills, my name is Somerset.  If I
                   could leave these books for him.

                                 TRACY
                           (undoes chain)
                   Please, come in.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT

     Tracy leads Somerset into the disarray of the apartment.

                                 TRACY
                   David went for a walk.  To clear his
                   head.  Oh, you can put those here.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Thank you.

     Tracy motions and Somerset puts the books on Mills' desk.
     He starts looking through one book, checking paperclipped pages.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Could you tell him... tell him this is
                   his reading assignment.  It's urgent.
                   I've marked the most important pages.

                                 TRACY
                   Would you like some coffee, or a drink.
                   David should be back any minute.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I do have to get going.

     Somerset sees a medal encased in glass on the desk amongst pens
     and pencils.  He picks it up: it's a medal for valor from the
     Philadelphia Police Department.

                                 TRACY
                   At least I got to meet you.  David has
                   told me a lot about you.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Really?  Good things, I hope.

                                 TRACY
                   Oh, yes.  He said you were very smart.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Really?

                                 TRACY
                   I think he's a bit intimidated by you.

     Somerset thinks about this, finds it hard to believe.  He goes
     through his pocket, pulls out a notepad and some paper scraps.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm going to leave him a list of
                   specifics.  It all relates to the case
                   he's on.

     He lays the various scraps and receipts aside on the desk, sits
     to start writing on the notepad.  Tracy goes to the kitchenette
     to get a chair.

                                 TRACY
                   You two aren't working together anymore.
                   Isn't that so?

                                 SOMERSET
                   To be perfectly honest, Mrs. Mills...

                                 TRACY
                   Tracy.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Tracy.  David and I weren't exactly what
                   you could call fast friends.

                                 TRACY
                   That's too bad.

     Tracy brings the chair over by the desk and sits.  Somerset
     looks up from his writing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I doubt your husband shares that
                   opinion.

     Tracy nods, leaning forward, semi-conspiratorially.

                                 TRACY
                   You know, Somerset, David is very...
                   determined.  I'm sure you've seen, it's
                   not likely he'll ever be compared to
                   Gandhi.

                                 SOMERSET
                   He's a good cop.  He just...

                                 TRACY
                   He sees policework as a crusade.  That's
                   what he wants it to be, and, that might
                   sound naive, but he's made a conscious
                   choice to be naive.
                           (pause)
                   Believe me, his heart's in the right
                   place.

     Somerset pauses, enchanted by her.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I hear you and he were high school
                   sweethearts.

                                 TRACY
                   Yeah.  Pretty hokey, huh?  But, what
                   girl wouldn't want the captain of the
                   football team as their lifelong mate?

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's rare these days... that kind of
                   commitment.

                                 TRACY
                   I guess so.

     Tracy's smile falters a bit.  Somerset notices this.  He breaks
     from her spell, turns to continue writing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Well... this will only take a minute.

                                 TRACY
                   Take your time.

     Somerset writes.  Tracy looks over the stack of books:

     Titles on the spines: BOSCH, A HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN ART, BREGEL
     THE ELDER, etc.  Hardcover novels: DANTE'S PURGATORY and THE
     CANTERBURY TALES.

     Tracy stands to look at the novels on top, then sees the pile of
     paper scraps from Somerset's pocket.  She picks up the piece of
     wallpaper with the pale red rose at its center.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   What is this?

     Somerset looks up.  Sees her holding the paper rose.  He takes
     it, slightly self-conscious, looks at it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   My future.

     Tracy tilts her head, looking at Somerset.

                                 TRACY
                   You have a strange way about you,
                   Somerset... I mean in a good way...
                   unusual.

     Somerset doesn't know what to say.  He pockets the paper rose.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   I apologize.  I'll get out of your hair.

     Tracy stands, takes the chair back to the kitchenette.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   It's just... it's nice to hear a man who
                   talks like that.  If David saw that
                   paper, he'd say you're acting like a
                   homosexual.  That's how he is.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (mock indignation)
                   Well!  I guess I won't be showing this to
                   him then.

                                 TRACY
                   I suppose not.

     Somerset continues writing.  Tracy sits at the kitchenette
     table, watches him.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     THURSDAY

     EXT.  CITY MORGUE -- MORNING

     It's raining hard.  Mills exits the morgue building with a few
     art books and a paper cup of coffee.  He holds one art book over
     his head as he dashes through deep puddles in the street.

     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- MORNING

     Mills gets in, puts his coffee on the dash and tosses the art
     books in a box.  He closes the door.  Alone with the sound of
     the rain.  He wipes water off his face, looks at his tired eyes
     in the rearview mirror.

     He reaches in the box of books, takes out copies of The
     Canterbury Tales and Dante's Purgatory.  He makes a face, opens
     Dante's Purgatory:

     |_______________________________/_____________________________|

     Mills turns to a bookmark, rests the book on the steering wheel.
     He reads.  He bites his lip, leaning close to the words.  He
     concentrates, mouths some of the words to himself.  He finally
     closes the book, shaking his head, not understanding anything
     he's reading.  He starts pounding the book against the steering
     wheel with all his might.

                                 MILLS
                   Fucking Dante.  Goddamn, poetry writing
                   freak, mother-fuck...

     A figure outside the window knocks on the glass.  Mills rolls it
     down.  A COP in raincoat hands a wet paper bag through.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Good work, Officer.  Good work.

     The cop leaves as Mills quickly rolls the window up and rips the
     bag open.  Inside: Cliff Notes for Dante's Purgatory and The
     Canterbury Tales.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Thank God.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- DAY

     It still rains outside.  Somerset enters, stops to notice
     DETECTIVE MILLS painted on the door where his name used to be.
     He walks, sees all his belongings have been moved from his desk
     and piled on a small temporary desk in the corner.

     Somerset sits at the temporary desk, starts organizing the files
     and papers.  Mills enters carrying the box of books.

                                 SOMERSET
                   How's it coming?

                                 MILLS
                   Great.

     Mills puts the box on the large desk.  They both settle in,
     attending to their work.  Two men, about five feet apart, each
     trying not to acknowledge the other's presence.

     Mills takes out his Cliff Notes, looks to see Somerset is
     occupied, hides them in a desk drawer.

     Somerset finishes one form, flips it and looks up.  There's a
     chalk board nailed to the wall.

     On the chalkboard:     1 gluttony(x)    5 wrath
                            2 greed(x)       6 pride
                            3 sloth          7 lust
                            4 envy

     The PHONE RINGS.  Both men look at it.  Phone RINGS again.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's your name on the door.

     Mills picks up.  Somerset returns to his work.

                                 MILLS
                           (into phone)
                   Detective Mills here.
                           (lowers voice)
                   Honey, I asked you not to call unless...
                           (listens)
                   What... why?  Okay... okay.  Hold on.

     Mills is confused.  He holds the phone out to Somerset.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   It's my wife.

     Somerset looks quizzical.  Mills shrugs.  Somerset takes it.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (into phone)
                   Hello?
                           (listens)
                   Yes, well... I appreciate the thought,
                   but... I...
                           (listens)
                   Well, I guess I'd be delighted to.
                   Thank you... goodbye.

     Somerset gets up, hangs up, puzzled.  Mills is waiting.

                                 MILLS
                   Well?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm invited to have a late supper with
                   you and your wife.  And I accept.

                                 MILLS
                   How's that?

                                 SOMERSET
                           (sits back down)
                   Tonight.

     Mills looks at the phone, lost.


     INT.  MILL'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT

     A record player on a moving box PLAYS QUIET MUSIC.

     There's a basketball game with NO VOLUME on the t.v. screen.
     Tracy, Mills and Somerset eat at the kitchen table.  Mills has a
     beeper by his beer and occasionally fingers it absently.

                                 TRACY
                   Why aren't you married, Somerset?

                                 MILLS
                   Tracy.  What the hell?

     Somerset adjusts his napkin on his lap, thinking.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I was close.  It just didn't happen.

                                 TRACY
                   It surprises me you're not married.  It
                   really does.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Any person who spends a significant
                   amount of time with me finds me...
                   disagreeable.  Just ask your husband.

                                 MILLS
                   No argument.

     Mills grins, but he means it.  he sips beer.  The conversation
     lapses into long silence.  Somerset concentrates on his plate.
     Tracy looks at Mills, who eats while watching the basketball
     game.

                                 TRACY
                           (to Somerset)
                   How long have you lived here?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Too long.  Much too long.
                           (drinks)
                   What do you think of our fair city?

                                 TRACY
                   You take the bad with the good, I
                   suppose.  It's... it's...

                                 MILLS
                   It takes time to settle in.

     Tracy looks at Mills.  Somerset can see it is a sore subject.

                           (to Tracy)
                   You'll get used to it pretty quickly.
                   There are things in any big city that
                   stand out at first.  But...

     A LOW RUMBLING is HEARD as plates begin to rattle and clatter.

                                 TRACY
                   Subway train.  It's right below us/

     The dishes clatter more.  Coffee cups clink against their
     saucers.  Tracy holds her cup to stop it, tries to act like it
     is nothing, but she is clearly bothered.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   It'll go away in a minute.

     They wait.  The t.v. picture goes fuzzy.  The RUMBLING grows
     LOUDER, knocks something over in the sink.  Mills continues
     eating.  Somerset fiddles with his food.  The record player
     skips, then plays on.  The RUMBLING finally DIES DOWN, till
     everything is normal.

                                 MILLS
                           (uncomfortable)
                   This real estate guy... a real scum,
                   brought us to see this place a few
                   times.  And, it was nice enough, and the
                   price was right.  I was thinking it was
                   nothing, but I started to notice, he
                   kept hurrying us along.  I mean what
                   could it be?  Why would he only show it
                   like five minutes at a time, before he'd
                   hustle us out the door?

     Mills laughs, lamely.

                                 TRACY
                   We found out the first night.

     Somerset tries to stay straight, but he can't help laughing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm sorry... it's a nice apartment.

     He pulls himself together, but only for a moment.  He can't stop
     it, laughs harder, covering his mouth.  Tracy and Mills laugh.

                                 MILLS
                           (sighs)
                   Oh, fuck.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- LATER NIGHT

     The record player spins a different album, DIFFERENT MUSIC.
     Tracy's clearing the last dishes into the sink.  Mills and
     Somerset have beers.

                                 SOMERSET
                   All television does is teach children
                   that it's really cool to be stupid and
                   eat candy bars all day.

                                 TRACY
                   I don't think I've ever met anyone who
                   didn't have a television.

     Tracy takes a pot of coffee to the table and pours.

                                 MILLS
                   That's weird.  It's un-American.

     Somerset shrugs.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What about sports?

                                 SOMERSET
                   What about them?

     Tracy brings over a plate of cookies and puts it on the table.

                                 MILLS
                   You go to movies at least.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I read.  Remember reading?  What's the
                   last book you read, Mills?

                                 MILLS
                   T.V. Guide.

     Mills laughs.  Burps.  he turns to Tracy.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Excuse me.
                           (to Somerset)
                   I just have to say, I can't respect any
                   man who's never seen Green Acres.

     Somerset gives a blank stare.  Tracy walks away.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   You've never seen The Odd Couple?  The
                   Flintstones?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I vaguely recall Wilma, and someone
                   named... Dino.

     Across the room, Tracy turns the t.v. and the record player off.
     She goes into the bedroom, shuts the door behind her without a
     word.  Somerset and Mills turn to the closed door.

     They look at each other, then sit for a time.  Somerset drinks
     coffee.  Mills drums his fingers on his beeper.  Big silence.


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

     Mills walks up the creaky stairs.  He carries his briefcase, a
     six-pack and art books.  Somerset follows, reading a case file.

                                 MILLS
                   We think he acted like he was delivering
                   a package.  The doorman at Mr. Gold's
                   building says he doesn't even look at
                   anyone who goes in anymore.

     Mills opens a door to the roof --

     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

     Mills and Somerset walk onto the roof.  It is a spectacular view
     on all sides.  Miles of city lights.  Breathtaking.  SOUNDS of
     the CITY reach them.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No connection between the two victims?

     Mills shakes his head, unloads what he's holding onto a rusty
     table.  He sits in one of two lawn chairs.  Somerset sits across
     from him.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   No witnesses of any kind?

                                 MILLS
                   None.  Which I can't understand.  It's
                   like this guy's invisible.


                                 SOMERSET
                   In this city, minding your own business
                   is a perfected science.

     Somerset takes a picture from the file, the drawing of the sun
     with an eye at its center.  He opens a book, CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS,
     which is full of illustrations.  He starts paging through.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   At the precinct, Sunday nights, they
                   offer a public crime prevention course.
                   And, the very first thing they teach is
                   that you should never scream "help" if
                   you're in trouble.  Scream "fire."
                   Because people don't want to get caught
                   up in anything.  But, a fire... that's
                   entertainment.  They come running.

     Somerset holds the books up to Mills, points to a picture of the
     sun and eye, same as the drawing Mills found.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   "The Sun in Splendor with the Eye."  It
                   refers to God the father, and to Saint
                   Thomas Aquinas.

                                 MILLS
                   Which saint is he?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Aquinas wrote a summary of theology,
                   Summa Theologica.  And he wrote about
                   the seven deadly sins.

     Mills takes the book and looks it over.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Now, what else have you got?

                                 MILLS
                   Look, I appreciate being able to talk
                   this out, but... it's my case.

                                 SOMERSET
                   So... satisfying my curiosity.  I'm
                   still leaving town on Sunday.

     Mills is pondering, very tired.  He unlatches his briefcase,
     takes a photocopy of the photo of the falsely pretty woman and
     hands it to Somerset.

                                 MILLS
                   The eyes were circled.  With Mr. Gold's
                   blood.

                                 SOMERSET
                   This is his wife?

                                 MILLS
                           (nods)
                   She was away on business.  She got back
                   the day he was killed.  If this means
                   she saw anything, I don't know what.
                   We've questioned her about ten times.

                                 SOMERSET
                   And, if it's a threat?

                                 MILLS
                   We put her in a safe house.

                                 SOMERSET
                   This is the one thing.

                                 MILLS
                   I know.


     EXT.  SLUM TENEMENTS -- NIGHT

     Two twenty-story tenement buildings stand practically underneath
     the span of a bridge.  The streets are littered with garbage.
     Teenagers stand in cliques in front of a liquor store.  Cars
     pass slowly, CAR STEREOS PUMPING out HIP HOP.

     Under the bridge, in shadow, a car is parked between two
     dumpsters.  The trunk is open.

     AT THE BACK OF THE CAR

     The trunk is full of cardboard boxes which are in turn full of
     tall, orange candles.  Hundreds of candles.  JOHN leans in under
     the trunk's bulb, opens a leather pouch and checks the contents:

     A plastic bottle of prescription pills.  A bottle of aspirin.  A
     hypodermic needle filled with liquid.  Lastly, many jars of baby
     food: STRAINED CARROTS, STRAINED SPINACH, CREAMED CORN, etc.

     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

     John climbs the stairs holding the leather case and a closed
     shoebox.  He wears clip-on sunglasses, a hat pulled low, a thin
     overcoat on his plump body.

     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     John comes from the stairwell door, looks, walks up the hall.
     The walls are graffitied.  The soiled floor is wet in spots.
     ARGUMENTS and LOUD CHILDREN are HEARD from behind closed doors.
     John comes to apartment 303.  He's winded from the climb.  He
     takes out keys, lets himself in.  Closes the door.


     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

     Somerset stands at the edge, holding the photo of Mrs. Gold.  He
     puffs on a cigarette, looks out at the city lights.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's like he's preaching.
                           (pause)
                   The sins were used in medieval sermons.
                   There were seven cardinal virtues, and
                   then seven deadly sins, as a learning
                   tool.  The sins distract man from true
                   worship.  True faith.

     Mills is seated at the table with art books open.

     A breeze fans the pages of the books.  The flipping pages reveal
     views of heaven, hell, adoration, crucifixion and sin.

                                 MILLS
                   Like in these paintings, and in Dante's
                   Purgatory, right?  But, in Purgatory,
                   Dante and his buddy climb that big
                   mountain...

                                 SOMERSET
                   Seven Terraces of Purgation.

                                 MILLS
                   Anyway... pride comes first, not
                   gluttony.  And in all the paintings,
                   the sins are in a different order.  I
                   can't find a pattern.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Because there's creativity in the mix.
                   Consider these books as the murderer's
                   inspiration.  Or aspiration.

     Somerset drops his cigarette to the empty street, watching the
     glowing tip fall.  He looks at the woman's circled eyes.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   He sees himself contributing to the body
                   of Christian work.

                                 MILLS
                   He's punishing these people.

                   What?  Forced what?

                   Attrition.  When you regret your sins,
                   but not because you love God.

                                 MILLS
                   Because someone's holding a gun on you.

     Somerset thinks.  He walks from the edge to Mills.

                                 SOMERSET
                   When Mr. Gold's wife found the body,
                   about how long was she in the apartment?

                                 MILLS
                   She didn't find it.  The door to the
                   apartment was open and a neighbor...

                                 SOMERSET
                   I thought you said she found the body.
                   When she got back from a business trip.

                                 MILLS
                   No.  She got back after you and I had
                   already been there.

     Somerset thinks, coming up with something.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What?

     Somerset holds up the photo of Mrs. Gold.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Maybe she is supposed to see
                   something... she just hasn't had a
                   chance to see it yet.


     INT.  SAFE HOUSE -- NIGHT

     The room is like a bland hotel room.  Mills stands beside MRS
     GOLD.  He shows her photos from the murder scene.  Mrs. Gold is
     crying.  Somerset stands across the room.

                                 MILLS
                   Please, look for anything strange or out
                   of place.  Anything at all.

                                 MRS GOLD
                   I... I don't understand.  Why now?

     Mills helps her go through the photos.  He is shaken himself,
     not wanting to put her through this.

                                 MILLS
                   I need your help if we're going to get
                   the guy who killed your husband.  If
                   there's anything in these pictures...

     Mrs. Gold sobs quietly, wipes her tears.

                                 MRS GOLD
                   I don't see anything.

                                 MILLS
                   Are you absolutely sure?

                                 MRS GOLD
                   I can't do this now... please.

ette to the empty street, watching the

                                 MILLS
                   She didn't find it.  The door to the
                   apartment was open and a neighbor...

                                 SOMERSET
                   I thought you said she found the body.
                   When she got back from a business trip.

                                 MILLS
                   No.  She got back after you and I had
                   already been there.

     Somerset thinks, coming up with something.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What?

     Somerset holds up the photo of Mrs. Gold.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Maybe she is supposed to see
                   something... she just hasn't had a
                   chance to see it yet.


     INT.  SAFE HOUSE -- NIGHT

     The room is like a bland hotel room.  Mills stands beside MRS
     GOLD.  He shows her photos from the murder scene.  Mrs. Gold is
     crying.  Somerset stands across the room.

                                 MILLS
                   Please, look for anything strange or out
                   of place.  Anything at all.

                                 MRS GOLD
                   I... I don't understand.  Why now?

     Mills helps her go through the photos.  He is shaken himself,
     not wanting to put her through this.

                                 MILLS
                   I need your help if we're going to get
                   the guy who killed your husband.  If
                   there's anything in these pictures...

     Mrs. Gold sobs quietly, wipes her tears.

                                 MRS GOLD
                   I don't see anything.

                                 MILLS
                   Are you absolutely sure?

                                 MRS GOLD
                   I can't do this now... please.

     Mills looks at Somerset.  Somerset holds other photos.

                                 MILLS
                   We have to show her those.  There might
                   be something she's missing.

     Somerset looks at the photos in his hand, hesitant.  These
     photos show Mr. Gold's corpse, not covered in any way.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Have her look one last time.

                                 MRS GOLD
                   Wait.  Here... here's something...

                                 MILLS
                   What is it?

     Mrs. Gold points at the constructivist painting on the wall in
     one photo.  The painting is an abstraction of colored squares.

                                 MRS GOLD
                   This painting... in the living room...

                                 MILLS
                   What?

                                 MRS GOLD
                   Why is it hanging upside-down?

     Mills jerks his head to look at Somerset.  Big score.


     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     This is where the greed murder took place.  Somerset and Mills
     are taking the constructivist painting off the wall.  Nothing on
     the wall behind the painting.  Blank space.

                                 MILLS
                   Nothing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   This has got to be it.

     Somerset puts the painting down, resting it on its bottom edge.
     The frame is backed by a thick sheet of brown paper.  He points
     to where the wire used to be screwed into the frame, and to
     where it has been re-screwed.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   It has to be.  He changed the wire to
                   rehang it.

     Somerset tears along the edge of the brown paper to get to the
     space between it and the canvas.  He tears out the entire sheet.
     Mills helps pull it away, but there's nothing there.  Empty.
     Mills looks at both sides of the paper, then tosses it away.

                                 MILLS
                   It's nothing.

     Somerset pays the painting down, face up.  He pokes his finger
     on the painted surface.  Mills watches as Somerset kneels, takes
     out a credit card and presses it's edge against the canvas,
     trying to peel up some of the paint.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Give it up.  The killer didn't paint the
                   fucking thing.

     Somerset pushes the painting away, stands, frustrated.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   He fucked us.

     Somerset backs away from the wall, staring at the space where
     the painting hung.  There is only a nail.  He stares intently,
     then turns and walks out of the room.

     Mills holds his hands to his temples, furious.  SOMERSET can be
     HEARD from the other room, going through drawers, dropping
     things.  GLASS is HEARD BREAKING.  Mills grabs a lamp and throws
     it on the floor.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Son of a bitch!

     Somerset comes back in, holding something.  He steps over the
     lamp and goes to the blank wall space.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Bear with me.

     Mills watches.  Somerset has a woman's make-up compact in hand.
     He opens it, uses the soft brush to begin applying the red rouge
     powder to the wall around the nail.

                                 MILLS
                           (incredulous)
                   Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Shut up and wait!

     Somerset brushes with wider strokes.  He blows, leans very close
     to the wall to study the powder.  Leans closer still.  Pause.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Call the print lab.  Now.


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Tracy is asleep with lights on.  She stirs, opens her eyes.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT

     Tracy opens the door, enters.  It's quiet.  She sees Mills and
     Somerset are gone.  She's all alone.  Unhappy.

     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, FIRE ESCAPE -- NIGHT

     Through the window, we can see into the bedroom.  Tracy comes
     back from the living room.  She goes to her side of the bed,
     kneels.  She reaches between the mattress and bedspring, takes
     out a paperback book she has hidden there.

     She comes to the window, opens it and climbs out onto the fire
     escape.  She sits, dangles her feet through the metal bars.  She
     opens the book and tries to read by the street light, resting
     her head against the railing.  A WOMAN is HEARD SCREAMING
     distantly.

     Tracy looks down the empty street, unsettled.  The woman is not
     heard again.

     Tracy lays back, looks at the sky, holding herself.  We can now
     see the title of the book: PREPARING FOR PARENTHOOD.  There is a
     picture of a baby on the cover.

     Tracy cries, quietly.


     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     A MALE FORENSIC uses a magnifying glass to study a very clear
     fingerprint in black powder on the wall.

                                 FORENSIC
                   Oh, boy...

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Talk to me.

     The forensic bites his lip, still studying.

     Mills and Somerset watch the forensic who works offscreen.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                           (to Somerset)
                   Listen, honestly... have you ever seen
                   anything like this?  Been involved in
                   anything remotely like this?

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.  I have not.

                                 FORENSIC (O.S.)
                   Well, I can tell you this, detectives...

     The forensic steps down from a stool.  Behind him, where the
     painting once was, there are fingerprints, clear and distinct.
     The prints have been left side by side, to form letters which
     form the words: HELP ME.

                                 FORENSIC (CONT)
                   ...just by studying the underloop...
                   these are not the victim's prints.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, PRINT LAB -- NIGHT

     Dark.  A TECHNICIAN sits before an old computer.  The computer's
     green screen shows fingerprints being aligned, compared and then
     rejected; whir - click - whir - click - whir - click.  Mills and
     Somerset watch, bathed in the green glow.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It doesn't work for me.  I can't believe
                   he wants us to help him stop.

                                 MILLS
                   Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of
                   schizoids out there doing dirty deeds
                   they don't want to do.  With tiny voices
                   whispering nasty things in their ears.

     Somerset doesn't buy it.  The technician adjusts a knob.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                   I've seen this baby take three days to
                   finish a cycle, so you guys can go cross
                   your fingers somewhere else.

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Somerset and Mills come from the print lab.  A janitor is
     mopping the hall.  The computer is HEARD WHIRRING AND CLICKING
     onwards.  Somerset sits with a groan on a couch outside the
     door.  Mills flops beside him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You really meant what you said to Mrs.
                   Gold.  You really believe we'll get him,
                   don't you?

                                 MILLS
                   And you don't?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I wish I still thought like you.  I'm so
                   far gone from that.

                                 MILLS
                   So, tell me what you think we're doing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   All we do is pick up the pieces.  We
                   take all the evidence... all the
                   pictures, statements.  Write everything
                   down and note what time things happened.
                   We take it all, make a nice, neat pile
                   and file it away.  Just in case it's
                   ever needed in a courtroom.

                                 MILLS
                   You're unbelievable.  In my entire life,
                   you're the oldest man I've ever met.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I've seen even the most promising clues
                   lead to dead ends.  Hundreds of times.

                                 MILLS
                   I've seen the same.  I'm not the country
                   hick-boy you seem to think I am.

     Somerset takes out a cigarette and lights it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   In this city, if all the skeletons came
                   out of all the closets... if every un-
                   revenged corpse were to suddenly rise
                   and walk again, there would be no more
                   room for the living.

     Mills slumps back, crosses his arms, closes his eyes to sleep.

                                 MILLS
                   Don't try to tell me you didn't get that
                   rush tonight... that adrenalin.  Like we
                   were getting somewhere.
                           (pause)
                   And, don't try to tell me it was because
                   you thought we found something that
                   would play well in a courtroom.

     Somerset looks at Mills, puffs the cigarette.  The computer is
     heard: whir - click - whir - click...


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     FRIDAY

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, HALLWAY -- EARLY MORNING

     Our detectives are fast asleep on the couch, leaning against
     each other.  People pass and look at them strangely.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Wake up, Glimmer Twins.  We have a
                   winner.

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, READY ROOM -- EARLY MORNING

     A windowless classroom.  The captain stands in front with a
     white screen at his side.  The face of a black man, 25, ZERO, is
     projected on the screen from a slide projector.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   His street name is Zero, as some of you
                   know.  His prints were found at the
                   scene by Detectives Mills and Somerset.

     FIVE hardened POLICE OFFICERS, four men, one woman, sit in
     chairs facing the captain.  They all wear bullet-proof vests
     with "POLICE" stencil-painted across them.  Somerset and Mills
     sit in back, drinking coffee, still trying to wake up.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT)
                   Now, Zero has a long, long history of
                   mental illness.  Serious illness.  He
                   was all over your television sets two
                   years ago after he raped and killed a
                   seventy-three year old woman.  He got
                   off, as the saying goes, on a
                   technicality.  So we watched him on the
                   streets, and he went out of circulation
                   about a year ago.

                                 FEMALE COP
                   If he disappeared, what do you want from
                   us?

                                 CAPTAIN
                   His last place of residence is still in
                   his name.  A search warrant is being
                   pushed through the court as we speak.

     A red-headed cop, CALIFORNIA, 28, raises his meaty hand.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   So, have the housing cops walk up and
                   ring the doorbell.  Problem solved.

     The cops laugh.  The captain clenches his jaw.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Listen, California.  When you go in, if
                   Zero isn't home, some of his buddies
                   might be house-sitting.  And besides
                   using, Zero deals, so, you will be very
                   uninvited guests.

     There is chatter among the cops.  Somerset leans to Mills while
     the captain continues the briefing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Does not seem like our killer, does it?

                                 MILLS
                   You tell me.  I'm new in town.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Zero does possess the requisite degree
                   of insanity... but, he doesn't have the
                   desire somehow.  Our killer seems to
                   have more purpose.  More purpose than
                   Zero could ever conceive of.

                                 MILLS
                   We'll tag along.

     Somerset wants no part of that.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Why would we?

                                 MILLS
                   Satisfy our curiosity?


     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- MORNING

     Mills drives, follows a police van.  Somerset rides shotgun.
     Mills is pumped, ready.  Somerset takes one Rolaids tablet off a
     fresh roll and chews it.

                                 MILLS
                   You ever take one?

     Somerset pulls out his gun, checks the load.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.  Never in twenty-four years.  I took
                   my gun out only five times with the
                   actual intention of using it.  I never
                   fired it.  Not once.

                                 MILLS
                   I pulled it once, fired it once.  I
                   never took a bullet.

                                 SOMERSET
                   And?

     Mills turns a corner, tires screeching.

                                 MILLS
                   It was my first one of these.  We were a
                   secondary unit, in vice.  I was pretty
                   shaky going in.  When we busted the
                   door, looking for a junkie, the fucking
                   guy opened fire.  One cop was hit in the
                   arm.  He went flying... like in slow
                   motion.
                           (pause)
                   I remember riding in the ambulance.  His
                   arm was like... a piece of meat.  I
                   thought, it's just his arm.  But, he
                   bled to death right there anyway.

     A pause.  Somerset opens the window, feels the air on his face.

                                 SOMERSET
                   How did the fire-fight end?

                                 MILLS
                   Well, I was doing really good in Philly
                   up till then.  Lots of simple busts.
                   I've always had this weird luck... but,
                   this was wild.
                           (pause)
                   I got that fuck with one shot... right
                   between the eyes.  And the next week,
                   the mayor's pinning a medal on me.
                   Picture in the paper, the whole nine
                   yards.

                                 SOMERSET
                   How was it?

                                 MILLS
                   I expected it to be bad, because I heard
                   about other guys.  You know... I took a
                   human life.  But, I slept like a baby
                   that night.

     Somerset eats another antacid.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I
                   can't remember where, but he wrote that,
                   in order to live in a city, you have to
                   have the ability to kill.  I think he
                   meant you truly must be able to do it,
                   not just faking it, to survive.

                                 MILLS
                   Sounds like he knew what he was talking
                   about.


     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- MORNING

     Crack vials and hypodermic needles crunch under heavy boots.

     The five cops from the briefing, fully geared up, rifles and
     handguns held, move quickly up the stairs, single-file.
     Somerset and Mills follow, guns out.  Somerset is sweating
     bullets.  Mills is juiced.

     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- MORNING

     The cops enter the dank hallway, the same hall we saw John in
     before.  They move cautiously, stepping over a drunken, helpless
     man.  A door opens and a woman peeks out.  The female cop points
     her gun and the woman obeys, slamming the door.

     California leads, steps up to apartment 303.  He has a search
     warrant scotch-taped to the front of his bullet-proof vest.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                           (to black cop)
                   This is it.  Give it up.

     A black cop hoists a battering ram.  The other cops get on both
     sides of the door.  Mills moves front.  Somerset hangs back.

                                 CALIFORNIA (CONT)
                   Police!!  Open the door!

     The black cop brings the ram forward with a splintering thud.
     The door flies open.  The cops storm in.

     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING

     The cops charge down a short hall into this incredibly dusty
     room.  A bed sits against a far wall.  Mills and California move
     up to the bed.  Someone lies under an indigo blanket.  Three
     other cops move, training their weapons on the bed.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Good morning, Sweetheart!

     A blond cop goes into another room.  Mills kicks the bed.

                                 MILLS
                   Get up now, motherfucker!  Now!

     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, ADJOINING ROOM -- MORNING

     The blond cop enters, gun trained, looks around in confusion.

     The room's tables, chairs and floor are covered with hundreds of
     colorful, plastic air fresheners.

     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING

     Somerset moves in, looks around.  He notices the area around the
     bed, the ceiling, walls and floor, has been painted indigo,
     while the rest of the room is its original white.  On a wall, a
     white sheet is pinned up with a square drawn on it in excrement.

                                 MILLS
                   I said get up, Sleepyhead!

     Mills pulls the indigo blanket off the bed, reveals the
     shriveled, sore-covered form of a black man who is blindfolded
     and tied to the bed with a thin wire wrapped time and time again
     around the bed.  Tubes lead from the stained loincloth around
     the man's waist and snake under the bed.  The victim is
     partially covered by what seem to be piles of black spaghetti.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Oh, fuck me!

     Somerset pushes past the cops who recoil from the stench.

                                 MILLS
                   Holy shit.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Sloth... it's sloth.

     The black cop touches the black spaghetti.  Holds a piece.

                                 BLACK COP
                   What the hell... those are dead worms.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                           (to Somerset)
                   Check this out, dick.

     California points with his gun to the end of the black man's
     right arm.  The hand is gone, severed at the wrist long ago.

                                 MILLS
                   It's him.  It's Zero.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Someone call an ambulance.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Someone call a hearse, more like.

     The female cop has gone to the wall where the sheet is pinned
     up.  She pulls the sheet aside and finds: fifty-two polaroid
     pictures; all pictures of Zero tied to the bed, with a date
     written at the bottom of each.  it is a visual history of Zero's
     physical decay.  The blond cop enters from the other room.

                                 BLOND COP
                   What the fuck is going on?

                                 MILLS
                   Hey, California.  Get your people out.

     Somerset takes out rubber gloves and puts them on.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   You heard him.  Hit the hall, and don't
                   touch anything.

     The other cops file out as Mills goes to examine the polaroids
     under the sheet.  Somerset replaces the sheet over Zero's body.
     California stays by his side.

                                 CALIFORNIA (CONT)
                   It looks like he's some kind of friggin'
                   wax sculpture.

     Somerset places his finger along Zero's throat.

                                 MILLS
                   Somerset, you... you better look here.

     Mills studies the polaroids.  Somerset walks to join him.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   All pictures of Zero tied to the bed.
                           (crouches)
                   The last one's dated three days ago.

     Somerset looks at the first photo.  In it, Zero is bound and
     gagged, but he is fit, healthy.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (awed)
                   The first photo... it's dated one year
                   ago.  Almost to the day.

     California lifts Zero's blanket to peek under, examining with
     morbid curiosity.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Mo-ther...

     Mills kneels and lifts the bottom of the sheet off the floor,
     finds an open shoebox.  On the box: TO THE DETECTIVES.

                                 MILLS
                   What's this?

     California leans close to Zero's gaunt, blindfolded face.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   You got what you deserved, Zero.

     Somerset leans down beside Mills.  Mills looks through the
     shoebox.  Inside are plastic, zip-lock bags.  One bag contains
     small clumps of hair, one contains a yellow liquid...

                                 MILLS
                   A urine sample... hair sample...
                   fingernail clippings.  He's laughing at
                   us.

     California is still close to Zero's face when suddenly Zero's
     lips twist.  Zero lets out a loud, guttural bark.  California
     jerks back in fear, shouting, falling over a chair.

     Mills and Somerset reel, standing.  They see California on the
     ground, scared out of his mind, pointing.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   He's alive!

     Mills and Somerset look towards the bed.

     Zero's lips move feebly as he lets out a sick, gurgling moan.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   He's still alive!


     EXT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING -- MORNING

     A crowd has gathered.  Mills' car, the police van and two
     ambulances are parked on the sidewalk.

     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, HALLWAY -- MORNING

     The siege cops are in the hall, holding neighbors at bay.

     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING

     Three ambulance attendants are at the bed, working on Zero.  One
     attendant uses wire-cutters to clip Zero's bonds.

     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- MORNING

     Mills and Somerset stand in the middle of one flight of stairs.
     They are both highly agitated.

                                 SOMERSET
                   The way this has gone, I didn't think it
                   was possible, but we may have
                   underestimated this guy.  The type of
                   intestinal fortitude it must take... to
                   keep a man bound for a full year.  To
                   sever his hand and use it to plant
                   fingerprints.

                                 MILLS
                   I want him bad.  I don't just want to
                   catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Listen... we have to divorce ourselves
                   from our emotions here.  We have to keep
                   focusing on the small details.

                                 MILLS
                   I don't know about you, Somerset, but I
                   feed off my emotions.

                                 SOMERSET
                   He'll string us along all the way if
                   we're not careful.

     Mills is looking at the floor, burning with anger.  Somerset
     grabs him by the jacket.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Are you listening to me?!

     Mills pushes Somerset's hand off.

                                 MILLS
                   I hear you.

     There is a sudden brilliant flash of light and the SOUND of a
     CAMERA ADVANCING.  Mills and Somerset look --

     Down the stairs, John is posing as a reporter.  He has his
     camera and flash up, pointed at the detectives.

                                 JOHN
                   Say cheese.

     He takes another picture, flashbulb flashing.  Mills charges
     downwards, grabs John by his wrinkled clothing.

                                 MILLS
                   What the fuck are you doing?

     John squirms, holds up a laminated PRESS identification pass.

                                 JOHN
                   I have a right, Officer.  I...

     Mills shoves him and John stumbles a few steps, then falls to
     the landing below with a thud.  His glasses fly off.

                                 MILLS
                   That doesn't mean anything.  This is a
                   closed crime scene now!

     Somerset steps down and pulls Mills back.  John stands.

                                 JOHN
                   You can't do this!  You can't...

                                 MILLS
                   Get the fuck out of here!

     John gets his glasses, scrambles downstairs, out of sight.

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                   The public has a right to know!

     Somerset yanks Mills harder, till Mills sits on the stairs.

                                 MILLS
                   How do those cockroaches get here so
                   quick?

                                 SOMERSET
                   They pay cops for the inside scoop, and
                   they pay well.  You can hate them, but
                   you better give them something, or
                   they'll make it all up.

                                 MILLS
                           (calming)
                   I'm sorry... I just...

                                 SOMERSET
                   Oh, it's alright.  It's always
                   impressive to see a man feeding off his
                   emotions.


     INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

     Mills stands with the blase DR. BEARDSLEY, who reviews a medical
     chart on a clipboard.  Zero lies inside an oxygen tent with
     tubes running into him.  The room is dark.

                                 BEARDSLEY
                   A year of immobility seems about right,
                   judging by the deterioration of the
                   muscles and spinal cord.  Blood tests
                   show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his
                   system.  Heroin... crack... even an
                   antibiotic which was administered to
                   keep the bed sores from infecting.

     Mills looks into the oxygen.

                                 MILLS
                   He hasn't said anything, or tried to
                   express himself in any way?

                                 BEARDSLEY
                   Even if his brain were not mush, which
                   it is... he chewed his own tongue off a
                   long time ago.

     Mills winces, moves away from the bed.

                                 MILLS
                   There's no way he'll survive?

                                 BEARDSLEY
                   Detective, he'd die right now of shock
                   if you were to shine a flashlight in his
                   eyes.


     EXT.  CITY STREET, CATHOLIC CHURCH -- AFTERNOON

     A tall church on a bustling street.  Smoggy air has eaten at the
     stonework.  The homeless are camped out on the stairs.

     INT.  CATHOLIC CHURCH, PRIEST'S QUARTERS -- AFTERNOON

     The priest's accommodations are quite spacious and comfortable.
     The parish's wealth is evident.  FATHER BLEEKER, 38, stands
     looking at several 8" by 10" glossies.  He's dressed in his
     "civilian" clothing, wears his hair short and proper.  These
     photos are making him heartsick.

     Bleeker hands them to Somerset who is seated by a fireplace.

                                 BLEEKER
                   Put them away.  I wish you hadn't
                   brought them into the church.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I needed for you to see them.

     Father Bleeker shakes his head, as if he were trying to forget
     the images.  Somerset replaces the murder photos in a file.

                                 BLEEKER
                   There were five principal phases in the
                   development of early Christian art.
                   From Hellenistic through the
                   Renaissance... each period was affected
                   by the decrees of religious leaders.

                                 SOMERSET
                   If this killer belongs to a certain
                   branch of the church... if he collects
                   religious art from a certain period, I
                   want to know.  I have to narrow it down.

     Bleeker walks to an ornate, gold cabinet.  He puts on a pair of
     cotton gloves.

                                 BLEEKER
                   The influences on these... things he's
                   done, couldn't have come before the
                   Gothic period.  What's in those pictures
                   is presented far too asymmetrically.

     Bleeker crosses himself before using a key to open the cabinet.
     He takes out an ancient devotional book and a piece of cloth.

                                 BLEEKER (CONT)
                   The colors will tell the tale.

     Bleeker takes the book to a table.  Somerset follows.  Bleeker
     lays the cloth under the book, opens the book, tenderly.

                                 BLEEKER (CONT)
                   Each sin had a symbolic color.  But the
                   specific color designations changed
                   throughout the ages.

     Somerset leans to examine Bleeker's illuminated manuscript:

     Two pages of prayer.  The prose is elaborately formed,
     surrounded by colorful illustrations of the seven deadly sins.
     Bleeker's finger points to a rendering of a man seated on a
     rock, guzzling from a jug.  It's been painted in orange.

                                 BLEEKER (O.S.,CONT)
                   This is an example.  Gluttony is the
                   sin, and the color is orange.  This
                   particular manuscript is preserved from
                   the 18th century.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   In the murders, gluttony is green.
                   Greed is yellow.  Sloth is indigo.

     Bleeker steps away and Somerset gets closer to the pages.

                                 BLEEKER
                   So, if this murderer is as precise as
                   you say, then you need to find out at
                   what period in history was gluttony
                   green... and so on.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where do I look?  If the colors changed
                   so often?

                                 BLEEKER
                           (contemplates)
                   There is one man... Father Stone.
                           (pause)
                   I haven't heard from him for quite some
                   time.  This was his passion.  He spent
                   his life studying the sins... and
                   preaching against them.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

     The chalkboard on the wall:  1 gluttony (x)       5 wrath
                                  2 greed (x)          6 pride

     Mills is behind his paperwork covered desk, listening to a
     uniformed OFFICER who looks over a report sheet.

                                 OFFICER
                   Zero's landlord said an envelope of cash
                   was in the office mailbox each month.
                   He says, quote, "I never heard a single
                   complaint from this guy and nobody ever
                   complained about him.  He's the best
                   tenant I ever had."

                                 MILLS
                   There's a landlord's dream tenant.  A
                   paralyzed man with no tongue.

                                 OFFICER
                   Who pays his rent on time.

                                 MILLS
                   Bring me everything as soon as it's
                   transcribed.

     The officer leaves.  Mills starts sorting through piles on his
     desk.  He doesn't know where to begin.

     He sits back in his chair, looks at the collage-like collection
     of pictures pinned on the walls: photos and diagrams of the
     murder scenes, the drawing of the sun and eye, color pages and
     black and white copies of pages from art books.

     He stares, thinking.  He stands, takes a photocopy off the wall.
     The killer's first note:

              Dear Detectives,
                   Long is the way, and hard, that out
                   of hell leads up to the light.

                                 MILLS
                           (to himself)
                   Milton.


     INT.  CENTRAL LIBRARY -- AFTERNOON

     Big brass lamps hang from the high ceiling.  Mahogany chairs and
     tables run down the center floor which is bordered by three
     levels of balconies.  People wander like ants in an ant farm.

     Mills walks, taking it all in.  He goes to the circulation desk.
     Impatient patrons wait in a long line.  He watches the bored
     HEAD LIBRARIAN, female, 64, help an old man at the desk.

     She opens the old man's books, runs a laser pen over a bar code
     sticker, pushes a few buttons on a computer.

     INT.  CENTRAL LIBRARY, TOP BALCONY -- LATER AFTERNOON

     Near the balcony railing, overlooking the main floor, Mills sits
     before a computer card catalog.  He reads the computer screen,
     unsure.  He sets down his pad and pencil, cracks his knuckles,
     begins typing on the keyboard.  The computer gives off a quiet
     BEEP.  Pleased, Mills reads the screen.  Types.

     On the screen:                 TITLE / PARADISE LOST_

     He hits return.  Reads the screen as information on the book
     appears.  He copies it on his pad, puts the pencil in his mouth.

     He types.  On the screen:      SUBJECT / JACK THE RIPPER_

     Hits return.  Again, he copies info from the screen.


     INT.  INNER CITY CLOISTER -- AFTERNOON

     A monk opens a formidable gateway door, letting Father Bleeker
     and Somerset into a garden courtyard.  Bleeker now wears his
     priestly garb and collar.  The monastery's main building looms
     at the end of a pathway.  The building is stately, ivy-covered.

                                 BLEEKER
                   Father Stone had a church and
                   congregation of his own.  But, he...
                   there were some problems.  The church is
                   deserted now.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Problems?

     Bleeker continues walking.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Father?

     INT.  INNER CITY CLOISTER, HALLWAY -- AFTERNOON

     The walls of the hallway are carved with images of saints.
     Bleeker whispers to Somerset beside a windowless door.

                                 BLEEKER
                   There was a small orphanage attached to
                   the church, overseen by Father Stone.
                   This was almost thirty years ago.
                           (hesitant)
                   He was an excellent priest, devoted in
                   every way.  Many in his parish demanded
                   his return.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Tell me what happened.

     Bleeker sees a NUN down the hall, coming towards them.

                                 BLEEKER
                   Allegations were made... Stone was
                   accused of abusing the children in his
                   care.  But, those charges were never
                   substantiated.

                                 SOMERSET
                   What abuse?

                                 BLEEKER
                   It was claimed... that the children were
                   beaten.  And, punished severely.

     The nun is too close for Bleeker to speak freely.

     INT.  INNER CITY CLOISTER, STONE'S ROOM -- AFTERNOON

     The door is unlocked and opened by the nun.  Somerset enters and
     Bleeker waits outside as the nun closes the door.  It's dark.

     FATHER STONE, 73, is in a wheelchair.  Feeble and frail, eyes
     sunken in their sockets.  He looks up at Somerset.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Father Stone.  I'm a policeman.  I'd
                   like to ask you a few questions, if it's
                   alright?

     The whites of Stone's eyes have yellowed.  He seems to nod.
     Somerset sits on a stool, close.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I want to ask you about the seven deadly
                   sins.

                                 STONE
                   The sins.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Yes, father.

     Stone reaches out a hand to touch Somerset's face.  Stone's
     extremely long fingernails trail against Somerset's cheek and
     Somerset tries to hide his revulsion.

                                 STONE
                   Are you one of mine?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I don't...

                                 STONE
                   Are you saved?  Do you have God?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I... I need to ask about the sins.  Do
                   you understand what I'm saying?

     Stone takes his hand away, seems to be getting angry.

                                 STONE
                   Are you a sinner?

     Stone's weak arms wheel him away, towards a corner.

                                 STONE (CONT)
                   There are sinners here.  Even here.
                   And, pain waits for them.  Hell is
                   hungry for them.

     Stone bites his lip, moaning, disoriented.

                                 STONE (CONT)
                   They don't realize... they don't know.
                           (pause)
                   Fuck them all!

     Somerset is shocked by the strength and volume of Stone's jagged
     voice.  The nun goes to place a comforting hand on Stone's
     shoulder.  Stone is beginning to cry.

                                 NUN
                           (to Somerset)
                   They shouldn't have let you disturb him.
                   This shouldn't have been allowed.

                                 STONE
                   Where are the children?
                           (much louder)
                   Where are the children?!


     INT.  CENTRAL LIBRARY, OUTSIDE LIBRARIAN'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

     From a mahogany hallway lined with book-carts, we look THROUGH a
     big WINDOW into the head librarian's office.  The elderly head
     librarian is at a computer, chain-smoking, working the keyboard.
     Mills alternates talking on the telephone and reading things off
     his pad to the librarian.

     We cannot hear them, but it's clear Mills is excited as he walks
     back and forth, hovering over the librarian, looking at her
     computer screen, making suggestions, then walking to monitor a
     dot-matrix printer which spews a waterfall of computer paper
     onto the floor.  Back and forth goes Mills, carrying the phone.
     He closes the pad, puts it in his pocket.

     The librarian finishes typing, sits back, done.  Mills hangs up
     the phone, goes to put it on the librarian's desk, but the cord
     drags, knocks a pile of books off a table.

     The librarian is irritated, goes to pick up the books.  Mills is
     apologizing.  He goes to watch the printer.  He tears the last
     sheet's perforated edge, gathers the huge pile of printed paper
     off the floor.

     Prize in hand, Mills is so grateful he bends to give the old
     woman a kiss on the cheek, but she pushes him away, now even
     more annoyed.  Mills goes to leave, knocks over another pile of
     books.  Before he can assist, the angry librarian points to the
     door.  Mills obeys like a scolded child, exits.

     The librarian shakes her head in disgust.


     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- AFTERNOON

     A once exemplary church, now boarded up, neglected.  Gothic in
     style, it stands with deserted brownstones and empty lots of
     rubble as neighbors.  Smokestacks spew smoke distantly.  Cars
     and trucks drive by on a nearby elevated highway, but down here
     on the street it's a ghost town.

     There's a building attached to the rear of the church.
     Somerset's car is parked beside it.

     INT.  ABANDONED ORPHANAGE, CLASSROOM -- AFTERNOON

     The windows are covered over.  Somerset and Father Bleeker move
     through.  Somerset has a flashlight with a wide beam.  The room
     is empty except for broken, cob-web covered school desks and a
     few file cabinets.  There are cracked blackboards on the walls.
     Rats skitter away from the light.

     Somerset opens a file cabinet drawer.  It's empty.  He walks to
     a door, starts pulling at the rotting boards which seal it shut.

                                 BLEEKER
                   What are you looking for?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm just looking.

     INT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- AFTERNOON

     Somerset pushes the door.  He and Bleeker enter from the
     classroom into the far back corner of the church.  Big church.
     Shafts of colored light needle through the holes in the pieces
     of wood and cloth that cover the broken stained glass windows.

     Somerset walks down the center aisle between deteriorated pews.
     rats run.  Pigeons flap about, dirt drifting off their wings.

     Somerset shines his flashlight forward to the rather barren
     altar.  To the right, at the top of the altar stairs, there is a
     stone statue of a saint with his arms outstretched, welcoming.

     The life-size saint is covered in spider-webs.  Tiny spiders
     crawl across his eyes, which look down on Somerset.

                                 BLEEKER
                   Saint Jerome Emiliani.  The patron saint
                   of orphans.

     Somerset shines the flashlight against the back altar wall,
     revealing a wooden carving of Christ crucified.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Is this still the Lord's house?

                                 BLEEKER
                   Of course it is.

                                 SOMERSET
                   And, even if Father Stone was guilty of
                   everything... if he was hurting children
                   here?  It's still the Lord's house?

     Father Bleeker finds this talk insulting and offensive.

                                 BLEEKER
                   You have no faith, Somerset?  Have you
                   given up on the church entirely?

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.
                           (pause)
                   That's not what I've given up on.

     Somerset notices two ends of a thick rope suspended from the
     ceiling above the center of the altar.  He looks up, following
     the rope with the flashlight, when he notices something else.
     His mouth drops.  Bleeker looks, and is equally horrified.

     Above them, in the beam of light: seven large paintings on
     panels tilted forward at the curve of the ceiling above the
     altar.  Seven ancient paintings; seven deadly sins.

     The beam of light moves to the panel to the immediate right: a
     painting of a man kneeling, grasping at gold coins all around
     him.  The man is naked, as was the victim of the greed murder.
     The chief color in this panel is a vulgar yellow.

     The third in the series is sloth.  The painting, in indigo,
     shows a man at rest in a pliant bed.  The skeletal man's eyes
     are rolled up in their sockets.  He is covered in slimy worms.


     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON

     The streets are full of patrol cars.  Cops and forensics enter
     and exit the church from various doorways.  Saw-horses are
     loaded off a flat-bed truck as a police barricade is erected.

     INT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Much activity, as forensics with flashlights go about their
     business, checking every nook and cranny of the church, looking
     for any sign that someone's been here recently.  Small temporary
     floodlights are hoisted on tripods.

     Two photographers stand at the tops of tall ladders.  Flash-
     photo after flash-photo is taken of the seven paneled tableau.

     Near the open church doors, Mills speaks with great animation,
     holding his ream of computer paper.  Somerset looks at the altar
     and the tableau, preoccupied.

                                 MILLS
                   Our guy's a bookworm, right?  And, I
                   know it's a long shot, but you have to
                   give a picture id and current phone bill
                   to get a library card.  Hey...

     Mills snaps his fingers in Somerset's face, gets his attention.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   I made two separate lists of books.  One
                   relating to the sins... Dante's
                   Purgatory, Canterbury Tales... The
                   Dictionary of Catholicism... all the
                   religious stuff.  The second list was
                   books about torture methods, mass
                   murderers... sadomasochism.  Whatever
                   our killer might study to do the things
                   he's done.  Whatever his other interests
                   are.

     Somerset takes the computer list.

                                 SOMERSET
                   So, what is this?

                                 MILLS
                   Alright.  Everything at the library goes
                   into a computer.  So, you can get in the
                   system and cross-reference...

     Mills fumbles in his pocket, takes out his pad and reads.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Let's say you take, Dante's Purgatory,
                   call number eight-five-one-D, and... The
                   Biography of the Marquis de Sade,
                   ninety-two S-A-D-E.  Put those books in
                   the system, and the computer can give
                   you the name of anyone who's ever taken
                   out both those books.  And, it doesn't
                   just give you their name and address, it
                   gives you a complete history of their
                   library reading habits.

     Mills slaps the list in Somerset's hand.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                           (psyched up)
                   If somebody's out there reading Paradise
                   Lost and studying The Life and Times of
                   Charlie Manson, I want to talk to them.

     Somerset looks up from the list, warming to it.  He starts
     looking around, searching for someone.

     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Somerset and Mills exit down the stairs.  Somerset's still
     searching, holding the list.  He spies a uniformed cop, DARIO.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Dario!  Come here.

     Dario runs up.  Somerset puts his hand on his shoulder and makes
     him walk with him.  Mills continues on to his car.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   According to the Father, this orphanage
                   wasn't around for more than five or six
                   years in the late fifties.  So, I want
                   someone to go to the Department of Child
                   Welfare or City Hall and dig up all the
                   records on this place.  Understand?

                                 DARIO
                   I got it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Get a list of every child who attended
                   this orphanage before it shut down.  Get
                   it on my desk within the hour.

     Somerset releases Dario, who runs to obey.  Somerset goes to his
     own car.  Mills is driving to leave, stops, revs the engine.
     Somerset hands the computer list through the window.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   You thought of this all by yourself?
                   This was your brainstorm?

                                 MILLS
                   Yeah.  Is that so hard for you to
                   believe?

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's a pleasant surprise.

                                 MILLS
                   I'm not as stupid as I look.

     Mills peels away.  Somerset heads to his own car.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (to himself)
                   I guess not.


     INT.  SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING

     Seven large photos hang with the other materials on the wall:

     The seven tableau paintings.  Gluttony, greed and sloth,
     followed by vanity.  Vanity shows a woman standing in front of a
     mirror, staring at her image.  The floor around her is scattered
     with flowers.  The primary color is violet, and as in all the
     paintings, there is a quality of ugliness in the character.

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Ramirez.  Manuel Ramirez.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   No... I don't see any Ramirez.

     The lust painting is next.  It shows a man standing over a
     woman.  The woman is nude, under a sheet, and the man's features
     are bizarre, lecherous.  He wants that woman.  There are apples
     on the floor and on the bed.  The color is red.

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Elinski.  Dennis Elinski.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   No.

     Envy is particularly gruesome.  The Devil is seen hovering in
     the air, wearing a crown, his body orange and slick, wrapped in
     a cloak of flames.  His arms held high, his right hand grips a
     sword, a bolt of lightning, arrows, wheat, thistles, etc.  His
     left hand, holds a plain globe around which a serpent has
     wrapped itself.  He looks down at several pitiful mortals in a
     pit of fire.  The mortals reach for him, yearn for him, the skin
     on their bodies is stretched taut over their bones.

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Atwater?  Paul Atwater.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   No.

     Wrath shows a man surrounded by vaporous, satanic demons.  He
     stands in a puddle of blood, looking at his hands stained with
     and dripping blood.  Other than the rich red, the color is blue.

     Mills is at his desk, a good portion of the print-out list
     draped to the floor.  He rubs his eyes, sighing, gets back to
     it.  Somerset, at the temporary desk, studies his orphan list.

                                 MILLS
                   Okay, here we go.  Listen to the books
                   this guy's been taking out...
                           (reading list)
                   Basic Homicide Investigation.  Forensic
                   Toxicology... The Encyclopedia of Modern
                   Serial Killers...
                           (looks up, excited)
                   Of Human Bondage.

                                 SOMERSET
                   That's not what you think it is.

     Mills is disappointed, runs his finger further down the page.

                                 MILLS
                   Holy shit.  Somerset...
                           (reading list)
                   The Writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas.

     Mills points to the drawing of "the Sun in splendor with the
     eye" which hangs on the wall.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Aquinas.  Right?

                                 SOMERSET
                   That's right.  Let me have it.

     Mills looks at the page... searching...

                                 MILLS
                   Fuck... he used a false name.

                                 SOMERSET
                   How do you know?

                                 MILLS
                   His library card lists him as Jonathan
                   Doe.  John Doe.

     Mills sits back, angry.  Something strikes Somerset as odd.
     Familiar.  He starts leafing quickly through the orphanage list.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What?

     Somerset finds what he's looking for.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Christ... it's like a sick joke.

                                 MILLS
                   What are you talking about?

                                 SOMERSET
                   There is one boy here.  He was
                   abandoned... no one knew who his
                   parents were, so he was named at the
                   orphanage...
                           (looks at Mills)
                   John Doe.  It's his legal name.


     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- EARLY EVENING

     Somerset and Mills climb stairs, turn a corner into this hall.

                                 MILLS
                   It's impossible odds that this is him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   We're focusing.

                                 MILLS
                   I know, I know.  On one little thing.
                   I'm not complaining.  I'll follow
                   anything we get and I'll take it any way
                   we can get it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   We'll look at him.  Ask a few questions.
                   Try to get a feeling whether we should
                   keep tabs on him.

     They reach a door, apartment 3A.  Somerset knocks.  Mills takes
     out his gun and looks at Somerset to ask "what do you think?"
     Somerset nods that he should have the gun ready.  Mills steps to
     the side of the door, knocks hard.  Waits.

                                 MILLS
                           (quietly)
                   I'll do the talking, right?  Let me
                   practice here... um, excuse me Mr. Doe,
                   but, are you by any chance a serial
                   killer?  Oh... oh, you are?  Well, come
                   with us then, if you don't mind.

     Mills smiles at his own wit.  A STAIR is HEARD CREAKING
     offscreen.  Mills turns to look towards the stairs.

     A MALE FIGURE stands at the top of the stairs, wearing a hat,
     standing in shadows.  The man looks at them, lets out a scream
     of horror and reaches into his coat.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Somerset!

     GUNFIRE SOUNDS and a bullet slams into door 3A behind Mills.  He
     and Somerset recoil in shock, going to the floor as another
     bullet explodes, blasting plaster off the wall.  The man is
     HEARD RUNNING back down the stairs.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   It's him!  Jesus Christ, we can get this
                   fucker!

     Mills jumps up.  He moves towards the railing.  Somerset sits up
     and takes out his own gun.  The stairwell is silent.

     Mills peers over the railing into the stairwell's center, gun
     pointed.  A HEAVY METALLIC CLICK is HEARD.  Echoes.  Mills leaps
     backwards as bullets begin raining up from below, accompanied by
     the SOUND of an UZI SUB-MACHINE GUN FIRING.

     Somerset lays flat as he and Mills crawl away from the railing,
     which is being shredded along with the floor around it.  Bullets
     soar unceasingly.  Mills and Somerset hold their hands over
     their ears.  Pieces of wood and plaster fly everywhere.  The uzi
     stops and the man can be HEARD RUNNING again.

     Mills gets up, covered in debris.  He runs down into the smoky
     stairwell.  Somerset rolls over, gets up more slowly.

     EXT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, REAR -- EARLY EVENING

     Mills rushes out into this weedy, overgrown courtyard.  He sees
     a thin vagrant sleeping on the building's junk-pile, then looks
     all directions.  His eyes are wild.  His gun hand is shaking.

     The courtyard is surrounded by alleyways.  The shooter could
     have gone anywhere and is nowhere in sight.  Somerset comes out,
     face wet with sweat.  Mills holsters his gun.

                                 MILLS
                   Are you alright?  Are you okay?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Yeah.  I think so.

     They look at each other for a long time.  Both realizing they
     came very close to dying.

     EXT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, FRONT -- NIGHT

     Police cars on scene.  Curious civilians have gathered.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

     UP THE STAIRWELL, several forensics are collecting shell
     casings, putting them in bags.  The casings are scattered all
     the way up the stairs.  ONE FORENSIC walks up beside a COP.

                                 ONE FORENSIC
                   I hear he's running around with an uzi
                   in one hand and a book of poetry in the
                   other.

                                 COP
                   A real, modern-day renaissance man, huh?

     AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, two forensics, SARAH and BILLY, wait
     behind Mills and Somerset.  Surgical gloves on all hands.  Mills
     kicks at the door to apartment 3A with all his might.  Again.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOMONE -- NIGHT

     BOOM -- door flies open.  Mills enters with Somerset.  Darkness.

                                 MILLS
                           (to forensics)
                   Give us first crack at it.

     Sarah and Billy wait in the hall.  Somerset hits a switch on the
     wall and a lamp illuminates on a desk.  The desk is in the
     center of the room, facing them.  The walls, floor to ceiling,
     are covered with visual stimuli; pictures, paintings, newspaper
     articles, sketches, writings on napkins and notebook sheets,
     etc.  Mostly religious images.

     The far wall is made of shelves full of books.  Mills goes to
     the desk while Somerset goes to the books.  Books: An Overview
     of Theology, Handbook of Firearms, A History of the World, Summa
     Theologica, U.S. Criminal Law Review, etc.

     Mills looks at the desktop.  The surface is marked by dried oil
     colors.  There are tubes of paint laying out, boxes of water
     colors and pastels.  Mills looks at one corner of the desk.  An
     orange candle has been allowed to burn down.  The wax trail goes
     all the way down the edge of the desk to a puddle on the floor.

     Somerset walks, studying one wall of pin-ups.  There are
     articles about the seven deadly sins, pages from art books,
     pencil drawings of Satan and Christ, and drawings of the seven
     paneled tableau paintings which inspired the murders.  Somerset
     lifts several sheets to note the paper scraps are spaced so
     tightly and completely that they cover the window.

     At the desk, Mills opens the top middle drawer.  It's empty
     except for The Holy Bible.  he opens another drawer, which is
     filled with at least forty empty aspirin bottles.

     Somerset looks at a door which is papered over by all the
     newspaper articles and photographs about the seven deadly sin
     murders.  He opens the door --

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO -- NIGHT

     Somerset enters.  The ceiling light is on.  There are
     bookshelves on each wall, filled with thousands of notebooks.

     Somerset takes one notebook down.  It is a thick composition
     book with a marbled black and white cover.  Inside, the pages
     are covered in small handwritten sentences and drawings.

     Somerset takes down another notebook and opens it.  Same as the
     first; scribbled sentences and sketches.

     He walks to another wall, pulls another notebook.  Same deal.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Jesus Christ.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM ONE -- NIGHT

     Mills opens a final drawer to find a rosary and a revolver.

     He looks around, nervous and excited, being in the murderer's
     lair.  He goes to a closed door across the room, notices John
     Doe's bed in the corner.  Sees Doe has a cross nailed to the
     ceiling directly above the bed's pillow.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- NIGHT

     Mills enters the bathroom.  It has been converted into a
     darkroom, lit by red bulbs, with strips of film hanging from the
     ceiling.  WATER is HEARD DRIPPING.

     Mills opens the shower curtain.  Prints hang drying, clipped to
     wires over the tub.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, THE PAINTROOM -- NIGHT

     Somerset enters from the room of notebooks.  This is John Doe's
     art studio.  Windowless, with several easels holding paintings
     in various states of completion.  The walls are covered with
     photos and finished canvases, except for one wall which is blank
     white.  Somerset turns the lights off.

     There is a 16mm film projector on a table, facing the blank
     wall.  Somerset turns the projector on.  It clatters to life,
     running a piece of film.

     The film is spliced into a non-stop loop. Somerset watches the
     wall, light strobing across him.

     The projector shows an image of clouds drifting, with strange,
     superimposed angels in flowing robes floating jerkily.  It's
     like an old, Hollywood version of heaven.

     The image switches abruptly to fire and tormented souls laboring
     around a pit of molten goo.  Like Heaven, it's a scratched piece
     of film from Hollywood's early days.

     Somerset turns to examine one of the paintings on an easel.  The
     painting has been skillfully rendered, in small, controlled
     brush strokes.  It shows a modern city street, stylized, dark.
     The city is peopled by mutated humans and freakish beasts.
     Sinners in the streets, killing, raping, pillaging.  Buildings
     are burning, blood is being spilled.  It's dense with detail.

     Somerset walks to another painting which is covered by a drop
     cloth.  He removes the cloth, uncovers a huge canvas.  We do not
     see the painting, but when Somerset does his features turn grim.

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Somerset!

     Mills enters, tormented, weary.  He stands in the projector's
     bright beam, holds an 8" by 10" print.

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Somerset, we had him.  Goddamn it.

     He hands a press pass and the photo to Somerset.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   The pass is a fake... we had him.

     Somerset looks at the photo, a picture of Mills and Somerset on
     the stairwell of the slum apartment building; the picture John
     took when he posed as a reporter.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   We were that close to him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I know.

     Somerset motions to the huge canvas.  Mills looks:

     The painting is frightening collage, thick with paint.  The
     photo of Mills and Somerset has been incorporated in bits and
     pieces.  Duplicate images: enlarged eyes, hands, faces.  The
     faces have been ripped, scratched, mutilated.  Grainy eyes with
     holes jabbed in them are mounted in paint beside chopped broken
     arms.  Mills' head is on Somerset's body, and vice versa.  It's
     like a sick, fragmented vision of a slaughter house floor.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS -- NIGHT

     A block of burnt-out row homes and warehouses.  Stray, wild dogs
     roam in a pack.  A car turns down this street.  It's John Doe's
     car, moving fast.  Its headlights go out and it cruises,
     avoiding garbage cans in the street.

     FOLLOW the dark car.  Ahead, a few blocks away, we can see the
     only lights in this neighborhood, the flashing reds, whites and
     blues of police activity.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S CAR -- NIGHT

     John Doe brings the car to a stop.  He watches the police at
     work around the abandoned church.  He gives no discernable
     reaction, puts the car in reverse.  He looks behind as he drives
     back the way he came.


     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     The refrigerator door is open.  A male forensic uses tongs to
     remove Zero's severed hand from behind soda cans and mayonnaise.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM ONE -- NIGHT

     The forensic walks through with the hand in a clear plastic bag,
     past a FEMALE SKETCH ARTIST who puts the finishing touches on a
     fairly accurate drawing of the balding John Doe.

                                 SKETCH ARTIST
                   This is the guy?

     Mills stands over the artist.  Sarah, Billy and two deputy
     detectives are at work in the room, photographing, searching.

                                 MILLS
                   Make sure it gets around.

                                 SKETCH ARTIST
                   You got it.  Tomorrow morning, this
                   city's good citizens will be on the
                   lookout for Elmer Fudd.

                                 SARAH
                           (to Mills)
                   We can't find anything to hang onto.  No
                   pay-stubs, no appointment books or
                   calendars.  Not even a book of phone
                   numbers.  And, you're not going to
                   believe this...

                                 MILLS
                   Keep looking.

                                 SARA
                   It's just... we haven't found any
                   fingerprints yet.  Not one.

                                 MILLS
                   You know, you're right.  I don't believe
                   it.  Keep looking.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO -- NIGHT

     Somerset reads one of Doe's notebooks.  Three cops are looking
     through other notebooks from the shelves.  Mills enters.

                                 SOMERSET
                   We need to put more men on this.

                                 MILLS
                   I'm working on it, alright.  What have
                   we got.

     Somerset bristles slightly at Mills' abrupt demeanor.

                                 SOMERSET
                   We've got about five thousand notebooks
                   in this room.  And, as near as I can
                   tell, each notebook contains two hundred
                   and fifty pages.

                                 MILLS
                   Then, he must write about the murders.

     Somerset looks at the notebook, reads.

                                 SOMERSET
                   "What sick, silly puppets we are, and
                   what a gross stage we dance on.  What
                   fun we have, dancing around, not a care
                   in the world.  Not knowing that we are
                   nothing.  We are not what God intended."
                           (turns pages)
                   "On the subway today, a man came up to
                   start a conversation.  He was making
                   small talk, this lonely man, talking
                   about the weather and other things.  I
                   tried to be accommodating, but my head
                   began to hurt from his banality.  I
                   almost didn't notice it had happened,
                   but I threw up all over him.  And I
                   couldn't stop myself from laughing."
                           (closes book)
                   No dates indicated.  They're placed on
                   the shelves in no discernible order.  He
                   describes a scab on his arm for five
                   pages, then writes about existential
                   philosophy on the next.

     Mills walks.  He looks into the adjoining paint room.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   It's just his mind poured out on paper.

     Mills leans in the doorway, looking at Doe's strange artworks.

                                 MILLS
                   You were right.  He is preaching.

     The PHONE RINGS in the other room.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT

     All attention is focused on the phone on Doe's desk.  A tape
     recorder is rigged to the receiver.  Mills and Somerset enter.
     Mills walks over, pushes a button on the recorder, picks up.

                                 MILLS
                           (into phone)
                   Hello... hello?

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)
                           (from recorder)
                   I admire you, David.  Imagine my
                   surprise on finding you at my doorstep.
                   I admire you more and more every day.

                                 MILLS
                           (into phone)
                   Okay, John.  Let's...

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)
                           (from recorder)
                   No, no, no!  You listen and don't talk.
                   I suppose you found the painting and the
                   photos.  This is just as well.  Now we
                   all know we've all seen each other.
                           (pause)
                   I mean what I say.  I do admire you.

     Long pause.  Mills waits.

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.,CONT)
                   Oh, there is one other thing.  Fourteen
                   hundred thirty.  West Eighty-sixth
                   street.  Apartment six-o-four.

     John Doe hangs up.


     INT.  APARTMENT 604, BATHROOM -- NIGHT

     Somerset looks around this femininely decorated bathroom.

     In the sink, objects covered in blood: a pair of scissors, a
     hypodermic needle, first-aid tape and gauze bandages, a bottle
     of anesthetic for use with the needle, a straight razor.

     Somerset moves from the sink, looks in the bathtub.  The tub and
     shower walls are splattered with blood.  The tub has a few
     inches of water in it.  The water is cloudy red and bits of
     gauze float in it.  Somerset jiggles the drain's knob.

     Some bubbles pop up from the clogged drain.

     INT.  APARTMENT 604 -- NIGHT

     Mills is in a dark mood.  He and Dr. O'Neill stand by a WOMAN
     who hangs by a noose from the ceiling.  The woman's head has
     been bandaged sloppily with white gauze and tape.  Her eyes have
     been left uncovered.  The gauze is stained red in small spots.

     The woman hangs low, so her feet are inches from the floor where
     piles of dried flowers and a cordless telephone lay.  There's a
     chair knocked over behind her.

     O'Neill's going through his black bag.  A violet, velvet curtain
     has been draped on the wall in the corner, behind a full length
     mirror.  The mirror reflects the corpse.  A seven-pointed star
     is smeared in lipstick on the mirror's surface, with the words I
     DID NOT KILL HER, SHE WAS GIVEN A CHOICE below.

     Somerset enters from the bathroom, looks at the murder display.

                                 MILLS
                   Pride.  Just like in the painting.

     Somerset nods.  He walks to a dresser.  The woman's purse sits
     open and Somerset extracts her driver's license.  He looks at
     the photo.  The woman in the picture is beautiful.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You can see what he did.

     O'Neill steps up to the woman.  He brandishes dull scissors.
     The captain enters with two uniform cops.  He looks around,
     grim, clenching his jaw.

                                 MILLS
                   Cut her up... dressed the wounds.  He
                   put the noose around her neck and stood
                   her on the chair.

                                 SOMERSET
                   She had the telephone.

                                 MILLS
                   Call for help, and you'll live.  But,
                   you'll be mutilated.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Or, kick out the chair, and spare
                   yourself a lifetime of hideousness.

     O'Neill's cutting the bandages on the woman's face.  He pulls
     them away in front.  Mills looks, disgusted by the sight.

     Somerset sits in a chair, runs his fingers through his hair.

                                 O'NEILL
                   He cut off her nose to spite her face.
                   And he did it very recently.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Alright, boys, you're running on empty.
                   Go home.  Just make sure you sleep with
                   the phone between your knees.


     INT.  BOOKSTORE -- NIGHT

     The bookstore is a labyrinth.  Tables and shelves, mountains and
     valleys of books.  Books, new and used, hard and soft, in
     disorganized groups.  CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS.  A few customers
     search for titles.

     Somerset walks, downcast, winds out of one aisle into another.
     he has his jacket over his shoulder, runs his fingers along the
     books as he goes.  He pulls one book, The Merchant of Venice,
     looks at it, replaces it.  He looks down the aisle and is
     surprised to see Tracy.

     Tracy stands solemn, scanning book spines.  Somerset approaches.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Tracy?

     Tracy brightens a bit upon recognizing him.

                                 TRACY
                   Somerset.  How are you?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm alright.  I'm glad to see you found
                   this place.  I almost should have
                   expected to run into you here, knowing
                   that you teach English.

     Tracy looks up and around.

                                 TRACY
                   It's so huge.  It's amazing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   This is why I moved into this
                   neighborhood.

                                 TRACY
                   Don't you love the smell of all the old
                   books.  It smells like... like... I
                   guess just old books, but, I love it.

     Somerset notices Tracy noticing his gun.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   Forgive me.  No matter how often I see
                   guns, I can't get used to them.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Same here.

     Tracy laughs.  She looks at her watch.

                                 TRACY
                   If David's going to be back home soon, I
                   should get back.

     She starts down the aisle and Somerset walks with her.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   I hope you'll come to dinner another
                   night.  Before you leave.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You can stay and browse a little longer,
                   can't you?  I mean...

     Tracy considers this as they enter an open area.

                                  SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I... I hardly know anyone I can talk
                   about books with anymore.  I'd
                   appreciate the company.

     Tracy stops.  Somerset looks hopeful.  Tracy is very tempted.

     INT.  BOOKSTORE -- LATER NIGHT

     Shelves and empty aisles of books.  CLASSICAL MUSIC still PLAYS.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   The irony is, that after a day of the
                   type of work he did, he'd come home and
                   read me these morbid crime stories.  Le
                   Fanu's Green Tea.  Murders in the Rue
                   Morgue.

     MOVE TO the aisle marked MYSTERY, where Somerset and Tracy are
     leaning against shelves.  They both hold books they've selected.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   My mother would give him hell... because
                   I was young, and he was keeping me up
                   till all hours, giving me nightmares.

                                 TRACY
                   Sounds like a father who wanted his son
                   to follow in his footsteps.

                                 SOMERSET
                   One birthday, he gave me a hardcover
                   book called The Century of the
                   Detective, by Jurgen Thorwald.  It
                   traced the history of detection as a
                   science and it sealed my fate.  Because
                   it was real, and that a drop of blood or
                   a piece of hair could solve a crime...
                   was incredible to me.

     A CLERK looks down the aisle, then walks on.

                                 CLERK (O.S.)
                   We're closing up, Somerset.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Okay, thanks.

                                 TRACY
                   David's going to wonder where I am.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'll give you a ride.

                                 TRACY
                   No.  Please, don't bother.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I have to insist.  If your husband found
                   out I let you ride the subway at this
                   hour he'd tear my head off.

     They make their way out of the aisle.  Somerset chuckles.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I mean, literally.


     EXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT

     Somerset's car stops at the corner of Mills' street.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset puts the car in park.  Tracy sits for a long time, then
     turns to face Somerset.

                                 TRACY
                   You've lived here for so long, Somerset.
                   You know this city.  I...

     Tracy can't quite figure how to put it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's a hard place, Tracy.

                                 TRACY
                   When David and I lived in Philadelphia,
                   we could afford to live on the
                   outskirts.  But now...
                           (pause)
                   I hate it here.  I feel scared, and I
                   feel sick and... I hate it.

     Tracy wants to laugh, like it's silly, but can't pull it off.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You have to put blinders on sometimes.
                   Most times.  But, keep in mind, Tracy,
                   like tonight, there are small pockets of
                   sanity.  Some bars and bookstores.
                   Museums.  Several last vestiges of
                   civilization.

     EXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT

     In Somerset's car, Tracy and Somerset continue talking.

     On the other side of the street, closer to the middle of the
     block, John Doe's car is parallel parked at the curb.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Behind the wheel, John Doe is slumped low, calmly watching
     Somerset and Tracy.  He can see them clearly from here.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Tracy looks out through the windshield, fighting tears.

                                 TRACY
                   I've visited so many of the schools,
                   looking for work, you know.  And, the
                   conditions are... horrible.  I can't
                   believe how bad it is.
                           (pause)
                   Children shouldn't have to grow up here.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You can always look into the private
                   schools.  You'll find something.

     Somerset gives her a handkerchief.  She wipes her tears.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   You're too hard on yourself, Tracy.

     She will not look at him, keeping herself under control.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   It's okay to hate this city.  It's
                   natural.  But, there is a bright side in
                   all this.  There is.  You want to hear
                   it?

     Tracy is able to muster a small smile.

                                 TRACY
                   Oh, God, yes.  Please.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I can't think of another place that
                   needs education more than this city.
                   And you're a teacher.  You can make a
                   difference in a few people's lives.
                   It's a very good thing.

     Tracy leans to give him a kiss on the cheek.

                                 TRACY
                   Goodnight, Somerset.

     They remain close, looking into each other's eyes.

                                 SOMERSET
                  Goodnight.

     Somerset reaches to touch Tracy's face.  They kiss.  They kiss a
     long time.  Tracy wraps her arms around Somerset's neck.
     Somerset runs his fingers through Tracy's hair.  They share
     their sorrow.  Tracy's tears run down her face.  Finally, they
     part, opening their eyes.

     They know this is wrong.  Somerset's hands are shaking.  He
     grips the wheel, feels helpless.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I'm sorry, Tracy.  I'm sorry.

     Tracy's face is flushed.  She is confused.

                                 TRACY
                   I... I better go.

     Tracy gets out, neglects to close the door, not looking back.

     Somerset tries to come to his senses.  He doesn't understand
     either, and his heart is aching.  He adjusts the rearview mirror
     to watch Tracy go.

     INSERT -- THROUGH REARVIEW MIRROR -- SOMERSET'S P.O.V.

     Tracy walks down the block, straightening her hair.  She runs.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset looks away from the mirror.  he holds his head in his
     hands for a moment.

     EXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT

     Somerset leans to pull the door shut, puts the car in gear.
     He drives, turns the corner.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S CAR -- NIGHT

     John Doe watches Somerset's car leave.  Doe turns his attention
     to Tracy, who hurries along the other side of the street.  Tracy
     looks back, enters her apartment building, digs out her keys.
     She gets through the door and climbs stairs, disappearing.

     EXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT

     Doe gets out of his car.

     He looks both ways down the street, walks towards Mills' and
     Tracy's building.


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Mills and Tracy are asleep in their bed.  Mills' eyes shift
     under their lids.  Rapid eye movement.

     A SOUND is HEARD from the other room.  Mills awakens.  He lays
     still a moment, then gets up, slowly, reaches to take his gun
     off the bedside table.  He grabs his pants from a chair, slides
     into them.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT

     Mills opens the bedroom door and enters quietly, gun held up.
     He moves, crouching.

     In the dark, objects in the room and shadows from windows form
     complex, confusing patterns.

     Mills walks between moving boxes, attempting to remain silent.
     He aims the gun from point to point as he advances.

     He gets to a closet.  Staying on one side, he opens the door and
     points his gun.  He carefully separates the clothing hanging
     there.  Nothing.  No one.

     He turns to look over the room.  It's the first time we see it
     in Mills' eyes -- real fear.

     The door to the apartment is wide open.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Mills moves from his apartment, gun out, into the dark hallway.
     The coast is clear.  He stays low, moves down the hall.  He
     stops, looks up.

     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

     Mills shoves the rooftop door open.  It creaks as it swings.

     Mills moves out, backwards, looking to top the raised rooftop
     entrance, covering it with his gun.  He moves around, sees
     nothing, walks to the edge of the roof and looks over.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Mills returns to the bedroom, still holding his gun up.  He
     looks at Tracy asleep in the bed.  The room begins to RATTLE a
     little as a subway train is again passing underground.

     He walks to the window and checks the lock.  He halts.  He opens
     the window and reaches out.  The rattling is a bit LOUDER.

     From the fire escape, he picks up a bundle of thorny thistles
     wrapped with a rubber band.  Mills realizes, Doe was here.


     INT.  SAFE HOUSE -- NIGHT

     The room is plain, like the room Mrs. Gold was kept in.  The
     door opens and Tracy and Mills enter.  They look sleepy,
     carrying suitcases.  A uniformed cop closes the door for them.

     Mills goes to lay a suitcase on a table while Tracy looks
     around, depressed, distant.  The lighting is bad.  There are no
     decorations, no windows.  A wide crack runs down one wall.

     Tracy sits down on the bed.  Mills notices her discontent.

                                 MILLS
                   It won't be for long, honey.  I swear.
                   This is just till this is over.

                                 TRACY
                   I know.

     Mills goes to sit beside her.  He puts his hand on her shoulder.

                                 MILLS
                   I'm sorry.

     Tracy nods.  She stands, goes to start turning down the covers.

                                 TRACY
                   I know.  It can't be helped.

     Mills feels useless, powerless.  He goes to the suitcase and
     starts unpacking the contents.  Tracy continues turning down the
     sheets.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     SATURDAY

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- EARLY MORNING

     The chalkboard:            1 gluttony (x)      5 lust
                                2 greed (x)         6 envy
                                3 sloth (x)         7 wrath
                                4 pride (x)

     Somerset is seated, holding the photo of the lust painting from
     the tableau.  Mills is behind his own desk.  They both look like
     they haven't gotten much sleep.

                                 MILLS
                   There's two people in that painting.
                   So, maybe he's planning to kill two
                   people this time.  Maybe.

     Mills looks at Somerset, who doesn't seem to be listening.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What's wrong this morning?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Nothing.  Sorry.

     Somerset looks up, sips from a cup of coffee, looks at the
     photo.  Mills swings his chair, looks out the window at the
     morning light on the billboard.

                                 MILLS
                   Lust is next.  Lust is sex.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Apples on the floor.  Original sin.

                                 MILLS
                   Adam and Eve.

     Somerset puts the photo down, leans back, takes out a cigarette.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Sex, sex, sex.  Fucking sex.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Lust is everywhere.  That's the hard
                   part.  I think lust is the most
                   prevalent sin, even more than greed.

     Somerset looks at the burning tip of his cigarette.  He gets up
     to stretch his legs.

     Mills picks up the lust photo, puts his feet up on the desk.

                                 MILLS
                   Lust is red.

     Long pause.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Bright red.

                                 MILLS
                   Blood red.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

                                 MILLS
                   Red blooded.  Red head.  Dead.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Red light district.

     Pause.  Realization.  Somerset and Mills look at each other.

                                 MILLS
                   That would make sense.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It would be fitting.

                                 MILLS
                   You're damn right it would.

     Mills picks up the phone.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS, PORNO DISTRICTS -- AFTERNOON

     Porno theaters and Adult Bookstores rule these busy sidewalks.
     Marquees offer SEXY STUFF, PUSSY FEST and movies like MIDNIGHT
     PLOWBOY and NATIONAL LAM-PORN'S CHRISTMAS INSERTION.  Cops are
     walking through the pedestrian flow, handing out photocopies.
     There are many patrol cars on the street.  Definitely a larger
     than usual police presence.

     Cops are questioning the proprietors of porn at the entrances of
     their shops and theaters.

     Cops are taping photocopies onto lamp posts.  These photocopies
     are warnings, with the drawing of John Doe's face above a line
     of information and the words HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?


     INT.  WILD BILL'S LEATHER SHOPPE -- AFTERNOON

     Somerset's holding up the composite sketch of John Doe.

                                 WILD BILL (O.S.)
                   Yeah, he was here.  This morning.

     Mills and Somerset are across the sales counter from WILD BILL,
     37.  Wild Bill is shirtless, covered in tattoos.  A thick scar
     runs down his forehead to his bent nose.  Leather belts, whips
     and jackets hang from the walls.

                                 MILLS
                   It was definitely him?  You're positive?

                                 WILD BILL
                   Yeah.  John Doe.  Easy name to remember.

                                 SOMERSET
                   What was this job you did for him?

     Wild Bill pulls a box from behind the counter, digs in it.

                                 WILD BILL
                   I got a picture of it.  That's what he
                   came for this morning.  I figured he
                   must be one of those art guys... like
                   those guys who piss in a cup and drink
                   it on stage.  Performance art.

     Wild Bill gives a polaroid to Mills.  We don't see the image.

                                 MILLS
                   Oh, fuck...

                                 WILD BILL
                   I think I undercharged him.  I was up
                   all night working to finish it.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (looks at photo)
                   You built this for him?  You built this?

                                 WILD BILL
                   I've built weirder shit than that.

     A BEEL CHIMES as a POLICEMAN enters the store.

                                 POLICEMAN
                   Somerset... we have a situation.

     Mills and Somerset follow the policeman out.

                                 WILD BILL
                   Hey, my picture!

     They're gone.  Wild Bill scratches his scar.

                                 WILD BILL (CONT)
                   Fucking pigs.


     EXT.  THE HOT HOUSE MASSAGE PARLOR -- AFTERNOON

     It's a madhouse outside The Hot House.  Police action in
     progress.  Cops have formed a barrier, holding off a crowd and
     creating an aisle to the back of a jail-van.  Cops and
     detectives escort various men, women and transvestites into the
     large vehicle.  The crowd, consisting of the dregs of society,
     is angry.  Some spit and throw trash at the cops.

     INT.  THE HOT HOUSE, RECEPTION AREA -- AFTERNOON

     An ANGRY COP pounds his nightstick on a glass cage.  Inside the
     cage sits an oily FAT MAN in front of a wall of sex toys.

                                 FAT MAN
                   Just wait!

                                 COP
                   Get out of the fucking booth!

                                 FAT MAN
                   Just wait!  I'll come out, just wait!

     INT.  THE HOT HOUSE, CORRIDORS -- AFTERNOON

     All the lights and walls are red.  Mills and Somerset follow a
     COP through the twisting corridors.  ROCK MUSIC THROBS.  They
     reach a door.

                                 COP
                   I don't want to go in there again.

     INT.  THE HOT HOUSE, RED ROOM -- AFTERNOON

     Mills and Somerset enter.  ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES, LOUD.  A strobe
     light flashes from the ceiling onto TWO AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS.
     The first attendant places a sheet over a bed, hiding the corpse
     of a WOMAN with long blonde hair.  The second attendant tries to
     examine the pupils of a CRAZED MAN, 55, who sits naked on the
     floor, wrapped in a sheet.  A COP holds the crazed man down.

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   He... he... he made me do it!

                                 SECOND ATTENDANT
                   I have to look at you.  I have to look
                   at you.

     An X is scratched into the red paint on the wall.  Mills and
     Somerset move towards the covered body.

     There are apples on the bed and floor.  The ROCK MUSIC from
     outside SUDDENLY STOPS.

                                 FIRST ATTENDANT
                   You're not going to want to see this
                   more than once.

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   He had a gun!  He... he made me do it!

     The sheet is lifted for the detectives.  They grimace at what
     they see.  We do not see.  Somerset closes his eyes and walks to
     face a wall, shaken.  The first attendant replaces the sheet.

     Mills steps back, takes out his handkerchief and sucks on it.

                                 CRAZED MAN (O.S.,CONT)
                   He made me do it!


     INT.  SANATORIUM, WHITE ROOM -- AFTERNOON

     A polaroid is on a white table.  It is the photo Wild Bill gave
     to Mills and Somerset.  It is a picture of a belt, made with
     extra leather straps so it can be worn securely around the
     groin.  It is a strap-on phallus, but there is no plastic
     protuberance.  Instead, there is a metal knife.  It is a strap-
     on butcher's knife.

     Somerset is seated beside the white table in this white room.
     Mills stands behind him.  The crazed man from the lust murder is
     in a chair across the room.  The crazed man is crying.

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   And... and... and he said... he asked if
                   I was married.  And, I could see he had
                   a gun in his hand.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where was the girl?

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   What?  What?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where was the prostitute?

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   She was... she was on the bed.  She was
                   just sitting on the bed.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Who tied her down?  You or him?

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   He had a gun.  He had a gun, and he made
                   it happen.  He made me do it!
                   He made me put it on... that thing.  Oh,
                   God... he made me wear it.  He had the
                   gun in my mouth.

     The man slides off the chair and hides his face in his hands.

                                 CRAZED MAN (CONT)
                   The gun was in my throat.

     Mills looks at the mirror in the room.

     Somerset stands, picks up the Polaroid as two men in white
     uniforms enter to collect the crazed man from off the floor.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING

     Somerset and Mills are shell-shocked, seated at their desks.
     Somerset is looking out the window.  Mills stares at the wall.

     Somerset looks to his temporary desk.  He picks up a small pile
     of mail, sorts through it.  An 8" by 10" manila envelope
     interests him.  It reads DETECTIVE SOMERSET on the outside,
     handwritten in red marker.  He opens it.

     He takes out a grainy photograph of he and Tracy kissing in his
     car.  It's obviously been taken with a special night-lens.

     Somerset goes pale, suppressing a gasp.  He holds the photo to
     hide it from Mills, looks to see Mills has not noticed.  He
     feels panicky, crumples the photo and envelope in his hand.

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Somerset enters, latches the door.  He takes the crushed photo
     and envelope from his pocket.  He quickly checks under the
     stalls to see he is alone.  He opens a window, goes to the sink.

     He takes out his cigarette lighter, lights the envelope and
     photo, watches them catch.  Once they're burning steady he
     throws them in the sink.

     He backs away, leans against the wall, watching, feeling sick.


     INT.  SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset and Mills sit with a full pitcher of beer between them.
     The JUKEBOX plays QUIETLY for other customers.  The walls of the
     bar are lined with trophies, ribbons and other victory symbols.

                                 SOMERSET
                   There's not going to be a happy ending.
                   It's not possible.

                                 MILLS
                   If we get him, I'll be happy enough.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's
                   good guys against the bad guys in this
                   city.

     Mills drinks deep, pours more.

                                 MILLS
                   How can you say that?  Especially after
                   today?

                                 SOMERSET
                   You tell me... when you walk into an
                   apartment, and a man has beaten his wife
                   to death, or, a wife murdered her
                   husband in cold blood... and you have to
                   wash the blood off their children.  You
                   put the killer in jail.  Who won?

                                 MILLS
                   If I thought like you, I'd have slit my
                   wrists a long time ago.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where's the victory?

                                 MILLS
                   You do your job.  Follow the law and do
                   the best you can.  It's all there.

                                 SOMERSET
                   If we caught John Doe tomorrow, and it
                   turned out he was the devil... if it
                   turned out he was literally Satan, then,
                   that might live up to our expectations.
                   No human being could do these horrible
                   things, right?!  But, this is not the
                   devil.  It's only a man.

                                 MILLS
                   Why don't you shut the fuck up for a
                   while?!  Huh?  You make these
                   speeches... like you know everything
                   there is to know.

     Somerset sits back, looking at Mills.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   You think you're preparing me for the
                   hard times ahead?
                   You think you're toughening me up?
                   Well, you're not!
                           (pause)
                   You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying
                   to fight.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Who are you fighting for?  People don't
                   want a champion.  They just want to keep
                   playing the lottery and eating
                   hamburgers.

                                 MILLS
                   What the fuck is wrong with you, huh?
                   What burnt you out?

                                 SOMERSET
                   There's no one thing, if that's what you
                   mean.  I just... I can't live anymore
                   where stupidity is embraced and nurtured
                   as if it were a virtue.

                                 MILLS
                   You're so much better than everyone,
                   right?  No one's worthy of you.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Wrong!  I sympathize completely.
                   Because if you can't win... then, if you
                   don't ignore everything and everyone
                   around you, you go insane.  It's easier
                   to smoke crack, and not worry that your
                   wife and kids are starving to death.
                   And, it's so much easier to bear a child
                   till that child finally shuts up,
                   because it takes so much work to love.
                   And, if you bothered to think about the
                   abuse, and the damage, you'd be sad.

                                 MILLS
                   You're talking about people who are
                   mentally ill.  You're...

                                 SOMERSET
                           (cuts in, furious)
                   No, I am not!  I'm talking about common,
                   everyday life here.  Where Ignorance
                   isn't bliss, it's a matter of survival.

                                 MILLS
                   Listen to yourself.  You say, "the
                   problem with people is they don't care,
                   so I don't care about people."  But, if
                   you're not part of the solution...

                                 SOMERSET
                           (cuts him off)
                   People who are in arguments over their
                   heads always use meaningless slogans.
                   But, life doesn't conform to analogies.

                                 MILLS
                   You're already here, and you've been
                   here a long time.  So, there's a part of
                   you that knows, even if everything you
                   say is true, none of it matters.

                                 SOMERSET
                   That part of me is dead.

     Mills stands.

                                 MILLS
                   Fuck you.  You want me to agree with
                   you.  "Yeah, you're right, Somerset,
                   this place is fucked.  Let's go live in
                   a fucking log cabin!"  Well, I don't
                   agree with you.  You're quitting, and it
                   makes me sick.  Cause, you're the best
                   I've ever seen.

     Mills digs out some money and throws it on the table.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Thanks for the beer.

     Mills leaves.  Other patrons watch him go.  Somerset takes out a
     cigarette.  He goes to light it.  The lighter will not light,
     and when it does, Somerset's hand is shaking.


     INT.  SAFE HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Mills comes quietly into the bedroom.  Tracy is asleep in the
     bed.  Mills takes off his jacket, puts it down.  He sits on a
     chair and unties one shoe, takes it off.  He looks at Tracy,
     looks at her a long time.

     He puts the shoe on the floor and goes to get on the bed.  He
     kisses Tracy's forehead, looks at her sleeping innocently.  He
     is touched, saddened.  He kisses her cheek, then wraps his arms
     under and around her.  He holds tight, kisses her again.  Tracy
     stirs.

                                 TRACY
                   David?

     Mills his face against her, holding tighter still.

                                 MILLS
                   I love you.

     Tracy holds his face in her hands, sees that he is crying.

                                 TRACY
                   David?

                                 MILLS
                   I love you.

     Mills clings to her.  She wraps her arms around him as he cries
     quietly against her, and she kisses him, tries to comfort him.
     He sobs.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS, INDUSTRIAL AREA -- NIGHT

     John Doe walks in this section of huge industrial complexes.
     Factories and foundries are lined side by side, seemingly for
     miles.  We can HEAR TUGBOAT HORNS sounding low and deep.  We're
     near the water.

     Doe seems to know where he's going.  He passes stacks of
     industrial piping and steel drums piled to the sky.

     He walks through an industrial junk-yard filled with trashed
     bulldozers, trucks and discarded factory equipment.  It's like a
     stroll through a bone-yard of dead dinosaurs.

     At the end of this field of metal, there is a tall, narrow
     alleyway formed by two warehouses.  Doe enters, looking up at
     the single lit bulb on the wall above.

     He looks at the ground, picks up a rock and a beaten hubcap,
     walks under the bulb.  He throws the hubcap with all his might.
     It soars, but misses the bulb, falls to the ground behind.

     Doe takes aim with the rock.  He throws, grunting.

     The rock smashes the bulb, bringing darkness to the alley.

     Doe walks back to the mouth of the alley.  He stops and turns to
     start from there.  He walks, deliberately, looking down at his
     feet.    FOLLOW as he walks.

     He stops, looks back to the way he came, then looks down at the
     ground in front of him again.  He takes off his thick glasses.

     He holds the glasses in his hand.


     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Somerset is in bed.  The metronome is sounding: tick, tick,
     tick... The SOUNDS of the CITY are LOUD.

     Somerset closes his eyes, concentrating on the metronome.  Tick,
     tick, tick... A MAN and a WOMAN are HEARD SCREAMING at each
     other incoherently from outside.  Somerset rolls over, restless. 
     Tick, tick, tick...

     A THIRD VOICE is HEARD from outside.  This man is screaming at
     the other two people to shut up.  Somerset opens his eyes, sits
     up.  He reaches over, grabs the metronome and throws it against
     the wall.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     SUNDAY

     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING

     Somerset sits away from the bed.  He's smoking a cigarette.  The
     PHONE RINGS.  Somerset gets up, not in the best of moods.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (into phone)
                   Hello.

                                 TRACY (V.O.)
                           (from phone, upset)
                   Hello, Somerset.  It's Tracy.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Is everything alright?

                                 TRACY (V.O.)
                   Yes.  Everything's fine.  Could... could
                   you meet me somewhere.  To talk.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (pause)
                   I don't think that's a good idea.

                                 TRACY (V.O.)
                   I need to talk to someone, Somerset.
                   You're the only friend I have here.  I
                   don't know anyone else.


     INT.  COFFEE CAFE -- MORNING

     Somerset and Tracy are seated in a booth by the window.  The
     city's morning rush passes by outside.  The cafe is noisy.
     Tracy is very upset.  Somerset is very uneasy.

                                 SOMERSET
                   David doesn't know about this?  You
                   haven't told him?

     Tracy shakes her head.  Somerset sighs.  Long silence.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I have to tell you, Tracy, I'm not the
                   one to talk to about this.

                                 TRACY
                   I just can't think straight.  I don't
                   know why I called you, except I can't
                   stand to hold it as a secret anymore.  I
                   had to get it out... and I can't tell
                   David yet.  Not yet.

     Somerset takes out his cigarettes, but thinks better of it and
     puts them away.  He watches Tracy stir her coffee.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I... I had a relationship once, very
                   much like a marriage.  And, there was a
                   baby.  A long time ago.  Things were
                   good.  And I got up one morning, and I
                   went on a case... a murder, like any
                   other.  Except it was my first since
                   hearing about the baby.  And, I felt
                   this fear and anxiety coming over me.  I
                   looked around and I thought, how can I
                   raise a child here?  So, that night, I
                   told her I didn't want us to have
                   children,  And, over the next few
                   weeks... I convinced her...

     Tears come to Somerset's eyes.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I mean, I wore her down... slowly.

                                 TRACY
                   I want to have children.  But...

                                 SOMERSET
                   I can tell you, I know... I'm positive I
                   made the right decision.  I'm positive
                   it was the right thing to do.  But,
                   there's never a day that goes by that I
                   don't wish I had decided differently.

     Tracy reaches to hold Somerset's hand, but he withdraws it,
     wipes his tears away.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   If you... if you decide not to have the
                   baby... if that's what you decide, then
                   never tell Mills you were pregnant.
                   I mean that.  Never tell.
                           (pause)
                   Your marriage would just wither, and die
                   altogether.

     Tracy looks around the cafe, tears in her eyes.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   But, if you decide to have the baby,
                   then, at that very instant, when you're
                   absolutely sure... tell him.  Tell him
                   that exact second.  And, spoil that kid
                   every chance you get.

                                 TRACY
                   Somerset...

     Somerset stands.  He forces a smile.

                                 SOMERSET
                   That's all the wisdom I can share with
                   you, Tracy.  I barely know you.

                                 TRACY
                   Will I see you again, before you leave?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Probably not.  But, it's probably better
                   that way.

     Somerset steps away, leaves.  Tracy watches him go.


     EXT.  CITY STREET -- DAY

     Mills and Somerset walk towards the precinct house.  They wade
     through cars to cross the street.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I've decided... I want to stay on, till
                   this is over.  Till either it's done, or
                   we can see it will never end.

     Mills remains impassive.

                                 MILLS
                   Oh, you want to stay now?

                                 SOMERSET
                   One of two things is going to happen.
                   We're either going to get John Doe...
                   or, he will finish his series of seven,
                   and he'll never be found.

                                MILLS
                   You think if you stay you're doing me
                   some big favor?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm requesting you keep me on as your
                   partner a few more days.  You'd be doing
                   me the favor.

                                 MILLS
                   You knew I'd say yes.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.  I wasn't sure at all.

     They enter the precinct house.  Down the sidewalk, from a
     distance, comes John Doe.  His brown workboots and clothing are
     splattered with blood.

     He walks towards the precinct house, hands in his pockets, like
     he's merely out for a walk on a Sunday afternoon.  People on the
     sidewalk stop upon seeing him, avoiding him.

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, RECEIVING LOBBY/BOOKING -- DAY

     Mills and Somerset walk past booking cubicles and benches of
     handcuffed low-lifes.  The place is swimming with activity.

     The two detectives head to a duty desk at the end of the room.

                                 SOMERSET
                   As soon as this is over, I'll be gone.

                                 MILLS
                   What a great big surprise that is.

     They pass through a gate and Somerset goes to the staircase
     leading to the second floor.  Mills stops at the duty desk.
     Other cops are fighting for the DUTY SERGEANT'S attention.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Mills and Somerset are on the premises.

                                 SERGEANT
                   Wonder-fucking-ful.

     Mills stops, looks.  Somerset stops, looks back down the stairs.

     John Doe stands inside the precinct house doors.  He holds out
     his arms as if to say "presto, here I am."

     Near silence comes to the room as all eyes go to the figure of
     John Doe.

     Mills is riveted, finding this impossible to comprehend.

     One UNIFORMED COP takes out his gun, points it at John Doe.

                                 UNIFORMED COP
                   It's him!

     Several other cops drop what they're doing and draw weapons.
     Mills, still off-balance, walks back through the gate, takes his
     gun out and points it at Doe.

                                 MILLS
                   Get down on the floor.

     Somerset comes back down the stairs.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Be careful!

     Cops move slowly in on Doe from all sides.

                                 ANOTHER COP
                   You heard him!  Get on the floor!

     John Doe gets on his knees, hands up.  Mills moves close, but
     not too.  ONE COP comes from behind, nudges Doe with his foot.

                                 ONE COP
                   Spread your legs and get your hands out
                   in front of you.

                                 MILLS
                   Get down!  Face down!

     John Doe gets on his stomach, obeys.  Mills comes right up to
     Doe, steps on his neck, puts his gun against Doe's head.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Don't move.  Don't move a fucking inch.

     Cops frisk and handcuff Doe.  Somerset comes beside Mills.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I don't believe it.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Hello, Lieutenant Somerset.

                                 COP
                   What the hell is this?

     The cop putting the handcuffs on Doe holds up Doe's hands.  Doe
     winces.  Every single one of Doe's fingers has a bandage wrapped
     around it.  John Doe looks up, his face pressed against the
     floor, glasses askew, Mills' gun at his temple.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   I want to speak with my lawyer.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, OBSERVATION ROOM -- DAY

     Mills, Somerset and the captain stand in darkness.

     On the other side of a two-way mirror, John Doe is seated in a
     restraining chair in an interrogation room.  His hands and legs
     are bound with leather straps to the chair's arm and legs.  A
     strap hold tight around Doe's throat.  This is not some
     superman/serial killer.  He looks more like an eccentric college
     professor.  His lawyer MARK SWARR, 43, sits at a table, taking
     notes.

     Mills holds a fingerprint card.  The black ink prints are just
     useless blobs with traces of blood in them.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   He cuts off the skin of his fingertips.
                   That's why we can't find a single usable
                   print in his apartment.  For a long
                   time, he's been cutting before the
                   papillary lines can grow back.

                                 MILLS
                   What about the trace on his bank
                   account?  The guns?

                                 CAPTAIN
                   The orphanage is all we have.  His bank
                   account is only five years old and it
                   started as cash.  There's no credit
                   history, no employment history.  We even
                   tried to trace his furniture.  All we
                   know for sure is he's wealthy, well
                   educated and totally insane.  We may
                   never know how he got that way.

     Somerset stands looking in at Doe.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Because he is John Doe, by choice.

                                 MILLS
                   When do we get to question him?

                                 CAPTAIN
                   You don't.  This goes to court now.

                                 MILLS
                   This doesn't make sense, captain.  He
                   wouldn't just turn himself in!

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed
                   to make sense.

                                 MILLS
                   He's not finished!

                                 CAPTAIN
                   You're wound way too tight on this,
                   Mills.

                                 MILLS
                   Somerset... help me out here.

     Somerset looks at them.  Says nothing.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   It's over.

     The captain leaves.  Mills is furious.

                                 MILLS
                   Damn it, Somerset.  You know Johnny's
                   fucking with us.  He's pissing in our
                   faces again!

                                 SOMERSET
                   Slow up.  You and I are, probably for
                   the first time ever, in total agreement.
                   He wouldn't just stop.

                                 MILLS
                   Well... what the fuck, man?

                                 SOMERSET
                   John Doe's only two murders away from
                   finishing his masterpiece, right?  But,
                   can you even conceive of what might
                   happen next?  I mean, can you tell me
                   how he's going to go about it?

                                 MILLS
                           (pause)
                   No.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I can tell you this; I recognize his
                   lawyer.  His name is Mark Swarr.  He's
                   the one who kept Zero out of prison.
                           (pause)
                   We'll wait for John Doe's plea.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- DAY

     Mills is at the desk with his feet up, stares at the chalkboard:

                    1 gluttony (x)       5 lust (x)
                    2 greed (x)          6 wrath
                    3 sloth (x)          7 envy
                    4 pride (x)

     Clock on the wall says 4:45.  Somerset packs books into boxes,
     preparing for his eventual departure.  The captain opens the
     door and steps into the office.  He clears his throat, looking
     like there is something very wrong.

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- DAY

     Mills and Somerset stand together.  The captain is behind his
     desk with the D.A., Martin Talbot, seated in front of him.  Mark
     Swarr addresses them all, seems nervous, but in control.

                                 SWARR
                   My client says there are two more
                   bodies... two more dead, hidden away.
                   He will take Detective Mills to these
                   bodies, but only Detective Mills.  Only
                   at six o'clock, today.

     Swarr wipes his brow with a handkerchief.

                                 TALBOT
                   Oh, Christ.

                                 MILLS
                   Why me?

                                 SWARR
                   He says he admires you.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (to captain)
                   This is all part of his game plan.

                                 SWARR
                   Mr. Doe claims that if the detective
                   does not accept this offer, the bodies
                   will never be found.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Frankly, counselor, I'm inclined to let
                   them rot.

     Mills walks up into Swarr's face.

                                 MILLS
                   You like what you do for a living?

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Back off, Mills.

                                 SWARR
                   I'm required by law to serve my clients
                   to the best of my ability, and to serve
                   their interests.

     Mills eases off.  Talbot is agitated, tapping a finger on the
     gold tooth in his mouth.  He looks at Swarr.

                                 TALBOT
                   We don't make deals like this.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   We're going to have to pass.

                                 SWARR
                   My client... he also wishes that I
                   inform you, if you do not accept, he
                   will plead insanity, across the board.

                                 TALBOT
                   Let him try.  I'd like to see him try!

                                 SWARR
                   Come now, Martin.  Even he knows, with
                   the nature of these crimes, I could get
                   him off with such a plea.

     Talbot stands, wringing his hands.  Mills and Somerset are
     looking at each other, thinking it over.

                                 TALBOT
                   I'm not letting this conviction slide.
                   I can tell you that, right here and
                   right now!

                                 SWARR
                   He says, if you accept, under his
                   specific conditions, he will sign a full
                   confession and plead guilty... right
                   here, and right now.

     Talbot looks at Swarr with hatred.

                                 MILLS
                   I'll do it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Hold on... just a minute.

     Somerset turns to Talbot.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   If he were to plead insanity... this
                   conversation is admissible.  The fact
                   that he's blackmailing us with his
                   plea...

                                 SWARR
                   And, my client reminds you, two more
                   people are dead.  The press would have a
                   field day if they found out the police
                   didn't seem too concerned about finding
                   them... giving them proper burial.

                                 MILLS
                   I'll do it.  I want to finish it.

     Somerset is thinking it through.  He looks at Mills.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (to captain)
                   Well... let's get the fucking lawyer out
                   of the room, and we can talk about how
                   this whole thing's going to go down.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, BATHROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Mills' hand reaches to the sink to pick up a razor.  He's
     shirtless, his chest covered in shaving cream.  He starts
     shaving in front of a mirror.  Somerset is behind him, smoking.

                                 SOMERSET
                   If John Doe's head splits open, and a
                   U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have
                   expected it.

                                 MILLS
                   I will.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No emotion.  Stay as cold as ice.

                                 MILLS
                   I will.

     Somerset flicks ash in the sink.  Mills finishes shaving.  He
     steps away from the sink and wipes his chest off with a towel.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                           (very serious)
                   Listen, Somerset... we've been through a
                   lot together.  And, I uh...

                                 SOMERSET
                   What is it?

                                 MILLS
                   I would like to make sweet love to you.

     Somerset walks away.  Mills laughs.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Please...

     As they leave.

                                 MILLS
                   Give me a kiss on the lips.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Give me a break.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, READY ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Mills has his shirt off.  A female technician, Josie, tapes a
     radio transmitter and microphone to his chest.

     Somerset sits nearby at one of the ready room desks.  He wears a
     bullet-proof vest, is just finishing a check of his gun.  He's
     putting the bullets back into it.

     Josie finishes prepping Mills.  Mills presses the adhesive,
     making sure it will hold.  He puts on a shirt and bullet-proof
     vest, fastens the velcro.

     Somerset stands, puts the gun in his hip holster.

     Mills picks up his own gun, checks it, holsters it.  He watches
     Somerset take out a roll of antacids.  Somerset pops a few.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Ready?

                                 MILLS
                   Extremely.

     They look at each other.  Mills holds out his hand.  They shake
     on it.


     INT.  CITY STREET, IN FRONT OF PRECINCT HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON

     The street is full of shadows as the sun is falling low.  On the
     steps of the precinct house, a throng of reporters shifts
     anxiously.  A line of policemen holds them back.  The precinct
     doors open.  Martin Talbot arrives, escorted by cops.  The
     press swarm lurches forward, flashbulbs explode.

     Talbot holds out his hands, quieting them, about to speak.

     EXT.  CITY STREET, AT BACK OF PRECINCT HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Mills' car pulls out of the fenced parking lot.  John Doe is
     seated in the rear.

     The car speeds up on the street, turns onto an avenue, heading
     into a canyon formed by tall buildings.  At the corner, a car is
     parked.

     Somerset is at the wheel.  He pulls out, follows Mills' car.

     EXT.  SKYSCRAPER ROOFTOP -- LATE AFTERNOON

     California is dressed in full battle gear.  He looks through
     binoculars at the city below.  The wind blows hard.

     He turns and runs to a sleek helicopter on the roof's heli-pad,
     climbs in the side door.  The PILOT leans back from the cockpit
     to hand him a helmet.  California dons it, starts strapping
     himself in so he can lean out the open door.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Is this wind going to hurt us?

     The pilot cranks the helicopter's whining engine and the blades
     start to spin, churning the air.

                                 PILOT
                   Just makes the ride a little more fun.

     California hefts a high-powered automatic rifle as the chopper
     lifts from the pad and takes off.

     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Mills drives, looking to the back seat through the rearview
     mirror.  A steel mesh partition separates front from back.

     John Doe sits with his hands cuffed.  He is dressed in gray
     pants and a gray shirt.  His feet are cuffed to a metal fastener
     on the floor of the car.  Rivulets of sweat pour down his face.
     He seems wired.

                                 MILLS
                   What's your story, Johnny?  Who are you,
                   really?

     Doe pushes his glasses back up the bridge of his nose, looks at
     Mills' eyes in the rearview mirror.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am
                   means absolutely nothing.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Somerset adjusts the volume on a radio receiver mounted on the
     dash.  He watches the road ahead, tailing Mills.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   What's your deal?  You seem pretty
                   fucking nervous.

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   I want this to go well.  It's very
                   important to me, obviously.

     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- LATE AFTERNOON

     The chopper hovers amongst skyscrapers.  California and the
     pilot are listening, through their helmet headsets.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   You want this to go well?  What is this?

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   Turn right on this street.  Stay in the
                   left lane.

     California leans out the chopper door, using his binoculars.

     EXT.  CITY STREET -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Mills' car weaves through traffic.

     Somerset's car isn't far behind, goes through a red light,
     barely missing a truck.  Other cars blow their horns.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

     A cellular phone on the passenger side is BEEPING.  Somerset
     pushes a button on the phone's panel.  He puts on a
     headset/telephone, speaks into the mouthpiece.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm here.

                                 CALIFORNIA (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   Downtown and moving west.  Looks like
                   you're going to be crossing water.

                                 SOMERSET
                   If we're on the bridge, you keep your
                   distance.  You hear me?

     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- LATE AFTERNOON

     The helicopter hovers steady.  California stows his binoculars.

                                 SOMERSET (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   Cross the river before us if necessary.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   You got it.

     California taps the pilot's helmet.

     EXT.  CITY SKY -- LATE AFTERNOON

     The helicopter dips, flying like a bullet over the city skyline,
     heading towards the river and the setting sun.

     EXT.  CITY STREETS -- LATE AFTERNOON

     FROM HIGH ABOVE, we see traffic on the highway at the polluted
     river's edge.  Cards and trucks move like blood through veins.

     DOWN CLOSER, we can see Mills' car in the flow.  The car turns
     into a lane of traffic on its way to the huge suspension bridge.

     Somerset's car is in close pursuit.

     UNDER THE BRIDGE, the police helicopter travels close to the
     water, moving parallel to the bridge, but low, so that it's out
     of the sightline of the vehicles above.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Traffic is bumper to bumper.  Somerset moves his headset
     mouthpiece to smoke a cigarette.  He steers onto the bridge,
     under the massive girders.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   For us to go pick up two more dead
                   bodies, and have that be the end of
                   it... just seems too boring for you.

     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Beyond the crest of the bridge, the sunset is crimson.

                                 MILLS
                   Wouldn't be sensational enough.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Wanting people to pay attention, you
                   can't just tap them on the shoulder.

     John Doe strains to turn, looks out the back window.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   Sometimes you have to hit them in the
                   head with a sledgehammer... and then you
                   get their strict attention.

                                 MILLS
                   What are you looking at, Johnny?

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Looking back... at the city proper...

     Doe situates forward, holds his hands in front of his face,
     looking at his bandaged fingers.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   And yet, no pillar of salt.
                           (smiles to himself)
                   Lost on you, isn't it?  You've never
                   read the Bible, have you, David?

                                 MILLS
                   I remember a lot of people reading it at
                   me when I was a kid.  I preferred the
                   classic comic version myself.

     This is an affront to Doe, angers him.  Mills sees it, likes it.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   I used to have "Godspell" on an eight-
                   track tape.  Does that count?

     Doe leans forwards, fury building in him.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   You make me sick.

                                 MILLS
                   Sit back, freak.

     Mills slams his fist against the partition.  Doe sits back.

                                 JOHN DOE
                           (under his breath)
                   Ignorant heathen.

                                 MILLS
                   Right, right.  I forgot.  You think
                   these murders were for God.  Right?
                           (pause)
                   I'm asking you seriously.  You really
                   think what you did was God's good work?

     Doe looks out the window at other cars, refuses to answer.

     He's pressing the tips of his forefingers into his thumbs,
     causing blood to drip from under the bandages.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   The Lord works in mysterious ways.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS, INDUSTRIAL AREA -- NIGHT

     It's getting dark.  We've been in this section of factories
     before, with John Doe.  The police helicopter soars overhead.

     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- NIGHT

     California's looking down, wearing night-vision goggles.

     INSERT -- CALIFORNIA'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH GOGGLES

     The goggles allow California to see clearly into the maze formed
     by buildings, yards and worksheds below.  No one in sight.

                                 CALIFORNIA (O.S.)
                   Fuck, man... there's about a thousand
                   places to be ambushed out here.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     The headlights are off.  Mills' car's red brake lights are far
     ahead on this industrial road.

                                 CALIFORNIA (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   I don't see anything... not yet.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (in mouthpiece)
                   A quick sweep is all we get.  Clear out
                   now.  You're right in front of us.

     Somerset reaches to turn up the volume on his radio receiver.
     Mills is HEARD SINGING "Jesus Christ Superstar," loud.  Somerset
     allows a very faint smile.

     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- NIGHT

     Mills drives along, singing.

                                 MILLS
                   Jesus Christ, Superstar... who in the
                   world do you think you are?  Jesus
                   Christ, Superstar...

     Doe's in the back seat, trying to bear it, steaming.

     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL SKIES -- NIGHT

     The chopper goes high, away, over the industrial area.

     It moves to the other side of the factories and settles in low
     over the river.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Mills' tune comes to a conclusion.  Somerset slows the car as he
     sees Mills' brake lights go on ahead.

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   We can walk from here.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (in mouthpiece)
                   You stay out of this unless I call you
                   in, California.  Understand?

                                 CALIFORNIA (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   You're in charge.

     Somerset takes off the headset/phone, stops the car.

     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL ROAD, AT SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset gets out.  He looks through binoculars.

     INSERT -- SOMERSET'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH BINOCULARS

     Mills' car has stopped under the lights of a junk-yard.  Mills
     gets out.  He walks to unlock the passenger door.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   Alright, Somerset.  Going for a stroll.

     AT MILLS' CAR

     Mills opens the passenger door.  Doe looks out.

                                 MILLS
                   Lean on your side.  Hands behind your
                   head and lock your fingers together.

     Doe obliges.  Mills moves to unchain Doe's feet, cautious.

     INSERT -- SOMERSET'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH BINOCULARS

     Mills lets Doe out.  Doe does a deep knee bend to loosen his
     legs.  Mills takes out his gun.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   Where are we going?

     Doe points with handcuffed hands, at a path through the junk-
     yard, towards warehouses.  Mills motions with his gun.

                                 MILLS (V.O.,CONT)
                           (from receiver)
                   Lead the way.

     Doe starts walking.  Mills follows, keeping the gun on Doe.  We
     lose sight of them behind the junk-yard's massive pieces.

     AT SOMERSET'S CAR

     Somerset lowers his binoculars.  He gets back in the car, leaves
     the lights off, drives slowly towards Mills' car.

     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL AREA, JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT

     Mills follows Doe past rusting collections of machines.  We took
     this walk with Doe before, through this metallic bone-yard.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   It's right this way.

     Mills is on edge.  His eyes search the towering, twisted junk.
     Sharp edges reach for the sky.  Glass breaks under their feet.

                                 MILLS
                   So far, so good.

     SOUNDS of BOATS on the river can be HEARD.  Doe's heading for
     the alleyway created by two warehouses beyond the junk-yard.

     Doe nears the alleyway.  It is pitch dark.  Doe stops before
     entering, turns to Mills.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   In here.

     Mills steps up, keeping his distance from Doe.  He can't see a
     thing in the blackness ahead.

                                 MILLS
                   You go first.

     Doe faces the alley.  He starts walking.  We MOVE with him as he
     goes.  He's counting silently to himself, moving his lips.

     Mills walks behind Doe, keeping a sharp eye out in all
     directions.  He's about ten feet behind Doe, keeping his gun
     trained on the back of Doe's skull.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Tell me where we're going.

     Doe continues walking, counting his steps, a bit quicker.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset has pulled along Mills' car, at the junk-yard.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   Slow down, Johnny.  Stop right there.
                           (pause)
                   I said stop!

     EXT.  WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

     Doe walks on.  Mills is behind, walking to close the gap.  We
     can HEAR the faint SOUND of RUSHING WATER.

                                 MILLS
                   I'll blow your head off right now!

     Doe stops abruptly.  He spins on his heels, facing Mills.

     Mills is getting closer, pumped, ready to pull the trigger.

     Doe reaches up with his hands, takes off his glasses.  He holds
     them in one hand.  The SOUND of the WATER is LOUDER.

     Mills is about six feet from Doe, and knows something's wrong.

     John Doe smiles.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What...

     Doe takes one step backwards and falls, straight down,
     disappears in the blink of an eye.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   No!

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset looks towards the far off alleyway, horrified.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   Motherfucker!  No!

     INT.  WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

     Mills stands facing the open manhole cover Doe disappeared into.

     A torrent of water rushes by underground.  Mills fires a few
     futile shots into the water, out of his mind with rage.  He
     pulls back the top of his bullet-proof vest, exposing the
     microphone.

                                 MILLS
                   He's gone, Somerset!  He's in the water!

     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL ROAD, SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset leaps out, takes out his gun.  FOLLOW as he runs into
     the junk-yard as fast as he can.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   I'm going in!

     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- NIGHT

     The chopper's over the river.  California listens intently.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   I have to go in after him!

     STATIC CRACKLES LOUD in his headset, then it GOES DEAD.
     California grips his mouthpiece.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Somerset, what's going on down there?!

     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWAY -- NIGHT

     An underground pipe-way.  Mills tries to swim, is mostly carried
     in the flow.  He's battered against the sides of the pipe,
     holding his breath desperately.

     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT

     FOLLOW Somerset as he charges onwards through the junk-yard,
     stumbling over pieces of metal.  He runs towards the alleyway.

     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS -- NIGHT

     WATER ROARS.  A square pool of water churns.  A moment, then
     Mills rises, gasping, choking.  He's disoriented, furious,
     waving his gun, expecting Doe to be right on top of him.

     No one around.  Mills looks.  This is some sort of unmanned
     water switching station.  the walls are covered in catwalks,
     drainage pipes and tunnels.  Some tunnels and pipes spew water
     down into the central pool, others are sealed shut.

     Mills pulls himself from the central pool to a concrete
     spillway.  He stands up, searching.  Doe could be anywhere.

                                 MILLS
                   Come on, Johnny!  I'm right here!

     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS TUNNEL -- NIGHT

     There is a plastic bag with an automatic pistol and extra clip
     inside hanging from a protruding shut-off valve.  John Doe's
     hands tear the bag open, taking the contents.

     EXT.  WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

     Somerset enters the alley, short of breath.  He points his gun
     in front of him, fearful.  Moving slowly.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Mills!

     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- NIGHT

     California is enraged, looks towards the pilot.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   God damn it!  Let's do something!

                                 PILOT
                   Somerset said wait!

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Fuck that!  Let's go!

                                 PILOT
                   Where?

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   I don't know!  Just go!

     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS -- NIGHT

     Mills climbs onto a catwalk.  He passes tunnels, looking down
     each, intense, ready to kill.  A waterfall flows and over the
     other end of the catwalk.

     Mills stands, looking over the railing at the central pool and
     other tunnels.  He points his gun and fires into a far tunnel.

                                 MILLS
                   Come on!  Let's do it!  You and me!

     A figure appears in the center of the waterfall behind Mills.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   I'm not going to let you win this!

     John Doe steps out of the waterfall, putting on his glasses.

     He seems calm, unloads his gun into Mills' back... BLAM, BLAM...

     Mills twists, blown forward by the bullets slamming into his
     bullet-proof vest.  BLAM, BLAM, BLAM... he stumbles, trying to
     turn and fire back, but bullets strike him down and he falls to
     the floor of the catwalk, gun falling from his hand.

     CLICK.  Doe's gun is empty.  The gunshots echo.  Mills lays
     there on his stomach, pounded, blacking out, the hot bullets in
     his vest smoking and sizzling from the water splashing them.

     Doe moves quickly, starts searching Mills' pockets.

     EXT.  WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

     Somerset comes upon the open manhole.  Water rushes by.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Christ.

     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS -- NIGHT

     The central pool bubbles, undulating.  Somerset surfaces,
     inhaling, bringing his gun up.  He looks.  No one in sight.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Mills!  Pull out!

     His voice reverberates, barely heard against the roaring water.
     he swims to the edge, climbs out.  He walks, looking...

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                           (pleading)
                   Pull out now!

     Somerset looks up, and freezes up on seeing --

     -- Doe's handcuffs hang, swinging, on the rail of the catwalk
     above, with Mills' radio transmitter and wire tied to them.


     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT

     Somerset runs to his car, driven, gasping for breath, still
     soaking wet.  He stops for one second, looks.

     Not too far away, the police helicopter flies low to the ground,
     turning in wide circles.

     Somerset climbs into the car, starts it up.  He drives away,
     leaving his lights off.  The engine protests loudly, forced to
     its limit.  The car disappears in darkness.

     The police helicopter circles, useless.


     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- NIGHT

     The church stands elegant at night, when its decayed state is
     partially hidden.  Small shafts of light escape from holes in
     the facade and just into the blackness.

     Somerset is out of his car.  He strides towards the church,
     checks his gun as he goes.  FOLLOW with him, getting closer to
     the church.  He climbs the stairs.

     Somerset steps up and kicks the church doors open, met by a
     tremendous blast of light --

     INT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Flickering orange light from hundreds of once tall orange
     candles, now burnt low.  They greet Somerset, in the church's
     old candle racks, on the floor, on the altar and all through out
     the pews.

     Somerset's eyes try to adjust to the light.  He holds his gun
     ready, walks down the long center aisle.

                                 JOHN DOE (O.S.)
                   Hello, Somerset.

     Doe sounds far, his voice echoing from the front of the church.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where's David?

                                 JOHN DOE (O.S.)
                   He's here.  With me.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Tell me what you want.

     Somerset can see through the heat warp.  Doe stands facing him
     from the altar.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   What do I want?  The same you... I want
                   an ending.  Stay where you are.  Put
                   your gun on the floor and slide it all
                   the way down here.

     Somerset obeys, bends, slides the gun down the aisle till it
     hits the bottom altar stair.  He keeps walking, slowly.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I want to see him.  Show me Mills.

     On the altar, Doe is sweating hard, standing over Mills.  Mills
     is slumped forward on the floor, unconscious.  His bullet-proof
     vest has been removed.

     Mills' hands are tied tight together in front of him, tied to
     one end of the thick rope suspended from the ceiling.  Doe holds
     the other end of the rope, has his gun tucked under his belt.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   You're an intelligent man, Somerset.
                   You understand what you're a part of,
                   don't you?  When this is finished, it
                   will seem surreal, but it will be a
                   whole, crystalline reality.  And, no one
                   will be able to deny it, no matter how
                   hard they try.

     Doe's voice is thick with passion.  Somerset is about halfway
     down the aisle, still moving.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You're a murderer.  That's all.  The
                   only way you've distinguished yourself
                   is by your particular brutality.

     Doe walks across the altar.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   You know that's not true.  You know.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You're killing innocent people, and I
                   should admire you?  You're doing it
                   because it gives you pleasure.  That's
                   the only purpose... your sick pleasure.

     Doe picks up a container of gasoline, looks out at Somerset.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Stay where you are!

     Somerset stops.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   I won't deny my personal desires.  I
                   won't.

     Doe begins dousing Mills with gasoline, covering Mills' body and
     clothing.  Mills stirs, coming to.  He coughs, choking on the
     gas and fumes.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   But, I don't mourn the victims in this
                   any more than I mourn the thousands who
                   died in Sodom and Gomorrah.

     Somerset looks fearful.  He starts approaching again.

                                 SOMERSET
                   All you've done is cause more misery and
                   pain!  You've given people all the more
                   reason to believe there is no God!

     Somerset eyes his gun at the bottom of the stairs.

     Doe sees Somerset moving, throws the gas can away, takes out his
     gun.  Doe walks to the edge of the altar, all the time holding
     his end of the rope.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Stop!

     Somerset is twitching with anger, looking at the gun about
     fifteen feet in front of him.

     Mills manages to look up, weak, his eyes barely able to open
     because of the stinging gasoline.

                                 MILLS
                   Somerset?

     Doe takes one step down off the altar.  Somerset is still edging
     forward, hands out away from his body.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Do you really think I'm just going to
                   let this happen?!  You think I'm going
                   to let him die?

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Yes.

     Doe fires his gun and the bullet slams into the front of
     Somerset's bullet-proof vest.  Somerset flies back, knocking
     over a rack of candles on his way to the floor.

     Doe walks quickly back onto the altar.

                                 MILLS
                   Motherfucker!

     Mills tries to grab at Doe as he passes, but Doe turns and kicks
     Mills in the ribs.  Mills cringes in pain.

     Somerset lays in the aisle, on his stomach, gasping.  He can't
     catch his breath, his twisted face pressed against the floor.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   How can you speak of God, Somerset?
                   When was the last time you spoke His
                   name?

     Mills tries to rub the gas out of his eyes with his bound hands.

     His mind works feverishly.  He looks around to see where he is,
     then he searches the floor.  We can see, inside his open shirt,
     the bleeding, upside-down cross Doe has cut into his chest.

     Doe walks back to shout angrily down at Somerset.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   When did you last speak His name?  Was
                   it in prayer?  Or, did you say the
                   Lord's name after you stubbed your big
                   toe?  Or, did you use His name to curse
                   another man?

     Somerset holds his chest, blinking, trying not to black out.

     Mills finds a piece of broken stained glass on the floor.  He
     picks it up, palms it, still choking on gasoline.

     Doe walks over to the statue of Saint Jerome Emiliani, pulling
     the rope from above so it goes taut and Mills' arms raise above
     his head.  Doe wraps the rope around Emiliani's arm.

                                 MILLS
                   I'm going to kill you, Johnny.  I'm
                   going to see you dead.

     Doe begins twisting the loose end of the rope around the statue.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   The irony, David, is that you policemen
                   and I want the same things.  But, you
                   are so short sighted.  In this city,
                   where you can see a deadly sin on every
                   street corner... and in every home, we
                   want repentance.

     Mills clutches the glass piece and starts cutting the rope just
     above his hands.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   We want good over evil.  We want values
                   instilled in the children.  We want a
                   world where a man or woman can lead a
                   decent life.
                           (pause)
                   Wisdom, understanding, counsel,
                   fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of
                   the Lord.  Such simple concepts.  Why
                   are they non-existent?

     Somerset manages to life his head, struggles to his knees.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (weakly)
                   Let him go, God damn you.

     Doe checks to make sure the rope around Saint Emiliani is secure,
     tightening the knots.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   There were two men once, who had
                   wonderful gardens.  Two gardens of
                   flowers that went on as far as the eye
                   could see.  Beautiful gardens... the
                   fragrance was inspiration in itself.

     Doe stands behind Emiliani, heaves against the statue.

     Mills watches, gritting his teeth, rubbing the glass against the
     rope, fingers bleeding.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   But, both gardens were beset by
                   problems.  Weeds started to take root,
                   and there were infestations of insects
                   and diseases.  The gardens started to
                   turn putrid.  And, one man fought to
                   save his garden, because he could never
                   forget how it once was.  Everyday he cut
                   the weeds, and killed the insects.
                   Fought the diseases.

     Doe finally topples the statue, down the altar stairs, and the
     other end of the rope pulls Mills upwards, screaming in pain.
     Mills is held, about eight feet in the air, legs dangling.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   That man never had a beautiful garden
                   again.

                                 MILLS
                   Fuck you!

                                 JOHN DOE
                   The other man plowed his garden under.
                           (pause)
                   He plowed it under the soil.  He started
                   over.

     Somerset gets to his feet, steadying himself on a pew.

     Doe walks across the altar, picks up a long metal pole with a
     thick wick and candle snuffer on the end.  He lights the wick
     from a near candle.  The flame burns long and thin.  He looks
     down at Somerset, takes out his gun.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   Stay there, Somerset.  Or, I'll kill him
                   right now.

     Doe holds the flaming pole up, near Mills.

     Somerset stops.  He looks up at Mills.

     Mills is straining.  He nods to Somerset, and Somerset sees
     Mills cutting at the rope.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Alright... you don't have to do this,
                   John.  You've already made your point.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Do you think I chose this?  Can you even
                   begin to understand how painful my
                   existence has been?  It's like... like
                   having every sense heightened beyond
                   comprehension.

     Doe lowers the flame, standing below and beside Mills, with his
     attention focused on Somerset.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   So that the stench of the street coats
                   your throat like bile.  So, sugar is so
                   sweet it... it makes your bones ache to
                   the marrow.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You're insane.  That's why.

                                 JOHN DOE
                           (seething)
                   No!  You're wrong!

     Mills continues cutting, bleeding, almost through the rope.  He
     begins to swing his feet slightly, his body swaying.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   I was chosen.  And I've wished a
                   thousand times I could have been a
                   normal man.  Like David Mills, a common
                   man... with a common life.  But, wishing
                   that is my sin.  I can't have it and I
                   shouldn't.

     Doe steps towards Mills.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Don't do this!

                                 JOHN DOE
                   I meant what I said.  I admire David
                   Mills.  I envy David Mills.
                           (pause)
                   Envy is my sin.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No!

     Just as Doe is to put the flame to Mills, the rope is finally
     cut through.  Mills drops, swinging his legs forward, smashing
     Doe in the face, knocking Doe's glasses off.

     Mills hits the floor with a thud.

     Somerset runs forward.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   David, get out!

     Doe has fallen back, dropping the metal pole.  Mills scrambles
     to his feet and charges at Doe, shouting.

     Doe squints, screaming, raises his gun.  Fires twice!

     The bullets catch Mills in mid-run, and carry him off his feet,
     backwards.

     Somerset grips his own gun, just as Mills' body falls, tumbles
     off the altar area and down the stairs in front of him.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   No!

     Somerset lets out a scream of pain and rage that chokes in his
     throat.  He falls to his knees and halts Mills' body.

     Somerset's shaking, unable to breathe, turning Mills over and
     cradling his head in his arms.  Tears come to his eyes.

                                SOMERSET (CONT)
                   David... David?  Please...

     On the altar, Doe throws his gun away.  he starts feeling around
     him, unsteady, looking for his glasses.

     Mills' eyes are closed.  He is still, bloody.  He swallows.

     With one gasp, without a word, he is dead.

     Somerset looks up at Doe, vision blurred by rage and tears.

     Doe stands, putting on his glasses, faces Somerset.

     Somerset lays Mills' body down.  Stands, walks up towards the
     altar, raises his gun.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   You.

     Doe stands, quaking, teeth clenched, fists balled up.  He waits
     for the bullets, falls to his knees.

     The gun trembles in Somerset's hand as Somerset brings the
     barrel to Doe's face.  A millisecond's pause.  Somerset changes
     the angle of fire.  BLAM, he blows John Doe's arm to pieces in a
     splattering explosion.

     Doe screams, falling back, on the altar floor.

     VIEWED FROM FAR BACK IN THE CHURCH

     The entire church with its candles frames the torture:

     Somerset walks to where Doe flops horribly, bleeding.  Somerset
     aims, shoots Doe in the leg.  Doe screams, rolling, trying to
     crawl away, knocking over candle racks.  Somerset follows.  He
     shoots Doe's other leg.  He shoots Doe in the other arm.  Flames
     begin to rise and spread quickly amongst the pews.  Doe
     continues to spasm, wrenching, hand slapping the bloody floor.
     BLAM, BLAM, BLAM.  Somerset steps back from Doe, overturns a
     rack of candles on top of him.  He steps away.  Watching.
     Flames begin rising on Doe's clothing.

     CLOSE ON JOHN DOE'S FACE

     Doe's face, covered in blood, twisted in agony, helpless, flames
     rising.  He continues screaming.

     His glasses crack from the heat.


     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- NIGHT

     Smoke billows from the windows.  The fire is moving quickly,
     ravenous.  It's just starting to light up the night.

     From the front door, Somerset walks weeping, carrying Mills'
     body in his arms.

     INT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- NIGHT

     The seven deadly sin tableau burns.

     Flames cause the paint to bubble and blacken.  Gluttony, greed
     and sloth are already halfway gone.

     Flames eat at pride, lust.

     Wrath and envy are being consumed.  Wrath goes last.  A man with
     bloodied hands, in tones of blue.  Flames devour it.


     EXT.  CEMETERY -- DAY

     A field of blue.  Cops in orderly rows.  The funeral of David
     Mills.  Many police officials and politicians stand in tribute.

     Somerset is here, in his dress blue uniform.  He stares forward,
     still numb, beaten.  Rifles are raised by a corps of riflemen.
     Blanks explode from the barrels.  They reload in unison.

     Somerset looks towards the grace where Mills' casket lies under
     an American flag.  Tracy is there.

     Tracy stands surrounded by strangers at the grave-site.  Her
     head is lowered.  She cries.  Each blast of the rifle salute
     causes her to react with a start.

     EXT.  CEMETERY -- LATER DAY

     The funeral is over.  Somerset stands at the edge of the
     graveyard, looking at the distant city.  Behind him, the
     mourners are still filing out to their cars.

     The captain approaches.  He comes to stand beside Somerset,
     similarly solemn.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   I don't know if I should do this.
                           (pause)
                   We found the motel room Doe must have
                   been staying in after you found his
                   apartment.

     Somerset hasn't acknowledged the captain, still looking away.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT)
                   Anyway... we found this in his
                   belongings.

     The captain takes out a sealed envelope.  Somerset takes it.

     On the envelope: DETECTIVE SOMERSET, handwritten, in red marker.


     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY

     Tracy and Somerset stand near a moving truck in front of the
     apartment building.  MOVERS carry Tracy's belongings to the
     truck.  Mills' car is attached to be towed behind.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I wish I could say something...
                           (pause)
                   Something to... I don't know...

                                 TRACY
                   I'll be okay.

     Somerset nods.

                                 SOMERSET
                   We'll keep in touch.  I'll come visit.

                                 TRACY
                   I'll write to you when we get there.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Take care of yourself.
                           (pause)
                   Take care of the baby.

     Tracy nods.  There's nothing left for them to say.  They're both
     empty.  It's time for them to give a gesture, a kiss, or a hug,
     to say goodbye, but neither makes the first move.

                                 MOVER
                   That's all, Mrs. Mills.  We got
                   everything.

     Movers latch up the back of the truck while the driver climbs
     in and fires up the engine.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Goodbye, Tracy.

                                 TRACY
                   Goodbye, Somerset.

     Somerset walks away.  Tracy walks away, gets in the passenger
     side of the moving truck.


     EXT.  CITY STREET -- LATER DAY

     Sidewalks jammed with people, hurrying.  Somerset walks in a
     fog, hands in his pockets.  He stops at a corner, but does not
     cross.  He stands there, looks up.

     At the city around him.  The buildings towering over him.

     At the cars, buses and taxies racing in the streets, blowing
     their horns and spouting soot.

     Somerset reaches into his jacket pocket, takes out the envelope
     from John Doe.  He studies it in his hand.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (to himself)
                   Oh... man...

     He opens it.  He takes out a small note, handwritten.  It reads:

                                          PLOW THEM UNDER.

     Somerset looks up again, mortified, fighting to keep control of
     his emotions.  He looks around:

     At the miserable people, walking past him.

     At a man at the top of the subway station stairs, sitting in a
     cardboard box, holding out a cup, rattling the change inside.

     A father passes by, holding his young son's hand.  Somerset
     turns to watch them as they pass.  The gather reaches to pick
     the boy up and carry him.  The boy holds tight.

     For some reason, this makes Somerset ache with sorrow.

     The father hugs his son to him, kisses him on the cheek.  The
     boy returns the kiss, with great affection.

     Somerset watches them disappear in the mass of humanity.  He
     looks back at the note in his hand.

     He tears the note up, into little pieces.


     INT.  MOVING TRUCK -- DAY

     The truck moves along in steady traffic.  Tracy sits beside the
     driver.  She looks out at the city across the river.

     She reaches into her pocket, takes out a small manila envelope.
     She opens the envelope and slides two keys on a keychain out
     into her palm.

     She's looking at the keys when she notices something about the
     envelope.  She reopens it, takes out a small folded piece of
     paper.  She unfolds it:

     It is the piece of wallpaper with the pale rose at its center.

     She smiles very faintly.


     EXT.  PRECINCT HOUSE -- EARLY EVENING

     Cars roll by in the street.  Cops come and go.

     Somerset walks up the stairs into the precinct house.

                                                 September 29, 2008


                                                     1.


    FADE IN:

1   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                1

    Autumnal streets seen through the sooty glass of a STREET
    LAMP. Shadows within shadows. Fog in the air. Full
    moon.

                             WATSON (V.O.)
               The year was 1891. London was the
               capital of the world -- the height
               of modernity, with the hiss of
               steam and smell of coal in the
               air. It was also the great
               cesspool into which all the
               sinners and criminals of the
               empire drained.

    Gas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a
    POOL OF LIGHT onto the street, silhouetting a MAN making
    his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern.

                             WATSON (V.O.)
               I had come to London, ten years
               prior, to find a life after the
               Afghan war. I had hoped to start
               a medical practice and settle into
               a nice, steady existence. The
               life I found was anything but nice
               and steady.

    We can see that the MAN wears a cape. The distinctive
    silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable. A
    FURIOUS CLATTER OF HOOVES APPROACHES in the distance.
    The MAN tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing
    stampede.

                             WATSON (V.O.)
               And that had everything to do with
               one man. My friend, my partner,
               my burden...

    The MAN exhales a plume of smoke calmly, giving us the
    impression that he knows something that we don't.

                             WATSON (V.O.)
               ... Sherlock Holmes.

    WHAM! The MAN in the deerstalker hat is KNOCKED FLAT by
    A RUNNING MAN who has vaulted over a wall, sending him,
    his pipe, and hat flying across the cobbles.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                     2.
1   CONTINUED:                                                       1
    The RUNNING MAN leans down as if to assist, but instead
    just picks up the smoker's broken umbrella and studies
    it. The MAN in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he
    recognizes his famous assailant.

                            MAN
              Sherlock Holmes?!

    SHERLOCK HOLMES offers the handle of the umbrella to the
    MAN, hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken
    umbrella.

                            HOLMES
              My apologies. Send the bill to
              John Watson, 221B Baker Street.

    Sherlock Holmes sprints off down an alleyway.   The MAN
    takes a step into the road to watch him go --

    -- and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a
    number of POLICE CARRIAGES, hurtling by on a serious
    pursuit, Victorian-style.

2                                                                    2
    INT. CARRIAGE - CLOSEUP ON THE OFFICERS - NIGHT
    inside. Big, uniformed guys assemble their weaponry -- a
    19th century SWAT team. One man stands out as a leader,
    older than the rest, INSPECTOR LESTRADE.

    A man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers:
    DR. JOHN WATSON, physically as tough as anyone else in
    the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him. A
    thinking man of action.

3   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                   3

    Almost tipping over, the carriage turns onto the
    Embankment and hurtles through the writhing fog along the
    river.

    As the carriage banks, we see Holmes cut across the
    carriage path again, taking a line the horses cannot
    follow.

                                                           CUT TO:


    ANOTHER ANGLE

    Holmes bursts out of an alley, sprints round a corner and
    runs across a courtyard to a side door.

    WE PULL BACK to see the FACADE OF ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.

                                                    3.


4   OMITTED                                                      4


5   INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                     5

    Holmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a
    stairwell. He takes a moment to recover; he's fit, but
    not as fit as he used to be.

    Holmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral
    staircase beyond it. He stops at the doorway and peers
    round the corner.

    A lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards
    Holmes. Holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the
    door. A BOWLER-HATTED MAN ascends the stairs, carrying
    the lantern and a gun.

    He peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the
    shadows, but does not see Holmes, who has pulled his
    black jacket up to conceal his face. The man swings the
    lantern away again. He peers about, confused.

    We see Holmes' eyes from the shadows, as he lowers his
    jacket and thinks through his plan of attack.

                            HOLMES (V.O.)
              Head cocked to the left, partial
              deafness in right ear. First
              point of attack.


    PRE-VISUALIZATION IN VARI-SPEED

    FOCUS ON the spot behind the man's right ear, just at the
    top of the jaw -- the most vulnerable point. Holmes
    launches a hammer blow, and we ramp from 24 fps to 400
    fps (ULTRA SLOW MOTION) as he makes contact. The man's
    head is thrown back as he spins round.

                            HOLMES (V.O.)
              Then throat, paralyze vocal
              chords, stop screaming.

    BACK TO 24 fps. The man's mouth opens to cry out. We
    RAMP BACK UP TO 400 fps as his Adam's Apple is struck
    with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream.

                            HOLMES (V.O.)
              Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker --
              knuckles to liver.

    BACK TO 24 fps, RAMPING TO 400 fps as a devastating
    knuckle-punch to the liver doubles up the bowler-hatted
    thug and crumples him to his knees.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                     4.
5   CONTINUED:                                                       5
    SECOND-TIME ACTION - SUPER FAST REPEAT OF ABOVE

    Holmes flashes out of the shadows, moving so fast that we
    can barely see what he's doing.

    THWACK! Hammer blow to ear.
    CRACK! Karate chop to throat.
    WHAP! Knuckle punch to liver.

    BACK TO NORMAL MOTION as the man crumples to the ground,
    Holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it
    onto his own in one super fast move.

    Holmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his
    lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase.


    POV - BOTTOM OF THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE

    Another bowler-hatted THUG approaches the bottom of the
    staircase. He has seen the lantern light. He draws his
    gun and approaches. Holmes places the lantern on the
    post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the
    shadows.

                            THUG
              What's goin' on, John?

    When he gets no answer, the THUG points his gun to where
    we saw Holmes hide.

    But Holmes appears from the shadows behind the THUG,
    reaches around him, grabs his gun hand and pistol-whips
    him twice with his own gun, dropping him.

    Holmes extracts a cigar from the Thug's top pocket and
    sniffs it appreciatively.

                            HOLMES
              Hhhmm, good cigar. Who do you
              work for?

    He jams the cigar in his own top pocket, picks up the
    man's bowler and proceeds on, further down into the
    crypts.

6                                                                    6

7   INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - BALCONY - NIGHT                          7

    TWO HARD MEN in bowler hats stand guard.

                                                           CUT TO:

    ANOTHER ANGLE

    Holmes surveys the scene AT A DISTANCE, out of sight.
    Eyes alive with intelligence, processing angles when --

    A HEAVY HAND falls on his shoulder.    PULL BACK to
    reveal --

    (The following exchange in whispers.)

                              HOLMES
              Watson.    Perfect timing.

                              WATSON
              Nice hat.

                              HOLMES
              Just got it.    Where's Lestrade?

                            WATSON
              Getting his troops in formation.
              Is that your blood or theirs?

                              HOLMES
              I don't know.    It's an old shirt.

                            WATSON
              You left this behind.

    Watson hands him his pistol.    Holmes looks at it with
    distaste, doesn't take it.

                            HOLMES
              Knew I'd forgotten something.
              Thought I'd left the stove on.

                              WATSON
              You did.

                              HOLMES
              Right.    Shall we?

    This is what they do.    This is what they like.

                                                              CUT TO:


    ANOTHER ANGLE

    The two HARD MEN on guard turn fast and gather together
    as they hear footsteps approaching.

                              MAN #1
              Des?

    He can see the hat, but not the man underneath.

                            WATSON
              Yeah, s'me.




                                                  (CONTINUED)

     Watson takes out the two men. He is more of a brawler,
     using headbutts, knees, and elbows. Less artful, but no
     less effective.

9    INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - BALCONY - NIGHT                      9

     Thugs dispatched, Holmes and Watson look down and see a
     chilling sight.

     A WOMAN IN WHITE LIES INSIDE A CRUDELY-PAINTED PENTACLE
     (five-sided figure), lit with candles at each corner.
     Her eyes roll back in her head, trance-like. A sword has
     been placed at her feet.

     A HOODED FIGURE KNEELS INSIDE A DOUBLE CIRCLE next to the
     pentacle. This is LORD BLACKWOOD. We do not yet see his
     face.

     ANOTHER HOODED FIGURE stands on the edge of the ceremony,
     shrouded in shadow. We do not see his face.

     Suddenly, the woman rises up like a broken puppet, as if
     pulled to her feet by invisible hands.

     Some kind of ritual is about to climax.

     Holmes and Watson head down, fast, not caring if they
     make a noise or not. Their footsteps echo.

9A                                                                9A
     INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS
     The second hooded figure moves back and melts into the
     shadows.

     Still kneeling, still hooded, Blackwood chants softly,
     Latin incantation repeating and repeating.

     ON THE WOMAN as her lips start to move in time with the
     incantation. This is spooky, real, powerful stuff.

     Holmes and Watson leap from the stairs to Blackwood's
     level.

     Blackwood simply ignores them.   The Latin incantation
     never stops.

     Holmes is closer to the girl, Watson closer to Blackwood.

                             WATSON
               The girl.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

     The girl bends with alarming and mechanical suddenness,
     picks up the sword and turns it on herself, ready to
     plunge the point into her heart.

     Holmes lunges, grabs the woman's arm, disarms her and
     pulls her out of the pentacle. She collapses.

     Simultaneously and eerily the candles extinguish and a
     rush of air departs the tunnel.

     Blackwood throws back his hood. We finally see his face.
     His eyes are intense, he is tapped into something dark
     and cruel.

     Holmes and Watson are shocked at his identity.

                             WATSON
               Lord Blackwood?!
     Blackwood applauds softly, strangely.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Well done, Holmes. And Watson as
               well.

     Watson raises his gun, trains it on Blackwood.

                             WATSON
               Stay right there.

     Blackwood raises his hands in front of him, almost
     mockingly.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Tell me, doctor, as a medical man,
               how did you like my work?
                    (beat)
               The fifth one was so scrawny, it
               was over before I'd finished the
               first incision.

     That's more than Watson can take.   He moves in to pistol-
     whip Blackwood --

     -- is stopped suddenly by Holmes' hand grabbing his
     collar.

                             HOLMES
               No.

     Watson struggles forward against Holmes' grip.

                             HOLMES
               Look.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

     Holmes seems to be pointing at Blackwood.   Watson looks,
     sees nothing.

                               HOLMES
               Look.

     Watson looks, and sees it and his eyes flare wide.

     INCHES FROM WATSON'S RIGHT EYE is the needle-pointed end
     of a QUIVERING PIECE OF HIGH-TENSILE WIRE, almost
     invisible --

     -- the other end held between Blackwood's hands.    A
     really nasty concealed weapon.

     One more step and Watson gets impaled in the eye.

                               BLACKWOOD
               What a shame.    That would've been
               fun.

     We hear heavy boots on the balcony, as Lestrade and his
     men finally appear.

     POLICEMEN flood the area.

                             HOLMES
               Impeccable timing, Lestrade.

                             LESTRADE
                    (vis Blackwood)
               Is that -- ?

                               WATSON
               It is.

                             HOLMES
                    (re: girl)
               We've gone for the doctor...
                    (re: Blackwood)
               And one for the rope.

                             LESTRADE
               You should've waited for my help.

                             HOLMES
               If I had, you'd be cleaning up a
               corpse and chasing a rumor.
               Besides, the girl's parents hired
               me, not the Yard.
                    (a wry smile)
               I can't imagine why they thought
               you'd need any assistance.

      Lestrade turns, frustrated. He watches his men yank
      Blackwood out of his double circle, put chains on him,
      while others carry the girl away on a stretcher. She's
      still mouthing the incantation.

      Lestrade eyes the double circle, the pentacle, shakes his
      head, not understanding them.

      Grudgingly, reluctantly, hating himself for needing to,
      he turns to Holmes.

                               LESTRADE
                 What do you make of that?

                               HOLMES
                 Some kind of ceremony. Five girls
                 killed beneath cathedrals at the
                 height of the full moon.
                      (indicating)
                 The double circle's for his own
                 protection.

                               LESTRADE
                 London will breathe a sigh of

                 Bravo, Lestrade. Have a cigar.

      Holmes sticks the villain's cigar in Lestrade's pocket
      and --

      -- A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER lifts his massive camera.

     He heads out, letting his aggravation show once his back
     is turned to his patient.


13   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HALL                                    13

     As Watson exits his apartment and moves down the hall,
     MRS. HUDSON, his landlady, shoots up the stairs with the
     paper. Her nerves are almost as bad as Captain Philips'.

                             MRS. HUDSON
                    (panting)
               I won't go in there by myself, not
               while he's in this state.

                             WATSON
               You're not going in at all.

     Which is a relief to Mrs. Hudson.

                             MRS. HUDSON
               What will I do when you leave?
               He'll burn the house down around
               me. What will he do? Couldn't
               you have a longer engagement?

                             WATSON
               He just needs a new case, that's
               all.

     Captain Philips emerges from Watson's apartment, heads
     towards them.

                             WATSON
               I smell burning.

     Mrs. Hudson's already-frayed nerves take a turn for the
     worse. Watson takes the newspaper from her.

                             WATSON
               Why don't you take Captain Philips
               and give him a nice cup of tea.

                             MRS. HUDSON
               Come on, Captain, let's go down.
               It'll be quieter.

                             WATSON
                    (as they leave)
               And perhaps some tea and bread up
               here when you can.

     Watson heads down the hallway to the last door. A
     tendril of smoke wafts out from under it. Urgent.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

     Nonetheless, Watson   stops, takes a deep breath, gathers
     himself. Something    like this has happened before (is, in
     fact, Holmes' usual   brand of chaos) the difference being,
     now, that Watson is   sick to death of dealing with it.

     Which doesn't mean he won't.

     Newspaper in hand, Watson opens the door, pokes his head
     in, cautiously. He sees --


14   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENTS                       14

     Watson squeezes through the doorway to find that the                
     obstruction is Holmes who is sitting in the dark on a               
     chair, blocking the door, aiming a gun (with an odd                 
     contraption fastened on its barrel) at the wall.                    

     Unadulterated chaos. A series of FLAMING BULLET HOLES               
     blasted into the wall in the (ragged) initials "V.R."

                             WATSON                                      
               May I join you in the armory?                             

                             HOLMES                                      
               Please... Watson, I've been                               
               working on a device which will                            
               suppress the sound of a gunshot.                          

     Watson heads towards the conservatory.                              

                             HOLMES                                      
               Please... Don't, don't, don't...                          

     Watson pulls open the curtains allowing the light to pour           
     in.

               It needs work.     May I see?...                          

     Watson passes him heading to the other side of the room             
     (possibly grabs the gun) picking up a pile of open                  
     letters from a table.

               Gently, gently, Watson...                                 

     Watson whips open more curtains and opens a window.                 

     Holmes crawls on his hands and knees over to a table                
     where he finds his sunglasses and puts them on.                     

     Watson sits on a chair and begins to leaf though the                
     letters.

     A little smile from Holmes.

               Then it's not official.

     Watson exits, leaving Holmes alone in his own chaos.
     For the first time, we see a hint of fear in his eyes.

                                                       CUT TO:

15   INT. THE ROYALE - DINING ROOM                               15

     Holmes sits in the center of a booth waiting for Watson
     to arrive. He is quite uncomfortable in this setting.

     WE SEE HIS OBSERVATIONS -- he picks up little pieces of
     information from the other guests. He notices the
     details on a pair of gentleman's cufflinks, the name on a
     bottle of wine, a surreptitious argument between waiters.
     It all becomes quite overbearing.

     And then Watson and Mary arrive, talking, intent on each
     other -- surprised when they realize Holmes is already
     there.

                              WATSON
               Holmes!   You're early.
                              HOLMES
               Fashionably.

                             WATSON
               May I present Miss Mary Morstan.

     Holmes looks at MARY MORSTAN -- looks again. She's
     beautiful, 30s, and clearly a woman worth marrying.
     Holmes stands. She extends her hand.

                             HOLMES
               My pleasure. For the life of me I
               don't know why it's taken him so
               long to get us properly
               introduced.

     Holmes gestures politely, they sit, Mary and Watson on
     either side of him. There is a decanted bottle of wine
     on the table.

                             MARY
               The pleasure's mine. It really is
               a thrill to meet you, Mr. Holmes.

               They can seem a bit far-fetched
               sometimes, though. Making these
               grand assumptions out of tiny
               details.

                             HOLMES
                    (livening up)
               Oh, no no. The little details are
               by far the most important. Take
               Watson...

                              MARY
               I intend to.

     Watson likes that, Holmes less so -- a forced chuckle.

                             HOLMES
               ... see that walking-stick? A
               rare African snakewood hiding a
               blade of high-tensile steel. A
               few were awarded to veterans of
               the Afghan war, so I can assume
               he's a decorated soldier. Strong,
               brave, born to be a man of action.
               And neat, like all military men.
               Then I check his pockets... ah. A
               stub from a boxing match. Now I
               can infer he's a bit of a gambler.
                    (a wink)
               I'd keep an eye on that, by the
               way.

                             WATSON
               Those days are behind me.

                              HOLMES
               Yes, right behind you.
                     (leaning in to Mary)
               He's cost us the rent more than
               once.

     Mary laughs.

                              MARY
               With all due respect, Mr. Holmes,
               you know him. But what about a
               perfect stranger? What can you
               tell about me?

     Holmes and Watson exchange a glance -- not a good idea.

                             WATSON
               I don't think that's necessary --

                       (at Watson)
                  She insisted.
                       (instantly)
                  You're a governess.

                  Charlie's 7, actually.

     Watson's getting nervous, reaches for the wine.     Holmes
     stops him.

                                HOLMES
                  It's breathing.
                       (back to Mary)
                  Then he's tall for his age.

     The WAITER appears.

               There's nothing wrong with your
               face.

               The gentleman has already ordered
               for himself.
                    (to Watson)
               What would madam care for this
               evening?

     Watson gives Holmes a hard look:   that's a bit much.

                             WATSON
               Give us a few minutes, please.

     He shakes his head, pours wine for all.

                             HOLMES
               There are two drops on your ear...
               India blue's nearly impossible to
               wash off, anyway. A very
               impetuous act by the boy, but
               you're too experienced to react
               rashly -- which is why the lady
               you work for lent you that
               necklace. It's from Asprey's,
               flawless, not the gems of a
               governess.
                    (beat)
               However, the jewels you're not
               wearing tell us rather more.

               Holmes.

     Both Watson and Mary scorch Holmes with their eyes.
     Holmes pauses... pauses, then:

                             HOLMES
               You were engaged.

     Holmes' mind has gotten away from him.   He begins talking
     faster, intensely focused, manic.

                             HOLMES
               The ring is gone. But the lighter
               skin where it sat suggests you
               spent some time abroad wearing it
               proudly.

     As Holmes talks, Watson gets up, moves to help Mary to
     her feet. They're leaving.

                             HOLMES
               Or at least until someone informed
               you of its true and rather modest
               worth, at which point you broke
               off the engagement and returned to
               England for better prospects. A
               doctor perhaps.

     Mary throws Watson's wine in Holmes' face. The
     restaurant goes silent. She turns to leave, turns back.

                             MARY
                    (low)
               Right on all counts but one. I

       Holmes lets the wine drip down over him.

                                 HOLMES
                 She's lovely.

       Holmes is left at an empty table with wine running down
       his face.

       Their orders arrive -- an array of plates piled high.
       The waiter puts them down, Holmes very carefully unfolds
       his napkin and places it into the top of his shirt,
       spaghetti style, takes his knife and fork and begins to
       cut the meat -- then pauses, looks around.


       HOLMES' POV

       Happy couples eating, laughing, talking. Suddenly,
       Holmes hears no words. He just sees their mouths moving.
       The sound of silverware clinking and scraping on fine
       china rises to an ORCHESTRAL ROAR --

       -- which becomes the ROAR of a BLOOD-THIRSTY MOB as a
       fist smashes into a face with a MEATY THUD.

       NIGHT

       Holmes staggers back from the blow. He tastes his own
       blood from a split lip. It interests him.
       He is stripped to the waist, all sinew and gristle. His
       opponent, McMURDO -- huge but flabby -- bangs his fists
       together and moves in.

       Bets rage back and forth through the pressing CROWD.


       HOLMES' POV

       The room and the fight are calm -- the sounds muffled and
       indistinct -- a complete sensory reversal of his
       experience in the restaurant. This is soothing to him,
       the ring is the only place where his mind stops racing.

       He's able to feel, not just think.    He is utterly in the
       moment.

       Holmes' hawk-sharp gaze darts down from McMurdo's face to
       his muscles as they flex, giving him just enough warning
       to move his head so that a punch grazes him.

       McMurdo throws a storm of punches, most of which Holmes
       ducks or blocks. He throws nothing in return, sometimes
       even drops his hands, just using his reflexes to protect
       himself.

       Once or twice, he reaches out and gently touches
       McMurdo's face or throat, when the big man leaves an
       obvious opening. But that's all. Holmes is completely
       in control --

       -- until he notices a face at ringside.


       CLOSEUP ON A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

       Early thirties, a look of pure intrigue in her eyes and a
       slight smile on her lips as she watches the detective.

       Holmes' POV returns to normal when he sees her, the sound
       floods back into the room.

       McMurdo senses his opponent's lapse in concentration and
       steps on Holmes' foot, tramping him and --

       He knocks Holmes down with a thunderous right.

       Holmes rolls over, stands, shakes his head to clear the
       cobwebs. He looks for the woman. She's gone. He turns
       back to McMurdo, smiles.

                                HOLMES
                 Well done.   Thank you.

       Holmes begins walking away.

                                McMURDO
                 Oi!   We ain't done here.

                               HOLMES
                      (walking away)
                 Not done. Finished. And as I
                 said, thank you, it was most
                 pleasurable.

15A-17 CONTINUED: (2)                                             15A-17
       Face twisted in disgust, McMurdo strides forward and
       SPITS CONTEMPTUOUSLY at Holmes, catching him on the back
       of the head. The crowd falls silent.

       Holmes stops.     Feels the back of his head, smells his
       hand.

                                  HOLMES
                   Hm.   Plymouth gin.

       He turns.   Steps back into the ring.

       The crowd applauds, working into a fever pitch, but from
       Holmes' POV, all is calm. His eyes tick slowly, scanning
       McMurdo, locking onto the big man's knee:

       A little scar-tissue, nearly invisible.    As McMurdo
       braces for combat --

       Instantly Holmes unleashes a series of superfast moves,
       incorporating exotic martial arts. The blinding
       combination culminates with a spinning kick to the big
       man's knee, which buckles altogether wrong.

       McMurdo falls, over and out. Holmes is already turning
       away before the giant hits the canvas.

       He sees the crowd fall silent, they're not sure if they
       like it, there really isn't any sport. He doesn't care.

       Passing fellow fighters and flirty barmaids, Holmes
       strides out of the bar, battered on the outside, soothed
       inside. He grabs a bottle in his hand. Taking a huge
       swig, he climbs the stairs towards the upstairs rooms.

18A                                                                   18A
       INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
       A candle shivers, casting jagged shadows. A row of stone
       cells. The sound of prisoners SCREAMING in the dark. A
       full-scale riot is on.

       Five GUARDS charge down the corridor, banging on the
       doors to quiet the prisoners.

       The GUARD CAPTAIN approaches a young guard, CHARLIE, who
       is frozen on the spot.

                                 GUARD CAPTAIN
                   Charlie, what the hell's going on

                It's Jack, he tried to stop
                Blackwood from doing his spells.
                And now he's in some kind of fit.

      The Guard Captain continues around the corner. We see
      another guard, JACK, lies convulsing on the floor.

                              GUARD CAPTAIN
                     (to the prisoners in
                      the cell next to

                You lot shut it!
                     (to the guards)
                Charlie, get, down here and get
                him to the infirmary.

      The guards pick Charlie up and carry him away.

      INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - BLACKWOOD'S CELL - NIGHT
      Blackwood sits dead center in the dark.   Eyes closed,
      WHISPERING ungodly sounds.

      On the walls the scrawls of a madman: wild symbols,
      sketches of animals, a headless sphinx, an upside-down
      cross. A hint of some method to his madness.

                              GUARD CAPTAIN
                All right, Blackwood, what's this
                all about?

                              BLACKWOOD
                I've a request.
                               GUARD CAPTAIN
                You don't get nothin' `til you
                stop this devil nonsense. That's
                a holy book --

      Blackwood closes his eyes again, resumes his soft murmur.

                              GUARD CAPTAIN
                     (louder)
                -- and you will respect it!

      Blackwood starts whispering FASTER.   LOUDER.

                              GUARD CAPTAIN
                Boy, you want me to muzzle you --

      Suddenly, the Captain starts COUGHING. He's confused.
      He coughs harder. Prisoners watch him stumble backwards.

     Blackwood keeps whispering.     The Captain falls to one
     knee, keeps coughing.

     Finally the Captain COUGHS SOMETHING UP, spits it out
     onto the stone floor. He looks down, horrified:

     It's a small CATHOLIC CROSS on a chain.

     Prisoners start SHOUTING.   The RAVEN at Blackwood's
     windowsill flutters away.   Other guards run up,
     terrified.

               Get him to the infirmary, now!

     Guards pull the Captain away. The remaining guard picks
     up the cross, stares at Blackwood, chilled. Blackwood's
     eyes snap open.

                             BLACKWOOD

21   INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - BARE-KNUCKLE BOXING RING - NIGHT       21

     The fighting is over and the pub is closing. Only a few
     people remain cleaning up, mopping the beer and blood.
     Watson enters fast, looks around, and moves upstairs.

22                                                                22
     INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - ATTIC
     Watson walks down a dingy hallway towards a door. With a
     look of resignation, he opens the door to see Holmes
     sitting alone in the sterile, barely furnished room.

     Holmes faces the corner, playing scales on his VIOLIN.
     On the table next to him, an upside down BEER STEIN and
     an assortment of prescription medicine bottles.

     Watson approaches, sees Holmes has bloodshot eyes from
     lack of sleep.

     Watson picks one of the medicine bottles which is open.
                             WATSON
               You know this is for eye surgery?

                             HOLMES
               I find that it lifts my spirits.

                             WATSON
               It's a pathological amorbic
               process, it increases tissue
               change and weakness. And you know
               what a black reaction comes on you
               afterwards.

     No answer. More scales. Watson approaches, sees Holmes
     has bloodshot eyes from lack of sleep. The beer stein is
     full of FLIES all buzzing about.

               Look at this. If you play a
               chromatic scale, they move
               clockwise. As soon as you switch
               to a pentatonic scale --

     Holmes plays a different scale, the flies all stop
     moving, stick to the glass.

                             WATSON
                    (faking interest)
               Really? What about when you --
               oops --

     Watson picks up the glass, lets loose the flies. Holmes
     looks up; Watson's already moving for the door, pissed.

                 You're Blackwood's last request.
                 Says he has information he'll give
                 only to you.

     But Watson's already out the door.


23   EXT. LONDON - DAWN                                             23

     Watson and Holmes ride in a cab, passing familiar
     landmarks as the city comes to life. They sit in
     silence, tension hanging between them. Finally Holmes
     grabs Watson's bag, rummages around and pulls out a clean
     white shirt.

     Watson looks out the window, frustrated. He sees THE
     HALF-CONSTRUCTED MASS OF TOWER BRIDGE. Near ground
     level, workers take down a large BLACKWOOD STEEL sign.

                               HOLMES
                 Look at that structure. What has
                 it been? Five years' work
                 already? Are you aware that is
                 the first combination of bascule
                 and suspension bridge. Very
                 innovative.

     No reply.

     As Holmes is taking off his jacket, he reaches into his
     pocket and pulls out a wad of money.

                there so I laid your customary
                bet --

     Silence.   Holmes takes off his shirt.

                              HOLMES
                You're right... I'll keep it with
                your check book, locked safely
                away in my drawer.

     Silence.   Holmes pulls on the clean shirt.

                              HOLMES
                The opera house is featuring Don
                Giovanni and I could easily
                procure two tickets if you had
                some cultural inclination this
                evening.

     Silence.

                              HOLMES
                You have the grand gift of
                silence, Watson. It makes you
                quite invaluable as a companion.

     Watson punches him square in the face.

                              WATSON
                And your grand gift is the uncanny
                ability to demoralize people. I
                was aware she'd been engaged. She
                told me.
     Holmes rubs his jaw.

                              HOLMES
                So that's a `no' to the opera
                then?

     Watson's steaming.   Holmes puts on his vest.

                              WATSON
                That's my waistcoat.

                              HOLMES
                It's too small for you.

                              WATSON
                Well, it's my property and I want
                it back.

     out of the carriage window. Holmes frowns, looks out the
     opposite window.

     Already a CROWD is gathering outside the jail, papers are

     zealots and occultists swarm. Police keep them away from

                             WATSON
               You go ahead. I've no business

     A pale, nervous GUARD leads Holmes down the shadowy
     corridor. All the cells are now EMPTY.

                             HOLMES
               Where are all the other prisoners?

                             GUARD
               We had to move `em, sir, otherwise
               we were going to have a riot on
               our hands. There's something
               about him... it's like he can get
               inside your head.

     Holmes can see how spooked the Guard is.

                             HOLMES
               I'm sure I can find my own way
               from here, if you have other
               duties to attend to.

               Much obliged, sir. Thank you,
               thank you.

     The Guard high-tails it out of there.

     Holmes approaches Blackwood's cell, strolling
     insouciantly. No way this creep's getting to him. In
     the shadows he can barely make out Blackwood, who's
     reading aloud to himself. Holmes listens, getting
     closer.

                             HOLMES
               A small point of concern.

                             BLACKWOOD
               How can I help?

                             HOLMES
               I'd already followed the murders
               with some interest and while my
               heart went out to the families of
               the victims, I couldn't but notice
               a criminal mastery in the stroke
               of your brush --

                             BLACKWOOD
               You're too kind.

                             HOLMES
               However, by comparison, your work
               in the crypt was akin to a finger
               painting.

     Suddenly, Blackwood is right at the bars, close to
     Holmes.

                             BLACKWOOD
               So now you're curious as to
               whether there's a larger game
               afoot, and that's why you're
               really here.

                             HOLMES
               Actually, my friend will pronounce
               you dead shortly and I thought I
               might keep him company.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Allow me to enlighten you. Your
               mistake is to imagine that
               anything earthly has led to this
               moment. Your error in judgement
               is to assume I've been holding the
               brush at all -- I am merely the
               channel.

     Despite the bars between them, the men are close
     together. Holmes seems to be studying Blackwood's ear.

                             HOLMES
               My only wish is that I'd caught
               you earlier. I might have spared
               five lives.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Those lives were a necessity, a
               sacrifice. Five otherwise
               meaningless creatures called to
               serve a greater purpose.

                             HOLMES
               I wonder if they'd let Watson and
               I dissect your brain -- after
               you're hanged, of course. I'd
               wager there's some deformity that
               would be scientifically
               significant. Then you would serve
               a greater purpose, too.

                              BLACKWOOD
               Mr. Holmes, you must widen your
               gaze. I'm concerned you
               underestimate the gravity of
               coming events.
                    (beat)
               For you and I are bound on a
               journey that will twist the very
               fabric of nature.
                    (beat)
               I sense fragility beneath your
               mask of logic, and it worries me.
               Steel your mind, Holmes, I need
               you.

     Holmes steps back, shakes his head.

                             HOLMES
               I must say, you've come a long way
               down from the House of Lords.

                             BLACKWOOD
               But I will rise again.

                             HOLMES
               Bon voyage, Blackwood.

     As Holmes walks away, Blackwood calls after him.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Pay attention! Three more shall
               die, and there is nothing you can
               do to save them.

               made it all possible it will be
               the last sane thought in your

28   INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - CORRIDOR - MORNING                 28

     Holmes walks down the corridor, meets Lestrade and a
     PRIEST. The place is bustling with cops and officials.

                             LESTRADE
               What did he want?

                             HOLMES
               Nothing.

     Holmes looks at the priest.

                             HOLMES
               Don't think you're needed, Father.
               Not for this one.

     INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - GALLOWS
     The room where the execution takes place is packed to the
     rafters with senior officials, members of the government
     and cops. We get a good look at some of the faces.
     Watson is there too. Blackwood walks up into the noose.

     INT. 221 BAKER STREET - DAY
     Holmes is out cold, lying on his tiger skin rug.                     

     CRACK!   His eyes fly open.   CRACK!!

                London's so bleak this time of

     REVEAL: Irene Adler sits on the stairs near Holmes' lab,           
     cracking walnuts. She stands and Holmes watches her                
     every move as she crosses to him. She leans down,                  
     putting the walnuts in front of him and flashes him a              
     smile.                                                             

                             IRENE                                      
               Not that I'm pining for New                              
               Jersey.                                                  

     Irene gets up to cross the room. Only once her back is             
     turned does Holmes lever himself upright, stunned by this          
     intrusion. As soon as she clears he quickly moves over             
     to a concealed safe. He tests the door to make sure it's           
     still locked.                                                      

                             IRENE                                      
               I prefer to travel in the winter.                        

     As she passes a small table that has been outfitted with           
     tea, dried fruit, olives, etc...                                   

                             IRENE                                      
               I brought a few souvenirs. Dates                         
               from Jordan, tea from Ceylon and                         
               olives from Cyclades. I thought                          
               we'd have a little tea party to                          
               cheer us up.                                             

     Irene grabs a file from Holmes' desk.                              

                             IRENE                                      
               I came across this as I was                              
               setting up.                                              

     Irene opens the file, flips through newspaper clippings            
     and police reports, her back to Holmes.                            

                             IRENE

     Holmes stealthily turns down a photo of Irene, just                
     before she turns back to face him.

               someone. There's nobody more                             
               brilliant or who knows London                            
               better than you. Plus, it's a                            
               wonderful opportunity to see you                         
               again.                                                   

     TRACK INTO Irene's hypnotically beautiful eyes. Holmes             
     almost melts. Then, Irene reaches for something inside             
     her jacket and Holmes grabs her hand.                              

                             IRENE                                      
               Why are you so suspicious?                               

                             HOLMES                                     
               Should I answer chronologically or                       
               alphabetically?                                          

     Irene pulls out an ENVELOPE.

               This is all the information you

               Who are you working for?                                

     Just for a brief moment, she can't hide the anxiety in            
     her eyes.

     She stands and pulls out a large bag of coins.                   

                              HOLMES
               Keep your money. I didn't say I'd
               take the case.

     She ignores him. Holmes examines the envelope. On it is          
     stamped the letterhead of the Grand Hotel. She pauses            
     behind him as she exits.

               They gave me our old room.                             

     As she walks out she puts her photo back upright.                


31   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - STAIRS                                31

     Irene descends the stairs just as Watson is coming in.
     He lifts his hat, waits for her to pass --

                              IRENE
               Hello, John.

     -- does a speechless double-take when he sees who it is.
     Irene keeps moving.

                                                    34.


32   EXT. LONDON STREET                                             32

     We PICK UP Irene crossing a street. She passes a DARK
     ALLEYWAY. Pauses. Looks. She turns into the alley.
     HOLD ON the alley for a long beat. Too dark to see much
     in there.

                                                          CUT TO:


     IRENE

     emerges from the alley holding a lovely bunch of roses.
     She sniffs them appreciatively, walks on.

     IRENE

     approaches a waiting carriage, looks around her, gets in.

                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. CARRIAGE
     Irene sits, turns to address a man-shaped shadow filling
     the opposite corner of the carriage. Before she can
     speak, a gesture from the shadow stills her. This is
     PROFESSOR MORIARTY.

     Irene is made to wait as Moriarty finishes writing a
     complex mathematical equation (in astronomy), folds the
     paper to reveal that it is addressed to THE ROYAL
     ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY, cracks open the carriage window and
     slides the folded paper partway out.

     Someone waiting outside takes the paper, and their
     footsteps clatter away.

     Moriarty closes the window, and the carriage starts
     moving. A full beat goes by before he turns to Irene,
     finally prepared to engage with her.

                             MORIARTY
               I assume he'll do it?

                             IRENE
               Not for money, but for me.   I
               wager he'll find our man within
               twenty-four hours.

                             MORIARTY
               You wager?

               I'm certain.

                                MORIARTY
               A better word.     I sincerely hope
               it's accurate.

                                IRENE
               I --

     Suddenly, the coach comes to a halt, they lurch forward.


34   EXT. LONDON STREET                                            34

     A rough-looking BEGGAR wearing an eye patch has fallen
     under a wheel of the coach.

                                BEGGAR
               Ow, me leg!

               You run me over, sir, yes you did!

                             COACH DRIVER
               You fell right into the carriage!

     The Beggar is up, limping toward the window where
     Moriarty and Irene sit. He has disgusting blackened
     teeth.

                             BEGGAR
               A little charity would go a long
               way, yes it would, sir.

     He reaches toward the window. Within a nanosecond,
     Moriarty extends his hand into which a PISTOL appears,
     delivered by a concealed mechanism (Travis Bickle style).

     The gun rests on the Beggar's forehead. The cold eyes of
     the man that holds the weapon bore into the skull of the
     Beggar, who backs off in fear. The carriage moves on.


35   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENT                         35

     Holmes is washing his face in a basin on the other side
     of the room, completely transformed now, utterly alive.
     Watson approaches, very concerned, almost enraged.

                             WATSON
               Look at you, I can't believe you                           
               ran after her like a schoolboy                             
               again. Leaping about, all                                  
               aflutter. Are you a masochist?                             

                             HOLMES
               Allow me to explain.                                       

                             WATSON
               Don't you remember what she did to                         
               you? She turned you inside out,                            
               she made a proper idiot of you.                            
               I'm sorry, you were going to                               
               explain something...

               No, I don't agree. It's more than                         
               a technicality. You're                                    
               misrepresenting the dimensions of

               I've upset you, I can tell.    I've                       
               said too much.

                  No, I'm just saying, one has                            
                  disproportionate limbs the other

       Holmes plucks his violin, the notes play over a FLASHBACK
       of the previous scene, all from HOLMES' POINT OF VIEW.

36     FLASHBACK - INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENT           36

       We see Irene step out.

                                IRENE
                  Why don't I see myself out.

       Once Irene leaves, he steps quickly to a window, and
       looks out to see her walking down Baker Street, turning
       down an alley. He bolts    into --


36A    INT. 221 BAKER ST. - CORRIDOR                               36A

       He sees Watson coming up the stairs. Before Watson can
       speak, Holmes snatches his coat and runs down the other
       end of the corridor. He JUMPS out the window to --


37     EXT. 221 BAKER ST. - REAR YARD                               37

       Holmes flies from the window and lands neatly on a tin
       roof. The jump to the next level is a more taxing
       prospect. Holmes weighs the distance and hurls himself
       down with a determined look. He lands just right.


37A-37D OMITTED                                               37A-37D

                                                       37.


38    EXT. COAL SHED                                                 38

      Holmes jumps off the shed, heads for the street one block
      over from Baker Street.


38A   EXT. LONDON STREET                                            38A

      He runs down the mews in great haste, stops at the same
      alley that Irene disappeared into -- but at the other
      side.

                                                          CUT TO:


      HOLMES' POV DOWN ALLEY

      from concealment:    Irene walks towards a MAN HOLDING A
      BUNCH OF ROSES.

                                 MAN WITH ROSES
                   Got some roses for you,
                   sweetheart. Cut you a deal `cos
                   you're so pretty.

                                 IRENE
                   Oh, how nice of you.

      Even without the man -- who is scrofulous and sly -- no
      woman in her right mind would go down this alley.

38B                                                                 38B
      INT. ALLEY
      The man with the roses beckons Irene forward. Another
      man steps in behind her, trapping her. He closes in to
      grab her --

      -- and WHAP!WHAP!WHAP! Gets three cosh-strikes across
      the chin, dropping him immediately.

      Still holding the roses, the man finds himself smacked up
      against the bricks with Irene's hand over his mouth.

      Quick as a snake, she slices upwards with a razor-sharp
      knife, cutting his belt, then his clothes, all the way to
      his collar. The move ends with Irene's finger over her
      own mouth, signalling the mugger to be quiet. He obeys,
      eyes bulging.

      Irene frisks him expertly. She's mugging the mugger.
      There is excitement in her eyes; this turns her on.



                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                     37A.
38B   CONTINUED:                                                  38B
                              IRENE
                Oh, look, a wallet. Doesn't look
                like yours, does it? And --
                naughty boy -- here's another
                one. I'll return them, shall I?

      She takes both wallets, takes the roses --

                              IRENE
                These are lovely, thank you.

      -- and leaves, stepping daintily over the crumpled man on
      the floor.

      On second thoughts, she turns back, takes his wallet too,
      then leaves.

                                                           CUT TO:


      ANGLE ON HOLMES

                              HOLMES
                Now, that's the Irene I know.

      He hurries after Irene down the alley.

38C                                                                  38C
      EXT. LONDON STREET
      Holmes exits the alley, catches a glimpse of Irene
      through a STREET FAIR, which is being assembled.

      Holmes picks up the pace.

      He snatches a HAT from a one-eyed old BEGGAR with his
      hand out. He drops a coin in his hand, then another coin
      and snatches the beggar's eye patch too.

      He runs past a coal cart, snags a lump of coal, rubs it
      on his face and hands, then pops it in his mouth, chews
      it to blacken his teeth.

      He pauses to singe the sleeve of Watson's coat on a
      fairground fire-breather's flames, runs on.


39    EXT. LONDON STREET                                              39

      Holmes emerges as the beggar we saw previously. Again he
      stops the coach and again the gun comes out, but this
      time we can see that Holmes gets a view of the man on the
      other end of the weapon before the carriage pulls away.

                                                      37B.


40   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENTS (PRESENT)             40

     Holmes strums one more chord on his violin, thinking.

     Irene's bag of money still sits on the table.                       

                             HOLMES
               This man intrigues me, Watson.                            
               He's got Adler on edge.                                   

                             WATSON
               Which is no mean feat.                                    

                             HOLMES                                      
               She's intimidated, scared...                              

                             WATSON                                      
               And yet she works for him. That's                         
               bad money. It's nothing to do                             
               with me, but leave this case.                             

     Holmes motions to the bills.

                             HOLMES
               Well, I may not have a choice. A                          
               man has to make a living. After                           
               all, I'll be paying the rent                              
               entirely on my own.                                       

                             WATSON                                      
               You know what, I've had just about                        
               enough --                                                 

                             HOLMES

                             VOICE (O.S.)
               Mister Holmes, sir...?

     He turns to see... CONSTABLE CLARK standing at the door.
     Breathless, pale, scared.

                             CONSTABLE CLARK
               Inspector Lestrade asks that you
               come with me, at once.

               What's he done now, lost his way
               to Scotland Yard? Watson, grab a
               compass. You means us.                           

                               WATSON
               Us means you.

               dead.

                             WATSON                             
               Well that's clever seeing as how I               
               pronounced him dead myself.

               morning.

                             WATSON
               I'll leave this one in your                      
               capable hands. I have tea with                   
               Mary and her parents this evening.               

     Watson walks into his office.                              

                             HOLMES
               It is not my reputation at stake                 
               here.

                             HOLMES                             
               Like it or not, it's a matter of                 
               professional integrity. No girl                  
               wants to marry a doctor who can't                
               tell if a man's dead or not.                     

     They all move to the exit.

               Watson, you'd do well to hide your               
               medical certificates in case                     
               they're revoked.

41   EXT. THE BLACKWOOD ESTATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY                 41

     Judging by the estate, Blackwood comes from old money,
     and lots of it. We FOLLOW the carriage hurrying Holmes
     and Watson forward.


42   EXT. THE BLACKWOOD BURIAL PLOT - DAY                           42

     Generations of wealth buried in moss-covered marble
     memorials. Not a place for a picnic, not even on a
     bright sunny day -- and it's starting to rain.

     A COP stops the carriage, opens the door. Holmes and
     Watson exit, Watson carries a black leather FORENSICS
     KIT.

     They walk up the pathway towards the Blackwood Family
     Crypt. Watson barely lifts his head, scanning the ground
     while Holmes appears to have taken an interest in a clump
     of trees in the distance.

                             WATSON
               Look at this mess. Nothing but
               standard-issue police bootprints.
               Any possible evidence there might
               have been has been trampled.

               Scotland Yard at their finest,
               once again.

     Police lamps light one large marble CRYPT. The cops are
     in tight clusters, whispering to themselves, spooked.
     They'd rather be anywhere but here.

     As Holmes and Watson approach, they see the marble doors
     of the crypt have been BLASTED OPEN FROM THE INSIDE.
     Holmes and Watson share a quick glance -- this is
     interesting.

     Lestrade emerges from the crypt.   He is sweating, shaken.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

     Holmes offers Lestrade his handkerchief, Lestrade waves
     it off.

                             LESTRADE
               Look at those slabs of marble --
               they're half a ton each if they're
               a pound -- smashed outward like
               they were nothing.

     On second thought, Lestrade does take Holmes'
     handkerchief.

                             LESTRADE
               Explain it if you can, Holmes.

     Holmes inspects the door, checking the hinges. He
     notices the Blackwood CREST, and the image of a SPHINX.

                             HOLMES
               And the coffin?

                             LESTRADE
               We're digging it up now. The
               witness is over there. You can
               question him if you like -- but
               you won't get much.

     The old GROUNDSKEEPER, pale and terrified, stands out of
     the rain under an ancient cypress tree.

     Watson heads for him.   Holmes disappears in the opposite
     direction.

     As soon as their backs are turned, Lestrade marches over
     to a nervous knot of cops, grabs a fistful of blue in
     each hand, drags his boys in close. He doesn't want
     Holmes or Watson to hear this.

                             LESTRADE
                    (low, angry)
               If you lot don't stop behaving
               like a bunch of superstitious milk
               maids, you're on double-time!
               You're an embarrassment! Also,
               you're forbidden to talk about
               this to anyone, not a word. Are
               we bloody clear on that?

     The cops nod, duly chastened.

                                                         CUT TO:

     THE GROUNDSKEEPER

     mumbles the Lord's Prayer under his breath. Watson
     immediately goes into doctor mode checking his pulse,
     looking in his eyes.

     The Groundskeeper just keeps praying. Watson takes a
     boiled sweet from his pocket, pops it in the man's mouth
     and gently sits him down.

     Holmes walks over holding a small branch from a tree.

                                WATSON
               He's in shock.     We should give him
               a few moments.

     Lestrade stomps up.

                              LESTRADE
               The witness stated that he saw
               Lord Blackwood rise from the
               grave.
                     (at Watson,
                      accusingly)
               Well? You pronounced the man
               dead.

                             WATSON
                    (stung)
               He had no pulse.
                             HOLMES
               Inspector, do you know if this is
               a spruce or a sycamore?

     Lestrade shakes his head.    It hasn't been a good day for
     him, or the Yard.

     There's a clunk. They all turn to see the coffin has
     been extracted from the crypt.

     Four beefy, soil-stained cops emerge lugging the coffin.
     They place it on the ground, step back, crossing
     themselves, murmuring, plainly terrified. Holmes
     chuckles.

                                LESTRADE
               OPEN IT!!

     But no one moves. The cops pass a CROWBAR around as if
     it were red-hot. Watson's had enough. He marches
     forward --

     -- snatches the crowbar away, jams it under the lid and
     levers it off with a slow, eerie groan.

     Holmes and Lestrade move forward, the cops move backward.

     The coffin is filled with EARTH, overflowing. They brush
     away a layer of dirt, to reveal... A DEAD BODY in the
     coffin. The body is a much smaller man than Blackwood,
     in everyday clothes, with red hair.

                             LESTRADE
               That's not Blackwood.

                              HOLMES
               Now that we have a firm grasp of
               the obvious...

     Watson opens his forensic kit, disturbed. Vials, silver
     tools. He takes a CALIPER, begins examining the body.

                             WATSON
               Lividity is late stage. Diptera
               deposits are approximately --
                    (measuring)
               -- three quarters of an inch,
               putting the time of death at ten
               to twelve hours ago.

                             HOLMES
               Inspector, may I see your pen?

     Lestrade hands over a nice fountain pen, still stunned.
     Holmes takes the pen and pries open the corpse's mouth,
     revealing: two missing teeth in the man's jaw.

                             WATSON
               Missing two incisors in the upper
               jaw...
                    (a look at Holmes)
               Adler's midget.

     Holmes spots something glinting in the man's dirt-filled
     pocket. He uses the pen to fish out: a POCKET WATCH.

                             HOLMES
               All yours, Inspector.

     Holmes hands the pen back to Lestrade. Lestrade looks at
     it with dismay, takes it in Holmes' handkerchief -- a
     small measure of revenge.

       Holmes and Watson begin walking away from the crypt.
       Lestrade follows, anxious. Holmes shows him the dusty
       pocket watch.

                               HOLMES
                 Scratches around the keyhole where
                 the watch is wound. Most drunks
                 are the same, and pawnbrokers
                 scratch the ticket number and
                 their initials inside the lid.
                 This one has five, so the owner --

                               GROUNDSKEEPER (O.S.)
                 He was walking.

       They all stop, suddenly. The old Groundskeeper stands in
       front of them, ready to unburden himself.

                               GROUNDSKEEPER
                      (quivering voice)
                 He was walking but his feet didn't
                 touch the ground. And I'm not
                 daft, I know what I saw and I know
                 Lord Blackwood. He was as alive
                 as you or me. It's not right.
                 It's not natural.
                      (turns, leaves)
                 Our Father Who art in heaven...
                 (etc.)

       All three men watch the Groundskeeper go. A sudden gust
       of wind moans eerily. They all want to get the hell out
       of there.

                               HOLMES
                 Now the game is afoot, Watson.

42A-50 OMITTE                                                  42A-50


51     EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY                                     51

       Holmes stands in the middle of the street contentedly
       observing humanity. Watson ENTERS FRAME and hands Holmes
       a bundle wrapped in newspaper.

                               WATSON
                 I fail to see how these fish and
                 chips are different from the three
                 other places we passed along the
                 way.

                                  HOLMES
                 Trust me.

               Just eat.

     Holmes complies hungrily and they start to stroll along.
     Watson appears preoccupied.

                             WATSON
               You know, I've seen things in war
               that I couldn't explain. I once
               heard a man predict his death,
               down to the number and placement
               of the bullet holes that killed
               him. You have to admit that a
               supernatural explanation is at
               least theoretically possible.

                    (mouth full, near
                     indecipherable)
               Never theorize before you have
               data. Invariably, you end up
               twisting facts to suit theories,
               instead of theories to suit facts.
               Adler's midget is the key to this.

     Holmes pulls out a JEWELER'S LOUP, screws it into his
     eye, and flips Reordon's watch open. He examines the
     lid.

                             HOLMES
               Hmm... scratches around the
               keyhole, what does that tell you?

                             WATSON
               The owner was most likely a drunk.
               Each time he wound the watch his
               hand would slip, hence the
               scratches.

                             HOLMES
               Very good, Watson! You've
               developed considerable powers of
               your own.

     Watson looks quite chuffed.

                             HOLMES
               Let's see now, there are several
               sets of initials scored into the
               lid.

                             WATSON

     Watson looks extremely pleased with himself until they
     turn a corner into a street where EVERY SECOND SHOP IS A
     PAWN SHOP. His face falls.

                             HOLMES
               The most recent is M.H...

     Watson shakes his head.

               I think not.

                             WATSON
               The time. Which leads me to
               deduce that I'm already late for
               my appointment with Mary. You
               remember, the one I was leaving

               coming to dig up dead bodies with

     A GYPSY PALM READER approaches Watson as he turns to
     leave.

                             PALM READER
               Reckon your future, sir?

                             HOLMES
               Perhaps we do need a little help
               from the beyond.

                                WATSON
               No, thank you.

     She grabs his hand anyway.

               You need to hear what I have to
               tell you.

     Watson is so taken aback by the urgency and gravity of
     her tone that he doesn't pull away.

                             PALM READER
               I see two men, brothers. Not in

               It's the most honest prediction
               old Flora has made in years. And
               you know it yourself, Watson.
               That is precisely the reason you
               can't find a suitable ring.
               You're terrified of a life without
               the thrill of the macabre, as well
               you should be.

     Holmes swallows the last of his cod and casts the
     wrapping aside, pleased with himself.

                             WATSON
               Do you still have my cut from the
               fight?

     Holmes digs into a pocket, produces a wad of coins.

                                HOLMES
               Why, do you --

     Watson snatches the money, storms into Madison and Haig.

     Holmes is confused until he spots a sign in the window:
     "Large selection of engagement rings for every wallet."

     Holmes starts to look a bit nervous. As he follows
     Watson, he is intercepted by the Palm Reader who grabs
     his arm.

                             PALM READER
               I seen something in his hand.
               Darkness and great pain. Mortal
               peril. Warn your friend, he's not
               safe.

     Even Holmes is taken aback by this.

     EXT. LONDON EAST END - MINUTES LATER
     Holmes and Watson move down the street, the pawnshop
     behind them. Now Watson is smiling, and Holmes is not.
     Watson is beaming at: an ENGAGEMENT RING in a box.

                                WATSON
               Not bad, eh?

     Holmes turns away, looks down at the TICKET he got from
     the pawnshop: an ADDRESS.

                             HOLMES
               Reordon's lodgings should be right
               around this bend. Here we are...

     windows are boarded up.

                             HOLMES
               Looks promising. And possibly
               dangerous. Oh, well, give my
               regards to Mary.

     Holmes winds his way up a twisting flight of creaky
     stairs, finds a door with scratches on the keyhole.

     Holmes takes out his knife and goes to work on the lock.
     It is fiddly. It takes him a while. He kneels to get a
     better angle with the knife.

     CRACK! Watson's boot flashes past him as he KICKS the
     door off its hinges. Off Holmes' pleased reaction, he
     gestures them inside.

                             WATSON
               I can spare ten minutes.

     INT. REORDON'S ROOMS - DAY
     The squalid doorway opens into a series of dark rooms.
     Watson lights a lamp which reveals details of an interior
     that stops them both in their tracks:

     From floor to ceiling, every available inch is covered in
     writing, biblical Latin and Hebrew. Scrawled-on paper
     and pages are tacked to walls and carved into the
     plaster, crucifixes punctuate the yards of text and
     collage, strange pagan charms hang from the ceiling.

                             HOLMES
               He clearly felt something was
               coming to get him.

                                WATSON
               Something did.

     They move further inside where there is a hallway and a
     basic bedroom. Holmes inspects it, moves through a door.

               Watson, come take a look at this --

     Watson puts down what he was looking at, goes towards...


56   INT. REORDON'S LAB                                            56

     Instantly, Watson covers his nose with a handkerchief.

                              WATSON
                    (reeling)
               Bloody hell...

     The room is stacked with an alarming amount of scientific
     and biological paraphernalia. Some of it gives off a
     distinctly electrical hum. Ungodly fragments of limbs
     and matter float in jars.

                             HOLMES
                    (inhaling deeply,
                     loving it)
               Ammonium sulfate.

     In the center of the room, something ROTTING. An
     experiment generating a massive stench, a seething cloud
     of flies. Holmes and Watson step closer to see:

     DEAD FROGS. Eyes opened impossibly wide, their bodies
     frozen in strange contortions, as if mid-death-rattle.

     Holmes moves around the room, sniffing like a morbid
     perfumer. Watson does his best not to gag.

                             HOLMES
                    (mumbles)
               Phosphorous... Formaldehyde...

                             WATSON
               Appears he was attempting to
               follow occult formula with
               scientific practice.

     Watson moves to the stove, sees a sheaf of BURNT PAPERS.
     He digs through them, finds one piece not as burnt as the
     rest. A CREST stamped on it, impossible to read.

     Watson digs through his forensic bag, pulls out vials.

                             WATSON
               Has he any hydrochloric acid?

     Holmes shuffles a few bottles, tosses one to Watson.
     Watson catches it, starts pouring the acid, another
     chemical on a clean sheet of paper.

     Holmes senses something, moves into the next room.       He
     stops at an open window, smells the CURTAINS:

                              HOLMES
                Irene was here.

     Watson presses the chemical-soaked paper onto the burnt
     paper.

                              WATSON
                Why would she hire you to find
                him, if she planned to do the job
                herself?

                              HOLMES
                Maybe it's not the man she's
                after, but something else.
                Something he was working on?
                              WATSON
                Ferrocyanide. Sucks the iron
                right out of the ink. Long as
                it's not too burnt...

     Watson keeps rubbing the paper together, puts it by the
     lantern. Slowly, faint words APPEAR on the blank page.
     Ghostly chemistry. Watson sees the crest is Blackwood's.

                              WATSON
                He worked for Blackwood.

     Holmes gets a whiff of something, raises an eyebrow.       He
     starts walking back to the other room.

                              HOLMES
                There's one odor I can't put my
                finger on. Sweet, almost like
                perfume... or sugar....
                     (stops, sniffs)
                Barley sugar.

     They are followed by DREDGER, a huge man, just shy of
     seven feet tall and pushing 400 pounds, slightly
     deformed, who follows them into the room. He sucks on a
     twisty stick of barley sugar (Victorian hard candy).

     They stop, surprised to see Holmes and Watson.    Holmes'
     eyes widen at the giant.

                             HOLMES
               Hello, gentlemen.

     Dredger is deadpan.

                             DREDGER
               Sherlock Holmes.

                             HOLMES
               Let me guess -- you're here to
               extinguish any connection between
               the man who lived here and the man
               you work for? Curious you'd still
               be running errands for a dead man.

                             DREDGER
                    (smiles)
               You do like to talk.

     The two thugs step toward Holmes and Watson.

                             HOLMES
               You take them, I'll handle Mr.
               Sweet tooth.

                             WATSON
               Seems about fair.

     Watson meets the men in the middle of the room, swinging
     at them. As they dodge and swing back --

     Holmes grabs a standing lamp, sliding it into his hand as
     a weapon. He looks at Dredger, knows it won't make a
     dent. He keeps moving, swinging the lamp toward a
     CURTAIN. In the blink of an eye:

     He WRAPS UP the curtain, ripping it down, bringing the
     heavy STEEL ROD with it. He catches the rod, flipping it
     so the curtain-rings rain to the floor.

     He spins the rod expertly, SMASHING it into Dredger's
     face. It stuns the giant for a beat, but quickly --

     Dredger LUNGES forward, trapping the steel rod under his
     arm. He grabs the rod and HURLS Holmes through the air,
     sending him flying into --

      Holmes crash-lands on the table, scattering all the
      bottles and tools. He blinks, trying to gather his
      senses. He sees Dredger incoming, as --

      Watson tussles with the thugs, a bar-room brawler.    Head
      butting one, kicking the other in the groin.

      The men whip out knives. Watson ducks and dodges, blades
      flashing on either side of him. One of the blades slices
      his shirt, ripping off his pocket, so --

      The ENGAGEMENT RING falls to the floor. One of the thugs
      accidentally KICKS it, sending it across the ground.

      As Watson follows the ring with his eyes, the first man
      HURLS his knife. Watson just barely ducks the blade,
      which SMACKS into the second thug, who falls. Watson
      fights the first thug, as he scrambles toward the ring.

      Dredger bears down on Holmes. Holmes reaches out for
      some kind of weapon, anything he can grab. He snatches a
      SHORT SHAFT. A truly pathetic weapon.

      Dredger lurches toward Holmes, who swings the metal shaft
      desperately, and... the shaft SPARKS.

      ZAP! A flash of light and crackle, and Dredger gets an
      ELECTRIC SHOCK that sends him flying back twenty feet --

      ring off the floor, just as --

      Dredger flies through the air, SLAMMING into Watson,
      knocking him off his feet, and knocking the ring away.

      Holmes looks at the lightning rod in his hand, stunned by
      the efficacy of the weapon.

      Dredger tries to recover, climbing off of Watson.    Holmes
      cranks his weapon. The rod sparks and hums.

      Dredger pulls himself up with the help of a water pipe on
      the wall. Holmes thinks quickly, then touches the other
      end of the pipe with the rod, and ZZZAPPPP!!

      The electrical current RUNS ALONG THE PIPE, and KNOCKS
      Dredger back twenty more feet.

        running for it, frantic as --

        Dredger rises, a clear change in his demeanor. He looks
        at the sparking rod and races for the window as well.

        Watson chases the engagement ring, bends down... just as
        he's about to grab it...

        THUD!   Dredger's massive foot STOMPS DOWN ON THE RING.

        Dredger gives Watson a cruel smile, then leaps out the
        window, landing atop a heap of coal. Watson glares as --

        Holmes blasts past him, leaps out the window.   Watson
        picks up the ring, sees:

        The stone was knocked out of the setting, lost in the
        floorboards, the rest of the ring mangled. Watson
        darkens, grips his ruined ring, and heads out --

        Dredger runs towards a SLIPWAY, which holds the
        UNFINISHED HULL OF A LARGE SHIP. The vessel can't be far
        from completion; it sits in a wheeled carriage designed
        to see it smoothly into water.

        For now though, big wooden chocks hold it in place, the
        whole thing is attached to a heavy chain that coils back
        around the shed that they just ran through.

        Holmes trails the hulking form of Dredger into this
        network of struts. They weave through the shadows.

        Holmes sees one of the cables shifting slightly.    He
        takes an angle to cut off Dredger, and --

      Dredger knows there isn't much juice left. He reaches
      out, grabs the weapon and... smiles a terrifying smile.
      A moment of reckoning between Holmes and Dredger:

      The shaft slowly... sizzles... out. Dredger tosses the
      rod. And now, Holmes backs away, as --

      Dredger grabs a sledgehammer, and swings the hammer at
      Holmes, smashing some of the wooden supports, tearing
      others out of his way. The ship LURCHES forward.

      A police WHISTLE echoes through the air.   Dredger turns
      for a moment, just long enough for --

      Holmes to launch himself at Dredger. They tumble down
      onto the massive runners on the floor of the slipway.

      Holmes wrestles Dredger's head onto the runner and pins
      him down. Dredger kicks out viciously, splintering
      another chock. It's the last straw for the support
      mechanism, the whole thing starts to creak.

64B   EXT. FABRICATION SHED                                       64B

      From his vantage point, Watson can see what's coming.

                              WATSON
                Holmes!


65    EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION                      65

      Grappling frantically on the runners, both Holmes and
      Dredger look up as the HUGE CHOCKS holding the ship
      EXPLODE BACKWARDS --

      -- the PROPELLERS on the stern of the ship start sliding
      down towards them.

                                                      52.


66    EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION                       66

      Dredger looks up at the approach of the propellers --

      -- Holmes charges into Dredger again, pulling him
      backwards across the runners. Dredger pulls Holmes down
      with him, Holmes' head hits the ground hard.

      Holmes lies semi-conscious, eyes rolled back into his
      head, as the leviathan roars down towards him.

      The ground beneath him shakes, knocks his head against
      the runner -- once, twice -- as he blinks back into
      consciousness, he sees the great shadow sweeping over
      him. He's doomed. And...

      The stern lurches to a STOP INCHES from his face. He
      opens one tentative eye, half expecting to find himself
      in the after-life, and sees black metal an inch from his
      nose. He realizes the ship has stopped, but he doesn't
      know why. He tries to roll out of the way, as --

      EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
      We see the chain extended taut as a tight-rope behind the
      half-launched ship.

      The SHIP squeals and groans as its timber supports buckle
      and crack with the weight of the tethered ship.

      A beat where the whole business hangs in limbo and...

      The timber finally gives way.   The ship is free again,
      falling through the air --
      Holmes rolls sideways as the propellers slice through the
      air above his head -- the hull screams past him with a
      sound like the side of the world being torn off --

      -- and then the ship's away, parting the Thames with a
      vast, frothy explosion of water.

      Holmes watches the ship drift gracefully out into the
      river -- from vortex to serenity in a matter of seconds.
      A quiet beat.

      Holmes collapses back, great gulps of air disappearing
      into his lungs. He tries to pull himself to his feet,
      but Dredger's bone-shaking punches have taken it out of
      him and he sags back to the ground.

      Watson arrives, helps him to his feet. They stagger back
      to the slipway where Dredger was standing. And they
      find:

      Nothing.   No blood or trace.   The big man is gone.

      The police whistles get louder, officers swarm the scene.
      They see the wreckage, the ship adrift, and... Holmes and
      Watson.

      Watson looks at his watch and does a slow, deep burn.


67    INT. LONDON JAIL - MORNING                                    67

      The next morning. A giant holding cell where every shade
      and aspect of Victorian villainy is corralled.

      Holmes wakes up on a bench after a peaceful night's
      sleep. Watson sits next to him, exhausted, bloodshot
      eyes. He's reading his notebook, making the odd change
      here and there.

      Holmes looks up and sees Watson staring at him, shaking
      his head.

                               WATSON
                 I haven't slept all night. I
                 deserve this... I clearly deserve
                 it. How could I ever be so
                 deluded as to believe I could meet
                 Mary's parents for tea once I let
                 myself be talked into going with
                 you. Now of course I'm in jail.

      Holmes tries to wiggle his fingers which causes him
      enough pain that he decides to bind them with Irene's
      handkerchief.

                               HOLMES
                      (theatrically
                       indignant)
                 You're not implying that I am
                 responsible for our current
                 situation are you, Watson? We
                 were set upon, man, it was self-
                 defense.

      Watson shakes the notebook in Holmes' face.

                               WATSON
                 I've used the time to review my
                 notes on our exploits of the last
                 seven months... and I've come to
                 the conclusion that I must be
                 suffering from to some profound
                 psychological aberration.

               Why else would I continually allow
               myself to be led into situations
               where you're deliberately
               withholding your intentions from
               me?

                             HOLMES
               You've never complained about my
               methods before.

                             WATSON
               I'm not complaining... I never
               complain... I never complain about
               your violin playing at three in
               the morning, your mess, your lack
               of hygiene, your stealing my
               clothes, your setting our home on
               fire!

                             HOLMES
               That was an accident...

     Watson challenges him with a look.

                             HOLMES
               The first time WAS an accident...

                             BIG MAN (O.S.)
               Remember me, boys? Put me away
               for robbery a few years back?

     Holmes turns and comes face-to-face with a dangerous-
     looking man who has a few conspicuous WARTS on his face.

                             HOLMES
               Ah, Mr. Brownlee. The fifteenth
               most dangerous man in London.

     Watson snaps at the man.

                             WATSON
               Who could forget that face? I
               told you, a little nitrate of
               silver and the warts will be gone
               in two weeks. Now, if you'll
               excuse us!

     Brownlee takes a swing at Watson. Holmes checks him and
     drops Brownlee without missing a beat.

               Nor am I complaining about the
               fact that you terrorize my
               patients and perform outlandish
               experiments on my dog.

                             HOLMES
               Gladstone's my dog as well.   It's
               in the interest of science.

                             WATSON
               What I do take issue with is your
               ruthless campaign to sabotage my
               relationship with Mary.

                             HOLMES
               Watson, I completely understand
               now. You're overtired and feeling
               a bit sensitive.

     Watson now turns away, completely irritated at Holmes'
     lack of understanding.

                             HOLMES
               What you need is a rest. You and
               I could go out to the countryside.
               My brother Mycroft has a small
               estate near Chichester. It has
               marvelous grounds and a beautiful
               folly. We could throw a lamb on
               the spit.

     Watson shakes his head in disbelief.

                             WATSON
               If I were going to the country, I
               would be going with my future
               wife --

                             HOLMES
               Certainly. We should have her
               along. Let's get Gladstone out of
               the house as well.

                             WATSON
               No, Holmes. Not you.   Me and her.
               You're not --

                             HOLMES
               Invited? Now you're not making
               any sense, Watson. Why would I
               not be invited to my own brother's
               country home?

                     head)

     He touches his own heart.   They hear a BILLYCLUB hit the
     bars.

               John Watson?   You made bail.

     Watson steps up. Holmes looks confused.    He steps
     forward. But the Guard shakes his head.

                              PRISON GUARD
               Just Watson.

     As he slides open the bars, they see... MARY emerges from
     behind the Guard. Watson stands for a beat between
     Holmes and Mary. He must make a decision. And he does --

     -- he leaves.

     Holmes watches him walk out, then locks eyes with Mary.
     She gives him a polite nod, turns, heads off with Watson.
     The bars slide shut.

     The mob surrounds Holmes.   He's never looked more alone.

     The hood is pulled off. Holmes takes in the scene, eyes
     flicking around the room.

     He's in a grand office where a man in his late 60s, SIR
     THOMAS, rises from a pile of papers.

                              SIR THOMAS
                Mr. Holmes, apologies for
                summoning you like this. I'm sure
                it's quite a mystery as to where
                you are, and who I am.

                              HOLMES
                As to where I am -- I was,
                admittedly, lost for a moment
                between Charing Cross and Holborn.
                But I was saved by the bread shop
                on Saffron Hill, the only bakers
                to use a certain French glaze on
                their loaves. After that, the
                carriage forked left, then right,
                a bump over the Fleet conduit --
                need I go on?

     Somewhat stunned, Sir Thomas shakes his head.

                              HOLMES
                As to who you are -- that took
                every ounce of my not-
                inconsiderable experience and
                skill... the letters on your desk
                are addressed to Sir Thomas
                Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice.
                That would be your official title.
                Who you realy are is another
                matter entirely.

     Sir Thomas is not in the mood for this -- but Holmes is
     on a roll.

               And as to the mystery -- the
               mystery is why you bothered to
               blindfold me in the first place.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Yes, well, it's standard
               procedure, I suppose.

     Holmes shakes his head; what a massive lack of judgement
     on their part.

                             STANDISH (O.S.)
               I think we have the right man.

     Holmes turns to see JOHN STANDISH and LORD COWARD
     standing behind him. Standish is an American in his
     sixties. Coward is a hard, ambitious man in his 30s.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Sherlock Holmes, Ambassador
               Standish from America and Lord
               Coward, the Home Secretary.

     Holmes acknowledges them -- barely -- as they enter.    He
     isn't impressed by rank.

                             LORD COWARD
               I suppose you already have some
               notion as to the -- practices of
               our Order?

                              HOLMES
               Yes.   They're almost interesting.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Be as skeptical as you like -- but
               our secret systems have steered
               the world towards the greater good
               for centuries. The danger is that
               they can also be exploited for
               more nefarious purposes.

                             LORD COWARD
               What some call the dark arts, or
               practical magic.

     Holmes looks around the room, sees FLAGS on the walls
     with ancient symbols, variations of the SPHINX.

                             STANDISH
               We know you're are a rationalist.
               We don't ask you to share our
               faith, only our fears.

                             HOLMES
               Fear is the more infectious
               condition.
                    (at Sir Thomas)
               In this case, fear of your own
               child.

     That shocks them rigid.

                             HOLMES
               Blackwood is your son, yes? You
               have the same colored irises -- a
               rare dark green, with diamond-
               shaped hazel flecks --

                      Thomas' ear)
               -- plus identical outer ears, or
               pinna, which only pass down
               through the direct bloodline,
               which would make you either
               brothers, or, more likely, father
               and son.

     Stunned, the men consult silently, come to some sort of
     conclusion. They turn back to Holmes. Sir Thomas seems
     especially shaken.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Very few people are privy to that
               information, and we want to keep
               it that way.

     Sir Thomas opens a bureau, digs for something.

                             SIR THOMAS
               He was conceived during one of our
               rituals. His mother wasn't my
               wife, but she shared our beliefs.
               She was a powerful practitioner.
               Though not enough to survive
               giving birth to him.

     Holmes is appalled and shows it.

                             SIR THOMAS
               We were young. It was before we
               fully understood the powers we
               were dealing with.

                             HOLMES
               Evidently.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Death followed him wherever he
               went, from his birth to arms he
               made and sold. What family he had
               tended to... not survive. No one
               could prove anything of course,
               but we all knew --

     Sir Thomas hands Holmes a TINTYPE. A photograph from the
     1860s. It's chilling: a death scene, a BODY covered by
     a sheet. A man who's just fallen out a window. A TEN-
     YEAR-OLD BOY -- young Lord Blackwood -- looks on.

                             SIR THOMAS
               The boy was a curse. I didn't
               have the courage either to take
               him in or to --

               All this is history. The present
               and future are worse.

                             SIR THOMAS
               We've done our best to stop him
               ourselves, but it's not enough.

                             LORD COWARD
               His power grows daily and
               exponentially. His resurrection
               is evidence of that. What he does
               next will be far more dangerous --

                             SIR THOMAS
               -- he's going to raise a force
               that will alter the very course of
               our world. We need you to find
               him and stop him before he does.

                             LORD COWARD
               We'll give you any assistance we
               can. As Home Secretary, I have
               considerable influence over the
               police.
                    (beat)
               Name your price.

     Holmes looks at Coward with scathing disdain.

                             HOLMES
               One of the great benefits of my
               work is that I can pick and choose
               my clients. I'll get him, but not
               for you.

     Holmes stalks out -- stops at the door, turns, fixes Sir
     Thomas with a very bleak gaze.

                             HOLMES
               I have one last question, Sir
               Thomas.

                             SIR THOMAS
               What is it?

     Holmes holds up the tintype.

                             HOLMES
               If the rest of his family's dead,
               why are you still alive?

     Holmes tosses the tintype onto a table, leaves.

74   EXT. THE GRAND HOTEL                                        74

     Holmes comes out of a carriage, and scoots up the steps
     of the massive hotel that's bustling with people.


75   INT. IRENE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY                               75

     Irene enters wearing a stunning evening dress. She
     pauses glancing briefly around the room before sitting at
     a mirrored dressing table. There's a decanter on the
     table next to her from which she pours herself a glass of
     wine.

     Then she begins removing an impressive assortment of
     WEAPONS hidden on her person: she pulls a stiletto from
     her garter, a Derringer from her waistband (which she
     puts down next to the wine glass). She pulls long thin
     needles from her hair, lets her hair down. As she
     continues...

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL Holmes watching her from a shadowy
     corner. He looks on silently until:

                             IRENE
               If you're going to watch me take
               my clothes off, Sherlock, the
               least you can do is help me with
               the buttons.

     OR ALT:

                             IRENE
               To watch a lady undress without
               her permission is a criminal
               offense, Sherlock, and could get
               you into a lot of trouble...

     They both eye the Derringer on the table.

                             IRENE
               So why don't you come over here
               and help me instead.

     Holmes approaches her somewhat tentatively and reaches
     for the top button on the back of her dress.

                                IRENE
               That's better.

                             HOLMES
               You can stop looking for Reardon.

                             IRENE
               I knew I could count on you.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                       61.

                             HOLMES
               He was buried in Blackwood's tomb.

     Irene is momentarily taken aback then recovers.

                             IRENE
               Wonderful. Case closed then.
               Your services are no longer
               required.

     Unbuttoning done, Holmes steps out to confront Irene.

                             HOLMES
               I can't help wondering if your
               employer will be as content with
               these results? You were
               uncharacteristically ill at ease
               in his presence. Your hand was
               trembling, your gaze was averted.
               I couldn't see his face, but I
               spotted chalk on his lapel. A
               professor perhaps?

     Irene gets up, walks behind a DRESSING SCREEN.

                             IRENE
                    (behind screen)
               The eye patch was a nice touch.

                             HOLMES
               But I've never known a professor
               to carry a gun, and on such a
               clever contraption.

                             IRENE (O.S.)
               Let's not argue.

                             HOLMES
               We're not.

     Irene steps out, now wearing an array of Victorian
     undergarments. Unfairly gorgeous. The huge DIAMOND
     still around her neck. She moves back to the dressing
     table.

     Holmes won't look at her, refusing to get turned on.

                             HOLMES
               Tell me who you're working for and
               what he's after.

                             IRENE
               That's nobody's business but my
               own.

               I disagree.

                             IRENE
               You see, we are arguing.

     Holmes gets closer and closer to Irene as he presses his
     case vehemently.

                             HOLMES
               When a man you ask me to find ends
               up dead in the coffin of the most
               notorious murderer since Jack the
               Ripper and that murderer manages
               to return from the dead, not only
               is it my business, it's the
               business of Scotland Yard and the
               highest levels of the British
               government. They will certainly
               consider your reticence to be an
               obstruction of justice. Which in
               relation to a crime of this
               magnitude would certainly mean
               prison time.

                             IRENE
               This wine is excellent.    You
               should really try some.

     Holmes notices her Derringer on the table next to the
     wine bottle.

                             HOLMES
               So what's it to be?

                             IRENE
               Do we really have to decide now?

     Irene reaches for the wine.

                             HOLMES
               You're in over your head this
               time, Irene.

     Irene snatches up her gun.    Holmes grabs her arm.

     BANG! A BULLET tears into his shoe, missing his toe.
     Holmes snatches away the smoking Derringer. Irene kisses
     him, hard and angry at first, becoming something else.
     Another of the weapons in her arsenal, and the one that
     disarms Holmes.

     The kiss leads them to the bed.

               That's better.

     Irene pulls him down to it.     He doesn't resist.

     CLICK!

     Holmes' eyes flare with surprise.

     CLICK!

                                IRENE
               Much better.

     Irene has handcuffed him to the bed frame.

                             IRENE
               This is the only way it could ever
               work between us, Sherlock -- one
               in shackles, the other with the
               key.

     She gets off him.

     While he struggles on the bed, Irene walks casually
     across the room. She starts putting on MAN'S CLOTHING.
     She's in charge now.

                             IRENE
               I've NEVER been in over my head.

                             HOLMES
               How can you live like this --
               always a fugitive.

     She approaches, now dressed as a man, straddles him.

                             IRENE
               But free. And on my own terms.
               Just like you -- well, not you at

      handcuff keys down there.

                -- but generally speaking.

      Holmes has no retort. Irene takes the scarf off his
      neck, moves to the doorway.

76    INT. SIR THOMAS' HOUSE - NIGHT                                76

      Sir Thomas enters the hall from outside, he looks tired.
      His butler, PERIGRINE, stands there waiting for him.

                              PERIGRINE
                Good evening, sir. Some figs and
                honey with a nice glass of port?
                I've prepared a tray.

                              SIR THOMAS
                No thank you, Perigrine, I'm going
                to bed.
                     (as he heads
                      upstairs)
                You won't let those figs go to
                waste, will you?

               Nor the port, sir.

     Thomas smiles, goes up.   Perigrine heads for the kitchen,
     licking his lips.


77   INT. SIR THOMAS' BATHROOM                                      77

     Sir Thomas sinks into his bath.   Relaxing.

     The CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS IN, drip, drip, drip.

     The silence is broken all of a sudden when the tap is
     magically turned on. Sir Thomas opens his eyes in panic,
     as he hears an eerie WHISPER O.S., like the rushing of
     wind.

     Sir Thomas is overcome with panic, tries to sit up.
     Can't. Not all the way.

                Hello, Father...

      Thomas blinks and sees that BLACKWOOD now sits in the
      corner of the bathroom, lit in a sinister fashion.

      Sir Thomas' eyes widen, the muscles stand out in his neck
      as he fights paralysis. He slides back down, slowly.

                              BLACKWOOD
                You can't fight it. It comes from
                a power greater than yours. You
                can only surrender.

      The water flows over Sir Thomas, as Blackwood steps
      closer and takes the sacred RING from his rigid finger.

                              BLACKWOOD
                I've been imagining this moment
                for a long time...

      The water closes over his face. Sir Thomas stares up at
      Blackwood, who watches him drown, slowly and surely.

                              BLACKWOOD
                ... I must admit, it's better than
                I thought it would be.

      INT. THE GRAND HOTEL - CORRIDOR - DAY
      Carrying an armful of laundry, a MAID slips a pass-key
      into a lock and opens the door...

      ... to be confronted by the snoring form of Holmes, still
      handcuffed to the bed. Clothes in total disarray. Her
      shriek wakes him. He looks down at himself and reacts
      with shock, then grim recognition sets in.

                              HOLMES
                Don't take this the wrong way, but
                might I borrow your hand?


78A   INT. POLICE CARRIAGE                                         78A

      Holmes sits beside a COP, and opposite CONSTABLE CLARK.

                              HOLMES
                Chambermaids were once such a
                liberal breed. Besides, she

                 This is why I find this modern
                 religious fervor so troubling,
                 there is no latitude for
                 misunderstanding.

      He looks out the carriage window and sees signs of a
      spiritualist gathering.

                              HOLMES
                Faith runs riot over reason.

                              CONSTABLE CLARK
                Well, it's a good thing she was
                offended or we'd never have found
                you. The inspector's been over to
                Baker Street himself this morning.

      The coach stops.

      Holmes steps out of the coach, and is escorted inside by
      Constable Clark.


78C   INT. SIR THOMAS' BATHROOM                                    78C

      Holmes is briefed by Constable Clark as they enter. As
      Constable Clark continues in, Holmes swivels away --

                              CONSTABLE CLARK
                We've checked everything. No sign
                of a break-in. The Butler didn't
                hear anything. The body was in
                the tub, eyes wide open --
      -- so that Const. Clark ends up talking to thin air.

                              CONSTABLE CLARK
                     (realizing Holmes
                      isn't there)
                -- only his ring was missing.

      He turns, puzzled, looking for Holmes, finds him right
      back at the doorway, in full virtuoso detective mode.
      Right now, right here is where Holmes is at his very best
      -- this is, in fact, why he exists.

      Holmes is satisfied by what he sees or finds, continues
      into the bathroom, where a POLICE OFFICER stands over the
      tub and Sir Thomas' body (covered with a blanket).

      The tub has been drained. The kind of crime scene
      violation that Holmes cannot get them to stop doing.

                              HOLMES
                Why did you drain the water?

                              POLICE OFFICER
                Out of common decency.

                              HOLMES
                     (incensed)
                Crime is common, logic is rare.
                The decent thing to do is catch
                the killer, not provide comfort to
                the corpse.

      Neither the officer nor Clark have a response. Holmes
      swivels, sees a JAR OF BATH SALTS on the table next to
      the chair Blackwood sat in, leans over, scoops it up,
      opens it, sniffs it.

                                HOLMES
                Hmm...

      Holmes thrusts the open jar under the Officer's nose.

                                HOLMES
                What is that?

                              POLICE OFFICER
                     (smelling)
                Uhhhh... jasmine?

                              HOLMES
                Superb. I suspect this comes from
                a larger cannister. It'll either
                be in the pantry, high up where
                it's warm and dry, or in a linen
                closet with a vent. And,
                Constable, you could check the
                ground under the rear windows for
                any footprints not your own.

      Both cops hesitate -- Holmes is not their boss.

                              HOLMES
                Data, data, data! I cannot make
                bricks without clay!

      The cops hurry away. Now Holmes can really get down to
      work. This may mean he gets on his belly for a floor's-
      eye-view, it may mean he looks down from a window sill.
      Sometimes he hums or sings to himself.

      Holmes is happy.

      He glances around the room, sees the chair where
      Blackwood was perched, sits in it himself.

      His eyes keep moving, noticing something on a wall. He
      steps toward it, runs his hand along a layer of dust.
      The dust has a line down it, as if the wall cracked open.

      Holmes steps to the sink, grabs a handful of TALCUM
      POWDER and tosses the powder against the wall, revealing:

      He pushes the panel, and the wall shifts, opening to
      reveal a SECRET ROOM. Holmes enters --

      Holmes finds a desk with a prayer table, and ancient
      texts, spellbooks, one book open to a picture of
      Alexander the Great at the Sphinx. He steps toward --

      An ALTAR below the image of the Sphinx. On the altar,
      four strange objects: a strand of human HAIR, a cow's
      BONE, a large sharp FANG, and a FEATHER.

      Holmes pockets the altar items and a couple pieces of
      paper, just as --

      INT. SIR THOMAS' BATHROOM
      -- Const. Clark and the Officer return, the Officer
      proudly hugging a 5 LB. CANNISTER OF JASMINE BATH SALTS.

      They are startled by the secret room --

      -- they are even more startled by the sight of Holmes
      kneeling at the altar and singing to himself.

      As soon as they arrive, Holmes springs to his feet and
      walks out. Maybe he continues singing between words.

      Holmes walks up the stairs and finds Watson's office door            
      open. He is well into packing his things. The office is

               No, he's your friend from                               
               Reordon's. He didn't survive                            
               Dredger landing on him. Poor                            
               fellow. But there is some                               
               consolation in the knowledge that                       
               he can still be of service to his                       
               fellow men.                                             

     Watson keeps packing. Holmes analyzes the body,
     starting, of all places, with the outer elbows and
     forearms of his coat.

     Holmes grabs various instruments and other items from             
     Watson's newly-packed boxes. Frustrated, Watson snatches          
     them back as quickly as Holmes takes them out.

                             HOLMES
               Elbows and arms stained with
               blood, but older than his own
               injuries. Plenty of it, layer on
               layer...

     Holmes scrapes at the layers of blood with his knife,
     examines it.

                             HOLMES
               Though none of it human.

     Watson slows down slightly. He keeps packing, trying to
     resist the mystery, but it's not easy.

                             HOLMES
               A butcher perhaps...?   What else?

     Holmes cuts a lock of the man's hair, ignites it, studies
     the color of the flame carefully. Watson wrinkles his
     nose at the smell.

                             HOLMES
               Hm -- predominantly yellow flame,
               but with distinct green bursts.
               Sulfurous. He spent lots of time
               around industrial work and very
               little around a wash basin.

     Holmes uses a curved nail file to scrape dirt from under
     the man's fingernails, rubs the evidence between his
     fingers like a connoisseur.

                             HOLMES
               Coal... river silt...

     Watson slows down further, struggling.

                             HOLMES
               That plus the river silt and
               industrial slag on his trousers
               puts him squarely in...

     A hanging beat.   And Watson finally cracks, blurting out:

                              WATSON
               Nine Elms.

                             HOLMES
               Well done. Now, you didn't happen
               to pack the Lord's Register of
               members' interests, did you?

     Watson pulls it out of a box.

               See what Blackwood admits to
               owning.

     As Watson flips through it, Holmes plucks a few chords on
     his violin, thinking. Watson finds the page.

                             WATSON
               It's endless, he's had a hand in

               good for you.

                                HOLMES
                  That's it, Watson! This should                             
                  lead us right to Blackwood.                                

        Holmes leaps up and readies himself to leave.

        This gives Holmes pause.                                             

                                HOLMES
                  Right. Well uh... best of luck                             
                  with everything, then.

                                   WATSON
                  Same to you.

        A brief nod, then Holmes is gone.

        A beat as Watson continues packing. He heaves a box up,
        moves for his suitcase. After a moment, he notices...

        Holmes' PISTOL.

                                   WATSON

        He picks it up. As he contemplates the weapon, he
        becomes more serious. Then angry. He mouths a curse to
        himself, and sees their DOG giving him a disapproving
        look.

                                WATSON
                  Yes, I know. Don't give me that
                  look, Gladstone.

        He pockets the gun, grabs his jacket and heads out.

      A few DROPS OF RAIN trickle down. He looks up, surprised
      by the rain. He raises his collar, and keeps moving.

      He hits the door to a building. It is locked. He bangs
      on the door, as the rain comes harder. The door finally
      opens. As he enters, we see the rain stops behind him,
      gone as fast as it came. A RAVEN flaps into the night.


82B   INT. TEMPLE OF FOUR ORDERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT             82B

      Standish comes up the stairs, wiping the raindrops off
      his coat, trying to dry himself, as he enters --


83    INT. TEMPLE OF FOUR ORDERS HEADQUARTERS - COUNCIL CHAMBER    83

      A five-sided room. A few dozen venerable-looking
      characters arrange themselves in seats. Lord Coward
      stands next to a central throne. He stays standing as
      they all sit -- all except STANDISH.

                              STANDISH
                What's the meaning of this?   Why
                did you call us here?

                              LORD COWARD
                Sir Thomas is dead. Effective
                immediately, I nominate Lord
                Blackwood as head of the Order.

                              STANDISH
                Are you mad, Coward? Have you any
                idea what he's capable of?

                              BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
                Of course he does. It's why he's
                here.

      Blackwood enters. He looks as if he's been to hell, and
      come back more powerful than ever.

      The crowd is stunned. Standish looks at Coward,
      betrayed, turns to the others -- who are transfixed by
      the sight of Blackwood suddenly kneeling before them.

                              BLACKWOOD
                I am humbled. I am honored.

               A magnificent and simple purpose.
               A different future... a future
               ruled by us.

     Blackwood stands, prowls.

                             BLACKWOOD
               You've made policy in secret for
               centuries. Now, you'll make it
               openly.

     The men are beginning to like what they hear.

               The first act is a necessary one,

               England will know our power.
               Then, the whole world will.
               Across the Atlantic lies a colony
               that was once ours, and will be
               again. Their civil war weakened
               them; their government is as
               corrupt and ineffective as ours.
               We'll take it from them.
                    (beat)
               With their resources and our

               Are you with me?

                    (turning to the
                     others)
               The powers he's playing with are
               beyond any man's control.

                              BLACKWOOD
               They're limitless -- even death
               holds no sway.

                             STANDISH
               Help me stop him before it's too
               late.

     Nobody moves.   Blackwood smiles -- he's won.

      Flames consuming him, Standish flails, crashing through a

      The fireball plummets through the sky, lighting city
      blocks. People look up, gape, and --

      WHOOMPF! Standish lands on the roof of a carriage.
      Horses and carriages SCREECH to a stop.

      The flames flicker blinding white, as his body contorts,
      melting away. People scream, gasp, faint, cross
      themselves, as they witness this unnatural act.

      Coward produces a brimming silver chalice.

                Come, drink your allegiance here.

      The members line up to drink from a CHALICE. It doesn't
      taste good, but it tastes like power. As they drink,
      Blackwood leans close to Coward:

84    EXT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT         84

      An industrial area on a bend of the Thames. Work doesn't
      stop when the sun goes down. Wharves stretch out into
      the water. WE SEE a boat is being loaded. We PULL BACK
      FROM the scene and look ACROSS the water.

      Just above the thump of industry we can hear a
      distinctive and irregular CHUGGING sound. Slowly a
      decrepit and eccentric little steam launch chugs INTO
      VIEW. Holmes is on the deck along with a much older man
      in a sailor's hat -- CAPTAIN TANNER.

                              HOLMES
                Everything all right, Captain
                Tanner?

      Captain Tanner has few teeth and a large white beard.

                              TANNER
                Just a little leak, nothing to
                worry about.

      Watson is busy with a bucket clearing the boat of a very
      serious leak. He's soaked, and furious.

                              TANNER
                Not a great one for the water, are
                you, doctor? Army type, aren't
                you? You wouldn't have lasted
                long in the Navy.

      Watson glares. Holmes scans the banks with a telescope.
      He sees a jetty with a few shadows shifting on it. The
      engine shudders off, the boat drifts. Tanner whispers:

                              TANNER
                That's as far as we can go.

      Holmes starts clambering over the side.    Watson's pissed.

                              WATSON
                There must be fifty yards of mud
                out there.

      Holmes' head is just visible before he drops over the
      prow. He whispers at Tanner.

               Pull in at Vauxhall. Send for the
               police when you get there.

     Tanner nods. A soft "splosh" as Holmes disappears.
     Watson carefully leaves his valued possessions behind,
     watch, etc. He lays down his wallet and looks at Tanner.

                             WATSON
               I know precisely how much money is
               in there.

                             TANNER
                    (taking the piss)
               I am sure you do, doctor.

     Watson glares, goes over the side, with his walking
     stick.

86   EXT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE                              86

     Holmes and Watson emerge out of the shallows, covered in
     mud. Holmes doesn't seem bothered. Watson does.

     They look up and see a jetty that heads out into the
     river. Two shadowy THUGS guard the dock, while more
     THUGS are loading the boat with something.

     Holmes and Watson scuttle forward, towards the entrance,
     where two more THUGS patrol. Watson pulls out Holmes'
     GUN.
                             HOLMES
               What are you doing with my gun?

                             WATSON
               Oh, please.

                             HOLMES
               It was an honest mistake --

                             WATSON
               There was nothing honest about it.

     Holmes looks back at Watson, takes the gun, says nothing,
     the closest he'll come to a confession. Watson steps
     forward.

                             WATSON
               Come on, let's get this over with.

     They look out at the thugs guarding the door. Holmes
     whispers, trying to figure out the best strategy.

                             HOLMES
               The one on the left seems more
               attentive, might prove easily
               distracted. The big one's been
               drinking -- whether for courage or
               from habit... Watson?

     Watson has already left. He simply walks up to the door
     and whacks the larger man in the face with the gun --
     before dispatching the other with a backhand pistol-whip.

     Holmes follows, notices that both men have hip flasks.
     He picks one up, takes a whiff, and pockets it as he
     follows Watson. He slows, sensing something behind him.
     He turns, looks at shadows. Nothing. And he enters --

87                                                                 87

88   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - TUNNEL                      88

     Holmes walks towards Watson who stands in the doorway,
     stopped in his tracks, spooked. Holmes catches up,
     passing Watson into --


89   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ANTECHAMBER                 89

     Shadows on shadows. Metal groans softly, like a
     plaintive wail. The twisted blades of slaughterhouse
     instruments glimmer in the darkness. A few RATS lay
     dead. A truly creepy scene. Holmes and Watson move
     through it.

     As they go, Holmes notices rows of empty tables. He runs
     his finger through a layer of dust, inspecting it.
     Quiet:

                             HOLMES
               They cleared something out of
               here, not minutes ago...

     Holmes slows, picks up one of the dead rats. He inspects
     it, sees something on its skin, some kind of dark spore.

                              WATSON (O.S.)
               Holmes.   You need to see this.

     Holmes looks up, and sees Watson standing at a set of
     doors.

     Holmes pulls out a CIGAR-CUTTER, CLIPS off the rat's
     TAIL, slipping it into his pocket, as he joins Watson,
     stepping into --


90   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - FACTORY FLOOR                90

     A massive space with a maze of machinery full of deadly
     gears and blades and saws, lifeless and silent for now.
     An automated butchery on a grand scale. This is the
     killing floor. Huge hooks hang from chain belts on an I-
     beam, the ceiling, swaying softly, whispering in the
     wind.

     On the high walls, a huge number has been scrawled:     118.

                               WATSON
               One-eighteen.    It's a date, a
               time?

     Holmes shakes his head, his eyes narrow, ticking.

                             HOLMES
               It's chapter and verse.
               Revelation 1:18. `I am He that
               liveth, and was dead.'

     Another voice completes the passage, echoing from above:

                             BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
               `And behold, I am alive
               forevermore, and have the keys of
               hell and of death. Amen.'

     Holmes and Watson follow the voice to see: BLACKWOOD in
     the rafters. Shadows hang heavy around him. Holmes and
     Watson react: this is the first time they've seen him in
     the flesh.
                              BLACKWOOD
                I cautioned you to accept that
                this is beyond your control. Now
                you see the truth for yourself.

     The hooks in the ceiling are shivering softly, strangely.
     Holmes tightens. Blackwood continues, his voice echoes,
     as the hooks move through the air, gliding on a track.

                             BLACKWOOD
               I want you to bear witness. At
               noon tomorrow, the world as you
               know it ends.

     Watson pulls his gun, draws a bead on Blackwood, pulls
     the trigger. Click. Misfire.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                       77.

                              BLACKWOOD
                And because I appreciate your
                help, Holmes, I have a gift for
                you.

      Holmes starts climbing up towards Blackwood.

                              BLACKWOOD
                     (voice moving away)
                She followed you. You led your
                little lamb straight to slaughter.

      Suddenly the whole machine starts up. Industrial-
      strength loud, movement everywhere, empty hooks jerking
      towards the processing line. Blades and gears and
      grinders churn.

      Watson's eyes go from Blackwood to --

      A pig carcass as it comes swinging out of the killing
      area, towards the SCORCHER (which scorches the carcasses
      with live flame).

      Then next carcass emerges --

      -- not a carcass, Irene. She is alive, for now. She
      hangs from two hooks on a track-line, her wrists shackled
      above her, her mouth gagged.

      Her eyes show terror until she sees them, then immense
      relief for a moment, then determination.

      Holmes looks up to see Blackwood's shadow retreating.

      Decision time.

90A                                                                90A
      INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ASSEMBLY LINE
      Holmes drops on to the machine and leaps from gear to
      gear like stepping-stones. He heaves himself up to the
      conveyor, where Irene is being pulled down the assembly
      line towards the flames.

      Watson sprints ahead, looking for a shut-off switch.

      Holmes unties Irene's gag.

                              HOLMES
                It's your turn in shackles this
                time.

      Ahead of them, the pig carcass is scorched in an
      overwhelming burst of flame. Holmes and Irene are next.

                But this time no key,
                unfortunately.

      Holmes notes that Irene's hands are shackled to separate
      hooks. It's going to take two actions to free her.

      The flame machine gurgles ominously, gearing up for the
      next blast.

      Watson sees a LEVER (PLEASE NOTE, NEW PROP!) that looks
      promising, turns to head for it -- then his eyes focus on
      a big canvas splatter cloth.

                              HOLMES
                I've been meaning to ask you
                something --

                              IRENE
                Well, I'm a captive audience.

      Watson rips down the splatter cloth, sprints to Holmes
      and Irene, tosses the cloth across the conveyor belt to
      Holmes --

      -- who wraps them up in the thick cloth just before the
      flames hit them.

      The heat is excruciating -- but the cloth protects them.

      Watson watches anxiously as the scorched cloth drops
      away, revealing that Holmes and Irene made it -- just.

      Relieved, Watson heads for the lever until "Oh Shit!" he
      looks ahead --

      -- sees the scorched pig carcass being dragged into a
      long, conveyor-belt-wide SCALDING TANK OF BOILING WATER.

      Decision time for Watson -- help Holmes and Irene, or try
      the lever? He goes for the lever, reaches it, pushes it
      all the way over --

      -- and the belt speeds up with a jerk.

      Watson hauls back on the lever, gets the belt back to the
      original speed, looks around for another possible off
      switch.

      Just as they reach the scalding tank, Holmes jumps off
      the belt (still opposite side to Watson), grabs Irene's
      legs and pulls her horizontal just before she's dragged
      into the boiling water.

      She's suspended just above the boiling water, with Holmes
      moving sideways, keeping pace with her.

                              IRENE
                     (trying her best not
                      to show the strain)
                You had a question.

      Holmes keeps hold of Irene's feet as he maneuvers past
      various obstacles --

                              HOLMES
                     (same)
                Ah. Yes. Do you still maintain
                you're not in over your head?

                              IRENE
                     (panting)
                In some countries steam is
                considered excellent therapy for
                the skin.

      -- then is gouged in the back by a whirling fan belt,
      jerks away, and Irene touches the water, SCREAMS.

      Watson hears the scream, turns -- then sees something
      again. It pisses him off. Fuck this machine.

      When Holmes has Irene stable again:

                              IRENE
                     (weakly)
                I have to say -- it's overrated.

      Holmes has to admire her courage -- until he hears Watson
      yelling at him.

      Up ahead a huge pipe spews boiling water into the tank --
      and impassable obstacle from Holmes' side of the conveyor
      belt.

      Watson points at the I-beam running above them.   Holmes
      nods. Irene sees it, too.

      Holmes helps her reach one foot, then other up to the I-
      beam. She hooks her feet over it, and is suspended
      upside down by her shackles and her feet --

      -- and still heading for the pipe spewing boiling water.

      Watson appears opposite Holmes, nods up at Irene.   She
      swings off the I-beam, through the air --



                                                    (CONTINUED)

      -- and Watson catches her feet, pulls her horizontal,
      facing the other way just in time to avoid the gush of
      boiling water.

      As Watson holds Irene, he spots a small, but significant-
      looking SWITCH on the wall, painted red. (PLEASE NOTE,
      NEW PROP!)

      Watson helps Irene back onto the conveyor belt, leaves
      her for Holmes to deal with, sprints for the switch.

      Irene rides the belt upwards.   Holmes clambers the
      equipment, following her.

      Up ahead, the scorched, scalded pig carcass precedes
      them.

      Holmes darts through a trimming station, with CLEAVERS
      HANGING FROM CHAINS, grabs one, jumps onto the belt,
      catches up to Irene --

      -- just as they both see the pig carcass CUT IN HALF
      LENGTHWAYS BY A GIANT BANDSAW.

      Holmes wastes no time, swings the meat cleaver at the
      lock shackling Irene's left hand. Sparks fly as metal
      kisses metal, but that's all. She's still shackled.

      Then both of them see that Watson has reached the SWITCH.
      Whew!

      Watson looks at them with relief -- close one -- and
      pulls the switch down with a really satisfying CLUNK!

      A bank of lights goes out but the conveyor belt keeps
      moving towards the giant band saw.

      Shit a brick.

                              IRENE
                Sherlock?

      Now, she's showing nerves. So is Sherlock. He braces
      himself on the belt, swings the cleaver with all his
      might --

      -- smashes the shackle lock.

      Irene swings sideways violently, still shackled by her
      right hand.

      The bandsaw whines viciously.

      Irene swings aside, just misses it.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

      Gets a free haircut.

      Then Holmes is under her, lifting her high so that she
      can free her right hand (a move not possible with both
      shackles).

      Irene unhooks herself, falls forward, taking Holmes with
      her. They plummet downwards OUT OF FRAME.

      Watson sprints towards where they fell, looks down --

      -- sees them lying on a carpet of scorched, boiled, cut-
      in-half pig carcasses. They're okay.

      Watson shakes his head, turns, heads for the door,
      looking for Blackwood.

      Irene gives Holmes a sweet, grateful smile --

                              IRENE
                Thank you so much. I owe you.

      -- pulls a knife, gets up, heads after Watson.    Holmes
      grabs her, stops her.

                              HOLMES
                You owe me information.
                     (angry)
                No more games, Irene.

      She hears Watson opening the door to the dock. She looks
      at Holmes, their eyes locking. Finally, the truth:

                              IRENE
                Blackwood's manufactured large-
                scale weapons for years. Lately
                there've been rumors of something
                new. More powerful than anything
                else. And... magical. My job is
                to find out if the rumors are
                true.

      her, processing. They blast through the doors to --

      Watson runs out of doors and towards the end of the dock.
      He sees: Blackwood and the boat are disappearing into
      the darkness.

      Holmes and Irene run out of the doors following Watson.
      Holmes slows, looking around the dock, seeing something
      on the planks:

      Steel drums are dripping.    A chemical.   Holmes recognizes
      it.

                                HOLMES
                Watson!

      Watson continues down the dock, tripping a wire connected
      to the steel drums, he turns realizing he has set off a
      trap and turns back to warn the others --

                                WATSON
                Holmes...

      A metallic conductor SPARKS.    Time slows.   BOOM!

      The drums of chemicals all EXPLODE! A blinding
      conflagration engulfing Watson. For a moment, it lights
      up all of London.

                              HOLMES
                WAATTTSSSSSONNN!!!!

      Holmes is pushed back   by the explosion as the rest of the
      barrels that line the   dock begin exploding arond them --
      it looks as it Watson   hasn't survived. BOOM! Irene is
      knocked to the ground   by the blasts and flying debris.

      Holmes races towards her as more explosions, flames and
      debris fly all around him in slow motion, occasionally
      knocking him to the ground.

      He reaches Irene, picks her up and grabs part of an
      exploded barrel to shield the two as they run for cover --
      BOOM! The barrel splinters as a final blast knocks them
      down, but to safety.

      As he opens his eyes --

     We see Lestrade and his men swarming the scene, they spot
     Watson, alive, but unconscious. Irene has disappeared.
     Holmes sees this and heads toward his friend, but --

     -- is intercepted by Constable Clark.

                             CONSTABLE CLARK
               There's an order for your arrest
               all the way from the top, sir --
               so you'll have to hit me now.

                             HOLMES
               From Lord Coward?

                             CONSTABLE CLARK
               Yes, sir, so make it look good.

                             HOLMES
               Thank you, Clarky.

     Holmes cracks Constable Clark in the sweet spot, helps
     him gently to his knees. Holmes turns away, makes his
     escape fast.

     Holmes turns back to look at the explosion.

     INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR
     Two POLICEMEN half-heartedly guard the end of a corridor.
     One reads the paper. The headline: "AMERICAN AMBASSADOR
     STANDISH BURNED ALIVE!"

     Mary returns past them, having unsuccessfully washed away
     tear-stained makeup; there is a smear on her cheek. The
     two coppers nod respectfully.
     Mary arrives at the windowed door of a private room,
     reaches for the handle, pauses.

     THROUGH THE GLASS, she sees a white-coated DOCTOR,
     studying Watson's chart.

     Mary stays at the door, unsure whether to enter or not.

     Watson is burned, cut, bruised, scraped, pock-marked with
     shrapnel. He mumbles inaudibly, his eyes still closed.
     He's delirious, sweating.

     (NOTE: Mary's detective novels and magazines, coat,
     handbag, etc. already in the room.)

     The doctor injects Watson in the arm. The shot wakes
     him. Watson tries to sit up, wincing with pain.

                             WATSON
               What are you administering?

                            DOCTOR
               Morphia. A sixth of a grain, for
               the pain.

     Watson looks at his wounded shoulder.

                             DOCTOR
               There are four pieces of shrapnel.
               The surgeon should be along
               shortly.

     Watson tries to sit up again.

     This reveals that Mary has entered the room, stands back
     respectfully, letting the Doctor do his work.

                             WATSON
               Are they subcutaneous, or deeper?

                             DOCTOR
               They're near the carotid artery.

                             WATSON
               Get a mirror, I'll extract them
               myself.

                             DOCTOR
               I can't authorize that, Doctor.
               We must first manage the pain and
               combat the infection.

                             WATSON
               I haven't time for that.   My
               friend is in dire --

                             DOCTOR
               Your friend? What kind of friend
               takes a retired soldier, who's
               served his country and deserves a
               peaceful, private life, and puts
               him so directly in harm's --

     Watson grabs the Doctor's arm angrily.

                              DOCTOR
               But evidently not wise enough to
               value your life over his
               misadventures.


     ON MARY

     As she takes a closer, sharper look at the Doctor.

                             WATSON
                    (succumbing to the
                     morphine)
               It was worth a wound, worth many
               wounds...

     Mary steps towards the Doctor, eyes flashing.

                                MARY
               Excuse me --

                             DOCTOR
                    (leaving)
               I have other... patients.

                                MARY
               Do you really?     Doctor.

     The Doctor turns just outside the door, to face her.
     She's suddenly very angry.

                             MARY
               You have nothing more to say to
               me?

                             DOCTOR
               Um... I'll check in on him again
               shortly.

                             MARY
               Is that the best you can do? I'm
               disappointed, but not surprised.

     The Doctor has no words.

                             MARY
               If anything happens to him, both
               our lives are lost. Do you
               understand that? Can you? --

     fast.

                             MARY
               -- or are you so selfish that's
               just not possible.

94A    EXT. LONDON - NIGHT                                          94A

       ESTABLISHING SHOT of London, possibly the bustle of Fleet
       Street during the morning rush hour. A train crosses on
       an overhead railway.

       We PUSH IN UNDER the railway arch until we can make out a
       splash of white in the shadows -- the Doctor from the
       hospital is slumped down against the wall.

       We PUSH IN ALL THE WAY, so that we CAN SEE that the
       Doctor is actually Holmes.

       There is something grotesque about his face, he hasn't
       completely removed his disguise. Parts of it hang down,
       obscuring him --

       -- but not obscuring the light of instability in his
       eyes. They begin to overflow with tears. He brushes
       them away then looks at his wet hand, horrified.

94B-94E OMITTED                                                 94B-94E


95     INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - ATTIC                                   95

       Holmes enters, disturbed, pained.   Emotions swirling.

       He pulls out a newspaper with the story of Standish's
       death, the pages and strange sacrificial offerings (bone,
       hair, feather, fang) from Sir Thomas' house.

       Gathering himself, Holmes stands in the middle of the
       bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the
       floor. The Ox bone directly in front of him (at 12
       o'clock). The eagle feather to his right (at 3 o'clock).
       The human hair behind him (at 6 o'clock) and the Lion's
       fang to his left (at 9 o'clock).

       Then with a piece of charcoal Holmes draws a circle
       around each image and a circle directly in the center of
       the four other circles. He then draws lines which join
       the circles together in the shape of a cross.

       In the center circle he draws a pentagram (using wax from
       a burning candle?). Then he pours a ring of salt around
       that circle.

       He lights four candles (one at each point of the cross)
       then stands in the center of the circle.

       He pulls a pocket knife from his coat, opens the blade,
       cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto
       the ground just outside the circle.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

     Then he begins to chant. The words are eerily
     reminiscent of Blackwood's chanting.

     Suddenly one of the drops of blood bursts into flame in
     mid-air -- as it hits the ground, the circle around
     Holmes ignites, followed by a larger circle beyond that.

                             BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
               And now it dawns on you, you begin
               to recognize your part in his
               play.

     Holmes snaps around, Blackwood has appeared behind him
     within the outer circle of flame.

                             BLACKWOOD
               You see the path he chose for you.

     Holmes sways, fuzzy.   He struggles to focus on Blackwood.

                 Didn't you wonder why it was so
                 easy to catch me? I told you I
                 needed five lives for my
                 resurrection. Why would I take a
                 sixth under St. Paul's?

     Holmes shakes his head, he can barely see straight.

                               BLACKWOOD
                 Unless I simply wanted to be
                 caught by the great Sherlock
                 Holmes...

     Blackwood raises a sacrificial sword and swings at
     Holmes' head.

                               BLACKWOOD
                 ... so I could die on the biggest
                 stage of all. You made me what I
                 am.

     We see --


     HOLMES' POV

     as Blackwood swings the sacrificial sword at Holmes'
     head. It looks as if Holmes has no time to react --

     WHOOSH -- the sword WIPES the FRAME --

     WATSON -- or some deathly version of his old friend -- is
     sitting in the chair where Blackwood appeared.

     Watson leans closer, into the light. A ghost or a man?
     He gestures towards the diagram on the floor.

                Interesting artwork.   You look

     alive, but with burn flashes, cuts and bruises. His arm
     is in a sling. He's been through it.

     In the b.g. Irene is at the fire heating some coffee.

     Watson shows him a piece of shrapnel --

                Took it out myself. Mary said I
                had a lousy doctor.

     They both smile.   United in agony.

                              HOLMES

                      them)

                              WATSON
                Yes, oddly, it seems she might
                understand the power of
                partnership.

     They both look back over to Irene who just finished
     loading her gun. The coffee seems ready so she pours a
     cup.

               Thank you. You know, I dreamt

     another.

     Watson and Irene sit at a table, the SCREECH of a fiddle
     now comes from upstairs.

     The fiddler's owner -- from the pub's band -- is busy
     getting drunk with the money he has acquired.

     Irene arrives with two pints, puts one down in front of
     him, sits opposite him with the other.

     Watson looks from Irene to the pint with open suspicion.
     Could it be poisoned? He wouldn't put it past her. But
     then he decides that's absurd. He takes a sip.

                             IRENE
               Oh, I poisoned that one.

      as he plays the violin, but not with a bow. He plucks
      it, he strums it, he makes strange atonal sounds, as he
      STARES AT THE RITUAL PATTERN he's laid out on the floor.

      Flashes to various images of the sphinx that he's
      observed over the course of the investigation.

      He stands up and draws a sphinx in charcoal on the floor.
      Then he moves to the ox bone -- a flash of Sir Thomas'
      ring with the Ox crest. He draws an ox in charcoal.
      Next to the ox bone Holmes writes -- Sir Thomas -- OX
      ring.

      Next, he moves to the feather -- a flash to an Eagle in
      flight -- he quickly sketches an eagle. Then to an
      American flag, then to Standish with his eagle-topped
      cane. Next to the feather he writes America.

      Then he moves to the hair. He draws a man's face. Flash
      to Reordon's red hair. Next to it Holmes writes Man.

      Then he moves to a Lion fang. He sketches out a lion --
      he thinks -- BUT no flashes. Next to it he writes a big
      question mark. Where? Who?

      Holmes returns to his violin. Staring at the Lion fang
      as if willing the flashes to come.

                I need a map of London.

      Holmes is excited, electric.

                              HOLMES
                Now that you're sitting
                comfortably, I shall begin. My
                initial approach was far too
                narrow. When Blackwood invited me
                to Pentonville prison, he
                suggested I widen my gaze and, at
                minimum, I have done just that.
                In fact, I may well have
                reconciled thousands of years of
                theological disparity. But that's
                for another time. Blackwood's
                method is based on a ritualistic
                mystical system that has been
                employed by The Temple of the Four
                Orders for centuries. To fully
                understand this system, to get
                inside it, I re-enacted the
                ceremony we interrupted in the
                crypt... with a few enhancements
                of my own.

                              WATSON
                At minimum.

      Watson and Irene shoot Holmes knowing looks.

                              HOLMES
                My journey took me somewhat
                further down the rabbit hole than
                I had intended.

                              IRENE
                Yes, your little white tail got
                rather dirty.

                              HOLMES
                But I have emerged enlightened...
                The fraternity who silently
                control the Empire, share the
                belief with the Kings, Pharoahs,
                and Emperors of old that the
                Sphinx was a door to another
                dimension, a gateway to
                immeasurable power --

      He tosses Watson the pages from Sir Thomas.

                              HOLMES
                It is made up of four parts: The
                Ox, the Lion, the Eagle, and Man --

      He points out the individual parts of the Sphinx,
      covering other parts with his hand. We see the Ox body,
      Lion paws, Eagle wings, Man's face.

                              HOLMES
                In Sir Thomas' secret chamber I
                found the bone of an ox, the tooth
                of a lion, the feather of an
                eagle, the hair of a man. Map!

      Watson throws the map down on the floor, really flying
      now.

                              HOLMES
                Now, it is a widely held belief
                that within the architecture of
                the great cities are coded
                references to this system.

      He runs his finger over the map tracing the shape of a
      cross...

      Then he picks up the charcoal and (following the map)
      draws a serpentine curve of the River Thames straight
      through the middle of the cross that he drew on the
      floor.

                              HOLMES
                Since he rose from the grave,
                Blackwood has killed three men.
                Each murder was committed at a
                location that has a direct
                connection with the Temple,
                therefore the System.
                     (beat)
                Reordon, the ginger midget,
                represents Man. We found his body
                here...

      He points to a spot on the map south of the Thames. It
      corresponds to the point on the cross that Holmes drew
      that has the hair (6 o'clock).

                              HOLMES
                Then Sir Thomas, Master of the
                Temple, wore the ox ring... he
                died here...

      Again the spot Holmes points is directly north of the
      river and corresponds to the point on the cross that has
      the ox bone (12 o'clock).

                hundred years -- and not by
                coincidence.

      He points to corresponding points on the map and on the
      cross.

                              WATSON
                Man, Ox, Eagle...

      He connects the dots on the map.   They form three points
      of a cross.

                              WATSON
                And last on the list:    the Lion.
      Holmes scribbles on a piece of paper. Watson and Irene
      step closer looking at the lion's fang and then the
      map...

                              HOLMES
                Correspondingly, the map will tell
                us the location of Blackwood's
                final act. Right here.

      Irene indicates the fifth circle Holmes has drawn -- the

      to where it would correspond to on the map -- right in
      the middle of the river.

                              HOLMES

                 Follow these plans.

       Watson goes down. It looks as though Holmes is about to
       join them when Lestrade and his men burst into the room.
       Holmes kicks the hatch closed and steps towards Lestrade.

       Holmes sits battered, cuffed and bruised, though we can
       see from his face that his spirits are unaffected by his
       physical state. Tough-looking cops sit either side of
       him, Lestrade sits opposite, shaking his head -- he can't
       believe it's come to this. He looks at Holmes.

      The place is a hive of activity, preparing for pomp and
      circumstance, at its ceremonial best.

      All of which is in stark contrast to the battered figure
      of Holmes, who is marched through a series of doors and
      checkpoints along the corridors of power by an angry-
      looking Lestrade. They come to a door. Lestrade knocks.

                Begging your pardon, m'lord, I
                know it's unorthodox, but Mr.
                Holmes has been making serious
                accusations about you and the
                order, sir.

      Lestrade pulls his lapel, revealing a temple of four
      orders pin.

                              HOLMES
                Oh, that solves the great mystery
                as to how you became inspector.

      Lestrade punches Holmes.

                              LORD COWARD
                I have five minutes before my next
                engagement, why don't you regale
                me with your stories of
                conspiracies. Thank you,
                Lestrade, if you could wait
                outside.

      Lestrade leaves and shuts the door.

                              HOLMES
                I'm curious, Coward, did you
                assist Blackwood in all the
                murders or just the one I
                prevented? Very distinctive those
                hand-made shoes of yours, but the
                price of quality is the unique
                imprint they leave.

      Coward walks towards his desk at one end of the room.
      Holmes goes to warm himself by the fire at the other end.

                               HOLMES
                Nonetheless, I confess to being
                completely out-matched. I could
                deduce very little from my
                investigation.

      Coward turns away for a moment -- Holmes subtly kicks a
      log from the fire, it starts to smolder and fill the room
      with smoke.

                              HOLMES
                Fortunately, there is nothing more
                stimulating than a case where
                everything goes against you. How
                many members of parliament do you
                intend to murder at noon today?
                     (beat)
                Man, ox, eagle, lion -- the lion
                is parliament, isn't it?

      Lord Coward slows, looks at Holmes in some astonishment.

                              LORD COWARD
                Very clever. But it's not murder,
                Mr. Holmes. It's mercy. We are
                giving the weak masses a strong
                shepherd. Don't you see it's for
                their own good?

      Smoke fills the room so that Holmes is concealed. Coward
      pulls a gun from the desk and moves to the window. He
      opens it to try and clear the smoke.

                              HOLMES
                No, but I don't care much what you
                think. I simply wanted to know
                the location of Blackwood's final
                ceremony, and now you have given
                it to me.

                              LORD COWARD
                I have told you nothing.

      A pair of handcuffs, slide across the floor to Coward's
      feet. He looks up and Holmes is nowhere to be found.
      Coward quickly moves across the room to lock the door.

                              HOLMES

                But your clothes say infinitely
                more than you ever hope. The mud

                A faint aroma of excrement, from
                where you have been standing.

      Coward, Blackwood, and the Temple members perform a
      ritual around a pentagram in the SEWERS. The big
      ceremonial sword is prominent.

                              LORD COWARD (V.O.)
                It's a shame you made an enemy out
                of Blackwood, Holmes, you would
                have made a valuable ally. The
                powers at our disposal are far
                greater than you can imagine.

                              HOLMES (V.O.)
                You and Blackwood laid the final
                touches to your ceremony in the

                Both Houses met today. The entire
                government will be present.

                               LORD COWARD
                How terrible is wisdom, Holmes,
                when it brings no profit to the
                wise.
                      (turning to Holmes)
                We take power at noon.

      REVEAL Holmes sitting in a chair behind Coward.

                              HOLMES
                Well there's no time to waste
                then, is there?

      Coward spins around and shoots at Holmes. He misses.
      Holmes runs towards the open window as Coward fires
      another shot.

      With a single bound, Holmes leaps out of the window
      Coward opened.

      Coward runs to the window and sees Holmes DIVING toward
      the river Thames, PLUMMETING down down down to --

      EXT. THAMES - OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT
      SPLASH! Holmes dives into the river handcuffed. He
      disappears for a moment then surfaces, looks about in the
      water. A moment of concern until we hear the familiar
      "chug" of a struggling engine.

      Holmes looks in the water and sees a rope trailing on the
      surface. He grabs it with his hands. And... it pulls
      him closer to the rickety boat of Captain Tanner.

      Watson stands on the rear deck, pulling Holmes in on the
      rope. Irene is also present.

      When Holmes is level, Watson leans over and clips off his
      cuffs using bolt cutters. Clearly the whole escape has
      been planned. Holmes is pulled up into the boat.

                              TANNER
                     (to Watson)
                I told you he'd be coming out the
                top window, soldier boy. No way
                he'd be coming over the terrace.

      Watson hands over the change from the engagement ring.
      Tanner takes it happily.

                              WATSON
                How was Lestrade?

                              HOLMES
                Performed his role perfectly.   A
                little too perfectly, come to
                think of it.

      Watson has the PAPER that Holmes gave him in the attic.

                              WATSON
                Well, your instructions were
                fairly precise... about everything
                except the window.

      Tanner smiles, still pleased with himself.

                              IRENE
                Where to, Sherlock?

      Holmes points to a dark recess in the embankment.

                              HOLMES
                Port side, Captain Tanner, into
                the sewers.

      Tanner turns the boat.   Irene looks out, her eyes narrow.

                              HOLMES
                Watson, did you bring my clothes?

      Watson hands over a pile of clothes and Holmes' PISTOL.
      Holmes opens the drum, checks the load, grimaces, pockets
      it. He's never going to like guns.

       Then Holmes reaches inside a pocket of clothes he is
       still wearing, and pulls out the hip FLASK that he took
       from the men at the slaughterhouse. He takes a shot.

                                IRENE
                  Starting early, aren't we?

       He offers the flask to her.

                                HOLMES
                  Trust me, have a drink.

       She can see this is more than a social invitation, she
       takes a hit, pulls a face. Holmes nods towards Watson,
       Irene passes him the bottle. He drinks, grimaces, hands
       it on to Tanner, who swallows it without flinching, wipes
       his mouth, smiles. The boat is almost at the sewers.

                                WATSON
                  What are we doing in the sewers?

                                HOLMES
                  Patience, Doctor. I am about to
                  show you...

       As they head toward the sewers, Holmes glances up toward
       Big Ben, the time moving toward noon.

       Tanner's boat, unlit, floats at the opening to the
       tunnel, on the edge of the darkness.

                                TANNER
                  Far as I can go.

       Holmes and Watson leap off the boat into the mouth of the
       sewer. Irene follows. (Watson has his SWORD STICK and a
       GUN, Holmes has changed into the clothes Watson brought
       for him.)

       They move through the shadowy sewer tunnels, working
       their way around corners and through junctions back under
       the Houses of Parliament.

      Holmes ducks around a corner, stops. Irene and Watson
      flank him, standing in shadows. They look down a long
      tunnel to:

      The area where Coward and Blackwood were seen in the
      flashback ceremony with the sword. But now:

      Blackwood's THUGS patrol the area. In the center, the
      pentagram remains. But there is something sitting in it,
      a futuristic device:

                              HOLMES
                Behold, Blackwood's magic.

      A black glass cylinder is housed in a metal cradle with
      electrodes on either side. It sits below a shattered
      ceiling, bricks dismantled, exposing a VENTILATION PIPE.
      Holmes looks back at Watson and Irene. Quiet:

                              HOLMES
                A chemical weapon. The first of
                its kind. Cyanide, to be precise.

                              WATSON
                You can tell that from here?

                               HOLMES
                No.   I can tell it from here.
      He pulls something out of his pocket:    the RAT TAIL.

                              HOLMES
                I snipped this off a rather
                recumbent rat at the
                slaughterhouse. Note the blue
                discoloration, the faint smell of
                bitter almonds. Tell-tale signs
                of cyanide.

      He points at the device and the exposed shaft over it.

                              HOLMES
                That shaft leads directly to
                Parliament. When activated, those
                electrodes on either side will
                send a charge converting the
                cyanide powder into a gas.

                              IRENE

       channel, DOWN a bend, all the way through a GRATE TO --

       Air blows UP through the grate. The chamber is now full
       of Lords and senior Royals. As they start to take seats,
       Lord Coward steps up, checks the crowd. He sees a shadow
       up in the Lords' Gallery.

                 Seven minutes to twelve...

       They nod. Shoulder-to-shoulder, they move down the
       tunnel, faster and faster.

       Irene trails them closely.

       Watson slides his sword stick into a loop on his belt.
       It's there when he needs it, out of the way otherwise.

       They draw their guns.
       They burst into the area, completely surprising the three
       thugs.

       Watson pistol-whips the nearest.    Holmes front-kicks the
       next.

       The third thug looks down the barrels of both their guns
       before he has a chance to fight or flee.

                                  HOLMES
                 I wouldn't.

       He doesn't. Irene comes in behind them and heads
       straight for the device.

                               WATSON
                 I'll keep these under wraps.

                              HOLMES
                Take this.

      Holmes hands Watson his gun. Gun in each hand, Watson
      herds the three thugs away from the device.

                              WATSON
                Over there.

      Sullen, but without much resistance, they move away (two
      dragging the pistol-whipped one, who is out). Watson
      turns so that he can watch the action at the device --

      -- which puts his back to another tunnel.

      Holmes joins Irene at the device. She grips her knife,
      looking for a way to detach the CYLINDER from the CRADLE
      (where electric coils and circuits pulse).

                              IRENE
                I've never seen anything like it.

                              HOLMES
                There's never been anything like
                it. A totally wire-free weapon.
                He must have some kind of remote
                device sending a signal to the
                receiver. Really quite --

      She reaches out with her knife and... ZAP! Her blade
      hits a coil, sparks flashing. Electrocuted, she drops
      the knife, which falls into the cradle, surrounded by
      humming, sparking coils.

      Irene recoils, sees something past Holmes --
      RACK PAST HOLMES TO WATSON --

      Where DREDGER LOOMS OUT OF THE DARK BEHIND HIM, both
      hands held high to grab the guns and smash Watson.

      Before Irene can alert him, Watson's wrists are crushed
      from behind. Dredger jerks Watson's arms sideways,
      sending both guns spinning away --

      -- Holmes's gun splashes into the sewer.

      Dredger spins Watson around, head-butts him with a teeth-
      rattling blow, flings Watson away like a discarded paper
      cup.

      Now unguarded, the two conscious thugs charge Holmes and
      Irene.

      Irene shoots one point blank with her Derringer, Holmes
      crushes the other's larynx.

                              HOLMES
                     (to Irene)
                Keep at it.

      Holmes goes for Dredger.


113   INT. PARLIAMENT - DAY                                       113

      Lords and Royals sit in this august hall, waiting for the
      session to begin. Coward looks up, and points, very
      emphatically.

                                 LORD COWARD
                Look.

      All eyes rise to see: BLACKWOOD, up in the Lords'
      Gallery. The hall goes silent, staring at a ghost.
      Blackwood is calm, commanding.

      Voices rise; Blackwood's followers move to block the
      doors as --

      BONG! The first CHIME OF NOON from Big Ben.

114                                                               114
      INT. SEWERS - DAY
      The chime echoes. Dredger charges towards the device and
      Irene. Holmes flies into him feet-first, deflecting him
      for a moment.

      It is now clear that Dredger's sole purpose is to protect
      the device.

      Irene sits at the device, trying to figure out how to
      defuse it.

      BONG!

      The second chime resounds. Dredger grabs Holmes, thrusts
      him upwards against the sewer roof, simultaneously
      strangling him and hammering him against the bricks hard
      enough to dislodge some.

      Holmes lashes out with his feet at Dredger -- who doesn't
      even bother to block anything. Holmes' kicks lose steam
      as he loses air.

      BONG!

                      (without looking up)
                 Nine strokes left.

      Dredger grins --

      -- until he is earholed from behind by two bricks, swung
      with full force by Watson.

      Dredger drops Holmes, staggers back holding his bleeding
      ears. Holmes heads back to Irene.

      Watson draws the sword from his sword stick.   Deadly
      enough, but not very big.

                               WATSON
                 You owe me for the ring.

      Dredger backs off, as if scared of the sword -- but only
      until he can reach up and pull Blackwood's ceremonial
      sword down off a brick ledge. This is going to be more
      uneven than usual.

      BONG!

      As Watson parries Dredger's massive slashes and thrusts
      all around them, only just keeping Dredger at bay --

      -- Holmes sees that the cylinder is welded onto the
      cradle by two RODS. His eyes narrow, a plan forming.

                               HOLMES
                 Give me your gun. The bullets, I
                 need the bullets.

      BONG!   The clock is ticking down.

      Irene pops open her Derringer, slides the bullets into
      Holmes' hand. He chops open the bullet casings with his
      knife, pouring the gunpowder into --

      -- the bowl of his pipe.

      BONG!

      Watson ducks a whooshing cut, lunges with his little
      sword, sticks it into the meat of Dredger's bicep.

      Dredger grunts angrily, flexes his bicep, rips the sword
      out of Watson's grasp with his muscle, then he pulls it
      out, snaps the blade against the wall like a twig, and
      moves in to cut Watson in two with the ceremonial sword
      from head to toe.

      Watson dives desperately, gets a haircut from the sword --

       -- which shatters against the floor.

       While Watson is down, Dredger punts him into the sewer
       with a splash, then turns back to the device.

       BONG!

115    INT. HOUSE OF LORDS                                          115

       Blackwood has lit four small red candles, placed them on
       the balustrade in front of him. He calmly intones a
       familiar chant. Lords are on their feet. Guards are
       banging outside the doors, but the doors are locked.
       Members of the Temple of Four Orders stand in front of
       anyone going to open them.

       INT. SEWER TUNNEL - DAY
       Holmes rips the stem off his pipe, places the open end of
       the bowl against the bolt holding the cylinders in place.
       Shaped charge, Victorian-style.

                               HOLMES
                 We need a light, a match --

       Irene's eyes narrow, seeing something in the cradle:   her
       KNIFE. She rolls up a sleeve.

                                 IRENE
                 Got it...
       Which is when a blood-maddened Dredger thunders into them
       both, arms wide, driving Holmes and Irene away from the
       device --

       -- hammering them into the wall with a mighty thud. Then
       he braces his massive feet, angles his huge legs and
       pushes, squeezes them against the wall like a human vice.

       That's the extent of Dredger's plan, and it will work for
       long enough because --

       BONG!

                                IRENE
                      (breath crushing out

       ON THE DEVICE AS IT GOES ACTIVE

       The batteries begin to fizz madly, cams turn, gears
       ratchet past each other. Bad news.

                               WATSON (O.S.)
                 Hey!

       Dredger turns his head so that he can see Watson, on his
       belly, crawled from the sewer -- where he found HOLMES'
       GUN.

       BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! Four white phosphorous tracers
       strobe through the sewer, stitch a line down Dredger's
       back (aimed so as not to hit Holmes or Irene on the
       through-and-through) --

       -- and continue to burn inside Dredger. He lurches away,
       eyes bulging, mouth wide with a silent scream.

       BONG!

                               IRENE
                 Two!

       Holmes and Irene stagger for the device.

       Fizzling, boiling inside, the dying giant falls like a
       tree.

       Watson is face-down on the stones, still.   The gun falls
       out of his limp hand.

       Irene swipes her hand down into the cradle, just barely
       avoiding the sparks and coils, snatching her blade,
       and...

       ZAP! A spark hits the blade, and she angles the blade,
       redirecting the spark toward --

       Holmes' pipe, which BLOWS WITH A VICIOUS CRACK!   The
       shaped charge shears the steel rods.

       Holmes and Irene reach for the cylinders.

       BONG!

       Watson rolls over, sits up.     He's done, had enough.

                               HOLMES
                 Come on, you've got to admit,
                 you're going to miss this.

                               WATSON
                 Which part? The stench of the
                 sewers or the broken bones?
                      (beat)
                 My ankle's done.

       Watson looks around.

                                  WATSON
                 Where's Irene?

       Holmes turns, looks. The cylinders are gone, and so is
       Irene. His face darkens. He misread her yet again.

                               WATSON
                 Holmes, I'm sorry...

       Holmes sees Irene's lithe shadow moving fast into a maze
       of tunnels. He motions to the disabled device.

                               HOLMES
                 Make sure Lestrade keeps it
                 intact.

       Watson nods.   He watches Holmes sprint into the darkness,
       face grim.

118A                                                                118A
       INT. HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY
       Blackwood flashes downward through the ornate official
       understory of the Houses, heads for a staircase
       spiralling even further down.

                                                        106.


118B   INT. SEWER TUNNELS - DAY                                   118B

       Irene hears Holmes' angry footsteps behind her, turns,
       sees a flash of movement through the labyrinth of tunnels
       and columns. She picks up speed.
                                                          CUT TO:

       ANGLE FROM THE SIDE

       Blackwood enters the maze of tunnels, hears, then sees
       Irene sprint across the maze, about 500 yards away.

       Then Holmes.

       Blackwood follows them.    Sees something on the ground
       ahead -- pauses.

       It's WATSON'S SWORD STICK, flung there from the previous
       action with Dredger.

       Blackwood scoops it up.

118C                                                              118C
       INT. SINGLE SEWER TUNNEL - DAY
       Panting, Irene runs along a tunnel that steps lower --

       -- and pinches tighter. A large-diameter water pipe
       angles down the tunnel wall, forcing Irene to turn
       sideways to continue.

       The sound of Holmes' footsteps drives her forward.

       And then the tunnel ends. The water pipe breaks off
       jaggedly in mid-air, next to Irene's head.
       The continuation of the pipe passes through solid brick
       at the end of the tunnel -- a dark, claustrophobic
       gamble. Irene hesitates for a moment, then slithers into
       the pipe, into the unknown.


118D   INT. PIPE - DAY                                            118D

       The pipe angles down, damp, horrible. For a long moment
       it is pitch black, pinched down. Irene's quick, anxious
       breath the only point of reference.

       This is as tight, subterranean, dark and nightmarishly
       claustrophobic as it gets.

       Then, almost imperceptibly, light.

       We can make out Irene's determined profile. Light
       increases, and so does Irene's rate of movement.

                                                          107.


118E   INT. CELLAR - DAY                                           118E

       The pipe emerges from the brick wall in what looks to be
       the cellar of a building. Stonework fairly new.

       Dim daylight from an unseen opening shows a fixed ladder
       heading upwards. Irene accelerates for it.


118F   INT. PIPE - DAY                                             118F

       Holmes grimaces, enters the pipe, shimmies TOWARDS us.
       An even tighter fit for him.


118G   INT. CELLAR - ON THE LADDER - DAY                           118G

       Irene -- climbing with one hand, cylinders in the other --
       reaches an iron grate, has to use all her strength to
       shoulder it aside. As fit and athletic as she is, this
       is a grind.

118H                                                               118H
       INT. HOLLOW BUILDING - DAY
       Irene emerges at the base of a dark, hollow building full
       of construction equipment, and sees, yes --

       -- more stairs, upward.   The only ready way out.

       Gritting her teeth, chest heaving, Irene charges the
       stairs --


118I   INT. CELLAR - DAY                                           118I
       -- just as Holmes pops out of the pipe, vaults onto the
       fixed ladder and swarms up it. Anger lends him energy.


118J   INT. HOLLOW BUILDING - DAY                                  118J

       IN A SERIES OF TIME JUMPS MARKED BY INCREASING
       EXHAUSTION:

       Irene finally makes it to a floor in the building that is
       flooded with sky-bright daylight.

       She surges for light -- a brick-framed window -- and --

                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

                                                         108.


118K   EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - REVERSE ANGLE -         118K
       DAY

       OF IRENE at the top of TOWER BRIDGE. She's climbed up
       the inside of the Tower. She's 250 feet above the
       Thames.

       We've gone straight from maximum claustrophobia to
       maximum knee-buckling exposure.

       PULL BACK and SWEEP INTO a massive, NEAR 360-DEGREE
       HELICOPTER SHOT that starts with Irene at the
       (unfinished) window --

       -- then shows the skeletal bridge spanned tenuously with
       scaffolding --

       -- then the glory of London, the center of the world,
       laid out for us in breathtaking, spectacular beauty --

       -- and returns to Irene as, recovered somewhat -- she
       darts onto the walkway scaffolding that crosses above the
       Thames.

119-119G OMITTED                                                 119-119G


119H   EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - WALKWAY - DAY                             119H

       Irene works her way through the construction debris on
       the bridge. She makes it to the end, no further to go.                

                                 SHERLOCK

       Sherlock appears behind her, winded.                                  

                                 SHERLOCK                                    
                   It's bad manners to leave without                         
                   at least saying `goodbye.'                                

       Irene turns.                                                          

                                 IRENE                                       
                   Goodbye!                                                  

       He start to move towards her.     She whips out her gun.              

                                 IRENE                                       
                   You of all people know I will pull

       They circle around each other.

                               IRENE                                      
                 I'd tell you I'm sorry, that I                           
                 wish things could be different but                       
                 you wouldn't believe me anyway.

                 Why hurry off, give it a try.                            

       He moves in again.   She shoots him in the arm.                    

       And in that split second --                                        

       Blackwood drops down from behind Irene, HITS her with              
       WATSON'S SWORD STICK. She drops, stunned. As she falls,            
       Blackwood plucks the cylinder out of her hand, and kicks           
       her gun away. Her gun goes flying off the side of the              
       bridge. But Irene doesn't pause:                                   

       She swings her legs through the air, trying to take out            
       Blackwood's knees. But he swipes her legs away, and                
       KICKS DOWN and --                                                  

       IRENE FALLS OFF THE BRIDGE.                                        

                               BLACKWOOD

       EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - WALKWAY - DAY
                                                                          
       A look between them and then it's on. Holmes grabs a
       short section of wooden batten out of the railing.
       Flimsy, no match for the sword --

       -- which is immediately apparent as Blackwood comes in,
       slashes, chops six inches off the batten.

                               BLACKWOOD                                  
                 I planned to kill a handful of                           
                 senile old men to make this empire                       
                 strong... but now because of you                         
                 thousands are going to die.                              

       Holmes is on the defensive throughout, but, as before,
       his target is the cylinder first, Blackwood second, self
       defense third.

                               BLACKWOOD                                  
                 All I have to do is break this                           
                 cylinder. The wind will do the                           
                 rest. And you'll be the first.                           

       The two men continue their swordfight: Holmes grabs some           
       rope hanging from the scaffolding above and swings off             
       the bridge. Blackwood steps to the edge with his sword             
       out, awaiting Holmes. Holmes swings towards the blade              
       and then pushes off the bridge once again to avoid it.             

       Holmes swings back onto the bridge a few feet away from            
       Blackwood. He lands, whips off his scarf and twirls it             
       around Blackwood's arm, binding them together. They                
       continue to spar, now bound.                                       

       Blackwood snarls, mounts a frenzied attack, which Holmes           
       simply tries to survive. The two men finally part, with            
       Holmes cast off towards the end of the bridge.                     

       Blackwood smiles. He grabs Holmes' gun (which Blackwood            
       knocked from Irene's hand earlier).                                

       Blackwood fires at Holmes. Holmes quickly ducks. The               
       bullet misses him, but hits a bucket twirling above his            
       head. A black liquid (tar) begins to pour out in a                 
       circle around him.                                                 

       Holmes turns, as if to flee (not that there's anywhere to
       go) -- his eyes lock on to something. He looks back to             
       Blackwood.                                                         

       -- Holmes kicks a huge scaffolding plank, which falls --

       -- whipping a coil of rope across the floor, hooking
       Blackwood around his ankle.

       Blackwood is DRAGGED down the walkway by the weight of
       the falling plank, pulled toward the edge.

       Holmes grabs the cylinders as Blackwood passes.                   

       Blackwood digs his fingers into a gap, screeching to a
       painful halt. His fingers are white from strain. Holmes
       remains cool.

                               HOLMES

       Holmes looks over the edge of the walkway. He sees the
       plank swinging dangerously in the storm. Blackwood
       strains desperately to hold on. As Holmes steps closer
       we INTERCUT with relevant FLASHBACKS.

       Blackwood struggles to hold on, he loses his grip for a
       second and is dragged back toward the precipice. Wind
       whips harder.

       Holmes doesn't notice: The Raven's rope SNAPS, starting
       a slow, subtle DOMINO EFFECT IN B.G.: a bucket drops,
       hits a row of standing timbers. The timbers start to
       topple.

       (NOTE: Each time one object strikes another, we hear a
       faint musical note moving up the same pentatonic scale
       that Holmes played earlier for his flies.)

                               HOLMES
                 You hated your father and the                           
                 other members of the Temple of the                      
                 Four Orders for what they did to                        
                 you. How satisfying it must have                        
                 been to use their own system                            
                 against them.                                           

       IN B.G.: We see the slow, inexorable dominoes continue
       to fall. The last timber falls over the edge, lands on a
       rope. The rope yanks down a crane, the crane swings,
       strikes another crane...

                               BLACKWOOD
                 Cut me loose, Holmes!

       Blackwood's eyes are full of fear. Holmes thoughtfully
       looks out at the angry storm, the atmosphere electric and
       dangerous. Holmes gives the slightest hint of a smile.

                               HOLMES
                 You better hope that it's nothing                       
                 more than superstition as you                           
                 performed all the rituals
                 perfectly.                                              

       Holmes looks around at the gathering storm.
                                                                         
       Blackwood can hold on no longer. He screams as he
       releases his grip and is torn down the walkway at
       breakneck speed.

       Quick as a snake, Holmes grabs a workman's ax placed on
       the side and hurls it at his feet, cutting the rope.

       Blackwood's imminent death is brought suddenly to a halt.
       The storm grows in ferocity. Holmes bends down,
       Blackwood is on his knees, cowed.

                  First, the world will see you for                        
                  what you are. Then you will                              
                  hang... properly this time.                              

       Blackwood looks up. CRACK! The crane dislodges a METAL              
       GIRDER, which misses Holmes by inches as it crashes
       through the floorboards --

       Blackwood smirks.                                                   

                                BLACKWOOD                                  
                  We'll see about that shall we.                           
                  It's a long journey from here to                         
                  the rope.                                                

       CREAK.   Holmes looks up.    Blackwood looks up.                    

                                HOLMES                                     
                  We'll see about that shall we.                           

       BANG! The top of the crane crashes down. The wooden                 
       infrastructure supporting Blackwood falls away.                     

       Sending Blackwood falling into a lattice of HANGING
       CHAINS below. Blackwood screams as the chains begin to              
       snap off one by one. He falls farther... and farther...
       and finally --

       SNAP! The last chain CATCHES, TIGHTENS around
       Blackwood's neck, killing him instantly.

       Blackwood dangles on the rusty chain, hanged like a
       common man after all, with Tower Bridge as his gibbet.

       Holmes just stands there, stunned. He looks out to see:
       the RAVEN flying away, a silhouette against the stormy
       sky. The bird flaps its wings, disappearing into a
       cloud.

       His brow furrows. Perhaps there really are some things              
       that cannot be explained.
                                                                           
       Holmes looks over the side of the bridge, sees:

       IRENE is awkwardly splayed on the lower level. She                  
       appears to be dead, possibly a small trickle of blood is            
       coming out of her mouth. Holmes moves down to her. He               
       takes her hand.

       Her eyes pop open.                                                 

       Irene makes a quick move: she tries to CUFF him.   But             
       this time, Holmes is ready for it:                                 

       He reverses the move, cuffing her instead.   He takes a            
       seat next to her.                                                  

       They sit there for a beat, an odd lovers' moment looking           
       out over the Thames.

       Holmes reaches over to grab the key. Their faces close,               
       near a kiss. Holmes drops the keys down the top of her                
       shirt (just as she dropped them down his pants). He
       snatches the DIAMOND from around her neck, turns and                  
       walks away. She smiles, calls out:

       Holmes walks away, pauses to pick up Watson's sword                   
       stick, keeps walking.

       At the end of the top of the stairs.    Holmes hands the              
       Cylinder to one of the policemen.

                  It'll be a hell of a trick if
                  Blackwood comes back from this
                  one.

                                HOLMES
                  Thank you, Lestrade.

                                LESTRADE
                  Now you're going to be even more
                  arrogant and insufferable than
                  ever.

       Then Lestrade cracks a smile.

                                LESTRADE
                  You're welcome, detective.
                       (beat)
                  Is the woman up there?

                                HOLMES
                  She won't be by the time your boys
                  get there.

       Holmes keeps moving into the night. The storm curls
       around him, the rain falling hard. And he sees...

       A shadow is waiting for him. We recognize the figure of
       WATSON. Holmes can't help but smile. He joins Watson,
       no words spoken.

       Holmes holds out Watson's sword stick. Watson takes it.
       The two of them stand looking out down the Thames.

       MOVING DAY. Mary and Watson walk towards 221B. A DRIVER
       loads Watson's boxes into a CARRIAGE that waits in front
       of the apartment.

                                 WATSON
                 One moment.

       Watson takes a quick look in one of the boxes.

                               WATSON
                 Please make sure this one is put
                 on the desk in the front room.

                               MARY
                 What's in all those notebooks?

                               WATSON
                 Nothing really... Just a few
                 scribbles... cases we've worked on
                 over the years.

                               MARY
                 All your adventures... I'd love to
                 read them sometime.

       Watson laughs then pauses for a moment to consider this
       idea before they enter.

       As Watson and Mary climb the stairs, it becomes clear                  
       that Mary now wears IRENE'S DIAMOND on her finger.
       Holmes had it made into an engagement ring.
                               WATSON
                 I still can't believe he's given
                 us that ring.

                               MARY
                 Do you think he's finally come to
                 terms with you leaving?

                                 WATSON
                 Of course.    No question about it --

       Watson opens the door of Holmes' apartment revealing a
       horrific scene: Holmes is hanging from a rope, his back                
       to them. He looks dead.

                 Don't panic, dear.                                     

       Watson and Mary step in but do nothing to help Holmes.

                 he's far too fond of himself.                          

       Watson pokes him.   Turns him around.

                 Good afternoon. I was trying to                        
                 deduce the manner in which                             
                 Blackwood survived his execution.

                 were. But it had a surprisingly                        
                 soporific effect and I was carried                     
                 off in the arms of Morpheus, like                      
                 a caterpillar in a cocoon.

                 Shouldn't you help him, John?

       Watson and Mary walk by.

                 The executioner attached it to a                       
                 harness, thus allowing the weight                      
                 to be distributed around the waist

       He finally uses his sword stick and slices Holmes down.

                  So you're saying Moriarty was                            
                  after a part of the machine and

                  The wire-free invention was the                          
                  game all along. Imagine being

125   FLASHBACK - INT. SEWER JUNCTION                             125

      We FOLLOW POLICEMEN heading into the sewer tunnel.

      They spread out to seal the crime scene, where Holmes had
      dismantled Blackwood's device.

                              CONSTABLE CLARK (V.O.)
                We believe Sergeant Smith was the
                first officer there.

      SERGEANT SMITH sees a POLICEMAN leaning over the device.

                              SERGEANT
                Oi, what you doing?

      The policeman looks up, and a GUN slides into his hand by
      means of the same device we saw in the carriage scene
      with Irene. We don't see his face.

                              CONSTABLE CLARK (V.O.)
                Shot in the head.

      BANG!

                                                         117.


126   INT. 221 BAKER ST. (PRESENT)                                    126

                              HOLMES
                Were there powder burns on his
                eyebrows?

      Clarky nods.

                              CONSTABLE CLARK
                He was shot at point-blank range.

      Holmes and Watson look at each other -- complete change
      of demeanor -- mind racing, looking concerned.

      The dog has regained its vital signs.

                              WATSON
                There's a brave boy... There,
                there, everything's going to be
                all right.

                              HOLMES
                Where is Blackwood's device now?

                deduction, however.

                 Moriarty was after the machine not
                 the poison.

      Holmes nods.

                               HOLMES
                 Blackwood's wire-free invention
                 was the game all along. It is
                 undoubtedly the more dangerous and
                 the more valuable of the two...
                      (wistful)
                 Irene was just a diversion.

      Mary looks at Watson who is clearly trying to curb his
      enthusiasm and interest.

      A KNOCK.   The MAN from the stairs pokes his head in.

                               MAN
                      (to Watson)
                 I've loaded the last of your

                 Well...

127   EXT. 221 BAKER ST. - DAY                                      127

      Mary and Gladstone wait for Watson in the carriage.

      Holmes and Watson stand in the doorway.    A stiff beat.
      Holmes extends an awkward hand.

                              HOLMES
                An honor working with you, Doctor.

      Watson shakes Holmes' hand, puts a hand on his arm.      A
      warm look, an understanding between the two men.

                              WATSON
                Take care of yourself, Holmes.

      Watson moves to the open door of the carriage but Mary
      stops him.

                              MARY
                Try not to be too late for dinner
                with my parents and... be careful.

      She waves to Holmes as the carriage pulls away.   Watson
      looks relieved and excited.

                              HOLMES
                Magnificent woman, Watson.
                Magnificent!

      They climb into Constable Clarke's black mariah which
      pulls away down Baker St. We PULL BACK FROM the carriage
      WIDE and UP like our opening on Baker Street -- perhaps
      the POV of the raven.

                                                        FADE OUT.

                         1

          INT KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM DAWN
          JOHN FLANDERS KITTREDGE and LOUISA KITTREDGE ("FLAN" and
          "OUISA") , an attractive couple in their 40s, in their night
          clothes are in an uncharacteristic state of shock.
          Some sort of horrible disaster has happened to them.
          THEY survey their living room which under normal
          circumstances would appear to be a serene haven.
          But why are they-so aghast? And terrified?
          Has the apartment been violated?
          The Fifth Avenue apartment, red and cozy, threadbare with
          the legacy of years of kids and dogs running in and out, is
          filled with beautiful objects chosen with care. Even though
          the apartment is 19th Century in feel, a lot of modern
          paintings hang on the walls.
          No. No visible disaster here.
          But then why FLAN and OUISA's emotional state? THEY run
          between the hall and the living room.

                         OUISA
          Is anything gone?
          OUISA opens the front closet with trepidation. But nothing
          leaps out. SHE sees a mink is still there..

                         FLAW
          How can I look? I'm shaking.

                         OUISA
          My god! The Kandinsky!
          0UISA runs into the living room. SHE can see by the
          discoloration on that wall that a painting is missing.

                         OUISA Y
          It's gone! Call the police!

                         FLAN
          There it is!
          An early abstract painting by Kandinsky leans against a
          Philadelphia Chippendale chair: the painting is wild and
          brilliantly colored.

                         0UISA
          Thank god!
          SHE picks the painting up and flips it around. It's a double
          sided painting. The artist, Kandinsky, had painted in
          different styles on either side of the canvas.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         2
          One side of the painting is geometric and somber; the other
          side is all chaos and brilliant colors.
          OUISA replaces the framed canvas on the wall where it
          belongs, but the side she chooses to display is the
          geometric side. SHE admires it.
          FLAN opens the door from the hall into

          THE OFFICE.
          A computer. Calendars. File cabinets. Bulletin boards with
          prints of paintings tacked on. FLAN checks - the slide
          projector is there. FLAN opens and closes cabinet drawers.
          OUISA appears in the doorway of the office.

                         OUISA
          We could've been killed.

                         FLAN
          Don't say that. The silver Victorian inkwell!
          FLAN runs past OUISA down the hall back to the living room.
          OUISA follows HIM back into

          THE LIVING ROOM.
          FLAN looks on an antique table crowded with framed family
          photographs going way back in time and all kinds of
          mementoes.

                         OUISA
          How can you think of things? We could have been
          murdered.

                         FLAN
          I want to know if anything's gone?
          HE picks up an ornate Victorian inkwell capped by a silver
          beaver and looks at it with great objectivity..

                         FLAN
          There's the inkwell. Silver beaver. Why?
          OUISA, drained, looks out the window down onto Central Park.

                         OUISA
          Slashed ---our throats slashed.
          Go to bed at night happy and then murdered.
          Would we have-woken up?
          OUISA screams.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         3
          But it's their pug dog licking her leg.
          OUISA picks up the dog and pets it.
          FLAN remembers something and buries his face in his hands.


                         FLAN
          We have to go to the wedding.

                         OUISA
          I am in no mood to go to any wedding.

                         FLAN
          We have to

                         OUISA
          They're your friends

                         FLAN
          I beg to differ. They're Your fr -
          FLAN stops, frightened suddenly, listening.

                         FLAN
          Hello?
          OUISA runs to HIM, terrified. HE holds HER.

                         OUISA (WHISPERS)
          You don't call out Hello unless--
          THEY walk softly to the dark hall.

                         FLAN
          I think we could tell if someone else was here.

                         OUISA
          We didn't all night.
          THEY look down the silent dark hall.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT THE WHITE WALL SOMEWHERE ELSE
          We don't know where we are yet but it's certainly not the
          KITTREDGE'S. The rain drumming outside and the distant
          thunder and the soft cool jazz playing makes the air of this
          room with the white wall, wherever it is, claustrophobic,
          even erotic.
          A YOUNG BLACK MAN whose name is PAUL comes into frame and
          leans against this white wall. Right off, you say this
          YOUNG MAN is a winner.
          PAUL frowns, then smiles. Right into the camera.

                         PAUL

                         (SERIOUS)
          Hello.

                         (FLIRTATIOUS)
          Hello.

                         (QUESTIONING)
          Hello?

                         (SUSPICIOUS)
          Hello...

                         (ELATED)
          Hello!
          Yes.
          Hello.
          SOMEONE OFF SCREEN claps.
          PAUL bows to the OFF SCREEN PRESENCE.

          EXT KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT BUILDING 910 FIFTH AVENUE DAY
          OUISA and FLAN run out of their apartment building, their
          clothes hastily pulled on, their faces swollen with shock.
          THEY run down the side street into

          THE GARAGE.
          Their car is waiting - a Mercedes - FLAN slips the
          attendant a bill. FLAN gets in the driver's seat.
          OUISA gets in the passenger seat.
          FLAN (a statement of fact)
          I'm shaking.

                         OUISA
          Then I'll drive.

                         FLAN
          I have to hang on.

                         T

                         OUISA
          Let's just get there

          INT THE WHITE WALL
          The Sound of the rain, the jazz, the thunder.

                         PAUL
          Bottle of beer.
          Bottle of beer.
          Bottle of beer.
          AN UNSEEN YOUNG MAN OFF CAMERA speaks - elegant phrasing.

                         VOICE
          Bottle of beer.

                         PAUL
          Bottle- of beer.

                         VOICE
          Very good. You owe me.
          PAUL takes off his shirt. HE's strongly built. HE throws

                         
          the shirt directly into the camera.

          EXT HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY DAY
          FLAN is driving terrifically fast. OUISA puts on a tape.
          MARIA CALLAS sings the death scene from La Traviata.

                         OUISA
          Be care - !
          A CAR veers by. FLAN swerves his car.

                         OUISA
          Let me drive!

                         FLAN (FURIOUS)
          Driving calms me!

                         OUISA
          When you're in one of these moods you do not
          drive well and I do not want to be killed today.

                         FLAN
          We could have been killed last night.

                         OUISA
          Stop saying that!

                         6

          !
          FLAN pulls himself together. HE moves over to the Slow lane.

                         FLAN
          I'm driving slowly. See. Slowly.

                         OUISA
          I went in the room first.
          FLAN looks for signs.

                         FLAN
          Where's the goddam turnoff onto the Taconic?
          A truck veers and almost hits them.

                         OUISA
          You didn't see what I saw!
          FLAN puts on brakes.

                         FLAN
          It's that fucking Maria Callas!
          Turn that damn thing off!

                         
          FLAN snaps off the tape deck.
          THEY resume driving.

                         OUISA
          It's not Maria Callas. It's that truck and you.

                         FLAN
          And last night.
          THE COUNTRYSIDE speeds by.

          EXT ST PETER'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH LITHGOW, NEW YORK DAY
          LOTS OF CARS parked in front of this sweet rural wooden
          chapel near Millbrook, New York.
          THE BRIDE, 20s, gets out of a limo escorted by her FATHER.
          OUISA and FLAN run up to the BRIDE and kiss her.

                         OUISA
          Happy is the bride the sun shines on

                         BRIDE (ALARMED)
          You look horrible!

                         OUISA (BRIGHT)
          No no! Could've been killed. All fine!

                         FATHER
          What?

                         FLAN
          Wonderful wedding. Wonderful day.
          THEY run into

          THE CHAPEL.
          This.perfect country chapel with a dozen or so rows of pews
          is bedecked with flowers and lit by candles.
          A STRING QUARTET at the side of the little altar plays
          Dvorak's American Quartet.
          THE USHER in morning clothes, greets FLAN and OUISA and
          shows them to their pew.

                         USHER
          Bride's side? Groom's side.

                         FLAN
          Either side. I can't even remember
          how we met them. Why are we here?
           THEY walk down the aisle, heads down.

                         OUISA
          Do not make a scene.
          THEY kneel.

                         FLAN (WHISPER)
          Now I lay me down to sleep - the most
          terrifying words  just think of it -

                         OUISA(WHISPER)
          I pray the Lord my soul to keep-

                         FLAN (WHISPER)
          The nightmare part - If I should
          die before I wake -

                         OUISA(WHISPER)
          If I should die - I pray the Lord
          my soul to take -
          COUPLE IN THE PEW IN FRONT turn. A
          MAN, A WOMAN, strangely not unlike FLAN and OUISA, perhaps A
          few years older, perhaps more nautical as if they'd flown a
          in from Nantucket, are named SANDY and CONNIE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         SANDY
          Is anything wrong?

                         OUISA
          We were almost murdered

                         FLAN

                         THROATS SLASHED
          THE PEOPLE in the pew in front gasp.
          FLAN and OUISA are serious.
          THE QUARTET plays The Wedding March.
          EVERYONE stands.
          THE BRIDE and her FATHER walk down the aisle.
          CU OUISA'S FACE lost in thought.
          Bright vivid colors fill the screen. Later we will learn
          they are from a double-sided painting by Kandinsky, which

                         HANGS IN

          THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM.

                         OUISA (VO)

                         
          Chaos.
          OUISA'S face appears briefly, smiling, then is replaced by
          dark, geometric patterns. The other side of the painting.
          It is lowered to reveal OUISA very serious.

                         OUISA (VO)
          Control.
          (The painting is flipped.)
          Chaos.
          (OUISA smiles. Flips it again. Frowns.)
          Control.

          BACK IN THE CHAPEL
          OUISA, still frowning at her memory, realizes the wedding
          ceremony is over.
          THE BRIDE and the GROOM run up the aisle beaming at EVERYONE
          to the strains of Lohengrin.
          But even THEY slow down when THEY see the state FLAN and
          OUISA are in.

                         GROOM
          Is everything all
          FLAN snaps out of it, putting on his party smile.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         9

                         FLAN
          We always get this way at weddings.
          THE BRIDE and GROOM resume their run up the aisle.
          It's FLAN and OUISA's turn to leave the pew and go up the
          aisle. SHE is stricken.

                         OUISA
          I do not always get this way at weddings.

                         FLAN
          We're alive.
          THEY walk up the aisle into the foyer of the chapel.
          SHE puts her head into his shoulder.

                         OUISA
          Oh, it was awful awful awful awful.
          Then OUISA and FLAN put on their best smiles as THEY pass
          through a receiving line, finally shaking hands with the

          WEDDING COUPLE.

                         BRIDE

                         
          Did you say you could have been killed?

                         OUISA (MERRY)
          Yes! Only hours ago!

                         FLAN (MERRY)
          But we're here!

                         OUISA
          Wouldn't miss it!
          THE BRIDE and GROOM look after THEM.

          EXT THE MILLBROOK GOLF AND TENNIS CLUB DAY
          A spankingly bright and solid country club in Millbrook New
          York situated on the golf course grounds surrounded by lots
          of tennis courts.

          INT MILLBROOK CLUB DAY
          THE WEDDING GUESTS file into the cheery club, all bright
          white and a shade of cheery green that only country clubs
          seem to find.
          MORE GUESTS than could f it into the CHAPEL are here in the
          club waiting for the Bride and Groom.
          FLAN and OUISA hesitate before going into the ballroom.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         10
          THEY stop in the small quiet dark clubby BAR.
          THEY sit at a small table, pulling themselves together.
          SANDY and CONNIE (the people from the pew in front of them)
          come up to THEM. A WOMAN who looks like a dormouse is with
          them. SHE is named JULIA.

                         SANDY
          We hate to pry -

                         FLAN
          No no. You're not prying

                         CONNIE
          But what happened -

                         SANDY
          This is our friend Julia

                         FLAN
          Do we know each other?

                         JULIA
          Oh yes through...

                         9 FLAN
          Of course. Haven't seen them in years
          FLAN shakes hands with the new acquaintance.

                         CONNIE
          We're worried for you
          FLAN and OUISA look at each other.

                         OUISA
          Tell them!
          SANDY and CONNIE and JULIA sit down at the small table.

                         FLAN
          We were having a wonderful evening last night.

                         OUISA
          A friend we hadn't seen for many years came by
           for dinner. I don't think you know him -

                         FLAN (PORTENTOUSLY)
          Geoffrey Miller. From South Africa--

                         OUISA
          Don't say it so portentously.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         11

                         

                         FLAN (BRIGHT)
          Geoffrey from South Africa.

                         OUISA
          Don't be ga-ga.
          (THEY give their orders to THE BARTENDER.)
          Something large.

                         SANDY
          I didn't know Geoffrey was in town.

                         JULIA
          I saw him at Susie Baxter's

                         SANDY
          I wasn't at Susie Baxter's

                         CONNIE
          Sandy forgets he was married to Susie Baxter.
          THE WAITER goes.

                         SAVOY
          That's no reason why she can't
          invite me to a party.
          CONNIE whispers to JULIA, her eyes on FLAN.

                         CONNIE
          He's an art dealer.
          JULIA nods now that's she's remembered.
          FLAN (hears it)
          Private sales. Purchases.
          OUISA leans forward. Somehow the telling calms HER.
          THE CHUMS lean forward.

                         OUISA
          We knew Geoffrey

                         FLAN
          through our children when Geoffrey and his
          family all lived in New York.

                         OUISA
          They've moved back to South Africa.

                         FLAN
          He was here in New York briefly on business
          and asked us to ask him for dinner.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         12

                         OUISA
          He's King Midas rich. Literally. Gold mines.
          THE WAITER puts down the tray of drinks.

                         FLAN
          Seventy thousand workers in just one gold mine.

                         OUISA
          But he is always short of cash because his
          government won't let its people --

                         FLAN
          Its white people --

                         OUISA
          -- its white people take out any money. So it's
          like taking in a War Baby.

                         (TO WAITER)
          Thank you. That one's mine -
          THEY switch drinks.

                         FLAN
           When he called it was like a bolt from the blue
          as I had a deal coming up and was short by

                         OUISA

                         TWO MILLION
          FLAN puts down his drink.

                         FLAN
          The figure is superfluous
          OUISA turns to CONNIE.

                         OUISA
          I hate when he uses the word "superfluous". I
          mean, we needed two million and we hadn't seen
          Geoffrey in a long time and while Geoffrey might
          not have the price of a dinner he easily might
          have two million dollars.

                         FLAN
          The currents last night were very churny.

                         CUISA
          we weren't sucking up. We like Geoffrey.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         13

                         FLAN
          It's that awful thing of having truly
          rich folk for friends.

                         OUISA
          Face it. The money does get in the -

                         FLAN
          Only if you let it. The fact of the money
          shouldn't get in-

                         OUISA
          Having a rich friend is like drowning and your
          friend makes life boats. But the friend gets
          very touchy if you say one word: life boat.
          (THE CHUMS laugh.)
          Well, that's two words. We were afraid our
          South African friend might say "You only love me
          for my. life boats?" But we like Geoffrey.

                         CONNIE
          I know who he is now.

                         JULIA
           Lovely man.

                         X

                         SANDY
          Didn't he invite us to visit him?

                         FLAN
          It wasn't a life-threatening evening.

                         OUISA -
          Rich people can do something for you even if
          you're not sure what it is`you want them to do.
          THEY turn at the sound of applause.
          THE BRIDE and GROOM have entered the Country Club and our
          table in the bar looks up as THE WEDDING PARTY passes by for
          a moment rushing past the Bar into the ballroom.
          Off in the ballroom THE SMALL ORCHESTRA strikes up "Just One
          Of Those Things" for the ten thousandth time.
          EVERYONE in the club is applauding and OUR TABLE applauds
          too. OUISA starts to rise.

                         OUISA
          Should we?

                         CONNIE
          Not on your life.
          CONNIE pulls OUISA back down to the table.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         14

                         
          FLAN signals another round.

                         FLAN
          Hardly a Life Boat evening -
          OUISA sits, enjoying this.

                         OUISA (SING-SONG)
          Portentous.

                         FLAN
          But when Geoffrey called and asked us to take
          him for dinner, he made a sudden pattern in
          life's little tea leaves because who wants to
          go to banks?
          FLAN'S VOICE takes us back to last night

          INT THE KITTREDGE.'S LIVING ROOM NIGHT

                         FLAN (VO)
          Geoffrey called and our tempests settled
          into showers and life was manageable. What
          more can you want?

                         
          GEOFFREY stands up into the frame, an elegant, impeccably
          British South African, more English than the English, ten
          years older than Ouisa and Flan.
          FLAN and OUISA are both dressed very stylishly and nattily
          tonight. But not trendy, not so it shows.
          FLAN was definitely an athlete and he still keeps himself in
          trim. If HE's in the art world, there's nothing arty about
          him.

                         GEOFFREY
          Listen.
          OUISA stops doing what she's doing which is rolling out a
          drink trolley with little hors d'oeuvres on plates.
          FLAN stops doing what he's doing which is checking that a
          slide projector is in place on the desk along side the
          silver beaver inkwell.
          FLAN and OUISA both tense.

                         FLAN
          What's wrong?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         15

                         GEOFFREY
          It always amazes me when New York is so quiet.
          OUISA and FLAN relax and laugh.

                         OUISA
          With the kids away, we get used to a lower noise
          quotient.
          FLAN pours a drink for GEOFFREY.

                         FLAN
          Geoffrey, you have to move out of
          South Africa. You'll be killed.
          Why do you stay in South Africa?

                         GEOFFREY
          One has to stay there to educate the black
          workers and we'll know we've been successful
          when they kill us.

                         FLAN
          Planning the revolution that will destroy you.

                         
          OUISA sits back on the comfy sofa amazed at the thought.

                         OUISA
          Putting your life on the line.

                         GEOFFREY
          You don't think of it like that.
          I wish you'd come visit.
          OUISA takes her drink and strokes the ears of her dog.

                         OUISA
          But we'd visit you and sit in your gorgeous
          house planning trips into the townships
           demanding to see the poorest of the poor. "Are
           you sure they're the worst off? I mean, we've
           come all this way. We don't want to see people
          just mildly victimized by apartheid. We demand
          shock." It doesn't seem right sitting on the
          East Side talking about revolution.

                         FLAN
          Only small murky cafes for Pepe le Noko here.

                         OUISA
          No. La Passionaria. I will come to
          South Africa and build barricades and
          lean against them, singing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         16

                         FLAN
          And the people would follow.

                         OUISA
          "Follow Follow Follow". What's that song?

                         FLAN
          The way Gorbachev cheered on the striking coal
          miners in the Ukraine - yes, you must strike-
          it is your role in history to dismantle this
          system. Russia and Poland - you can't believe
          the developments in the world -
           (HE remembers:) "The Fantasticks" (SINGS:)
          "Follow Follow Follow".

                          OUISA
          China.
          FLAN and OUISA (despair)
          Oh.

                         GEOFFREY
          Oy vay China. As my grandmother would say.
          Our role in history. And we offer ourselves up

                         
          to it.

                         FLAN
          That is your role in history. Not our role.
          OUISA ponders this thought.

                         OUISA
          A role in history. To say that so easily.
          GEOFFREY suddenly gets up and looks through the telescope by
          the window.

                         GEOFFREY'S POV
          GEOFFREY flashes down nine floors into Central Park. HE
          frowns in puzzlement when HE sees

          A STATUE OF AN ALASKAN HUSKY
          baying up into the sky.
          FLAN and OUISA look at GEOFFREY's back and then at each
          other. How to keep the ball rolling?
          FLAN (to Geoffrey)
          Do you want another drink before we--

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         17

                         
          GEOFFREY turns into the room.

                         GEOFFREY
          Wonderful view.

                         OUISA
          The phrase - striking coal miners - I see all
           these very striking coal miners modelling the
          fall fashions.

                         GEOFFREY
          Where should we?

                         FLAN
          There's good Szechuan. And Hunan.

                         OUISA
          The sign painter screwed up the sign. Instead
          of The Hunan Wok, he painted The Human Wok.

                         GEOFFREY
          God! The restaurants! New York has become the
          Florence of the Sixteenth Century. Genius on
          every corner.

                         OUISA
          I don't think genius has kissed the Human Wok.
          THEY finish off their drinks.

                         GEOFFREY
          The new Italian looked cheery.
          FLAN and OUISA
          Good.

                         FLAN
          We made reservations.
          FLAN looks at the slide projector.

                         FLAN
          Geoffrey, I'd like to show -
          FLAN'S sentence hangs in mid-air as GEOFFREY follows OUISA

                         INTO

          THE HALL.
          OUISA burrows in the closet getting her coat and
          GEOFFREY's coat out of the hall closet stuffed with tennis
          rackets and skis and boots.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         18

                         

                         OUISA
          This restaurant - they wrap ravioli up
          like salt water taffy.
          FLAN appears behind HER to help HER.
          THEY both wrestle the coats out of the closet.

                         FLAN
          Six on a plate for a few hundred dollars.
          And FLAN gets the coats. A clatter of tennis rackets
          falling. GEOFFREY takes his topcoat.

                         GEOFFREY
          You have to come to South Africa so
          I can pay you back. I'll take you on my plane
          into the Okavango Swamps -

                         OUISA
          Did you hear - to take back to Johannesburg.
          out in Eastharpton

                         FLAN

                         LAST WEEKEND

                         OUISA
          a guy goes into one of the better food stores -

                         FLAN
          Dean and DeLuca -
          FLAN helps OUISA on with her coat.

                         OUISA
          one of the Dean and DeLuca look alikes. Gets a
          pack of cigarettes and an ice cream bar. Goes
          up front. Sees there's a line at the register.
          Slaps down two twenty dollar bills and goes out.
          GEOFFREY doesn't get the anecdote.

                         FLAN
          We sent it to the Times.
          GEOFFREY smiles politely.
          FLAN and OUISA press a little bit too hard.

                         OUISA
          They have the joke page of things
          around New York.

          They send you a bottle of champagne.
          THEY all laugh brightly.

          INT MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
          THE CHUMS listen enrapt. OUISA is serious.

                         OUISA
          We weren't auditioning but I kept thinking Two
          Million dollars Two Million dollars.

                         FLAN
          It's like when people say -Don't think about
          elephants' and all you can think about is
          elephants elephants elephants.

                         OUISA
          Two million dollars Two million dollars.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM
           OUISA and FLAN laugh brightly. THE FRONT DOORBELL rings.
           OUISA and FLAN look at each other. Who is that?
          OUISA goes into the hall.

                         OUISA
          What ever you do, don't think about elephants.

                         GEOFFREY
          Elephants?
          FLAN rapidly steers GEOFFREY to a chair, closes the living
          room door, then wheels a projector with a carousel tray into
          place.

                         FLAN
          Louisa is a dada manifesto. About the Cezanne -
          unless we're careful, it'll be sold and never
          seen again -
          FLAN switches off the room's lights and clicks on the
          projector. The slide projection of a beautiful green
          landscape by Cezanne fills the wall by the door.

          appears in the Cezanne forest holding his eyes against the
          projector's light. And OUISA behind HIM.
          FLAN clicks off the projector.
          OUISA switches on the living room lights.
          THE YOUNG BLACK MAN - PAUL - is in his early twenties, very
          handsome, very preppy. His shirt front is ripped and
          bloodied. Fresh blood. EDDIE helps PAUL to the sofa,
          OUISA following at a loss.

                          PAUL
           I'm so sorry to bother you, but I've been hurt-
           and I've lost everything and I didn't know where
           to go. Your children-- I'm a friend of --

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
          THE CHUMS are transfixed.

                         OUISA
          And he mentioned our childrens' names.

                         FLAN
          And the school where they went.

                         OUISA
          Harvard. You can say Harvard.

                         FLAN
          We don't want to get into libel.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM
          PAUL (exhausted and scared)
          I was mugged. Out there. In Central Park. By
          the statue of that Alaskan husky. I was
          standing there trying to figure out why there is
          a statue of a dog who saved lives in the Yukon
          in Central 'Park and I was standing there trying
          to puzzle it out when -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         21

                         

                         OUISA
          Are you okay?

                         PAUL
          They took my money and my brief case. I said my
          thesis is in there -
          PAUL looks down. HE sees the blood seeping through his
          shirt.

                         FLAN
          His shirt's bleeding.

                         OUISA
          His shirt is not bleeding. He's bleeding.
          PAUL holds his mouth, nauseous.

                         PAUL
          I get this way around blood.
          FLAN (leading PAUL out of the room)
          Not on the rug. Eddie, get the doctor--
           EDDIE turns to leave.

                          PAUL
           No! I'll survive. Please. No doctors -
           PAUL, frightened, looks at FLAN.
           FLAN (To EDDIE)
           We'll call if we need any -
          FLAN helps PAUL out of the room down the hall.

                         OUISA
          Thank you, Eddie -
          EDDIE goes.
          FLAN, followed by OUISA, supports PAUL into

          THE WHITE TILED BATHROOM.
          PAUL sits on the side of the tub.
          PAUL takes off his blazer and pulls off his ripped shirt.
          His tie is still around his neck. There is a good sized
           knife slash in his side by his rib cage. OUISA and FLAN
          cringe. FLAN opens the medicine cabinet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         22

                         PAUL
          I don't mind the money. But in this age of
          mechanical reproduction they managed to get the
          only copy of my thesis.

                         FLAN
          Where's the first aid book!
          OUISA runs into their bedroom.
          PAUL looks out the bathroom door into FLAN and OUISA'S
          bedroom. PAUL watches OUISA as she goes into

          THE MASTER BEDROOM.
          OUISA rummages through her book case and finds her Red
          Cross manual. OUISA turns and sees PAUL sitting on the edge
          of the tub staring at HER.
          FLAN is crouched down, bathing PAUL'S slash.

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
          OUISA is moved by these events.

                         OUISA
           We bathed him. We did First Aid.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S BATHROOM
          OUISA reads from the manual.

                         OUISA
          The Red Cross advises: Press edges of the wound
          firmly together, wash area with water-

                         FLAN
          Yes! I'm doing that - Hold on
          FLAN daubs on mercurochrome.

                         PAUL
          Owww!

                         FLAN
          Hold still! Ouisa! I need gauze!
          GEOFFREY pokes his head in the bathroom.

                         GEOFFREY (LEAVING)
          It's been wonderful seeing you--

          OUISA (firm but cheery)
          No no no! Stay!

                         GEOFFREY
          My time is so short. Before I leave America, I
          really should call -

                         OUISA
          You darling old poop -

                         FLAN
          Have you seen the new book on Cezanne?

                         GEOFFREY

                         NO

                         OUISA
          An absolute revelation - this'll only take a mo-
          OUISA rushes out of the bathroom after GEOFFREY.

                         FLAN
          I need the gauze

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR

                         OUISA
          I ran down the hall to get the book on Cezanne,
          got the gauze from my bathroom--

          BACK AT THE KITTREDGE'S
          We watch a flustered OUSIA dart about as she describes--

                         OUISA (VO)
          Gave the Cezanne to Flan who wanted the gauze,
          gave the gauze to Geoffrey who wanted Cezanne.
          OUISA mutters under her breath as she dashes down

          THE HALL.

          ouisa?
          OUISA grabs the gauze out of GEOFFREY's hand.
          SHE runs back down the HALL.

          FLAN finishes bandaging PAUL's wound.
          OUISA goes into

          HER SON'S BEDROOM.,
          SHE takes a pink shirt from the bureau.

          THE MASTER BEDROOM
          PAUL puts on the pink shirt and looks at HIMSELF in the
          mirror.

                         FLAN
          He's going to be fine.
          GEOFFREY appears in the door with the book on Cezanne.

                         GEOFFREY
          Lovely book.
          FLAN looks stricken.

                         OUISA
          Please? Stay?
          GEOFFREY pauses.

                         GEOFFREY
          Agreed.
          FLAN beams.

          And peace was restored.

          BACK IN THE MASTER BEDROOM
          FLAN holds out PAUL's blazer. PAUL winces as HE lifts his
          arms to put it on.

                         PAUL
          Your children said you were kind. All the kids
          were sitting around the dorm one night dishing
          the- shit out of their parents. But your kids
          were silent and said No, not our parents. Not
          Flan and Ouisa. Not the Kittredges. The
          Kittredges are kind. So after the muggers left,
          I looked up and saw these Fifth Avenue
          apartments. Mrs. Onassis lives there. I know
          the Babcocks live over there. The Auchinclosses
          live there. But you lived here. I came here.
          OUISA, so touched, turns to FLAN and GEOFFREY.

                         OUISA
          Can you believe what the kids said?
          PAUL looks at the framed photos on wall of

          0 THE HALL.

                          PAUL
           But your kids - I love them. Talbot and Woody
           mean the world to me.

                         FLAN
          He lets you call him Woody? Nobody's
          called him Woody in years.
          THEY come into

          THE LIVING ROOM.
          PAUL looks around happily. HE goes to the wall by the
          mantlepiece and looks at a dark abstract painting.

                         PAUL
           They described this apartment in detail. This
          is a Kandinsky! - a double. One painted on
          either side. May I see - ?
          OUISA lifts the painting off the wall and turns it around.
          Even GEOFFREY is taken by the painting.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         0 26

                         FLAN
          What makes it valuable is Kandinsky painted on
          either side of the canvas in two wildly
          different styles. One side is geometric and
          somr=r. The other side is wild and vivid.

                         GEOFFREY
          My god!

                         FLAN
          We flip it around for variety.
          OUISA happily turns the painting back and forth to show off
          its two sides. The SCREEN is filled with the bright colors
          then the dark colors.

                         OUISA
          You like? You like? Chaos? Control?
          Chaos? Control?
          SHE puts on a goofy happy face for the chaotic side and a
          dopey tragic face for the geometric. Yes. We've been here
          before, through OUISA's memory, at the wedding.

                         PAUL
          It's wonderful.
          OUISA leans the painting against a chair, the chaotic side
          showing.

          FLAN turns to JULIA.

                         FLAN
          Wassily Kandinsky. Born 1866 Moscow. Blue
          Rider Exhibition 1914. He said "It is clear
          that the choice of object that is one of the
          elements in the harmony of form must be decided
          only by a corresponding vibration in the human
          soul". (very spiritual) Died 1944 France.
          JULIA nods. Ah yes.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM
          PAUL looks around the apartment, so cozy, warm.

                         PAUL
          It's the way they said it would be.

          Did you bitch your parents?

                         PAUL
          As a matter of fact. No. Your kids and I...we
          both liked our parents... loved our--Look, am I
          getting in the way? I burst in here,
          hysterical. Blood. I didn't mean to---

          No!

          How Harvard?

          Well, fine. It's just there. Everyone's in a
          constant state of luxurious despair and constant
          discovery and paralysis.

          Although I've lived all over. My folks are
          divorced. He's remarried. He's doing a movie.

          He's directing this one but he does act.

                         FLAN
          What's he directing?

                         PAUL
          Cats.

                         OUISA
          Someone is directing a film of Cats?

                         FLAN
          Don't be snooty.

                         PAUL
          You've'seen it? T.S. Eliot--

                         FLAN
          Well, yes. Years ago.

                         OUISA
          A benefit for some disease or school---

                         FLAN
          Surely they can't make the movie of Cats.

                         OUISA
          Of course they can.

                         PAUL
          They're going to try. My father'll be here

          What a courageous stand!

                         PAUL
          They thought of lots of ways to go. Animation.

                         FLAN
          Animation would be nice.

                         PAUL
          But he found a better way. As a matter of fact,
          he turned it down at first. He went to tell
          the producers - as a courtesy - all the reasons
          why you couldn't make a movie of Cats and in
          going through all the reasons why you couldn't
          make a movie of Cats, he suddenly saw how you
          could make a movie of Cats --

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
          Can it be possible? A FEW MORE GUESTS have joined the table.

                         OUISA
           And it was here we pulled up - ever so
          slightly - pulled up closer--

                         FLAN
          And he told us.

                         OUISA
          He named the greatest black star in movies.

                         SIDNEY -

                         FLAN
          Don't say it. We're trying to keep this
          abstract. Plus libel laws.

                         OUISA
          Sidney Poitiers There. I don't care. We have
          to have truth. He started out as a lawyer and
          is terrified of libel. I'm not.

          INT THE WHITE WALL
          PAUL, leaning against the wall, talks with great vivacity to
          that OFF SCREEN PRESENCE who is the POV of the camera.

                         PAUL
          Sidney Poitier, the future Jackie Robinson of
          films, was born the twenty fourth of February
          1927 in Miami during a visit his parents made to
          Florida - legally? -to sell tomatoes they had
          grown on their farm in the Bahamas. He grew up
          on Cat Island, "so poor they didn't even own
          dirt" he has said. Neglected by his family, my
          father would sit on the shore, and, as he told
          me many times, "conjure up the kind of worlds
          that were on the other side and what I'd do in
           them." He arrived in New York City from the
           Bahamas in the winter of 1943 at age fifteen and
           a half and lived in the pay toilet of the bus
           station across from the old Madison Square
           Garden at Fiftieth and Eighth Avenue. He moved
           to the roof of the Brill building, commonly
           known as Tin Pan Alley. Washed dishes at the
           Turf restaurant for $4.11 a night. He taught
          0 himself to read by reading the newspaper. In the
           Black newspaper, the theater page was opposite
           the Want Ad page. Among his 42 films are No Way
           Out 1950/ Cry the Beloved Country 1952/
           Blackboard Jungle 1955/ The Defiant Ones 1958/
           Raisin in the Sun 1961/ Lilies of the Field
           1963/ In the Heat of the Night 1967/ To Sir With
           Love 1967/ Shoot to Kill 1988 and, of course,

           PAUSE. (THE OFF SCREEN VOICE JOINS HIM)
          Guess Who's Coming To Dinner.

                         PAUL (LAUGHS)
          He won the Oscar for Lilies of the Field and
          was twice named top male box-office star in
          the country. My father made no films from 1977
          to 1987 but worked as director and author. Dad
          said to me once "I still don't fully understand
          how all that came about in the sequence it came
          about".
          And we hear the OFF SCREEN PRESENCE applauding.
          PAUL bows, happily.
          HE kicks his shoe off into the camera.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM

                         PAUL
          Dad's not in till tomorrow at the Sherry. I
          came down from Cambridge. Thought I'd stay at
          some fleabag for adventure. Orwell. Down and
          Out. I really don't know New York. I know Rome
          and Paris and Los Angeles a lot better.

                         OUISA
          We're-going out to dinner. You'll come.

                         PAUL
          Out to dinner?

                         FLAN
          Out to dinner.

                         PAUL
          But why go out to dinner?

                         OUISA
          Because we have reservations and oh my god'what
          time is it? Have we lost the reservations and
           we don't have a damn thing in the house and it's
          Sixteenth century Florence and there's genius on
          every block.

                         GEOFFREY
          Don't mock.
          SHE kisses GEOFFREY.

                         PAUL
          You must have something in the fridge.

                         FLAN
          A frozen steak from the Ice Age.

                         PAUL
          Why spend a hundred dollars on a bowl of rice?
          Let me into the kitchen. Cooking calms me. What
          I'd like to do is calm down, pay back your kids-

                         OUISA
          He mentioned our kids names--

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM

                         PAUL
          - who've been wonderful to me.

                         OUISA
          They've never mentioned you.

                         FLAN
          What are they supposed to say? We've become
          friends with the son of Sidney Poitier, barrier
          breaker of the fifties and sixties?

                         GEOFFREY
          Your father means a great deal in South Africa.

                         OUISA
          Even Geoffrey was touched.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM

                         PAUL
          I'm glad of that. Dad and I went to Russia once
          to a film festival and he was truly amazed how
          much his presence meant -

                         OUISA
          Oh no! Tell us stories of movie stars tying up
          their children and being cruel.

                         PAUL
          I wish.

                         GEOFFREY
          You wish?

                         PAUL
          If I wanted to write a book about him. I really
          can't. No one would want to read it. He's
          decent. I admire him.

                         OUISA
          He's married to an actress who was in one of--
          she's white? Am I right?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         33

                         
          PAUL (painful territory)
          That is not my mother. That is his
          second wife. He met Joanna making
          "The Lost Man". He left my mother
          who had stuck by him in the lean years.
          X had just been born. "The Lost Man"
          is the only film of my father's I can't
          bring myself to see.

                         OUISA
           Oh, I'm sorry. We didn't mean to -

                          PAUL (BRIGHT)
          No! We're all good friends now. . His kids from
          that marriage. Us - the old kids. I'd love to
          get in that kitchen.
          FLAN (to Ouisa)
          What should we do?

                         OUISA
          It's Geoffrey's only night in New York.

                         GEOFFREY
           I vote - stay in.
          OUISA, FLAN and PAUL
          Good!

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR

                         OUISA
          We moved.into the kitchen.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S KITCHEN
          THE KITCHEN is large, was built in the 205 when people had
          big dinners at home.
          PAUL opens the refrigerators and freezers.
          PAUL'S actions are synchronous with the words.

                         FLAN (VO)
          We watched him cook.

                         OUISA (VO)
          We watched him cook and chop.

                         FLAN (VO)
          He sort of did wizardry

                         OUISA (VO)
          An old jar of sun dried tomatoes--

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         34

           FLAN (VO)
           Left avers - tuna fish - olives - onions -
          It's all dazzling and rapid. FLAN opens the wine. OUISA
          takes dishes and silver out and hands them to GEOFFREY.
          EVERYONE is in a picnic spirit. PAUL fills a large pot with
          water from the tap.
          PAUL (to Geoffrey)

                         YOU'RE FROM

                         GEOFFREY
          Johannesburg.
          PAUSE. PAUL Studies GEOFFREY. OUISA and FLAN freeze.
          Is it a tense moment?
          PAUL takes a breath. PAUL puts the water on the fire, eyes
          never off GEOFFREY. Then PAUL resumes chopping onions
          briskly and dropping them into the frying pan.

                         PAUL
          My dad took me to a movie shot in South Africa.
          The camera moved from this vile rioting in the

                         
          streets to a villa where people picked at lunch
          on a terrace, the only riot the flowers and the
          birds-- gorgeous plumage and petals. And I
          didn't understand. And Dad said to me "You meet
          these young blacks who are having a terrible
          time. They've had a totally inadequate
          education and yet in '76 - the year of the
          Soweto riots - they took on a tremendous
          political responsibility. It just makes you
          wonder at the maturity that is in them."
          PAUL opens a cabinet and takes out a Haitian candelabra that
          obviously hasn't been used since it was brought home as a
          souvenir. PAUL dusts it off.

                         PAUL
          it makes you realize that the 'crummy childhood'
          theory, that everything can be blamed in a
          Freudian fashion on the fact that you've had a
          bad upbringing, just doesn't hold water. May I?

                         FLAN
          Oh, please.
          PAUL pours a brandy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         35

                         

                         GEOFFREY
          What about being black in America?
          PAUL scoops a melange of vegetables into a glass dish and
          puts it in the microwave.

                         PAUL
          My problem is I've never felt American.
          I grew up in Switzerland. Boarding school.
          Villa Rosey.

                         OUISA
          There is a boarding school in Switzerland that
          takes you at age eighteen months.

                         PAUL
          That's not me. I've never felt people liked me
          for my connections. Movie star kid problems.
          None of those.
          THE WATER boils. HE dumps in pasta.
          The microwave timer goes off. PAUL removes the glass dish.

                         PAUL
          But I never knew I was black in that racist way
          0 till I was sixteen and came back here. Very
          protected. White servants. After the divorce we
          moved to Switzerland. My mother, brother and Z.
          I don't feel American. I don't even feel black.
          I suppose that's very lucky for me even though
          Freud says there's no such thing as luck. Just
          what you make.
          PAUL takes the pasta off the boil and drains it, plopping
          the pasta into a brightly colored bowl.
          OUISA, FLAN and GEOFFREY sit at the counter, transfixed.

                         OUISA
          Does Freud say that?
          PAUL holds out three dishes heaped with food.

                         PAUL
          Here's dinner. All ready.

                         OUISA
          Shall we move into the dining room?
          OUISA opens double doors leading into

          THE DINING ROOM.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         36
          This room has not been in use for a while.
          The overhead chandelier is very bright and harsh.
          A sewing machine is in the corner there.
          Bookkeeping items at one end of the long table.
          Nineteenth century Victorian mythological paintings hang.on
          the walls. FLAN adjusts the rheostat to dim the lights in
          the chandelier.

                         OUISA
          Don't look at the sewing machine.
          FLAN sweeps the bill things off the table onto a chair.
          OUISA opens the sideboard and takes out four linen place
          mats and silverware and quickly sets the table.
          PAUL takes out matches and lights the Haitian card"e'Yabra.
          FLAN runs into the living room and returns with a vase of
          flowers.
          THEY smile at the appearance of the sudden party in this
          wonderful room.
          THEY sit down. THEY eat. Surprise. It's delicious.

                          PAUL
          Is everything okay?
          FLAN, OUISA and GEOFFREY
          Mmrmmm .. yes.

                         GEOFFREY
          This is the best pasta I've ever -

                         OUISA
          The best!

                         PAUL
          My father insisted we learn to cook.

                         FLAN
          Isn't he from Jamaica? There's a taste of--

                         GEOFFREY
          The islands.

                         PAUL
          Yes. Before he made it, he ran four restaurants
          in Harlem. You have good buds!

                         GEOFFREY
          See? Good buds. I've never been
          complimented on my buds-

                         R

                         FLAN
          I am astonished!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         37
          PAUL leans back and watches them happily.

                         OUISA
          Where's yours?

                         PAUL
          The cook never eats.

                         FLAN
          The more for us!
          THEY all laugh.
          PAUL leaves the room abruptly.
          FLAN, OUISA and GEOFFREY look at each other.
          FLAN stands.

                         FLAN
          Hello?
          PAUL returns with the rest of the real in brightly painted
          bowls.

                         

                         PAUL
          Seconds?
          THEY laugh and are served.

                         OUISA
          Have you declared your major yet?

                         PAUL

          Blunt question. What's he like?

          OUISA reaches for the bottle of wine.

                         OUISA
          Let's not be star fuckers.

                         FLAN
          I'm not a star fucker.

                         PAUL
          My father, being an actor, has no real identity.
          You say to him, Pop, what's new? And he says,
          'I got an interesting script today. I was asked
          to play a lumberjack up in the Yukon. Now, I've
          been trained as a Preacher, but my church fell
          apart. My wife says we have to get mbney to get
          through this winter. And I sign up as part of
          this team where all my beliefs are challenged.
          But I hold firm. In spite of prejudice because
          I want to get back to my wife. Out of this
          forest,back to the church... .' And my father is
          in tears and I say Pop, this i:. not a real
           event, this is some script that was sent to
          you. And my father says ' I' m trying it out to
          see how it fits on me.' But he has no life--he
          has no memory--only the scripts producers send
          him in the mail through his agents. That's his
          past.

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
          Can it be? The CROWD listening to FLAN and OUISA is even
          larger.

                         OUISA
          I just loved the kid so much. I wanted to reach
          out to him.

                         FLAN
          And then we asked him what his thesis was on.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S DINING ROOM

                         GEOFFREY
          The one that was stolen. Please?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         39

                         PAUL
          Well...
          (HE takes a deep breath and leans back in

                         HIS CHAIR)
          A substitute teacher out on Long Island was
          dropped from his job for fighting with a
          student. A few weeks later, the teacher
          returned to the classroom, shot the student
          unsuccessfully, held the class hostage and then
          shot himself. Successfully. This fact caught my
          eye: last sentence. Times. A neighbor
          described the teacher as a nice boy. Always
          reading Catcher In the Rye.
          The nitwit - Chapman - who shot John Lennon said
          he did it because he wanted to-`draw the
          attention of the world to Catcher In the Rye and
          the reading of that book would be his defense.
          And young Hinckley, the whiz kid who shot Reagan
          and his press secretary said if you want my
          defense all you have to do is read catcher in
          the Rye. It seemed to be time to read it again.

                         FLAN
          I haven't read it in years.
          OUISA shushes FLAN.

                         PAUL
          I borrowed a copy from a young friend of mine
          because I wanted to see what she had underlined
          and I read this book to find out why this
          touching, beautiful, sensitive story published
          in July 1951 had turned into this manifesto of
          hate.
          I started reading. : It's exactly as I
          remembered. Everybody's a phoney. Page two: "My
          brother's in Hollywood being a prostitute."
          Page three: "what a phony slob his father was."
          Page nine: "People never notice anything."
          Then on page twenty two my hair stood up.
          Remember Holden Caulfield--the definitive
          sensitive youth--wearing his red hunter's cap.
          "A deer Hunter hat? Like hell it is. I sort of
          closed one eye like I was taking aim at it.
          This is a people shooting hat. I shoot people
          in this hat."

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         40

                         

                         PAUL (CONTINUES)
          Hmmm, I said. This book is preparing people for
          bigger moments in their lives than I ever
          dreamed of.
          Then on p. 89 "I'd rather push a guy out the
           window or chop his head off with an ax than sock
          him in the jaw. I hate fist fights...what
          scares me most is the other guy's face..."
          I finished the book. It's a touching story,
          comic because the boy wants to do so much and
          can't do anything. Hates all phoniness and only
          lies to others. Wants everyone to like him, is
          only hateful, and is completely self involved.
          In other words, a pretty accurate picture of a
          male adolescent.
          FLAN, OUISA, .GEOFFREY are transfixed.
           And what alarms me about that book--not the book
           so much as the aura about it--is this: the book
           is primarily about paralysis. The boy can't
           function. And at the end before he can run
          away and start a new life, it starts to rain and
          he folds. Now there's nothing wrong in writing
          about emotional and intellectual paralysis. It
          may indeed thanks to Chekhov and Samuel Beckett
          be the great modern theme.
          The extraordinary last lines of Waiting For
          Godot--"Let's go." "Yes, let's go." Stage
          directions: They do not move.
          But the aura around this book of Salinger's--
          which perhaps should be read by everyone ut
          young men---is this: It mirrors like a fun
          house mirror and amplifies like a distorted
          speaker one of the great tragedies of our times-
          --the death of the imagination.
          Because what else is paralysis?
          The CAMERA moves closer and closer in on PAUL.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         42

                         PAUL (CONTINUES)
          The imagination has been so debased that
          imagination--being imaginative-- rather than
          being the lynch pin of our existence now stands
          as a synonym for something outside ourselves
          like Science fiction or some new use for
          tangerine slices on raw pork chops---what an
          imaginative summer recipe--and Star wars! So
          imaginative and Star Trek--so imaginative! And
          Lord of the Rings--all those dwarves--so

                         IMAGINATIVE---
          The imagination has moved out of the realm of
          being our link, our most personal link, with our
          inner lives and the world outside that world--
          this world we share--what is schizophrenia but a
          horrifying state where what's in here doesn't
          match up with what's out there?
          Why has imagination become a synonym for style?
          I believe that the imagination is the passport
          we create to take us into the real world.
          I believe the imagination is another phrase for
          what is most uniquely Is.

                         
          Jung says the greatest sin is to be unconscious.
          Our boy Holden says "what scares me most is the
          other guy's face--it wouldn't be so bad if you
          could both be blindfolded"--most of the time the
          faces we face are not the other guys' but our
          own faces. And it's the worst kind of
          yellowness to be so scared of yourself you put
          blindfolds on rather than deal with yourself.
          To face ourselves.
          That's the hard thing.
          The imagination.
          That's God's gift to make the act of self-
          examination bearable.

          PAUSE.
          FLAN, GEOFFREY, OUISA are very moved.

                         OUISA
          Well, indeed.

                         FLAN
          I hope your muggers read every word.

                         GEOFFREY
          I'm going to buy a copy of Catcher i. the Rye at
          the airport and read it.

                         OUISA
          Cover to cover

                         PAUL
          I'll test you. I should be going.
          PAUL starts to go. THEY follow.
          THE DINING ROOM opens into

          THE LIVING ROOM.

                         FLAN
          Where will you stay?

                         OUISA
          Not some flea bag.

                         PAUL
           I get into the Sherry tomorrow morning. It's not
          so far off. I can walk around. I don't think
          they'll mug me twice in one evening.
          FLAN and OUISA take's PAUL's by the arm and leads him down
          the hall into

          THEIR DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM.

                         OUISA
          You'll stay here tonight.

                         PAUL
          No! I have to be at the hotel at seven AM sharp!

                         OUISA
          We'll get you up.

                         PAUL
          or Dad will have a fit.

                         QUISA
          Up at six fifteen which is any moment now and we
          have that wedding in Millbrook-
          OUISA pulls back the covers on the bed and puts the dolls on
          the floor.

                         FLAN
          There's an alarm by the bed

                         OUISA
          Your feet might hang out over the end

                         PAUL
          If it's any problem--

                         FLAN
          It's only a problem if you leave.
          PAUL takes the alarm and sets the time.

                          PAUL
          Six fifteen? I'll tip toe out.

                         FLAN
          And we want to be in Cats.

                         OUISA

                         FLAN:

                         PAUL
          It's done.
          THEY shake hands.

                         GEOFFREY
          I'll fly back. With my wife.

                         OUISA
          Pushy. Both of you.
          PAUL sits on the bed, testing it.

                         PAUL
          He's not. Dad said I could be in
          charge of the extras. You'd just
          be extras. That's all I can promise.

                         FLAK
          In cat suits?

                         PAUL
          No. You can be humans.

                         FLAN
          That's very important. It has to be in our
          contracts. We are humans.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         44

                         
          THEY all return down

          THE HALL.

                         GEOFFREY
          We haven't got any business done tonight.

                         FLAN
          Forget it. It was only an evening at home.

                         OUISA
          Whatever you do, don't think about elephants.
          GEOFFREY puts on his overcoat.

                         PAUL
          Did I intrude?
          FLAN and OUISA
          No!

                         PAUL
          I'm sorry - Oh Christ -
          GEOFFREY (to Flan)

                         0
          There's all ways of doing business. Flanders,
          walk me to the elevator.

                         OUISA
          Love to Diana.
          OUISA kisses GEOFFREY on the cheek.

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
          It seems the BRIDE and GROOM have joined the people
          listening to FLAN and OUISA's tale.

                         OUISA
          We embraced. And Flan and Geoffrey left -

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S HALL
          FLAN walks GEOFFREY to the elevator, leaving OUISA and PAUL
          alone. PAUL and OUISA look at each other. Then PAUL breaks
          the moment and goes to

          THE DINING ROOM.

                         _ PAUL
          Let me clean up -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         45
          OUISA follows.

                         OUISA
          Hal Leave it for -
          PAUL looks at the table filled with dishes and bowls and
          glasses and napkins.

                         PAUL
          Nobody comes in on Sunday.
          PAUL snuffs out the candles with his fingers.

                         OUISA
          Yvonne will be in on Tuesday.

                         PAUL
           You'll have every bug in Christendom -
          The room is dark, -lit only from the living room.
          THEY both reach for the dishes.

                         OUISA
          Let me -

                         
          PAUL takes the dishes.

                         PAUL
          No. You watch. It gives me a thrill to be
          looked at.
          PAUL looks at HER. OUISA is momentarily at a loss.
          PAUL goes into the kitchen.
          The service door into the kitchen swings back and forth.

          DINING ROOM/KITCHEN
          OUISA in the dining room looks at PAUL's back as HE washes
          dishes at the sink.
          Suddenly the dining room is flooded with light.
          FLAN has flicked on the light.

                         FLAN
          He's in.

                         OUISA
          He's in?
          FLAN parades around the table.

                         FLAN
          He's in for two million.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         46

                         

                         OUISA
          Two million!

                         FLAN
          He says the Cezanne is a great inv1stment. We
          should get it for six million and sell it to the
          Tokyo bunch for ten.

                         OUISA
          Happy days! Oh god!
          PAUL comes into the dining room.

                         PAUL
          Two million dollars?
          FLAN runs into

          THE LIVING ROOM.
          FLAN picks up the slide carousel and kisses it.

                         FLAN
          Figure it out. He doesn't have the price of -a
          dinner but he can cough up two million dollars
          and the Japs will go ten!
          PAUL and OUISA come into the living room.

                         PAUL
          Go to ten? Ten million?

                         OUISA
          Break all those dishes! Two million! Go to ten!
          And we put up nothing?

                         PAUL
          Nothing?

                         FLAN
          Geoffrey sold that Hockney print I know he
          bought for a hundred bucks fifteen years ago for
          thirty four thousand dollars. Sotheby took
          their cut, sure but still--Two million! Wildest
          dreams. Paul, I should give you a commission.

                         PAUL
          Your kids said you were an art dealer. But you
          don't have a gallery. I don't understand -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         47

                          FLAN
          People want to sell privately.
          Not go through a gallery.

                         OUISA -Ï¿½
          A divorce. Taxes. Publicity.
          FLAN (holding up a slide)
          People come to me looking for a
          certain school of painting.

                         OUISA
          A modern.. Impressionist. Renaissance.

                         FLAN
          But don't want museums to know where it is.

                         OUISA
          Japanese.
          OUISA, FLAN and PAUL go down the hall to

          FLAN'S OFFICE.
          FLAN flicks on his computer.

                         

                         FLAN
          I've got Japanese looking for a Cezanne. I have
          a syndicate that will buy the painting. There is
          this great second level Cezanne coming up for
          sale in a very messy divorce.
          FLAN holds up the slide.

                         OUISA
          Wife doesn't want hubby to know she owns a
          Cezanne.
          PAUL looks at the slide.

                         FLAN
          I needed an extra two million. Geoffrey called.
          Invited him here for dinner.

                         OUISA
          Tonight was a very nervous very
          casual very big thing.

                         PAUL
          I couldn't tell -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         48
          s PAUL gives the slide very carefully back to FLAN who files
          it.

                         OUISA
          All the better. 0
          FLAN opens a door in the OFFICE. THE OFFICE connects to

          THE MASTER BEDROOM.
          PAUL follows FLAN and OUISA into their bedroom.

                         PAUL
          I'm glad I helped -

                         OUISA
          You were wonderful!

                         PAUL
          I'm so pleased I was wonderful.
          All this and a pink shirt.

                         OUISA
          Keep it. Look at the time.

                         PAUL
          It's going to be time for me to get up.

                         FLAN
          Then we'll say our good nights now.

                         PAUL
          Oh Christ. Regretfully. I4l1 tip toe.
          PAUL and OUISA follow FLAN into

          THE HALL.
          PAUL goes into their daughter's bedroom.
          FLAN and OUISA hover in the hall.
          FLAN takes out his wallet.

                         FLAN
          Take fifty dollars.

                         OUISA
          Give him fifty dollars.

                         PAUL
          Don't need it.

          Suppose your father's plane is late?

                         FLAN
          A strike. Air controllers.

                         OUISA
          Walking around money. I wouldn't want my kids
          to be stuck in the street without a nickel.
          PAUL sits on the bed and takes off his shoes.

                         FLAN
          And you saved us a fortune. Do you know what
          our bill would've been at that little Eye-tie
          store front?

                         OUISA
          And we picked up two million dollars. One
          billionth of a percent commission is -

                         FLAN
          Fifty dollars.
          FLAN hands PAUL the money. PAUL hesitates, then takes it.

                         PAUL
          But I'll get it back to you tomorrow. I want my
          father to meet you.

                         OUISA
          We'd love to. Bring him up for dinner.

                         PAUL
          Could I?

                         FLAN
          You see how easy it is.

                         OUISA
          Sure. If Paul does the cooking.
          FLAN, OUISA and PAUL laugh.
          OUISA goes into the bathroom and fills a glass with water
          and puts it on the night table.

                         OUISA
          Goodnight.
          PAUL smiles at them.

          THE MASTER BEDROOM/BATHROOM
          FLAN and OUISA get ready for bed, undressing, hanging jacket
          and trousers up neatly. OUISA undoes her dress.
          THEY are in and out of bathroom and bedroom, -brushing
          teeth.

                         FLAN
          I want to get on my knees and thank god -money-

                         OUISA
          Who said when artists dream they dream of money?
          I must be such an artist. Bravo. Bravo.
          FLAN putting on pajamas, OUISA her nightgown.

                         FLAN
          I don't want to lose our life here. I don't
          want all the debt to pile up and crush us.

                         OUISA
          It won't. We're safe.
          OUISA in bed turns off the light.
           FLAN looks out the window onto the park.

                         FLAN
          For a while. We almost lost it. If I didn't
          get this money,. Ouis, I would've lost the
          Cezanne. It would've gone. I had nowhere to
          get it.
          OUISA gets out of bed and comes to FLAN.

                         OUISA
          Why don't you tell me how much these things
          mean? You wait till the last minute -
          OUISA and FLAN get into bed.

                         FLAN
          I don't want to worry you.

                         OUISA
          Not worry me? I'm your partner.

                         FLAN
          There is a god.

                         OUISA
          And his name- is --

                         A

          Sidney.
          THEY embrace. THE CAMERA comes in very close, circling
          FLAN and OUISA, their love, their safety. Then THE CAMERA
          drifts back and away from them, travelling out through the
          window, out of their cocoon to

          EXT THE APARTMENT BUILDING/CENTRAL PARK NIGHT
          down the face of the solid apartment building and drifts
          away through the night down into Central Park and stops at
          the statue of the husky barking at the moon.

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR

                         OUISA
          I dreamt of Sidney Poitier and his rise to
          acclaim. I dreamt that Sidney Poitier sat at
          the edge of my bed and I asked him what troubled
          him? Sidney? What troubles you? Is it right
          to make a movie of Cats?

                         

          BACK IN THE MASTER BEDROOM
          FLAN is asleep on his side of the bed. OUISA is wide awake,
          staring at A MAN in dinner clothes, who sits on the edge of
          her bed. His back is to the camera. Is it SIDNEY POITIER?
          THE CAMERA drifts in to OUISA, who is transfixed by this
          apparition.
          "SIDNEY" (very comforting)
          I'll tell you why I have to make a movie of
          Cats. I know what Cats is, Louisa. May I call
          you Louisa?
          (OUISA nods Yes)
          I have no illusions about the merits of Cats.
          But the world has been too heavy with all the
          right to lifers. Protect the lives of the
          unborn. Constitutional amendments. Marches!
          When does life begin? Or the converse. The end
          of life. The Right To Die. Why is life at this
          point in the 20th century so focussed on the
          very beginning of life and the very end of life?
          What about the eighty years we have to live
          between those two inexorable book ends?
          THE CAMERA closes on OUISA. Her face, seen over "SIDNEY's"
          shoulder, is all wonder.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         52

                         OUISA
          And you can get all that into Cats?
          THE CAMERA drifts round with OUISA'S gaze to finally see
          "SIDNEY'S" face. ï¿½,.
          It is PAUL.

                         PAUL/SIDNEY
          I'm going to try.

                         OUISA
          Thank you. Thank you. You shall.
          THE CAMERA circles off PAUL to OUISA. She is asleep.
          CUT BACK to reveal
          No one is sitting on the bed.
          THE CAMERA moves onto FLAN's face, sleeping.
          Slides of paintings by Matisse, Picasso, De Kooning, Pollock
          appear over his face.

                          FLAN (VO)
           This is what I dreamt. I didn't dream so much
           as realize this. I felt so close to the
           paintings. I wasn't just selling like pieces
           of meat. I remembered why I loved paintings in
           the first place - what had got me into this -
           and I thought - dreamed - remembered-

           INT AIRPLANE HANGAR
           FLAN happily sits in the bright vast empty space at a slide
           carousel projecting slides of paintings into the air.

                          FLAN (VO)
           How easy it is for a painter to lose a
           painting. He can paint and paint - work on a
           canvas for months and one day he loses it - just
           loses the structure - loses the sense of it -
           you lose the painting.
          A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT shines on FLAN who turns to see
          A TEACHER, in her forties, very pure and happy, hanging
          beautiful and brilliantly colored children's drawings in the
          air. FLAN'S VOICE echoes in this vast space.

          Camouflage. But the second grade --your grade.
          Matisses everyone. You've made my child a
          Matisse. Let me study with you. Let me into
          the second grade! What is your secret?

                         THE TEACHER
          Secret? I don't have any secret. I just know
          when to take their drawings away from them.
          THE TEACHER hangs pink shapes like paper versions of PAUL'S
          button down shirt on a clothes line stretching to the end of
          the hangar.
          THE SCREEN is filled with the color Pink.

          EXT PINK SKY DAWN
          The bright pink morning sky flashes with golden blotches,
          abstract, until WE see it is the morning sun reflecting off
          windows on the West Side of Central Park.
          Then we realize it is the view from

                         

          THE KIZTREDGE'S MASTER BEDROOM DAWN
          THE CAMERA pulls back from the window to FLAN and OUISA in
          bed, cozy. SHE wakens, smiles, kisses HIM.
          FLAN mumbles in his sleep and rolls over.
          OUISA looks at her bedside clock. 6 A.M.
          SHE gets out of bed, then pauses to take in the dawn
          display.
          OUISA walks through

          THE LIVING ROOM
          and opens the front door. SHE picks up the Sunday papers
          and goes into

          THE KITCHEN.
          OUISA looks at the spotlessly clean sink and counter.
          SHE flicks on the coffee machine and takes juice out of the
          refrigerator scanning the front page.
          SHE sits at the counter and opens the magazine to the back
          page and begins to do the cross word puzzle.

                         OUISA
          I sat in the kitchen happily doing the cross
          word puzzle in ink. Everybody does it in ink. I
          never. met one person who didn't say they did it
          in ink.

          BACK IN THE KITCHEN
          OUISA fills in a word on the puzzle. is it in ink? Then
          looks up.

                         OUISA (VO)
          And I'm doing the puzzle and I see the time and
          it's nearly seven and Paul had to meet his
          father and I didn't want him to be late and was
          he healthy after his stabbing?
          OUISA puts the puzzle down and goes into

          THE HALL.

                         OUISA (VO)
          The hall is eighteen feet long.
          OUISA walks down the hall which now seems impossibly long.

                         OUISA (VO)
          I stopped in front of the door.
          OUISA taps on the door of her daughter's room.

                         OUISA
          Paul?
          SHE hears - what? - sounds of moaning?

                         OUISA
          Paul??

                         PAUL (MOANING)

                         YES YES

                         OUISA
          Are you all right?
          OUISA opens the door to

          HER DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM.

           SHE turns on the light. SHE screams.
           A GUY mid 20s, buck naked except for ratty white socks,
          stands up on the bed.

                         HUSTLER
          What the fuck is going on here. Who the fuck
          are you?!
          PAUL, startled,"sits up in bed and pulls on his clothes.
          OUISA screams.

                         OUISA
          Flan!!

          THE MASTER BEDROOM
          OUISA shakes FLAN violently. FLAN comes to.

                         FLAN
          What is it?!
          FLAN AND OUISA step out into

          THE HALL.

                         

          SILENCE.
          THEY hear their dog bark in

          THE LIVING ROOM.
          THE HUSTLER, naked but for white socks, wanders around the
          living room picking up things. THE DOG is barking at HIM.
          THE HUSTLER turns and smiles at FLAN and OUISA. -

                         HUSTLER
          Hey! How ya doin'? Nice stuff.

                         FLAN
          Oh my God!
          THE HUSTLER stretches out on the sofa.

                         HUSTLER
          Hey. I got to get some sleep--
          FLAN tips the sofa, hurling the HUSTLER onto the floor.
          THE HUSTLER leaps at FLAN threateningly.

                         OUISA
          Stop it! He might have a gun!

           HUSTLER (laughs)
          Yeah. I might have a gun. I might have a knife.
          THE HUSTLER raises his hand threateningly.

                         OUISA
          He has a gun! He has a knife!
          THE HUSTLER chases OUISA around the room.
          FLAN chases the HUSTLER. THE DOG chases FLAN.
          PAUL,dressed, runs in to the living room, carrying THE
          HUSTLER's clothes which HE hurls down onto the sofa.

                         PAUL
          I can explain.

                         OUISA
          You went out after we went to sleep and picked
          up this thing?

                         FLAN
          You brought this thing into our house! Thing!
          Thing! Get out! Get out of my house!
          FLAN picks up the HUSTLER'S clothes and opens the front
           door.

                         THE HUSTLER
          Hey! Be careful of the pants!

                         FLAN
          Take your clothes. Go back to sleep
          in the gutter.
          FLAN flings the clothes out into

          THE OUTSIDE CORRIDOR.
          FLAN pushes the elevator button.
          THE HUSTLER suddenly lunges at FLAN and grabs FLAN by the
          lapels of his bathrobe.

                         HUSTLER
          Fuck. You!
          THE HUSTLER throws FLAN back violently, then picks up his
          clothes.
          OUISA runs to FLAN.
          FLAN gasps, catching his breath.
          THE ELEVATOR DOOR opens..
          EDDIE, the elevator man, is startled by the sight.

                         W

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         57
          OUISA is terrified as PAUL stands at the front door.

                         PAUL
          Please. Don't tell my father. I don't want him
          to know. I haven't told him. I got. so lonely.
          I got so afraid. My dad coming. I had the
          money. I went out after we went to sleep and I
          brought him back. You had so much. I couldn't
          be alone. I was so afraid. I am so sorry.

                         OUISA
          Just go.

                         EDDIE
          Is everything all right?

                         FLAN
          Make sure they go out!

                         PAUL
          I can explain!

                         FLAN
          Give me my fifty dollars.

                          PAUL
           I spent it.

                          OUISA
           Get out!

                          PAUL
          I'm so sorry.
          THE HUSTLER is in the elevator, pulling on his seedy
          clothes.

                         FLAN
          Make sure they leave. By the back door.
          PAUL steps into the elevator. The door shuts.

          BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM
          FLAN and OUISA survey the room. THEY are at a loss.
          THEY straighten out the pillows on the sofa.
          THEY are exhausted.

          Well, it's not

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM
          FLAN and OUISA survey the living room.

                         FLAN
          I am shaking.

                         OUISA
          You have to do something.

                         FLAN
          it's awful.

                         OUISA
          Is anything gone?

                         FLAN
          How can I look? I'm shaking.

                         OUISA
          Did he take anything?

                         FLAN
          Would you concentrate on yourself?

                         OUISA
          I want to know if anything's gone?

                         FLAN
          Calm down.

                         OUISA
          We could have been killed.

                         OUISA
          How can you think of things? We could
          have been murdered.
          FLAN picks up an ornate Victorian inkwell capped by a silver
          beaver.

                         FLAN
          There's the inkwell. Silver beaver. Why?

          Go to bed at night happy and then murdered.
          would we have woken up?

                         FLAN
          we're alive.
          THEY sit on the sofa, drained, holding onto the phone.
          The phone suddenly rings. THEY clutch each other.

                         OUISA
          Don't pick it up!
          FLAN does.

          him. He was so charming. His father was taking
          the red eye. He couldn't get into the Hotel

          down the corridor. The blonde thief runs out,

          That was no burglar.

                         OUISA
          You had another house guest.
          KITTY and LARKIN laugh.

                         LARKIN
          We feel so guilty. Paul could've been killed by
          that intruder. He was very understanding -

                         OUISA
          Was anything missing from your house?

                         LARKIN
          Nothing.

                         FLAN
          Did you give him money?

                         KITTY
          Twenty-five dollars until his father arrived.

          Have you talked to your kids?

          Can't get through.

          The sound of keys in the door. The door swings open.
          FLAN switches on the lights. THE TWO COUPLES run in heading

          Hi. Celebrity Service? I'm not
           sure how you work.

                         KITTY
          Greta Garbo used the name Harriet Brown.

                         OUISA
          You track down celebrities? Am I right?

                         LARKIN
          Everybody must have known she was Greta Garbo.

                         OUISA
          I'm trying to find out how one would get in

          FLAN returns carrying an elaborate arrangement of flowers.
          FLAN reads the card.

          "To thank you for a wonderful time.
          Paul Poitier.'"
          FLAN reaches into the bouquet. HE takes out a p.t of jam.

                         FLAN
          A pot of jam?

                         LARKIN
          A pot of jam.
          THEY back off as if it might explode.

                         KITTY
          I think we should go to the police.

          THE FOUR approach the precinct on East 94th Street.

          INT THE PRECINCT
          THE DETECTIVE, whom we recognize from earlier, looks up from
          his desk.

                         

                         DETECTIVE
          What are the charges?

                         OUISA
          He came into our house.

                         FLAN
          He cooked us dinner.

                         OUISA
          He told us the story of Catcher In The Rye.

                         FLAN
          He said he was the son of Sidney Poitier.

                         DETECTIVE
          Sidney Poitier?
          FLAN and OUISA
          You got it.

                         DETECTIVE
          Was he?

                         OUISA
          We don't know.

                         FLAN
          We gave him fifty dollars.

                         KITTY
          We gave him twenty five.

                         OUISA
          He picked up a hustler.

                         FLAN
          He left.

                         KITTY
          He chased the burglar out of our house.

                         OUISA
          He didn't steal anything.

                         LARKIN
          We looked and looked.

                         KITTY
           Top to bottom. Nothing gone.
          THE DETECTIVE closes his notebook.

                         OUISA
          Granted this does not seem major now.

                         DETECTIVE
          Look. We're very busy.

                         FLAN
          You can't chuck us out.

                         DETECTIVE
          Come up with charges. Then I'll do something.

          INT THE MORGAN LIBRARY NIGHT
          FLAN and OUISA have come to a charity do featuring a string
          quartet playing Schubert Trio in B flat.
          But FLAN and OUISA are not entranced by the music.
          THEY stand at the back of the room by the bar telling their
          story to a GROUP of fascinated FRIENDS (none of whom was at
          the wedding) as the QUARTET plays. These FRIENDS are all
          dressed formally but with the look of people who dress this
          way every night. There-'s always one of these going on and
          they're always there.

                         FLAN
          Yes, there is another chapter.

                         OUISA
          Our kids came down from Harvard. a
          Loud groans of protest and disbelief fill the

          KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM DAY
          Two of FLAN and OUISA'S college aged CHILDREN, WOODY and
          TESS, and KITTY and LARKIN'S boy, BEN, slump around the
          room. They are in dismay at OUISA, FLAN, KITTY and LARKIN
          and their story.

                         FLAN
          --the details he knew--how would he know about
          the painting?
          FLAN has taken the Kandinsky off the wall and flipped it
          around to the wild side.

                         FLAN
          Although I think it's a very fine Kandinsky.
          FLAN leans the painting against a chair and studies it.

                         OUISA
          And none of you knows this fellow? He has this
          wild quality--yet, a real elegance and a real
          concern and a real consideration.
          TESS looks at the floral arrangement PAUL sent.
          It's only slightly wilted.

                         TESS
          Well, Mom, you should have let
          him stay. You should have divorced
          all your children and just let this
          dreamboat stay. Plus he sent you flowers.

                         FLAN
          And jam .

                         THE KIDS
          Oooooo.

                         OUISA
          I wish I knew how to get hold of his father.
          Just to see if there is any truth in it.

                         LARKIN
          Who knows Sidney Poitier so we could just call
          him up and ask him?

                         KITTY
          I have a friend who does theatrical law.
          I bet he -

                         LARKIN
          What friend?
          KITTY (suddenly trapped)
          Oh, it's nobody.

                         LARKIN
          I want to know.

                         KITTY (SCREAMS)
          Nobody!

                         LARKIN (RECONSIDERS)
          Whatever's going on anywhere, I do not
          want to know. I don't want to know.
          I don't want to know.

                         

                         KITTY (OVERLAPPING)
          Nobody. Nobody. Nobody.

                         BEN (OVERLAPPING)
          Dad. Mom. Please. For once. Please?
          BEN, KITTY, LARKIN scream at each other in anguish.
          TESS, in a fury, leaves the apartment.
          FLAN follows HER to

          THE OUTSIDE CORRIDOR.

                         FLAN
          Tess, when you see your little sister, don't
          tell her that Paul and the hustler used her bed.

                         TESS
          You put him in that bed. I'm not going to get
          involved with any conspiracy.

                         FLAN
          It's not a conspiracy. It's a family.
          THE ELEVATOR DOOR opens. TESS and FLAN virtually growl at
          each other as the door shuts on TESS.

          EXT CENTRAL PARK DAWN
          The Alaskan Husky barks at the moon.
          THE CAMERA travels out of the park up the face of the Fifth
          Avenue apartment once again into the safety of

          THE MASTER BEDROOM.
          FLAN and OUISA are in bed asleep.
          OUISA sits up when SHE hears someone tapping insistently on
          the window pane. SHE looks around the room.
          PAUL appears outside on the window ledge wearing the pink
          shirt. OUISA gets out of bed and opens the window.

                         PAUL
          The imagination. That's our out. Our
           imagination teaches us our limits and then how
           to grow beyond those limits. The imagination
           says listen to me. I at your darkest voice. .I
          am your 4am voice. I am the voice that wakes
          you up and says this is what I'm afraid of. Do
          not listen to me at your peril. The
          imagination is the noon voice that sees clearly
          and says yes this is what I want for my life.
          It's there to sort out your nightmare, to show
          you the exit from the maze of-your nightmare, to
          transform the nightmare into dreams that become
          your bedrock. If we don't listen to that voice,
          it dies. It shrivels. It vanishes.
          (PAUL takes out a switch blade and opens it.)
          The imagination is not our escape. on the
          contrary, the imagination is the place we are
          all trying to get to.
          PAUL lifts his shirt and stabs himself.
          OUISA screams.
          PAUL falls over backward into space.
          The phone rings, waking OUISA. FLAN picks up the phone.
          OUISA sits up, a little stunned. She is relieved to find
          things so normal.

          INT THE PRECINCT EARLY MORNING

                         DETECTIVE
          I got a call that might interest you.

          EXT BETH ISRAEL DOCTORS HOSPITAL DAY
          FLAN and OUISA, KITTY and LARKIN come to this hospital
          across from Gracie Mansion.

          INT BETH ISRAEL DOCTORS HOSPITAL DR. FINE'S OFFICE
          DR. FINE, an earnest professional man in his 50s, comes
          down the hall, and opens his office door.
          FLAN, OUISA, KITTY and LARKIN sit in his office.

          DR. FINE
          I was seeing a patient. I'm an
          obstetrician at New York Hospital.
          The nurse opened my office door.

          INT EXAMINING ROOM DAY
           THE NURSE, a sturdy woman in her 50s, opens the door.

                         NURSE
          There's a friend of your son's here.
          PAUL appears,- looking much as HE was when HE came to FLAN
          and OUISA's. PAUL's shirt front is bleeding.

          DR. FINE'S OFFICE
          OUISA and FLAN, KITTY and LARKIN are filled with dread.

          DR. FINE
          I treated the kid. He was more scared than
          hurt. A knife wound, a few bruises.

                         EXAMINING ROOM
          PAUL gets off the examining table, buttoning his pink shirt.

                         PAUL

          is coming here.

          And he told me the name of a matinee idol of my
          youth. Somebody who had really forged ahead and
          made new paths for Blacks just by the strength
          of-his own talent. Strangely, I had identified
           with him, before I started Medical School. I
           mean, I'm a Jew. My grandparents were killed in
           the war. I had this sense of self-hatred, of
          fear. And this kid's father - the bravery of
          his films - had given me a direction, a
          confidence. Simple as that. We're always
          paying off debts. Then my beeper went off. A
          patient in her tenth month of labor. Her water
          finally broke. I gave'him the keys.

          THE HOSPITAL HALL.

                         

                         PAUL
          Doug's told me all about your brownstone. How
          you got it at a great price because there had
          been a murder in it and for a while people
          thought it had a curse but you were a scientific
          man and were courageous!

          DR. FINE
          Well, yes! Courageous!

          DR. FINE'S OFFICE
          FLA.N and OUISA, KITTY and LARKIN agree.

                         FLAN
          Very courageous.

          DR. FINE
          I ran off to the delivery room. Twins! Two
          boys. I thought of my son. I dialed my boy at
          Dartmouth. Amazingly, he was in his room.
          Doing y hat I hate to ask.

           INT COLLEGE DORM ROOM DAY
           The call wakens DR. FINE'S son, DOUG, 20.
          DOUG grabs for the phone from under the covers. Is there
          someone else in bed with Doug?

          DR.FINE'S EXAMINING ROOM

          DR. FINE
          So you accuse me of having no interest in your
          life, not doing for friends, being a rotten
          father. Well, you should be very happy.

          COLLEGE DORM ROOM

                         DOUG
          The son of who? Dad, I never heard of him.
          Dad, as usual, you are a real cretin. You gave
          him the keys? You gave ,& complete stranger who
          happens to mention my name the keys to our
          house? Dad, sometimes it is so obvious to me
          why Mom left. I am so embarrassed to know you.
          You gave the keys to a stranger who shows up at
          your office? Mother told me you beat her! Mom
          told me you were a rotten lover and drank so
           much your body smelled of cheap white wine. Mom
           said sleeping with you was like sleeping with a
           salad made with bad dressing. Why you had to
           bring me into the world!
          A GIRL sits up in bed, terrified.

                         EXAMINING ROOM

          DR. FINE
          There are two sides to every story -

          COLLEGE DORM ROOM

                         DOUG
          You're an idiot! You're an idiot!
          THE GIRL in bed puts pillows over her head.

          DR. FINE'S OFFICE
          FLAN and OUISA, KITTY and LARKIN lean forward in
          fascination.

          DR. FINE
          I went home..-courageously with a policeman.

           EXT DR. FINE'S BROWNSTONE DAY
          DR. FINE puts the key in the door. The COP with HIM has his
          gun drawn. DR. FINE and THE COP enter

          THE BROWNSTONE.
          THEY hear a Debussy quartet playing.
          PAUL sits in the living room wearing a silk robe, swirling a
          snifter of brandy, listening to the music.
          PAUL smiles when HE sees DR. FINE, but when the COP appears
          with the gun, PAUL rolls over on his side out of the chair.

          DR. FINE
          Arrest him!
          DR. FINE snaps off the radio.
          PAUL backs up against the wall.

                         PAUL
          Pardon?

          DR. FINE
          Breaking and entering.

                          PAUL
          Breaking and entering?

          DR. FINE
          You're an imposter.

                         PAUL
          Officer, your honor, your eminence, Dr. Fine
          cave me the keys to his brownstone. Isn't that
          so?

          DR. FINE
          My son doesn't know you.

                         PAUL
          This man gave me the keys to the house.
          Isn't that so?
          THE COP puts his gun away.

                          POLICEMAN (SCREAMS)
           Did you give him the key to the house?

           DR. FINE
           Yes, but under false pretenses. This fucking
           black kid crack addict comes into my office

                         LYING -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         75
           PAUL (cool and forgiving)
          I have taken this much brandy but can pour the
          rest back into the bottle. And I've used
          electricity listening to the music, but I think
          you'll find that nothing's taken from the house.
          PAUL takes off the silk robe and neatly places it on the
          table.

          DR. FINE
          I want you to arrest this fraud.
          PAUL puts on his jacket and leaves the house.

          DR. FINE
          Stop him!
          THE POLICEMAN walks away.

          COLLEGE DORM ROOM
          DOUG continues his tirade.

                         DOUG
          A cretin! A creep! No wonder mother left you!

                         
          DOUG flings the phone against the wall.

          DR. FINE'S OFFICE
          FLAN and OUISA, KITTY and LARKIN look at DR. FINE
          sympathetically.

          DR. FINE
          Two sides. Every story.
          But THE TWO COUPLES are also embarrassed.

          BACK TO THE MORGAN LIBRARY
          PEOPLE from the back row of the concert turn away from the
          music and listen to OUISA and FLAN.

                         OUISA
          We went down to the Strand -

          THE STRAND BOOKSTORE.
          which advertises itself as possessing Eight miles of books
          and that seems an understatement.
          THE CAMERA rushes past rows of books.
          And then suddenly stops.

                         OUISA
          I found it!
          OUISA'S HAND reaches up and brings down.

                         CU
          A COPY OF SIDNEY POITIER'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY: "This Life"
          OUISA reads from the Poitier autobiography.
          THE OTHERS are enrapt..

                         OUISA
          "Back in New York with Juanita and the children,
          I began to become aware that our marriage,
           while working on some levels, was falling apart
          in other fundamental areas."
          FLAN takes the book.

                         FLAN
          There's a picture of him and his four-
          daughters. No sons. Four daughters.

          BACK TO THE MORGAN LIBRARY

                         FLAN

          THE FIVE of THEM have gone down the street fram the Strand
          to this swell restaurant.

                         FLAN
          Agatha Christie would ask what do
          we all have in common?

                         OUISA
          It seems the common thread linking us all is an
          overwhelming need to be in the movie of Cats.

          FLAN (to Dr. Fine)
          How come we never met?

          DR. FINE
          His mother had custody. I lived out West. After
          he graduated from high school, she moved west.
          I moved east.

                         LARKIN
          I think we should drop it right here.

                         KITTY
          Are you afraid Ben is mixed up in this fraud?

                         LARKIN
          I don't want to know too much about my kid.

                         KITTY
          You think Ben is hiding things from us? I tell
          you, I'm getting to the bottom of this. My son
          has no involvements with any black frauds.
          Doctor, you said something about crack?

          DR. FINE
          It just leaped out of my mouth.
          No proof. Oh dear god, no proof.

                         FLAN
          We'll take a vote. Do we pursue this to the end
          no matter what we find out about our kids?

                         OUISA
          I vote yes.

          for our children. Protecting them. From what?
          The truth is what we were protecting those
          little people from... there is a lot to worry
          about and I'd better start telling the little
          bastards - start worrying!" The end.
          KITTY closes the book in dismay.
          OUISA, FLAN, LARKIN, and DR. FINE are each lost in thought.

          INT LINCOLN CENTER METROPOLITAN OPERA NIGHT
          FLAN and OUISA, dressed formally, the way people used to
          dress for the opera, stand at the small champagne bar
          outside the boxes. Their similarly dressed FRIENDS are
          engrossed in the tale.

                         FLAN
          We all went up to Harvard.

          FLAN and OUISA, KITTY and LARKIN, and DR. FINE cut through
          the Harvard Yard at an urgent pace.

          INT ELIOT HOUSE HARVARD
          The FIVE PARENTS sit in the empty Dining Commons.
          THEY've come for lunch. And now lunch is over.
          TESS, WOODY, BEN and DOUG sit on the other side of the
          refectory table, glaring at their parents, lunch trays
          between the generations.
          STUDENTS walk in and out. THE PARENTS speak in hushed,
          library size whispers to avoid any echo.

                         FLAN
          It's obvious. It's somebody you went to High
          School with, since you go to different colleges.

          DR. FINE
          I just want to tell you how I appreciate
          your coming today -

                         DOUG
           Dad? Spare me?
          DOUG'S voice echoes.

                         OUISA
          He knows the details about our lives.

                         FLAN
          Who in your high school, part of your gang, has
          become homosexual or is deep into drugs?

                         TESS
          That's like about fifteen people.
          TESS enjoys her echo because it makes FLAN and OUISA
          uncomfortable.

                         LARKIN
          I don't want to know.

                         TESS
          I find it really insulting that you would assume
          that it has to be a guy. This movie star's son
          could have had a relationship with a girl in

                         HIGH SCHOOL---
          And BEN is just as loud.

          That's your problem in a nut shell.
          You're so limited.
          FLAN and OUISA try to shush them.

                         TESS
          That's why I'm going to Afghanistan.
          To climb mountains.

                         OUISA
          You are not climbing mountains.

                         FLAN
          We have not invested all this money in
          you to scale the face of K-2.
          TESS leans across the table, matching them whisper for
          whisper.

                         TESS
          Is that all I am? An investment?

                         

                         OUISA
          All right. Track down everybody in your high
          school class. Male. Female. Whatever. Not
          just homosexuals. Drug addicts. The kid might
          be a drug dealer.
          DOUG throws back his chair.

                         DOUG
          Why do you look at me when you say that? Do you
          think I'm an addict? A drug pusher? I really
          resent the accusations.

          DR. FINE
          No one is accusing you of anything. Sit down.
          LARKIN gets up and paces around the table.

                         LARKIN
          I don't want to know. I don't want to know.
          I don't want to know.

                         FLAN
          Nobody is accusing anyone of anything.
          I'm asking you to go on a detective search and
          find out from your high school class if anyone
          has met a Black kid pretending to be a movie
          star's son.

                          BEN
          He promised you parts in Cats?

                         OUISA
          It wasn't just that. It was fun.

                         TESS
          You went to Cats. You said it was an all time
          low in a lifetime of theater going.
          OUISA considers.

                         OUISA
          Film is a different medium.

                         TESS
          You said Aeschylus did not invent theater to

          Well, maybe he'll make a movie of Starlight
          Express and you can all be on roller skates!
          THE KIDS stand up.

          blocking TESS and DOUG and BEN's escape. OUISA takes a red

          Here is a copy of your yearbook. I want you to
          get the phone numbers of everybody in your
          class. You all went to the same boarding
          school.

          DR. FINE
          You can charge it to my phone.

          This is the KGB.

          DR. FINE
          You're on the phone all the time. Now I ask you
          to make calls all over the country and you
          become reticent.

          This is the entire McCarthy period.
          WOODY saunters up to his PARENTS.
          HE is very cool.
          FLAN and OUISA smile at his sweet attitude.

                         WOODY
          I just want to get one thing straight.

          Finally, we hear from the peanut gallery.
          And WOODY screams at THEM in rage, his voice echoing,
          mindless of the STUDENTS who freeze in the background as you
          would at a traffic accident.

                         WOODY
          You gave him my pink shirt? You gave a complete
          stranger my pink shirt? That pink shirt was a
          Christmas present from you. I treasured that
          shirt. I loved that shirt. My collar size has
          grown a full size from weight lifting. And you
          saw my arms had grown, you saw my neck had
          grown. And you bought me that shirt for my new
          body. I loved that shirt. The first shirt for
          my new body. And you gave that shirt away. I
          can't believe it. I hate this life. I hate
          you.

          EXT ELIOT HOUSE
          WOODY's wrath grows and grows and drives OUISA and FLAN,
          indeed all the PARENTS, out of the serene, venerable Harvard
          building onto the street. PASSERSBY stop and gape.
           WOODY doesn't care.

                         DOUG
          You never do anything for me.

                         TESS
          You've never done anything but
          tried to block me.

                         BEN
          I'm only this pathetic extension
          of your eighth rate personality.

                         DOUG
          Social Darwinism pushed beyond all limits.

                         WOODY
          You gave away my pink shirt?

                         TESS
          You want me to be everything you weren't.

                         DOUG
          You said drugs and looked at me.
          THE PARENTS go down the street, speechless, defeated.

          TESS has come down to New York with news for her mother.

                         TESS
          So I went to MIT. He was there in
          his computer room and I just pressed
          him and pressed him and pressed him.
          I had this strapped to me.
          TESS puts a small tape recorder on the desk.
          TESS turns it on. OUISA listens to the tape.

          Yes, I knew Paul.

          INT A COMPUTER ROOM AT MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY
          THE CAMERA focusses in on her thigh. WE can see the slight
          bump where TESS has strapped the recorder.

          TRENT's pinched face looks as if it has never, known one
          truly happy day.

          EXT A DOORWAY RAIN NIGHT
          PAUL dressed in ragged clothes stands huddled in a doorway
          to get out of the freezing rain.
          TRENT passes by the doorway.
          TRENT is gone.
          Then TRENT reappears and stares at PAUL.

          INT TRENT CONWAY'S APARTMENT NIGHT
          PAUL stands against the WHITE WALL we've seen earlier.
          Rain. Distant thunder. Jazz playing somewhere.
          PAUL, unlike the elegant PAUL we have seen, is dressed in
          torn jeans, a ripped tank top, dirty high top sneakers.
          This is the PAUL we first saw.

                         
          PAUL looks at TRENT with a mixture of contempt and I dare
          you.
          PAUL stretches out on the bed.
          HE pulls out a thick address -book from under him.

                         PAUL
          What's this?
          PAUL speaks.street talk speech. Hardly what we've heard.

                         TRENT
          My address book.
          TRENT tries to take the address book away from PAUL.

                         PAUL
          All these names. Addresses.
          Tell me about these people.
          TRENT lies along side PAUL.

                         TRENT
          This is where I wanted you to be...
          Right here...
          PAUL, hypnotised by the-'address book, slaps TRENT away from
          him and gets out of the bed.

                         TRENT
          I just want to look at you. Sorry.

                         PAUL
          Are these all rich people?
          TRENT sits up in bed.

                         TRENT
          No. Hand to mouth on a higher plateau.

          judgement.

          PAUL paces around the room, looking into this book.

                         PAUL
          I think it must be very hard to be with rich
          people. You have to have money. You have to
          give them presents.

                         TRENT
          Not at all. Rich people do something nice for
          you, you give them a pot of jam.

                         PAUL (AMAZED)
          That's what pots of jam are for?

                         TRENT
          Orange. Grapefruit. Strawberry. But fancy.
          They have entire stores filled with fancy pots
          of jam wrapped in cloth. English. Or French.

                         PAUL
          I'll tell you what I'll do. I pick a name. You
          tell me about them. Where they live. Secrets.
          And for each name you get a piece of clothing.

                         TRENT
          All right.

                         0
          plunging into the address book.

                         PAUL
          Kittredge. Talbot and Woodrow.

                         TRENT

          meet you for the first time and our friendship
          will be witnessed by my friends, our parents'
          friends. If it all happens under their noses,
          they can't judge me. They can't disparage you.

                         TRENT
          This is the way you must speak. Hear my accent.
          Hear my voice. Never say you're going horse
          back riding. You say You're going Riding. And
          don't say couch. Say sofa. And you say

          We went through the address book letter by

          Why do they want to find him?

                         TES S
          They say to help him. If there's a crime, the
          cops will get involved.

                         TRENT
          Look, we must keep in touch. We were friends
          for a brief bit in school. I mean we were
          really good friends.

          won't you press charges?

           FLAN and OUISA have brought their FRIENDS up to date.

                         OUISA
          Paul learned all that in three months!

                         OPERAGOER
          Three months?

                         FLAN
          Three months!
          The chimes ring, signalling the start of the opera.

                         OUISA
          who would have thought it? Trent Conway, the
          Henry Higgins of our time.
          THE GROUP laughs and finishes their drinks as THE USHER
          unlocks the door to

          THE OPERA BOX.
          THE GROUP proceeds in, deciding who'll sit where in the box
          and checking their programs.
          OUISA looks into the vastness of the Metropolitan Opera
          House.
          THe chandeliers are rising into the ceiling.

          OUISA is distracted.

                         OUISA
          Paul must have looked at all those
          names and said I am Columbus. I am Magellan.
          I will sail into this new world.
          The camera comes in on OUISA as she remembers

          THE KITTREDGE LIVING ROOM.
          TESS laughs. OUISA laughs. It's a nice moment between these
          two.

                         OUISA
          I read somewhere that everybody on this planet
          is separated by only six other people. Six
          degrees of separation. Between us and everybody
          else on this planet. The President of the
          United States. A. gondolier in Venice. Fill in
          the names. I find that A.] tremendously
          comforting that we're so close and B.] like
          Chinese water torture that we're so close.
          Because you have to find the right six people to
          make the connection. It's not just big names.
          It's anyone. A native in a rain forest. A
          Tierra del Fuegan. An Eskimo. I am bound to
          everyone on this planet by a trail of six
          people. It's a profound thought. How Paul found
          us. How to find the man whose son he pretends to
          be. Or perhaps j& his son, although I doubt it.
          How every person is a new door, opening up into
          other worlds. Six degrees of separation between
          me and everyone else on this planet. But to
          find the right six people.
          TESS kisses HER MOTHER.
          OUISA puts out the light and THEY leave the room.

          SANDY and CONNIE (yes! Pram the wedding) have leaned over
          from the next box.

                         FLAN
          No. No news.

                         OUISA
          He just vanished.

                          FLAN
          Nothing. All quiet. Thank god.
          THEY pass out of the box into

          THE CHAMPAGNE BAR.
          EVERYONE is very cheery.

                         OUISA
          Yes! We are going to Rome.
          CONNIE gives OUISA a card with a name on it.
          OUISA reads the card and passes it to FLAN.

                         OUISA
          No! I don't know them.
          FLAN smiles when HE sees the card.

                         FLAN
          Always wanted to meet them! Of course we'l1
          call. As soon as we get to Rome! What fun!

                         TOWARDS

          THE VATICAN.

                         FLAN (VO)
          Rome is always remarkable but to see -
          Columns flash past. The blurring clears and we are moving

                         INTO

          INT SISTINE CHAPEL
          with FLAN and OUISA. They are escorted, through a maze of
          scaffolding, by an elderly Italian ART DEALER.

                         FLAN (VO)
          the Sistine Chapel like this!

                         OUISA (VO)
          To stand at the very top on scaffolding!

                         
          FLAN and OUISA ride up through the scaffolding, in a
          rickety elevator.

                         OUISA
          We were at the opera and ran into them and they
          gave us your address!

                         FLAN
          This is staggering!
          THEY step out, in great excitement, right onto

          THE SISTINE CHAPEL SCAFFOLDING.

                         FLAN (VO)
          They restored it after all these years -
          FOUR ITALIAN WORKERS scrub away at the ceiling a few feet
          above them. They refer constantly to banks of computers
          operated by TWO JAPANESE.

                         OUISA (VO)
          scraped all this paint off it

                         FLAN (VO)
          and years of smoke and tourists and it's brand
          new!

           OUISA looks up. SHE is right beneath the hand of God
           touching the hand of Man. SHE looks at it in awe. To be
           this close to it! THE SCREEN is filled with the cleaned
          ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

          INT SOHO LOFT NIGHT
          FLAN and OUISA sit on cushions of a Soho loft done in the
          most glamorous minimal Japanese mode.

                         FLAN
          The colors are vibrant!

                         OUISA
          Flan went for business but for me it was -
          THE OWNERS of this loft are a MAN, 40s, who is confined to a
          wheel chair, and his beautiful COMPANION, an elegant
          Japanese woman. THE TEN DINNER GUESTS are dressed all in
          black, except OUISA who has on a bright Chanel suit. SHE
          and FLAN have managed to capture stage center.

          No. It's not important -

          You must!

                         OUISA
          Well, the day we got back from Rome -

                         FLAN
          We stepped out of the taxi from the airport and

          EXT THE KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT BUILDING DAY
          FLAN steps out of the cab first.

                         OUISA (VO)
          our doorman whom we tip very well at Christmas
          and any time he does something nice for us-- our
          doorman spits at my husband, J. Flanders
          Kittredge. I mean, spit at him!
          The DOORMAN - FRANK - good faithful loyal FRANK - holds
          the door open and spits at FLAN.

          Darling, they don't have to know every detail.

          EXT THE KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT BUILDING
          OUISA is afraid to come out of the cab.

                         DOORMAN
          Your son! I know all about your son.

                         FLAN
          What about my son?

                         DOORMAN
          Not the little shit who lives here. The other
          son. The secret son. The negro son you deny.

                         FLAN
          The negro son?

                         DOORMAN
          The black son you make live in Central Park
          while you're gallivanting around Rome.
          The DOORMAN spits at FLAN again.

          THE JAPANESE HOSTESS is interested.

          THE JAPANESE HOSTESS
          You have a black son?

                         FLAN
          No! The cops brought this young girl to us!

                         OUISA
          The cops called us up and we went
          down to the precinct again!

          THE DETECTIVE sits on the edge of his desk.
          OUISA and FLAN sit in chairs in the small office, looking on
          uncomfortably. The emotion in the shabby room is too big for
          the size of it. THEY watch a young woman named ELIZABETH,in
          her mid-20s, seated behind the DETECTIVE'S desk.

          My boy friend and I took a picnic
          into the park

          EXT CENTRAL PARK DAY
          RICK, ELIZABETH and PAUL sprawl out on the grass in the
          sun, under the statue of the Alaskan husky, the remains of a
          picnic around them. Bongo Drums play in the distance.

                         ELIZABETH (VO)
          and we met this guy and started
          singing and talking.
          RICK, a nice young guy in his mid-twenties, plays his guitar
          energetically, the THREE of them having a great time singing
          a cheery old rock song.
          PAUL is wearing the pink shirt and the khakis but looks
          pretty seedy. HE eats hungrily.

                         PAUL
          I was hallucinating from not eating-

                         ELIZABETH
          If I told people back home that
          New York had trees and picnics,
          they'd swear I was lying. I love New York so
          much. Look at it! I can't get over it.

                         RICK
          We're here from Utah.

                         PAUL
          Do they have any black people in Utah?

                         RICK
          Maybe two.

                         ELIZABETH
          I saw them once. Two black people.

                         RICK
          Yes, the Mormons brought in two.
          THEY all laugh, enjoying each other, the day, the meeting.

                         ELIZABETH
          We came here to be actors.

                         RICK
          She won the all-state competition
          for comedy and drama.

                         PAUL
          My gosh!
          ELIZABETH stands up and declaims.

                         ELIZABETH
          "The quality of mercy is not strained.
          It droppeth like the gentle rain from heaven.."
          SHE's not bad. But then SHE giggles and the Shakespearean
           effect crumbles.

                         RICK
          And we study and we wait tables.

                         ELIZABETH
          Because you have to have technique.
          ELIZABETH and RICK are very earnest.

                         PAUL
          Like the painters. Cezanne looked for the rules
          behind the spontaneity of Impressionism.

                         RICK
          Cez - That's a painter?

                         ELIZABETH
          We don't know anything about painting.

                         PAUL
          My dad loves painting. He has a Kandinsky but
          he loves Cezanne the most. He lives up there.

                         RICK
          What?

          He lives up there. Count six windows over.
          John Flanders Kittredge. His chums-call him
          Flan. I was the child of Flan's hippie days.
          His radical days. He went down South as a
          freedom marcher, to register black voters - his
          friends were killed. Met my mother. Registered
          her and married her in a fit of sentimental
          righteousness and knocked her up with me and
          came back here and abandoned her. Went to
          Harvard. He's now a fancy art dealer. Lives up
          there. Count six windows over. Won't see me.
          The new wife--the white wife-- The Louisa
          Kittredge Call Me Ouisa wife - the mother of the
          new children wife--

                         RICK
          Your brothers and sisters?

                         PAUL (BITTER)
          They go to Andover and Exeter and Harvard and
          Yale. The awful thing is my father started out
          good. My mother says there is a good man inside
          s J. Flanders Kittredge.

                         ELIZABETH
          He'll see you if he is that good. He can't
          forget you entirely.

                         PAUL
          I call him. He hangs up.

                         RICK
          Go to his office -

          He doesn't have an office. He works out of
          there. They won't even let me in the elevator.

                         RICK
          Dress up as a messenger.

                         ELIZABETH
          Say you have a masterpiece for him.
          "I got the Mona Lisa waitin' out in the truck."

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         99

                          PAUL
          I don't want to embarrass him. Look, this is so
          fucking tacky.

                         (PAUSE)
          You love each other? a

                         ELIZABETH
          A lot.
          RICK and ELIZABETH touch each other's hands.
          PAUL (standing up to go)
          I hope we can meet again.

                         RICK
          Where do you live?
          PAUL looks around HIM and makes a hopeless grand gesture.

                         PAUL
          Live? I'm,home.
          PAUL picks up two plastic shopping bags which are filled
          with clothing.

                         

                         ELIZABETH
          You're not out on the streets?

                         PAUL
          You're such assholes. Where would I live?
          PAUL shrugs his shoulders and leaves.
          RICK and ELIZABETH look at each other then follow him down
          the path leading through the park to the carousel.
          THE CAROUSEL calliope plays merrily.

                         RICK
          Stay with us.

                         ELIZABETH
          We just have a railroad flat in a tenement --
          PAUL looks at a bank of daffodils planted by the carousel.
          HE begins picking a bouquet of daffodils.
          RICK and ELIZABETH are being as persuasive as they can.

                         RICK
           It's over a roller disco. The last of the
           roller discos but it's quiet by five AM and a
          great narrow space -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         100

                          ELIZABETH
          A railroad loft and we could give you a corner.
          The tub's in the kitchen but there's light in

                         THE MORNING-

                         SOHO LOFT

                         OUISA
          And he did!

          INT RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT DAY
          RICK and ELIZABETH'S tenement is disastrously crummy and
          probably violates every building code. But, yes, light
          does flow in through that one narrow window.
          PAUL puts the bouquet of daffodils into a jelly jar and sets
          it down on a board that covers the tub.

                         THE PRECINCT
          ELIZABETH composes herself.
          OUISA pours ELIZABETH a glass of water.

                         ELIZABETH
           He stayed for a few weeks. He taught
          us so much. We even thought he was the
          reason for coming to New York. He opened
          up a new world for us. That's all anybody
          wants, isn't it? A new world?
          OUISA looks at FLAN.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
          RICK and ELIZABETH listen intently to PAUL.

                         PAUL
          This is the way you must speak.
          Hear my accent. Hear my voice.
          Never say you're going horse back riding.
          You say You're going Riding. And don't
          say Couch. Say Sofa. And you say bodd-ill.
          It's bottle. Say bottle of beer.

                         RICK
          Bodd-ill a bee-ya.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         101
          ELIZABETH pokes around in the refrigerator.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (SERIOUS)
          Hello. ï¿½. _

                         (FLIRTATIOUS)
          Hello.
          (SHE discovers two bottles of beer)
          Hello hello!
          SHE opens the beers. PAUL regards RICK for a moment.
          PAUL takes the bottle of beer.
          RICK and ELIZABETH share the other.

                         PAUL
          Bottle of beer. And never be afraid of rich
          people. You know what they love? A fancy pot
          of jam. That's all. Get yourself a patron.
          That's what you need. You shouldn't be waiting
          tables. You're going to wake up one day and the
          temporary job you picked up to stay alive is
          going to be your full time life.
          ELIZABETH is struck by his advice and embraces PAUL
          gratefully.

                         

                         THE PRECINCT
          ELIZABETH is more pulled together, sipping her drink of
          water. FLAN takes OUISA's hand.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
          RICK and ELIZABETH have made love and lay on their backs in
          bed and dream.

                         RICK
          I'll tell you all the parts I want to play.
          Vanya in Uncle Vanya.

                         ELIZABETH
          Masha in Three Sisters.

                         RICK
          I'd like a -
          ELIZABETH is on fire with happiness and unwittingly cuts off

          RICK.

                         ELIZABETH
          No, Irina first. The young one
          who yearns for love.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         102

                          RICK
           I'd like a shot at -

                         ELIZABETH
          Then Masha who loves.

                         RICK
          I'd like a shot -

                         ELIZABETH
          Then the oldest one, Olga, who never knows love!
          RICK'waits to see that ELIZABETH is through, then:

                         RICK
          I'd like a shot at Laertes. I think
          it's a much better part.
          ELIZABETH gazes in a mirror that- SHE holds close to her
          face.

                         ELIZABETH
          Do you think it'll hurt me?

                         RICK
           What'll hurt you?

                         ELIZABETH
          My resemblance to Liv Ullmann.
          PAUL runs into the loft.

                         PAUL
          He wrote me! I wrote him and he _
          wrote me back! He's going to give
          me a thousand dollars! And that's
          just for starters! He sold a Cezanne
          to the Japanese and made millions and
          he can give me money without her knowing it.
          PAUL lets out a whoop and leaps up onto the bed with RICK
          and ELIZABETH in it and begins jumping up and down.

                         ELIZABETH
          I knew it!
          PAUL goes to a corner which contains a single mattress on
          the floor and begins to pack his few things back in the
          plastic bags.

                         PAUL
          I'm moving out of here!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         103

                         
          ELIZABETH reaches for her robe and pulls it on.
          RICK pulls on his jeans.

                         ELIZABETH
          You can't!

                         RICK
          No!
          RICK and ELIZABETH surround PAUL to make HIM stay.
          PAUL hugs THEM.

                         PAUL
          But I am going to give you the money to put on a
          showcase of any play you want and you'll be in
          it and agents will come see you and you'll be
          seen and you'll be started. And when you win
          your Oscars - both of you - you'll look in the
          camera and thank me -
          ELIZABETH loves the moment and weeps her acceptance speech.

                         ELIZABETH
          I want to thank Paul Kittredge.

                         RICK
          Thanks, Paul!
          THEY all hug each other and that's real.

                         PAUL
          One hitch. I'm going to meet him in Maine. He's
          up there visiting his parents in Dark Harbor.
          My grandparents whom I've never met. He's
          finally going to tell my grandparents about me.
          He's going to make up for lost time. He's going
          to give me money. I can go back home. Get my
          momma that beauty parlor she's wanted all her
          life. One problem. How am I going to get to
          Maine? The wife checks all the bills. He has
          to account for the money. She handles the purse
          strings. Where the hell am I going to get two
          hundred and fifty dollars to get to Maine?

                         ELIZABETH
          How long would you need it for?

                         PAUL
          I'll be gone a week. But I could wire
          it back to you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         104
          PAUL goes into the john to take his toothbrush and razor.
          ELIZABETH pulls on her dress and straightens out her hair.

                         RICK (QUIET)
           We could lend it to him for a week.

                         ELIZABETH (QUIET)
          We can't. If something happens -

                         RICK (QUIET)
          You're like his stepmother. These women holding
          on to all the purse strings.

                         ELIZABETH
          No. We worked too hard to save that.
          PAUL comes out of the john.
          RICK - always laid back - is suddenly quite angry.

                         ELIZABETH
          Paul. I'm sorry. We just can't.

                         PAUL
          Look. No problem. I understand.

                         ELIZABETH
          I'll meet you both after work. If your father
          loves you, he'll get you the ticket up there.

                         PAUL
          He does. It'll work out. Hey.
          Posture. Stand up straight. Don't slump.
          Attitudes of defeat.
          ELIZABETH kisses PAUL and looks at sullen RICK and leaves.

          She was one of those armies of
          young people who come to New York
          filled with dreams and end up on a treadmill
          working and working just to stay alive.

          INT A WEST SIDE RESTAURANT NIGHT
          ELIZABETH is one of the few waitresses in this crowded bar
          and works very hard.

          EXT CASH MACHINE NIGHT
          ELIZABETH gapes at the information on the screen.

          ELIZABETH begins hitting the machine to get her card back.
          ELIZABETH picks up the phone on the machine and calls the
          emergency number.
           ELIZABETH (in phone)
           There's some mistake. It says my joint account
           - can you see the numbers on the screen - that's
          right. that's my name. And his name. Joint
          account. What do you mean? Closed? Who closed
          the account? Who took everything out of the
          account? Who did this! Give me my card back!

          An hysterical ELIZABETH goes into

                         

          THE LOBBY.
          FRANK, the DOORMAN, is having a snooze.
          ELIZABETH shakes him. HE wakes up terrified at the sight of
          this hysterical creature over HIM.

                         ELIZABETH
          - people named Kittredge. This Kittredge guy
          has a black son he makes live in the park -

                         FRANK
          Mr. Kittredge has what?

                         ELIZABETH
          His black son took money from me -

                         FRANK
          You have to be quiet

                         ELIZABETH
          I want to get up to see them!

                         FRANK
          You'll have to call or write a letter -

                         ELIZABETH
          They owe me money!

          THE KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT BUILDING.
          FRANK, the DOORMAN, bolts the front door to the-building.
          ELIZABETH bangs on the door.

                         ELIZABETH
          I'm here trying to get to meet people.
          I am stranded. Who do I know to go to?
          I want my money. I work tables. I work hard.
          A CAB pulls up. A POSH COUPLE steps out of the cab to go
          into 910 Fifth. THEY look at ELIZABETH.

                         ELIZABETH
          "The quality of mercy is not strained?"
          Fuck you, quality of mercy.
          FRANK opens the door quickly. THE POSH COUPLE scoots in.
          ELIZABETH kicks the building.

          INT ORSO'S RESTAURANT NIGHT
           FLAN and OUISA have come to this Broadway Italian restaurant
          after the theater with a MAN and WOMAN who from their dress
          and manner are obviously in the theater: ANDREW and ZEANNIE.
          FLAN and OUISA are in mid-story.

                         FLAN
          - all over the building that I had abandoned
          some mistake of my past in Central Park!
          THE COUPLE gasps!

                         JEANNIE
          But it's too fantastic!

                         FLAN
          Can't you just see me marching
          down South for Freedom Now!

                         OUISA (PROUDLY)
          Yes. Yes, I can.

                         FLAN
          It was so embarrassing.

                         ANDREW
          Horrible!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         107

                         OUISA
          It wasn't so embarrassing.

                         JEANNIE
          I bet Flan loves being outraged.
          FLAN (mock outrage)
          I don't!

                         ANDREW
          You do! Flan loves getting into
          high dudgeon! His cheeks go all rosy!
          Look at his cheeks! Dudgeon becomes him.
          THEY all laugh as the WAITRESS puts down the plates of food.

                         FLAN
          To high dudgeon!
          THEY all toast.
          But OUISA has stopped laughing.

          INT RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TEN EME NT NIGHT
          ELIZABETH sits up in bed in the dark. SHE impassively
          watches a rat scramble across the floor. RICK comes in,
          drained, dressed in a baby blue tuxedo with a ruffled blue
          shirt - the kind of tux worn at high school proms.

                         RICK (BRIGHT)
          Hi!
          ELIZABETH puts on the light.

                         ELIZABETH
          Where's the money?

          BACK IN ORSO'S RESTAURANT
          OUISA continues her tale.

                         DUISA
          - she understandably wanted to know.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
          RICK laughs brightly and sits beside HER on the bed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         108

                          RICK
          No! Let me explain. Paul found some extra
           money of his own and he wanted to thank us for
           staying here! He would've treated you but you
           had to work or else we would've . We rented
          these tuxedos! Isn't it a gas! He's going to
          give us the money back! And then I'm going to
          take you to the Rainbow Room. That's where we
          went! I brought you matches!

          INT THE RAINBOW ROOM NIGHT
          RICK, in his ruffled blue tux, and, PAUL, in impeccable
          black tie, look into the Rainbow Room.
          THE CAPTAIN takes THEM to a table by the window.
          RICK and PAUL look out over the city. The view is magic!

                         RICK (WHISPERS)
          Now did we get this table!

                         PAUL
          Stick with me, baby. I know the
          right name to drop.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
          RICK (laughs brightly)
          And it's not that expensive for what you get.
          Well, it's not a bargain but it's

          THE RAINBOW ROOM
          THE WAITER opens a bottle of champagne.

                         RICK
          How an I going to explain to Elizabeth
          about the money?
          PAUL tastes the champagne. THE WAITER pours.

                         PAUL
          She'll have it back. With interest. Wonderful
          bouquet. Bouquet. That's what you call the
          taste of the wine. And I believe that wine from
          the even numbered years is generally the
          superior to the odd numbered years. Although
          it's just a theory - Cheers! Skol! Prosit!

                         RICK
          You are just about the greatest -
          THE DANCE ORCHESTRA plays a salute to 1930's romance.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         109

                          PAUL
          Do you want to dance?

                         RICK
          Elizabeth has never seen anything l_4e here. I
          wish she was... Who do we dance with?
          THE ORCHESTRA segues into a tango. PAUL stands.

                         RICK
          We're guys.

                         PAUL
          Every moment in life is a learning experience or
          what good is it? Right? Right?

                         RICK
          Well, yes.

                         PAUL
          Then let this bunch of jerks see class.

                         ORSO'S RESTAURANT
          FLAN nods for their dinner guests, ANDREW and JEANNIE.

                         
          A little bit of titillation.

                         FLAN
          They danced. That's right! High
          over New York City.

          THE RAINBOW ROOM
          RICK and PAUL go to the dance floor and begin to dance,
          PAUL leading. RICK loving it.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
          RICK tries to laugh it up into a wild experience.
          ELIZABETH sits impassively.

                         RICK
          I swear nothing like this ever
          happened in Utah.

          THE RAINBOW ROOM
          At first PEOPLE don't notice RICK and PAUL dancing. Then
          PEOPLE do notice.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         110

           RICK (VO)
          And, I'll tell you, nothing like that must have
          ever happened at the Rainbow Room because they
          asked us to leave. It was so funny.
          PAUL spins RICK round and round and the CAMERA spins with

          THEM.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT

                         RICK
          You'll love the place. It's up so high.

          THE RAINBOW ROOM
          THE CAMERA spins around the panoramic view sixty-five floors
          and then spins out of the windows down onto

          EXT THE ICE RINK ROCKEFELLER CENTER NIGHT
          THE CAMERA focusses in on a COUPLE spinning in the middle of
          the ice. RICK and PAUL, hysterical with laughter, cut
          through Rockefeller Center and then come to Fifth Avenue
          where A HANSOM CARRIAGE waits. THE DRIVER tips his hat to
          these customers. PAUL jumps into

          THE HANSOM CARRIAGE.

                         RICK
          We don't have any money -

                         PAUL
          Amigo! When will you learn! Money is one
          commodity you can always get.
          THE HANSOM CARRIAGE proceeds up to Central Park.
          RICK leans forward looking out the isinglass windows.

                         RICK
          I'm going to have to explain to Elizabeth about
          the money and calm her. She gets so nervous

                         ABOUT-
          (PAUL draws a circle on RICK's back.)
          Hey, stop that. Paul. Come on.

                         PAUL
          I was wondering if I could fuck you.
          RICK laughs. Then sees PAUL is serious.

                         RICK
          I don't do things like that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         111

                         

                         PAUL
          That's what makes it so nice. You don't.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
          RICK reaches over and turns off the light by the bedside.
          Downstairs we hear the throb beginning of the roller disco.
          ELIZABETH looks at him coldly.

                         RICK
          - and he did and it was fantastic.

          THE HANSOM CARRIAGE
          Time has passed.
          PAUL kisses an amazed, mussed RICK on the mouth and jumps
          out of the CARRIAGE and goes off into the dark.

          EXT CENTRAL PARK
          THE DRIVER stands up seeing PAUL run out. RICK runs out of
          the CARRIAGE after PAUL. THE DRIVER chases them.

                         CU
          RICK lost in the nighttime park.
          RICK looks up and sees the STATUE OF THE HUSKY.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
          RICK paces back and forth.

                         RICK
          Didn't we come here for experience? Right? We
          can use this. Right?
          ELIZABETH lies on her stomach on the bed away from him.

                         THE PRECINCT
          ELIZABETH rolls a pencil back and forth on the desk.
          FLAN and OUISA watch sympathetically.

                         ELIZABETH
          He rambled on for hours. His own father
          warned me Rick was a fool and I looked
          at Rick and knew his father was right.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         112

           RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
           RICK paces back and forth in a rage, pulling at his tux.

           RICK - -
           My father is not right! I can't have him be
           right. I wanted experience. We came here for
          experience. What's so wrong with that? Right?
          ELIZABETH is repelled by him.

                         ELIZABETH
          Don't touch me!

                         THE PRECINCT
          ELIZABETH rubs her hands over her face as if trying to get
          the memory away.
          OUISA looks at FLAN and THE DETECTIVE.

                         ELIZABETH
          He went on for a long time trying to get me
          just to look at him. I couldn't even do that.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT

                         

                         RICK
          But I didn't come here to do this or lose that
          or be this or do this to you. Not to you. Look
          at me? Elizabeth! What did I let him do to me?

                         ELIZABETH
          Nobody did this but you.

          BACK IN ORSO'S RESTAURANT

          talk about six degrees

                         FLAN
          We were in the roller disco that night!
          ANDREW and JEANNIE's jaws drop.

                         OUISA
          Yes! There we were roller skating for heart
          disease or cancer -

                         FLAN
          It was illiteracy.

          INT ROLLER DISCO NIGHT
          MIDDLE AGED PEOPLE all dolled up roll skate around and
          around trying to keep their balance to 40s swing music.
          Among the SKATERS we spot FLAN and OUISA at this ROLLER
          DISCO BENEFIT skating round and round breathlessly going
          faster and faster, laughing and laughing.
          Lights flash and whirl.

                         OUISA
          I hadn't skated in I hate to tell you how many

                         YEARS -

                         FLAN
          We came outside giddy and reeling

          EXT ROLLER DISCO NIGHT
          Lights reflect in a puddle on the wet street. THE CAMERA
          pulls back to reveal it is a puddle of blood, seeping out of
          a crumpled body.

                         OUISA (VO)
          The body must have just landed there in a clump

                         FLAN (VO)
          Because the blood seeping out had not yet
          reached the gutter...

                         OUISA (VO)
          The blood just oozing out slowly
          towards the curb.
          FLAN and OUISA and another COUPLE, SANDY and CONNIE from
          the wedding, stop at the sight. They stare at the body
          that has slammed into the pavement. The body of RICK.

                         FLAN (VC)
          The boy had jumped from above.

                         OUISA (VO)
          We just missed it by minutes.

                         OUISA
           Perhaps we could have saved him - called an
          ambulance - but it was too late -

                         FLAN
          He could've landed on us!
          ANDREW and JEANNIE are appalled. No!
          OUISA frowns.

                         JEANNIE
          It's so funny you say that. Yesterday we walked
          through the park by Gracie Mansion

                         ANDREW
          and it was cold and we saw police putting a
          jacket on a man sitting on a bench.

                         JEANNIE
          Only we got closer and it wasn't a jacket.

                         ANDREW
          It was a body bag. A homeless person
           had frozen during the night.

                         OUISA
          Was it that cold?

                         ANDREW
          Sometimes there are periods where you see death
          everywhere.
          FLAN waves to someone over there.
          THE WAITRESS brings coffees.
          OUISA looks straight ahead.

          OUISA and FLAN sit with the DETECTIVE and ELIZABETH.

                         DETECTIVE
          When this young lady told me the black kid was
          your son, it all seemed to come into place.
          What I'm saying is she'll press charges.

                         ELIZABETH
          I want Paul dead. He took all our money. He
          took my life. Rick's dead! You bet your life
          I'll press charges.

          We haven't seen him since that night.

                         DETECTIVE
          Find him. We might have a case. a

                         OUISA
          How do we find him?

                         FLAN
          We'll trap him. I'll release it to the papers.
          I can call the New York Times. I have friends.
          They'll publish the story. Someone will see
          it. And turn him in. We'll find Paul.

                         OUISA
          Six degrees. Six degrees.
          OUISA looks at FLAN. FLAN is so secure.

          FLAN, in his bathrobe, opens the door and picks up the
          morning paper.
          t HE scans through the paper, then lets out a whoop and runs
          through the apartment to

                         INSERT

          OUISA is making a breakfast drink at the blender.
          FLAN (reading from the Times)
          "Smart sophisticated tough New Yorkers such as
          J. Flanders Kittredge who opened their homes and
          pocket books to a young man learned yesterday
          they had been boondoggled by a confidence man
          now wanted by police -
          FLAN pounds the kitchen counter in glee.
          OUISA looks at him, askance.

          We were in Aspen.
          THE CHIME signals the intermission's end.

                         FLAN
          I'll send you the clipping.

                         OUISA
          You could wall paper the Empire State Building
          with all the copies he made.

                         ALEX
          We'll meet right here at the next intermission-
          THEY return inside.

          THE YOUNG BALLERINA
          Did you ever hear from Sidney Poitier?

                         FLAN
           No.

                         ALEX
          Did you hear from the boy?

                         FLAN
          No.

          EXT CATHEDRAL OF ST. JOHN THE DIVINE DAY
          OUISA and FLAN get out of a taxi in front of this gothic
          cathedral. THEY see KITTY and FLAN running down the street
          to the same destination.

          INT CATHEDRAL OF ST. JOHN THE DIVINE
          OUISA and FLAN walk down the aisle with KITTY and LARKIN.

          Come for dinner with us after

                         OUISA
          We'd love to but can't!

                         FLAW
          So sorry! Have to work.

          We are bidding tonight on an Henri Matisse.

                         LARKIN
          The nudes? The bathers? The dancers?
          THEY cut down a side aisle.

                         FLAN
          It's a second level Matisse -

                         OUISA
          but a Matisse -

                         KITTY
          Who are you buying it for? The Japanese?
          Germans?
          AN ORGAN suddenly begins playing a triumphant Bach cantata.

                         OUISA
          Not allowed to tell.
          OUISA turns to look up at the choir loft.

                         LARKIN
          Then it's the Germans.

                         FLAN
          They'll go as high as -

                         OUISA
          Don't tell all the family secrets -

                         FLAN
          Well over 25 million.

                         LARKIN
          Out of which you will keep -

                         OUISA
          Not that much in this new market.

                         FLAN
          Ugh. Bring back the 80s.
          I'll have to give most of it away, but the good
          part is it gives me a credibility in this new
          market. It's all out of whack. Everything's
          up. Everything's down. I mean, a David Fucking
          Hockney print sold for a hundred bucks fifteen
          years ago went for Thirty four thousand dollars!
          A print! A flower. You know Geoffrey. our
          South African -
          OUISA shushes FLAN.
          THEY have arrived at

          INT THE BAPTISTRY OF THE CATHEDRAL OF ST. JOHN THE DIVINE
          OUISA and FLAN are part of the GROUP in this stone Gothic
          chamber witnessing the baptism of the infant child of two
          FRIENDS of theirs. KITTY and LARKIN are the godparents.
          EVERYBODY applauds as THE PRIEST shakes the water on the

          OUISA is on the speaker phone with TESS while she is
          dressing for the auction.

                         TESS (VO)
          What do you have on?

                          OUISA
           I'm totally dolled up. The black. Have you seen
          it? I have to tell you the sign I saw today.
          Cruelty-free cosmetics. A store was selling
          cruelty-free cosmetics.

          TESS is curled up on her bed enjoying this chat.

                         TESS
          Mother, that is such a beautiful thing. Do you
          realize the agony cosmetic companies put rabbits
          through to test eye shadow?

                         OUISA
          Dearest, I know that. I'm only talking about
          the phrase. Cruelty-free cosmetics should take
          away all evidence of time and cellulite and--

          HARVARD DORM ROOM

                         TESS
          Mother, I'm getting married.

                         MASTER BEDROOM
          OUISA picks up the receiver on the cordless phone. This is
          too important for 'a speaker phone.

                         OUISA
          I thought you were going to Afghanistan.

                         TESS (VO)
          I am going to get married and then go to
          Afghanistan.

                         OUISA
          One country at a time. You are not
          getting married.

          Immediately so deeply negative--

                         OUISA (VO)
          I know everyone you know and you are not
          marrying any of them.

                         TESS
          The arrogance that you would assume you know
          everyone I know. The way you say it: I know
          everyone you know -

           Unless you met them in the last two days - you
          can't hold a secret.
          (The other line rings)
          Wait- I'm putting you on hold

                         TESS (VO)
          No one ever calls on that number.

                         OUISA

          Lights flash on the glass of this UNSPECIFIED LOCATION.
          PAUL, frightened, is on a street phone AND dressed as HE was
          when TRENT first met him, ragged, scared.

                         PAUL
          Hello?

          BACK IN THE MASTER BEDROOM

                         OUISA
          Paul?
          We will cut back and forth between these two locations for
          the remainder of this scene. At times, the two will share
          the screen.
          During this scene OUISA walks throughout THE APARTMENT
          speaking on the cordless phone.

                         PAUL
          I saw the story in the paper. I didn't know the
          boy killed himself. He gave me the money. I
          didn't steal any -

                         OUISA
          Let me put you on hold. I'm
          talking to my child.

                         PAUL
          If you put me on hold, I'll be gone and you'll
          never hear from me again.
          OUISA pauses.

          TESS is cut off.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S HALL

                         OUISA
          You have to turn yourself in. The boy comaitted
          suicide. You stole the money. The girl is
          pressing charges. They're going to get you.
          Why not turn yourself in and you can get of f
          easier. You can strike a bargain. Learn when
          you're trapped. You're so brilliant. You have
          such promise. You need help.

                         PAUL
          Would you help me?

                         OUISA
          What would you want me to do?

                          PAUL
          Stay with you.

                         OUISA
          That's impossible-.

                         PAUL
          Why?

                         OUISA
          My husband feels you betrayed him.

                         PAUL
          Do you?

                         OUISA
          You were lunatic! And picking that drek off the
          street. Are you suicidal? Do you have AIDS?
          Are you infected?

                         PAUL
          I do not have it. It's a miracle. But I don't.
          Do you feel I betrayed you? If you do, I'll
          hang up and never bother you again -

                         OUISA
          Where have you been?

          Travelling.

                         OUISA
          You're not in trouble? I mean, more trouble?

                         PAUL
          No, I only visited you. I didn't like the first
          people so much. They went out and just left me
          alone. I didn't like the doctor. He was too
          eager to please. And he left me alone. But you.
          You and your husband. We all stayed together.

                         CUISA
          What did you want from us?

                         PAUL
          Everlasting friendship.

                         OUISA
          Nobody has that.

                         PAUL
          You do.

                          OUISA
          What do you think we are?

                         PAUL
          You're going to tell me secrets? You're not
          what you appear to be? You have no secrets.
          Trent Conway told me what your kids have told
          him over the years.

                         OUISA
          What have the kids told him about us?

                         PAUL
          I don't tell that. I save that for blackmail.

                         OUISA
          Then perhaps I'd better hang up.

                         PAUL (PANIC)
          No! I went to a museum! I liked
          Toulouse-Lautrec!

                         OUISA
          As well you should.

                         PAUL
          I read the Andy Warhol Diaries.

          Ahh, you've become an aesthete.

                         PAUL
          Are you laughing at me?

                         OUISA
          No. I read them too.

                         PAUL
          I read The Agony and the Ecstasy by Irving Stone
          about Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel.

                         DUISA
          You're ahead of me there.

                         PAUL
          Have you seen the Sistine Chapel?

                         OUISA
          Oh yes. Even gone to the top of it in a rickety
          elevator to watch the men clean it.

                         PAUL
           You've been to the top of the Sistine Chapel?

                         OUISA (VO)
          Absolutely. Stood right under the hand of God
          touching the hand of man.

                         THE WORKMAN
          Hit it. Hit it. It's only a fresco.
          OUISA looks up at the hand of God. SHE laughs and slaps
          the hand of God.
          PAUL smiles in wonderment as the SCREEN fills with color.
          But then WE're out of his imagination and see the squalid
          surroundings of his phone booth.

                         PAUL
          You slapped God's hand!

          I slapped God's clean hand.
          And you know what they clean it with? All this
          technology? Q-tips and water.
          PAUL is thrilled by this bit of knowledge.

          No!

                         OUISA
          Clean away the years of grime and soot and paint
          ovens. Q-tips and water changing the history of
          Western art. Vivid colors.

                         PAUL
          Take me to see it?

                         OUISA
          Take you to see it? Paul, they think you might

          OUISA (mouths to Flan)
          It's Paul.
          FLAN goes to the other phone.

                         FLAN
          I'll call that detective.
          The other phone line rings. FLAN picks it up.

          INT HARVARD DORM ROOM

                         TESS
          Dad! We were cut off. I'm getting marr -

                         FLAN (VO)
          Darling, could you call back -

                         TESS
          I'm getting married and going to Afghanistan -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         125

          BACK IN THE KITTRIDGE'S LIVING ROOM

                         FLAN
          We cannot talk about this now -

          HARVARD DORM ROOM

                         TESS
          I'm going to ruin my life and get married and
          throw away everything you want me to be because
          it's the only way to hurt you!
          TESS hangs up.
          ANOTHER PHONE is picked up. It is at

          THE PRECINCT.
          THE DETECTIVE doesn't even get to say "Hello".
          FLAN (on the phone)
          I've got that kid on the line.

                         DETECTIVE
          Find out where he is.

                         

          KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM
          FLAN (mouths to Ouisa)
          Find out where he is

                         PAUL
          Who's there?

                         OUISA
          Look, why don't you cone here. Where are you?
          PAUL, pressed in the battered phone booth, doesn't want to
          be in this cold street with its brightly lit squalor. HE
          wants to be at OUISA's, but his fear wins out.

                         PAUL
          I come there and you'll have the cops waiting.

                         OUISA
          You have to trust us.

                         PAUL
          Why?

                         OUISA
          Because - we like you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         126
           FLAN (mouths)
          Where is he?
          PAUL, straining to hear, gets very paranoid.

                         PAUL
          Who's there?

                         IT'S -
          I'm not here.
          It's Flan.
          FLAN groans impatiently.
          PAUL brightens.
          THE OPERATOR makes noises.
          PAUL drops a coin in the box.

                         PAUL
          Are you in tonight? I could come and make a
          feast for you.

                         

                         OUISA
          We're going out now. But you could be here when
          we come back.

                         FLAN
          Are you nuts! Tell a crook we're going out. The
          house is empty.

                         PAUL
          Where are you going?

                         OUISA
          To Sotheby's.
          FLAN grabs the phone.

                         FLAN (SARCASTIC)
          The key's under the mat!
          PAUL is as cheery as HE can be.

                         PAUL
          Hi! Can I come to Sotheby's?
          FLAN thrusts the phone back to OUISA.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         127

                         OUISA

                         
          Hi.

                         PAUL
          I said hi to Flan.

                         OUISA

                         FLAN

                         OUISA

                         PAUL
          That's wonderful! I'll come!

                         OUISA
          You can't.

                         PAUL
          Why? I was helpful last time -

                         FLAN
           Thank him - he was very help -
          OUISA hands FLAN the phone.

                         FLAN
          Paul? You were helpful getting me that money
          for the Cezanne. You impressed Geoffrey -

                         PAUL
          Really! I was thinking maybe that's what I
          should do is what you do - in art but making
          money out of art and meeting people and not
          working in an office -

                         FLAN
          You only see the glam side of it. There's a
          whole grotty side that -

                         PAUL
          I could learn the grotty -

                         FLAN
          You have to have art history. You have to have
          language. You have to have economics -

                         -- PAUL
          I'm fast. I could do it. Do your kids want to

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         128

                         FLAN
          No, it's not really a profession you hand down
           from generation to gen - what the hell at I
           talking career counselling to you! You
           embarrassed me in my building! You stole money.
           There is a warrant out for your arrest.'
           OUISA (wrests the phone away)
          Don't hang up! Paul? Are you there? Paul!
           (TO FLAN) You made him hang up -

                         PAUL
          I'm here.

                         OUISA
          You are! Who are you? What's your real name?

                         PAUL
          If you let me stay with you, I'll tell you.
          That night was the happiest night I ever had.
          OUISA (to Flan)
          It was the happiest night he ever had.

                         FLAN

                         
          Oh please. I am not a bullshitter but never
          bullshit a bullshitter.
          FLAN goes.
          SHE paces into the KITCHEN, looking at the implements PAUL
          had used that night, the funny candelabra.

                         OUISA
          Why?

                         PAUL
          You let me use all the parts of
          myself that night -
          OUISA opens the door into the DINING ROOM.

                         OUISA
          It was magical. That Salinger stuff -
          SHE turns on the chandelier in the DINING ROOM.

                         PAUL
          Graduation speech at Groton two years ago.

                         OUISA
          Your cooking -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         129

                          PAUL
           Other people's recipes. Did you see Donald
          Harthleme's obituary? He said Collage was the
          art form of the 20th century.

                         OUISA
          Everything is somebody else's-

                         PAUL
          Not your children. Not your life.
          SHE walks around the empty dining room table.

                         OUISA
          Yes. You got me there. That is mine.
          It is no one else's.

                         PAUL
          You don't sound happy.
          SHE walks back into the LIVING ROOM.

                         OUISA
           There's so much you don't know. You are so.
           smart and so stupid -

                         
           PAUL slams the side of the phone booth.

                          PAUL (FURIOUS)
           Never say I'm stupid -

                          OUISA
           Have some flexibility! You're stupid not to
           recognize what you could be.

                         PAUL
          What could I be?

                         OUISA
          So much.

                         PAUL
          With you behind me?

                         OUISA
          Perhaps. You liked that night?
          I've thought since that you spent
          all your time laughing at us.

                         PAUL
          No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         130
          SHE walks down the HALL.

                         DUISA
          That you had brought that awful hustling thing
          back to show us your contempt -

                         PAUL
          I was so happy. I wanted to add sex to it.
          Don't you do that?
          OUISA looks into the MASTER BEDROOM and goes in.

                         DUISA (PAUSE)
          No.

                         PAUL
          I'll tell you my name.

                         OUISA
          Please?

                         PAUL
          It's Paul Poitier-Kittredge.
          It's a hyphenated name.
          SHE sits on her bed.

                         OUISA
          Paul? You need help. Go to the police. Turn
          yourself in. You'll be over it all the sooner.
          You can start.

                         PAUL
          Start what?

                         OUISA
          Your life.

                         PAUL
          Will you help me?
          OUISA stands up.

                         OUISA
          I will help you. But you have to go to the
          police and go to jail and -

                         PAUL
          Will you send me books and polaroids of you and
          cassettes? And letters?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         131

                         OUISA
          Yes.
          OUISA walks rapidly down the HALL.

                         PAUL
          Will you visit me?

                         OUISA
          I will visit you.

                         PAUL
          And when you do, you'll wear your
          best clothes and knock em dead?
          SHE's in the LIVING ROOM.

                         OUISA
          I'll knock em dead. But you've got to be careful
          in prison. You have to use condoms.

                         PAUL
          I won't have sex in prison. I only
          have sex when I'm happy.

                          OUISA
          Go to the police.

                         PAUL
          Will you take me?

                         OUISA
          I'll give you the name of-the detective to see-

                         PAUL
          I'll be treated with care if you
          take me to the police. If they don't
          know you're special, they kill you.

                         OUISA
          I don't think they kill you.
          PAUL puts the phone receiver over his head in a sudden
          gesture of fear. Then HE returns the receiver to his ear.

                         PAUL
          Mrs. Louisa Kittredge, I am black.

          PAUSE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         132

                         OUISA
           I will deliver you to them with
          kindness and affection.

                         PAUL
          And I'll plead guilty and go to
          prison and serve a few months.

                         OUISA
          A few months tops.

                         PAUL
           Then I'll come out and work for
          you and learn -

                         OUISA
          We'll work that out.

                         PAUL
          I want to know now.

                         OUISA
          Yes. You'll work for us.

                         PAUL
          Learn all the trade. Not just the grotty part.

                         

                         OUISA
          Top to bottom.

                         PAUL
          And live with you.

                         OUISA
          No.

                         PAUL
          Your kids are away.

                         OUISA
          You should have your own place.

                         PAUL
          You'll help me find a place?

                         OUISA
          We'll help you find a place.

                         PAUL
          I have no furniture.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         133

                          OUISA
          We'll help you out.
          PAUL beams as HE becomes the PAUL from that night. His
          imagination is off and running. The lights, from wherever
          HE is, shine on his face and reflect on the broken glass of
          the booth.

                         PAUL
          I made a list of things I liked in the museum.
          Philadelphia Chippendale.

                         OUISA
           Believe it or not, we have two Philadelphia
          Chippendale chairs -

                         PAUL
          I'd rather have one nice piece than
          a room full of junk.

          Philadelphia Chippendale.

                         PAUL
           All I have to do is go to the police.

                         OUISA
          Make it all history. Put it behind you.

                         PAUL
          Tonight.

                         OUISA
          It can't be tonight. I will take you tomorrow.
          We have an auction tonight at Sotheby's -

                         PAUL
          Bring me?

                         OUISA
          I can't. It's black tie.

                         PAUL
          I have black tie from a time I
          went to the Rainbow Room. Have
          you ever been to the Rainbow Room?

                         OUISA
          Yes.

          What time do you have to be there?

                         OUISA
          Eight o'clock.

                         PAUL
          It's five thirty now. You could come
          get me now and take me to the police
          tonight and then go to Sotheby's--

                         OUISA
          We're going to drinks before at the Pierre.

                         PAUL
          Japanese?

                         OUISA
          Germans.

                         PAUL
          You're just like my father.

                         OUISA
          Which father?

                         PAUL
          Sidney!

          PAUSE.

                         OUISA
          Paul. He's not your father. And
          Flanders. is not your father.
          FLAN comes in to the living room, dressed.

                         FLAN
          Oh fuck. We have drinks with the Japanese at
          six- fifteen - Get off that fucking phone. Is
          it that kid? Get him out of our life! Get off
          that phone or I'll rip it out of the wall!
          OUISA (looks at FLAN)
          Paul, I made a mistake. It is not the Germans.
          We will come right now and get you. Where are
          you? Tell me? I'll take you to the police. They
          will treat you with dignity.

                         PAUL
          I'm in the lobby of the Waverly movie theater on
          Sixth Avenue and Third Street.

          KITTRIDGE'S LIVING ROOM

                         OUISA
          We'll be there in half an hour.

                         PAUL
          I'll give you fifteen minutes grace time.

                         OUISA
          We'll be there. Paul. We love you.

                         PAUL
          Ouisa., I love you. Ouisa Kittredge. Hey?
          Bring a pink shirt.

                         OUISA
          We'll have a wonderful life.
           SHE hangs up and looks at FLAN.

                         OUISA
          We can skip the shmoozing. Pick
          the boy up, take him to the police
          and be at Sotheby's before eight.

          INT A FORMAL DINING ROOM
          Of all the PARTIES we've been to, this is the most luxurious
          of all, given by one of New York's legendary hostess's, a
          glamorous woman who must be in her late 80s, MRS. BANNISTER.
          OUISA and FLAN are here.
          This dinner is really a state occasion in honor of that
          United Nations type at MRS. BANNISTER'S right.
          But FLAN and OUISA have captured the table.

                         OUISA
          t The story ended there...

                         FLAN
          It did not!
          Clearly OUISA is as disturbed by the telling of the events
          as FLAN is energized.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         136

                         OUISA
           There are so many other people here tonight. We
          didn't mean to take up so much
          MRS. BANNISTER slams her napkin down.

          MRS. BANNISTER
          No! It's my supper and I command you to sing!

                         FLAN
          We called our new best friend, the detective.

                         OUISA
          We told them Paul was at the Waverly theater.
          FLAN (to his dinner partner)
          Sixth Avenue and Third Street. The lobby.

                         OUISA
          But we had promised Paul that we would
          bring him to the police. We told the police he
          was special.

                         FLAN
          Well, Ouisa did.

                          OUISA
          The detective said he'd honor our promise.

                         FLAN
          We skipped the cocktails

                         OUISA
          But we didn't count on

          EXT TRAFFIC ON FIFTH AVENUE
          OUISA and FLAN in dinner clothes are stuck in a traffic jam.

                         OUISA (VO)
          Traffic traffic traffic
          FLAN gets out of the car and looks ahead in this din of
          honking horns.

          EXT WAVERLY MOVIE THEATER, GREENWICH VILLAGE NIGHT
          FLAN and OUISA speed up Sixth Avenue and double park in
          front of the Waverly Movie Theater.
          Two Cop cars are there. Red lights spinning.
          PEOPLE gape on the street.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         137
          THEY see PAUL being dragged into one of the two Cop cars,
          t kicking and screaming.
          THE COPS throw PAUL into the back seat.
          FLAN tries to talk to one of the POLICE while OUISA runs up
          to the Cop car window.
          PAUL, being handcuffed, looks at OUISA. HE smiles as if
          HE's bumped into DUISA at a cocktail party.

                         PAUL
          The Kandinsky is painted on both sides.
          DUISA is startled. THE COP slams the car door on PAUL.

                         OUISA
          Paul? Officer? Let me go with you -
          I promised I'd take him!

                         OFFICER
          Lady. Out of the way --
          FLAN takes OUISA's-arm.

                         OUISA
          We have to do soaething!

                         FLAN

                         
          Let's just get the hell out of here.
          THE COP CAR pulls away, sirens blaring.
          PAUL turns and looks at OUISA. Betrayal.

          BACK IN THE FORMAL DINING ROOM

          MRS. BANNISTER
          There's nothing more you can do -

                         FLAN
          What could we do? We tried.

                         OUISA
          went to the precinct.

          INT THE PRECINCT DAY
          DUISA hands the detective's card to the DESK CLERK.

                         CLERK
          He's transferred.

                         OUISA
          Since yesterday? He's been handling this

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         138

                         CLERK
           He's transferred -

                         OUISA
          This is about an arrest made yesterday at the
          Waverly Movie theater -
          THE CLERK checks the records.

                         CLERK
          This precinct didn't do any business at the
          Waverly Theater.

                         OUISA
          I didn't imagine it -

                         CLERK
          I'm not saying you did.

                         OUISA
          Could you find out which precinct -
          THE CLERK looks through the book.

                         CLERK
          The name?

                         

                         OUISA
          Poitier. He's a young black man. Or maybe
          Kittredge. I don't know the exact name -

                         CLERK
          Are you family?

                         OUISA
          Not exactly. But the detective
          promised me yesterday that I could go with the
          young man when he was arraigned to let them know
          he was special.

                         CLERK
          We have no record of it. Some other precinct
          must have made the arrest. It sounds like your
          special friend was wanted for something else.

                         OUISA
          Like what?

                         CLERK
          Lady, how can I help you? You don't even know
          your friend's name.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         139

                         OUISA
           We can find anybody - Six degrees
          THE CLERK closes the book.

          BACK IN THE FORMAL DINING ROOM

                         OUISA
          We weren't family. We didn't know Paul's name.

          EXT HOGAN PLACE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE DAY

                         OUISA (VO)
          I went to the District Attorney's office.
          we weren't family. We didn't know Paul's name.

          EXT THE CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING

                         OUISA (VO)
          I called the Criminal Courts.
          I wasn't family. I didn't know Paul's name.

          THE FORMAL DINING ROOM

                         OUISA
          You see, I read today that a young man
          committed suicide in Riker's Island.
          Tied a shirt around his neck and hanged
          himself. Was it the pink shirt? This
          burst of color? The pink shirt. Was it Paul?
          We never found out who he was.

                         FLAN
          I'm sure it's not him.

          MRS. BANNISTER
          Yes. I agree. Isn't it amazing.

                         FLAN
          He'll be back. We haven't heard the last of
          him. The imagination. He'll find a way. Could
          we talk about something else? Our guest of
          honor tonight- it's such a pleasure to meet you-
          But.THE GUEST OF HONOR FROM THE UN leans forward.

          THE GUEST OF HONOR
          Why does it mean so much to you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         140

                         OUISA
           He wanted to be us. Everything we are in the
          world, this paltry thing--our life--he wanted
          it. He stabbed himself to get into our lives.
          He envied us. We're not enough to be envied.

                         FLAN
          Like the papers said. We have hearts.

                         OUISA
          Having a heart is not the point. We were hardly
          taken in. We believed him -- for a few hours.
          He did more for us in a few hours than our
          children ever did. He wanted to be your
          child. Don't let that go. He sat out in that
          park and said that man is my father. He's in
          trouble and we don't know how to help him.

                         FLAN
          Help him? He could've killed me. And you.
          THE GUESTS agree.

                         OUISA
          You were attracted to him -

                         
          FLAN throws down his napkin in mock outrage. Almogj mock
          outrage.

                         FLAN
          Cut me out of that pathology! You are
          on your own -

                         OUISA
          Attracted by youth and his talent and the
          embarrassing prospect of being in the movie
          version of Cats. Did you put that in your Times
          piece? And we turn him into anecdote to dine out
          on. Like this. As we are right now. But it was
          an experience. I will not turn him into an
          anecdote. How do we fit what happened to us
          into life without turning it into an anecdote
          with no teeth and a punch line we'll mouth over
          and over for years to come. "Tell the story
          about the imposter who came into our lives---"
          "That reminds me of the time this boy--". And
          we become these human juke boxes spilling out
          these anecdotes. But it was an experience. How
          do we keep the experience?
          OUISA looks around the dinner table.
          THE GUESTS have decided to start on their dinners.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         141
          FLAN (to his Dinner Partner)

                         
          That's why I love paintings. Cezanne. The
          problems he brought up are the problems painters
          are still dealing with. Color. Structure.
          Those are problems.
          OUISA (to herself)
          There is color in my life, but I'm not
          aware of any structure.

                         FLAN
          What are you saying, darling?
          OUISA looks at FLAN clinically. FLAN frowns and turns back
          to his dinner partner brightly.

                         FLAN
          Cezanne would leave blank spaces in his
          canvasses if he couldn't account for the brush
          stroke, give a reason for the color.

                         OUISA
          Then I am a collage of unaccounted-for brush
          strokes. I an all random.
           OUISA stands up from the dinner table.
          Her chair scrapes. There is an embarrassed rush.
          MRS. BANNISTER (an order)
          Sit down.
          OUISA leaves the dinner table.

          THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE FORMAL DINNER PARTY
          OUISA pushes the elevator button.
          FLAN comes into the hall.

                         FLAN
          What kind of behavior is -

                         OUISA
          God, Flan, how much of your life
          can you account for?
          THE ELEVATOR DOOR opens.

                         FLAN
          Do you realize how important this woman is!
          SHE steps in the elevator. FLAN follows.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         142
          THEY descend in silence, not wanting a scene in front of the
          THE OPERATOR. THE ELEVATOR DOOR opens into the lobby.

          INT PARK AVENUE LOBBY NIGHT
          FLAN follows OUISA through the lobby.

                         FLAN
          Are you drunk? What are you unhappy about? The
          Cezanne sale vent through. The Matisse went
          through. We are rich. Geoffrey's rich. Next
          month there's a Bonnard and after that -

                         OUISA
          These are the times I would take a knife and dig
          out your heart. Answer me? How much of your -

                         FLAN
          - life can I account for! All! I am a gambler!
          OUISA smiles at the simplicity of her realization.

                         OUISA
          We're a terrible match.
          OUISA steps out onto

          EXT PARK AVENUE NIGHT
          FLAN (following OUISA)
          She is a very important woman. I am hoping to
          do business! Did you see the paintings on her
          walls! She might want to sell! She
          FLAN glares at HER and turns back into the lobby and returns
          to the party.
          OUSIA moves to follow FLAN, then walks up PARK AVENUE, lost,
          agitated, unsure.
          OUISA walks on, remembering

          THE SISTINE CHAPEL.
          OUISA's hand completes the action.
          OUISA slaps the frescoed ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.
          OUISA slaps the Hand of God!

          OUISA gasps when SHE looks in a SHOP WINDOW
