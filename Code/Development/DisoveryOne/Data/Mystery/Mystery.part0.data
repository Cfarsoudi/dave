     INT.  MIAMI AIRPORT, TERMINAL -- DAY

     Amongst the weary tourist families and solitary businessmen
     sits TOM WELLES, middle-aged, hair neat, suit crisp and
     gray.  He's eating crackers from a cellophane package,
     sipping soda from a paper cup, watching an ARRIVAL GATE.

     AT THE GATE

     PASSENGERS arrive: the paunchy, graying men of First Class
     leading the pack, except for a handsome YOUNG REPUBLICAN
     poster boy hurrying along.

     ACROSS THE TERMINAL

     Welles gets up and FOLLOWS...

     EXT.  MIAMI AIRPORT, CURBSIDE -- DAY

     Welles comes outside, squinting in the sun, moving down the
     sidewalk, looking back over his shoulder...

     The Young Republican is lead to a waiting LIMO by a DRIVER.

     Welles moves to the nearby TAXI STAND...

     INT.  TAXI -- DAY

     Welles gets in, turning in his seat to watch behind.

                             CAB DRIVER
               Where to?

     Welles keeps watching, sees the limo pull away and pass.

                             WELLES
               Follow that limousine.  Don't get
               too close, don't let it get too far
               away.  Just keep with it.

                             CAB DRIVER
               You kidding?

                             WELLES
               Nope.

     The cab set in motion.  Welles takes out cigarettes,
     lighting one, takes out a small NOTEPAD and makes notations.

                             CAB DRIVER
               Uh, listen... you're not supposed to
               be smoking in here.  I'm sorry,
               that's company policy...

                             WELLES
               How about this... every cigarette I
               smoke, I give you five dollars?

                             CAB DRIVER
               Okay... okay, yeah, that'd be good...


     EXT.  MIAMI BEACH, "GOLD COAST" -- DAY

     In front of an Art Deco hotel, the driver opens the
     limousine door and the Young Republican steps out. 

     ACROSS THE STREET 

     Welles watches from inside the double-parked taxicab. 


     EXT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY 

     Not exactly four-star.  "AD LT MOVIES EVERY ROOM." 

     INT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY

     Welles is asleep on the bed, full dressed, hands folded
     across his stomach, snoring lightly, sweaty. 

     INT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE, RESTAURANT -- DAY 

     Welles sits alone at the bar, eating a sandwich, bored.  He
     watches some fuzzy ESPN on the t.v., looks at his watch. 

     EXT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY 

     Welles walks across the parking lot, gets into his RENTAL
     CAR, starts it and drives away. 


     EXT.  MIAMI BEACH DISCOTHEQUE -- NIGHT 

     Young Republican and a GAUDY WOMAN exit the disco, MUSIC
     THROBBING out from the doors behind them.  They join hands,
     drunk, heading to the street, looking for their limo. 

     DOWN THE STREET

     Welles is seated in his parked rental car, raises a CAMERA
     with TELEPHOTO LENS: whir, CLICK, whir, CLICK, whir, CLICK...
     Welles lowers the camera, letting out a yawn. 


     INT.  AIRPLANE, COACH -- NIGHT 

     The familiar DRONE of flight.  Welles is shoehorned into his
     aisle seat, using tiny utensils to eat his tiny meal.

     An OLDER WOMAN arrives in the aisle.  Welles picks up his
     tray, closes his tray table, unbuckling his seatbelt,
     struggling to get up... finally successful, balancing his
     tray, letting the woman in to the window seat. 

                             OLDER WOMAN 
                 Thank you. 

     Welles nods, forcing a smile, sitting back down.  He returns
     to toiling over his miniature supper. 


     EXT.  HARRISBURG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT 

     Welles' AIRPLANE ROARS down with a SCREECH, landing lights
     gleaming.  The airport is small, relatively isolated.

     TITLE:      Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

     INT.  HARRISBURG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT

     Passengers arrive.  Welles is with them, searching the few
     PEOPLE waiting in the terminal hallway.  Welles smiles...

     Welles' wife, AMY, smiles when she sees him.  She's plain
     and pretty, holding one hand on a BABY STROLLER beside her.
     Welles comes to her, embracing her, appreciating her.

                             AMY
                 Welcome home.

                             WELLES
                 Do you know how much I missed you?

     They kiss, but Amy pulls away, sniffs him.

                             AMY 
                 What's this... have you been
                 smoking... ? 

                             WELLES 
                 Smoking?  I'm not smoking. 

                             AMY 
                 Your clothing reeks of it. 

                             WELLES 
                 You know, Amy, I've been sitting
                 around in bars and everywhere
                 following this guy... I mean, is
                 this what I get first thing?  Before
                 you even "hello," you accuse me... ?

                             AMY 
                 I'm not accusing you... 

                             WELLES 
                 Well, I'm not smoking, okay? 

                             AMY 
                 Okay, I believe you. 

                             WELLES 
                 We've been all through that.  I've
                 been on my best behavior.

     Welles bends to the stroller, picks up his infant daughter,
     CINDY, and hoists her in the air, overjoyed. 

                             WELLES 
                 Hello, pumpkin-head, did you miss
                 me?  I sure missed you... 

     He kisses the happy child, holding her in one arm. 

                             WELLES 
                 Let's get my bags and get the hell
                 out of here. 

     Welles pulls Amy close and kisses her again, leads the way.
     Amy follows, pushing the stroller. 

                             AMY 
                 How's the detective business?

                             WELLES 
                 Business was fine.  I'll tell you
                 what, you couldn't pay me enough to
                 live down there. 

                             AMY 
                 You better not be smoking, that's
                 all I can say. 

                             WELLES 
                 Honey, I'm not, please... 

     Amy takes Welles hand, smiling at him. 


     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles and Amy make love in the darkness.  Standard,
     missionary position sex, little passion.  They slow to a
     finish, uneventfully, holding each other.  Their breathing
     quiets.  Their daughter CINDY can be HEARD CRYING elsewhere.

     Welles kisses his wife again, rolls off of her and sits on
     the edge of the bed.  Amy covers herself. 

                             AMY
                 I love you.

                             WELLES
                 I love you. 

     He looks towards her in the dark.  He gets up, gets a towel
     from the bathroom and wraps it around him. 

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BABY'S ROOM -- NIGHT 

     Cindy's crying.  Welles enters, goes to lean into the crib.

                             WELLES 
                 What's all the trouble, Cinderella?
                 What are you crying about, huh? 

     He lifts and cradles Cindy, comforting her. 


     EXT.  HARRISBURG CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING --DAY 

     A small city of moderate architecture facing the Susquehanna.

     INT.  OFFICE -- DAY 

     An old money office with windows over the river.  A well-to-
     do POLITICIAN looks unhappily through PHOTOS on his desk.
     Welles sits by the Pennsylvania state flag, watching.

     PHOTOS show the Young Republican and Gaudy Woman in Miami:
     leaving the Art Deco hotel, the Discotheque, a restaurant...

                             WELLES 
                 Your son-in-law dealt with the dry
                 cleaning franchise during the day,
                 saw that woman every night. 
                       (clears his throat) 
                 The specifics are in the report, and
                 information about the woman.  It's
                 unpleasant, I know.  I apologize... 

                             POLITICIAN 
                 None too discreet, is he? 

                             WELLES 
                 No, sir, he is not. 

                             POLITICIAN 
                 He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn
                 my daughter, but what can you do? 

     The politician shakes his head in disgust.  Welles rises. 

                             WELLES 
                 The um... you'll find my invoice in
                 the envelope. If that's all...

                             POLITICIAN 
                 Yes, Mister Welles, thank you. 

                             WELLES 
                 Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever
                 be of further assistance.

     Welles leaves, glances back, shuts the door. 

     EXT.  HARRISBURG STREETS -- DAY 

     Welles drives his plain Ford past the CAPITAL BUILDING. 

     EXT.  HARRISBURG, BRIDGE -- DAY 

     Welles' car crosses the Susquehanna, leaving the city. 

     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BACKYARD -- DAY 

     Sunny day.  Welles wears tan khakis, T-shirt and fishing
     cap, mowing his lawn with his ROARING lawnmower.  Welles'
     yard is modest, surrounding his modest split level suburban
     one in a neighborhood of similar homes and similar yards.

     Welles turns the lawnmower, stopping to mop his brow.  One
     of his neighbors is repainting a back porch.  The neighbor
     waves.  Welles waves, resumes mowing. 


     INT.  BOWLING ALLEY -- NIGHT

     MUSIC'S LOUD.  League Night.  Every lane full.  Welles is
     with his team in BOWLING SHIRTS.  Welles hoists his ball,
     preparing to bowl.  He takes three steps, releases...

     Down the lane, PINS SCATTER.  One pin remains standing.

     Welles balls up his fists and curses, walks back towards his
     rowdy, mocking teammates.  He shouts back at them, laughing,
     grabbing his beer and drinking, waiting at the ball return. 

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT 

     Dinner.  Welles and Amy eat at the kitchen table with Cindy
     in a high chair.  Amy feeds Cindy between bites.  Welles is
     still in his league shirt. 

                             AMY 
                 You think you'll have time for the
                 water heater this weekend?

                             WELLES 
                 Sure.  I'll call the guy. 

                             AMY 
                 You're not using the same guy who
                 tried to fix it? 

                             WELLES 
                 I'm not using him again for
                 anything.  He was worthless. 
                       (eating)
                 You have bridge here Saturday? 

                             AMY 
                 Betty's out of town so we're playing
                 next week. 

     Welles nods, eating.  He watches Amy feed Cindy.  The PHONE
     starts RINGING.  Welles goes to answer it. 

                             WELLES 
                       (into PHONE) 
                 Hello.  Yes... could you hold on a
                 minute...?

     Welles hands the phone to Amy, pats Cindy's head as he heads
     downstairs, through the LIVING ROOM... 

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles enters his well kept OFFICE, turns on a light at the
     desk.  The room is filled with FILE CABINETS and shelves of
     BOOKS, hundreds of PHONE BOOKS and a COPY MACHINE.  Welles
     picks up the phone and cups the receiver. 

                             WELLES 
                       (shouts upstairs)
                 Okay, I've got it.
                       (into phone)
                 Hello... sorry, I was switching
                 phones.  It's a pleasure to make
                 your acquaintance, Mrs. Christian.
                       (listens)
                 Yes.  Yes, I understand... tomorrow
                 evening should be fine...

     Welles listens, clears space on his desk, taking notes. 


     EXT.  CHRISTIAN COMPOUND -- DUSK 

     A huge OLD WORLD MANSION is situated at the center of acres
     of Pennsylvania forest and vast gardens.  Welles' car heads
     down a long tree lined drive, to the dark mansion. 

     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT 

     Welles follows a BUTLER down a long hall. 

     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, LIBRARY -- NIGHT 

     The butler shows Welles in, shuts the door.
     Towering SHELVES of BOOKS are serviced by ladders.  Far
     across the room, an old, sad woman, MRS. CHRISTIAN, sits
     waiting with a tall, thin, sinister ghoul of a LAWYER.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Mister Welles. You're very prompt.   

                             WELLES 
                 I try to be.

     Welles crosses towards them. It takes a while. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I appreciate your coming on such
                 short notice. 

     Mrs. Christian holds out her hand and Welles takes it. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 This is Mister Longdale, my late
                 husband's attorney. 

     Welles shakes Longdale's limp hand, looking him over. 

                             WELLES 
                 Uh huh, pleasure. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Apparently Mr. Longdale has
                 something he feels he simply must
                 say before you and I speak.

                             LONGDALE 
                 Yes, I do have something to say.  I
                 insisted on being here as soon as I
                 heard Mrs. Christian contacted you. 

                             WELLES 
                 I'm listening. 

                             LONGDALE 
                 As Mr. Christian's attorney and one
                 of the executors of his estate, it
                 concerns me that a meeting of this
                 sort should take place without my
                 being asked to attend. 

                             WELLES
                 Of what sort? 

                             LONGDALE
                 You are a private investigator? 

                             WELLES 
                 That's right. 

                             LONGDALE 
                 Well, whatever reasons Mrs.
                 Christian has for engaging the
                 services of a private investigator,
                 I should certainly be a party to.
                 But, since she feels differently, I
                 can only go on the record as having
                 expressed my adamant disapproval. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Yes, how theatrical.  So you've gone
                 on the record, and now perhaps you
                 should just be gone. 

     Longdale's irritated, but has no choice.  He walks away. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Have a pleasant evening. 
                       (to Welles) 
                 Will you have tea, Mister Welles? 

                             WELLES
                 Thank you. 

     Mrs. Christian begins pouring tea from the service on a
     table.  Welles watches Longdale exit. 

                             WELLES 
                 He's odd.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 He's a lawyer.
                       (offers tea)
                 Please, sit, here...

     Welles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer, taking a seat.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I've spoken to friends of mine and
                 my husband's, in Harrisburg, in
                 Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about
                 you.  I must say you have friends in
                 influential places. 

                             WELLES
                 I've been privileged to provide
                 services for people I admire.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 You are highly recommended.  Praised
                 for your discretion... your strict
                 adherence to confidentiality. 

     Welles nods, sipping tea. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 As you know, my husband passed away
                 recently.  Two weeks ago now.

                             WELLES 
                 My condolences. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 His passing has left me with...
                 something of a dilemma.  A terrible,
                 terrible dilemma. 

                             WELLES 
                 I'll do whatever I can to help. 

     Mrs. Christian studies Welles.

     INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Mrs. Christian and Welles enter.  This office has been lived
     in for a lifetime.  Giant DESK.  AMERICAN FLAG.  Walls
     covered in old b+w PHOTOGRAPHS and ACHIEVEMENTS. A large,
     baked enamel sign nailed up, "CHRISTIAN STEEL." 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 His inner sanctum. 

     Welles looks up at the OIL PAINTING over the fireplace: MR.
     CHRISTIAN, a powerful, old man, posed with a dark, teeming,
     industrial landscape behind him. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Not many people have been inside
                 this room. 

     Welles examines PHOTOS of Mr. Christian visiting various
     STEEL PLANTS, COAL MINES and ground-breaking ceremonies,
     shaking hands with WORKMEN, with POLITICIANS. 


                             WELLES 
                 Pittsburgh? 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Mostly.  That's where he started his
                 empire building.
                       (looks up at portrait)
                 He was a good man.  Notorious as an
                 eccentric, but that was something he
                 cultivated.  He wanted to be
                 legendary.

                             WELLES 
                 He succeeded. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 We were married forty-five years.
                 Hard even for me to imagine.  We had
                 our troubles.  There were plenty of
                 places for him to be other than
                 here, but he was always loyal to me,
                 and I to him.  I loved him deeply.

     Welles waits. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles? 

                             WELLES 
                 I wear a gun when I can tell a
                 client expects me to.  Other than
                 that, there's never any reason. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Just curious. 

     Mrs. Christian crosses to take down a PICTURE, revealing a
     WALL SAFE.  The safe is ajar, burnt and scarred, broken into.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 My husband was the only one with the
                 combination to this safe.  I knew
                 about it, but as far as I was
                 concerned it was none of my
                 business.  Not till now, that is. 

                             WELLES 
                 You hired someone to open it.  I'll
                 bet the lawyer loved that.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 There was nothing he could do.  My
                 husband left everything to me.
                       (looks at safe)
                 I prevented anyone from seeing the
                 contents.  I felt these were my
                 husband's private things.  I
                 didn't... I didn't realize... 

                             WELLES 
                 Do you want to tell me what you
                 found? 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Cash, stock certificates, and this...

     She takes something from her pocket, puts it on the desk: a
     plastic bag containing a short 8MM FILM on a plastic reel.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 It's a film... of a girl being
                 murdered. 

                             WELLES 
                 I'm afraid I don't... 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 This is a movie showing a girl being
                 murdered.  She's sitting on a bed,
                 and a man rapes her... and he begins
                 to cut her with a knife...
                       (pause)
                 I only watched what I could.

     Welles picks up the film, looks at it. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I didn't know what to think.  I
                 can't tell you how horrible it's
                 been, to know this belonged to my
                 husband.  To know that he watched
                 this... this atrocity.  But, I can't
                 go to the police...

                             WELLES
                 Mrs. Christian... please, will you
                 sit down a moment? 
                       (leads her to a chair) 
                 I want you to listen carefully.
                 What you're talking about is a
                 "snuff film."  But, from what I
                 know, snuff films are a kind of...
                 urban myth.  Like, red light
                 district folklore.  There's no such
                 thing, I can assure you. 

     Mrs. Christian shakes her head. 

                             WELLES 
                 Please, believe me.  This is
                 probably a stag film.  Simulated
                 rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might
                 seem real, but there are ways of
                 making it look realistic... fake
                 blood and special effects...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 No. 

                             WELLES 
                 If you were to study it you'd see
                 the camera cutting away... you'd see
                 the tricks they can play...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I'm telling you it's not that. 

                             WELLES 
                 I'm sure it is. 
                       (smiles) 
                 It's probably something your husband
                 was given as a bad joke.  More than
                 likely he never even watched it. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Will you watch it and see for
                 yourself? 

                             WELLES 
                 Of course.  But, I'm certain it's
                 nothing to worry about. 


     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 

     An 8MM PROJECTOR faces a wall.  Welles looks back to Mrs.
     Christian in the doorway.  Mrs. Christian leaves, shuts the
     door.  Darkness.  Welles turns on the projector and sits.
     The PROJECTOR CLATTERS, shooting bright images...

     ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, over exposure, then... the grainy
     FILM is HAND HELD, constantly in motion, showing a skinny
     GIRL, 16 or 17, in a negligee, sitting on a bed in a
     nondescript room with little furniture.  Looks like a hotel
     room.  We only ever see three walls.  The once beautiful
     girl looks worn, drugged, dark circles under her eyes,
     staring blankly.  The CAMERA'S tungsten SPOTLIGHT casts
     long, shifting shadows as the camera moves, but the girl
     still stares oblivious.  The bed is wrapped in PLASTIC and
     DUCT TAPE.  The floor is covered by PLASTIC SHEETING...

     Welles watches, crossing his arms, already uncomfortable.

     ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a
     bathroom, and a MASKED MAN enters.

     The Masked Man wears a garish, Mexican WRESTLING MASK with
     eye holes and a mouth.  The mask covers his entire head.
     He's naked except for red shorts, his body scrawny, oiled,
     pale.  The man goes to stand in front of the girl.  He seems
     to be saying something to her, but the film is silent and
     the ONLY SOUND is the PROJECTOR'S LOUD sprocket hole
     CLATTER.  It's all one long take.  The CAMERA MOVES to favor
     the girl...

     Welles sits straight in his chair, wary.

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man raises his open hand and SLAPS the
     girl, knocking her back on the bed...

     Welles grimaces.

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man pulls the girl back to a seated
     position.  The girl's like a rag doll, face reddened, eyes
     closed, but she remains upright.  Masked Man uses his thumbs
     to open her unseeing eyes.  He touches her mouth with his
     fingers, presses his lips to hers.  Then, Masked Man backs
     away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked
     Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid
     out.  Masked Man runs his fingers over the blades...

     Welles rises slowly, still watching.

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man selects a huge Bowie knife and moves
     back towards the girl...

     Welles crosses his arms tight, disbelieving, fearful.
     WE WILL NEVER SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THE FILM, but Welles
     does.  In the flickering, reflected light, Welles backs
     involuntarily away from the horrible images, holding his
     fist to his mouth, breathing hard.

     Welles keeps backing away, till he's backed against a wall.
     The PROJECTOR'S CLATTERING.  Welles is sickened, sweating,
     still watching, till he finally shuts his eyes.

     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, ADJOINING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Silence.  Mrs. Christian sits waiting, troubled.
     The door to the dining room opens and Welles enters from the
     dark, visibly shaken.  Mrs. Christian watches him, her
     sorrow now shared.

                             WELLES
                 You... you need to go to the police. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I told you I can't, not yet. 

                             WELLES
                 You don't have any other choice. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                       (stands, shakes her head) 
                 No.  For me to live with the ruin of
                 my husband's name, I need know that
                 whoever did this will be punished.
                 If you can find them, I will take
                 their names to the police.  I'll say
                 my husband confessed on his death
                 bed. I'll say I didn't have courage
                 to come forward at first...

                             WELLES 
                 It won't work like that.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Any evidence you collect can be
                 given to the police later,
                 anonymously.  I've thought about it
                 and there's no other way.  If you
                 can't find them... if the only thing
                 that comes from this film is that
                 this is all my husband will be
                 remembered for, well I can't let
                 that happen.  I'm telling you I
                 won't.  If there's no chance that
                 poor girl's memory can be served,
                 then I'll just have to spend my last
                 days trying to forget her. 

     Welles sits, rests his head in his hands. 

                             WELLES 
                 I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate
                 investigations...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 You've found missing persons before. 

                             WELLES 
                 Nothing remotely like this. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I know what I'm asking.  Your
                 compensation will be appropriate to
                 the risk.  You'll need cash to buy
                 information, and I'll provide it.
                       (pause)
                 I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.
                       (pause)
                 You saw what he did to her.

     Welles stands, torn apart and uncertain, looks back to the
     dining room where the projector sits idle.


     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BABY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Cindy is sound asleep in her crib.
     Welles is seated near, staring at his sleeping child.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles digs in piles of SHOEBOXES and BOOKS on the floor of
     his cluttered closet, finds what he wants: a LOCK BOX.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Welles twists the lock box dial's combination, opens the box
     to reveal his GUN, HOLSTER and CLEANING SUPPLIES.  Welles
     takes out the gun, cleaning it.  Amy watches.

                             WELLES 
                 This is the mortgage.  This is
                 Cindy's college money. 

                             AMY
                 I understand.

                             WELLES 
                 Sometimes you can't know what I'm
                 doing.  It's better that way.

                             AMY
                 I know.

                             WELLES 
                 It's a missing persons case... a
                 long shot.  I'll give it two months,
                 two months at most, then I'll be
                 back.  We'll take a vacation.

                             AMY
                 Why the gun? 

                             WELLES 
                 I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even
                 wear it.  It's a precaution.
                       (cleaning gun)
                 Don't worry about me.


     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles looks through one file cabinet.  He pulls out a FILE.
     It contains all sorts of POLICE ARTIST SKETCHES.  Welles
     finds one of a TEENAGE GIRL with dark hair, looks at it.

     Welles positions the sketch on his COPY MACHINE, hits copy.

     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE, DRIVEWAY -- MORNING

     Welles loads BOXES and a SUITCASE into his car's back seat.

     Welles puts the lock box in the car's trunk, in a hiding
     place beside the spare tire.  He places a brown BRIEFCASE on
     top, covers them both with carpet.  He closes the trunk.

     EXT.  PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE -- MORNING 

     Little traffic.  Welles' Ford races down the highway.


     EXT.  CLEVELAND CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

     City skyline, overcast.  Looks like rain.

     TITLE:       Cleveland, Ohio

     EXT.  CLEVELAND STREETS -- DAY

     Welles' car moves slowly in a not-so-great neighborhood.
     Welles leans forward, peering through the windshield...

     An APARTMENT BUILDING'S crooked SIGN lists "WEEKLY RATES."

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM, CLEVELAND -- DAY

     Dingy room.  Welles locks the door, puts the chain on. His
     suitcase and boxes are on the bed.  He begins unpacking,
     taking a PHOTO ENLARGER from one box and an 8MM PROJECTOR.

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM, BATHROOM -- DAY

     The developer's on the toilet.  DEVELOPING PANS are on the
     floor, developer bath, stop bath and fixing bath, with
     BOTTLES of CHEMICALS and packages of PHOTO PAPER.  Welles
     uses tape and ALUMINUM FOIL to black-out a window.

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- DAY

     Pizza box on the bedside table.  Welles' suits hang in the
     closet.  Welles sits facing a small REEL TO REEL on a desk.
     He wears white gloves, handles the 8MM FILM, careful to hold
     it by the edges, holding it up to the light, squinting.

     Welles puts in a magnifying EYEPIECE, leaning close...

     WELLES' P.O.V. THROUGH MAGNIFYING LENS: studying the first
     few inches of exposed film, coming upon TINY LETTERS printed
     just below the sprocket holes: "SUPRAlux 544."
 
     INT.  WELLES' ROOM, BATHROOM -- DAY

     RED BULB in the light socket.  Welles threads the 8MM FILM
     into his enlarger, still in white gloves.

     He flicks the enlarger on, projecting a sideways IMAGE down
     onto the enlarger's baseboard, FOCUSING... it's the girl
     sitting on the bed, early in the snuff film.

     Welles makes an adjustment to the enlarger's lens; framing
     tighter on the girl's face, REFOCUSING.

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles comes out of the makeshift darkroom, holding a PHOTO
     of the girl.  He props the photo up on a dresser, stands
     looking at it.  Sad girl, staring forward.

     Welles goes to pick up his CELLULAR PHONE, dials.

                             WELLES 
                       (into phone) 
                 Hello, honey, it's me.
                       (listens)
                 I'm fine, how are you?

     Welles listens.  He turns to look at the girl's photo.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE -- DAY

     Nondescript.  "U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons."

     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, OFFICES -- DAY 

     Small.  Cubicles.  Employees work phones and computers.
     BULLETIN BOARDS are covered in FAMILY PHOTOS, Polaroids and
     familiar "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?" missing person/children POSTERS.

     IN ONE CUBICLE, Welles opens his billfold, shows his
     identification: a laminated "LICENSED INVESTIGATOR,
     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania", with WELLES' PHOTO...

     The DIRECTOR of the center, a tired looking official in
     bifocals, studies the card.  Welles sits.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?

                             WELLES 
                 Call me Tom.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Alright, Tom.

                             WELLES
                 What I'd like, very simply, is
                 access to your archive.  And, now I
                 understand this isn't something you
                 normally do for private citizens...

                             DIRECTOR 
                 There are reasons for the way we do
                 things here.

                             WELLES 
                 Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by
                 whatever decision you make, but I'd
                 appreciate if you'll hear me out... 

     The director sits back in his chair.

                             WELLES 
                 Few days ago, I was contacted by a
                 couple living in Philadelphia, a
                 doctor and his wife.  What happened
                 was they picked up a young girl
                 hitchhiking off 81, which heads into
                 Philadelphia, started up a
                 conversation with this girl, she
                 looked homeless, seemed about
                 eighteen maybe.  They convinced her
                 to let them buy her a meal in the
                 city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have
                 much to say, but they got a sense
                 she's a runaway, so all through
                 dinner the doctor's working on her,
                 trying to convince her that at the
                 very least she should pick up a
                 telephone.  Not surprisingly, she
                 ate her food, excused herself...
                       (snaps fingers)
                 That's the last they saw her.  The
                 reason they came to me for help, the
                 reason I'm coming to you, is we had
                 a friend of mine in the department
                 work up a sketch...
                       (shows the POLICE ARTIST
                        SKETCH he photocopied)
                 They want to see if I can I.D. this
                 girl, somehow pass along a message
                 to let the parents know the kid's
                 alive, doing alright.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or
                 N.C.M.E.C.? 

                             WELLES 
                 I figured you share information. 

                             DIRECTOR 
                 We do. 

                             WELLES 
                 For whatever reasons I thought you
                 might be more receptive.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Why don't they come to me? 

                             WELLES 
                 This doctor and wife, they're nice
                 people, but they don't want to get
                 too involved.  They're not trying to
                 have the parents come looking for
                 the girl either. 
                 You and I both know sometimes, not
                 often, but sometimes there's real
                 reasons why a kid'll run. 
                 Molestation, whatever.  Besides
                 that, the girl's probably eighteen,
                 so she's legal.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 I'm not so sure about this. 

                             WELLES 
                 They're putting themselves in place
                 of this kid's parents and thinking
                 they'd want to hear their girl's
                 okay, even if that's all they hear. 

                             DIRECTOR
                 I can give you my card, if your
                 clients want to call me... 

     Welles accepts a CARD, disappointed.

                             WELLES 
                 They were pretty clear they didn't
                 want this coming back on them.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry. 

     Welles looks at the director, stands, hangs his head.

                             WELLES 
                 Who knows... maybe she's already
                 given her parents a call, right?

     Welles leaves. 

     EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE -- DAY

     Welles comes out the front doors, pissed.

                             WELLES 
                 Fuck.

     He tears the card in half and drops it as he heads for his
     car.  After a moment, the director comes out after him...

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Excuse me... Tom, hold on...

     Welles looks back, walks back, glances down...
     makes sure he stands on the torn card, hiding it underfoot.

                             DIRECTOR
                 Listen, maybe I can help after all.
                 Why don't you come on back in...
                 we'll see what we can do. 

     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY

     Director leads Welles into this RESEARCH ROOM, a small
     library with long tables, old COMPUTERS, lots of FILE
     CABINETS and CARD CATALOGS.  Secretaries tend to the files.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 This is it.  It's not much. 
                       (points at computers) 
                 We've got less than five percent on
                 computer and we lose that funding in
                 December.  I'll have someone show it
                 to you anyway.  Other than that, I'm
                 afraid it's the wet thumb method.

     Welles looks to the many, many file drawers. 

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Files are mostly by state and year
                 of disappearance.  We try to keep
                 the children and adults separate.
                 No eating or smoking in here, but
                 there's a coffee machine in the hall.

                             WELLES 
                 Any good?

                             DIRECTOR
                 It's horrible, but it'll be your
                 best friend after a few days.  I
                 hope you realize what kind of long
                 shot you're chasing after. 

                             WELLES
                 You're gonna be seeing a lot of me.
                 You're sure you don't mind?

                             DIRECTOR 
                 It's good what you're doing.

     The director puts out his hand.  Welles looks, shakes.


     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     ON A COMPUTER SCREEN: files open and close -- PICTURE after
     PICTURE of a MISSING CHILDREN, mostly teenagers, each with
     physical description, age, date of disappearance, etc.  Lost
     souls, although these are posed portraits, high school
     yearbook photos and vacation photos, so the children are
     mostly smiling, happy and healthy. But, all "MISSING."

     Welles works the computer keyboard and mouse...

     ON THE SCREEN: the FACES of TEENAGERS, boys and girls, one
     after the other, MISSING... MISSING... MISSING...


     INT.  CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles searches the SHELVES of the LIBRARY.  He begins
     taking down various books...

     "Motion Picture Photography."  "Film Stocks and Physical
     Characteristics."  "Super 8 Filmmaking."

     INT.  CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- LATER -- MONTAGE

     In Welles' notepad: "SUPRAlux 544."
     Welles sits paging through technical photography books. 


     INT. WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded through the projector.  He
     turns the CLATTERING projector on and sits, watching.

     ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, then... the skinny GIRL in a
     negligee, sitting on the bed.  The CAMERA'S SPOTLIGHT casts
     long shadows.  The girl stares, oblivious...

     ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a
     bathroom, and the MASKED MAN enters, wearing the ghastly
     WRESTLING MASK.  The man goes to stand in front of the
     girl.  He seems to be saying something.  The FILM halts.

     Welles sits forward, hand on the projector.  He's seen
     something.  He PLAYS the FILM in REVERSE...

     ON THE WALL: the Masked Man walks backwards, away from the
     girl, backwards into the bathroom, door shutting...

     Welles stops the projector, not taking his eyes from the
     image.  He ADVANCES the film FRAME BY FRAME...

     FRAME BY FRAME... as the bathroom door opens, and the Masked
     Man enters... FRAME BY FRAME... as the Masked Man moves
     forward... door closing behind him... STOP...

     FREEZE FRAME: a THIRD MAN is reflected in the bathroom
     mirror.  Grainy and blurred, but he's in the room with the
     girl, standing there, captured in the mirror in this one
     brief instant just before the bathroom door closes.

     Welles walks to take a closer look, studying the almost
     ethereal image of the Third Man.


     EXT.  CLEVELAND STREET CORNER -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles is in a PHONE BOOTH, feeds many quarters into the
     phone, waiting, looking at his notepad. 

                             WELLES
                       (into PHONE) 
                 Hello, Mrs. Christian?  Tom Welles.
                 Here's where we stand.  I checked
                 the film stock and it's called Supra-
                 lux 544.  The company that made that
                 stock discontinued it in '92...
                       (listens)
                 Yeah, about five or six years ago.
                 Anyway, do what you can to dig up
                 your husband's old financial
                 records, look for anything out of
                 the ordinary...

     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles is back at the computer, alone, drinking coffee.
     ON THE COMPUTER: endless PHOTOS of MISSING CHILDREN.
     The PHONE CALL CONTINUES in VOICE OVER:

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 Nobody really uses eight millimeter
                 film anymore, so we can assume there
                 are reasons our guys did.  First,
                 they could develop it themselves if
                 they had any sort of expertise.
                 Obviously, this isn't the kind of
                 movie you can just drop off at the
                 one-hour photo...

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles just stands, staring at the PHOTO of the GIRL.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 Second, the film that went through
                 the camera is what we've got.
                 There's no negative.  Unlike video,
                 it wasn't meant to be duplicated.
                 No reason for them to risk having
                 more than one copy of their murder
                 floating around...

     INT.  CLEVELAND BAR -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Local bar.  Welles sits drinking with the archive's
     director, talking, smiling at something the director said.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 There don't seen to be many
                 fingerprints on the film itself, but
                 I'm going to have to be careful to
                 leave them intact...

     INT.  MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles is tired, unshaven.  He's moved on to the physical
     files, at one table, looking through HUNDREDS of MISSING
     PERSON BULLETINS.  Secretaries tend to other files. 

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 It's okay for yours and your
                 husbands fingerprints to be on the
                 film, but you'll have to use me as
                 a middleman if you go to the police.
                 That way I don't have to explain why
                 my prints are on it...

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles sits with the PROJECTOR ON, watching the film again.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 There were three men.  Two are
                 obvious; the man in the mask and the
                 man running the camera, but I caught
                 a glimpse of a third man in a
                 mirror.  It's nothing that can be
                 used for identification, but he was
                 there, watching...

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man touches the girl's mouth, presses
     his lips to hers.  Masked Man backs away, leaving frame,
     till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked Man standing at a table
     with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid out...

     Welles notices something, puts the projector on FREEZE FRAME.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 So, there were three.  They would
                 have kept it small, wouldn't have
                 let anyone in on it they didn't have
                 to.  That's all for now... except,
                 I feel I should tell you... with
                 this looking like it happened at
                 least five or six years ago...

     Welles walks to the frozen IMAGE on the wall.  It shows the
     Masked Man's hands in frame, fingering the blades.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 Well, it's not very likely we'll
                 ever find out who this girl was. 
                       (listens) 
                 I will, I'll keep trying. Goodbye.

     V.O. PHONE CALL ends with the SOUND of the PHONE HANGING UP.

     ON THE WALL: there's a DARK SPOT on Masked Man's hand, on
     the arch between his index finger and thumb.  Grainy and
     hard to make out, but looks like a small TATTOO.

     INT.  WELLES ROOM, BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- END MONTAGE

     Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded into his photo enlarger,
     projecting the IMAGE we just saw down onto the baseboard.

     He re-frames, CLOSER ON the masked Man's hand, REFOCUSING...
     the black spot is a little clearer, looks like a small STAR
     tattoo on the back of Masked Man's hand.

     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY

     Welles sits hunched over the card catalog, still unshaven,
     drinking coffee, flipping through smaller PICTURES of
     MISSING CHILDREN in one drawer, one by one by one...

     Welles rolls his neck.  He looks to see the archive's
     director in the doorway.  The director nods, leaving.
     Welles gets back to it, stooped over the catalog.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     TITLE CARD:      three weeks later

     EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE -- DAY

     In the lot, Welles gets wearily from his car, smoking.  He
     tosses the cigarette, gets a Thermos off the front seat.

     INT.  MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY

     Welles pulls out a card catalog drawer labeled "North
     Carolina 1992," flipping through picture cards.  The FACES
     of TEENAGERS: a happy BOY with blue eyes... a red headed
     GIRL with freckles... a ruddy faced BOY... a pretty GIRL
     with a ribbon in her hair... a black GIRL in a pink dress...
     a blonde haired BOY with curly hair...

     Welles furrows his brow.

     He backtracks to the pretty GIRL with the ribbon in her hair.

     Welles sits straight.  He reaches into his pocket, hands
     shaking a little, takes out and unfolds the PHOTO he printed
     of the girl from the snuff film.  It's her.

     Welles compares the two pictures.  She's prettier in the
     card catalog photo, but it's her.

     Welles can't believe it, looks around.  Secretaries at other
     files don't even know he's there.  Welles pulls out his
     notepad, scribbling down INFORMATION off the card...

     Writing the girl's name: "Mary Anne Matthews."


     EXT.  INTERSTATE HIGHWAY -- NIGHT

     Welles, car races past, alone on the dark freeway.

     Suburban library.  Kids play hop-scotch in the parking lot.

     INT.  FAYETTEVILLE LIBRARY, MICROFICHE ROOM -- DAY

     Welles works the MICROFICHE MACHINE, scrolling through old
     issues of the LOCAL NEWSPAPER, finds an ARTICLE headlined
     "Search Continues for Local Teen."

     There's a PICTURE of the GIRL, Mary Anne Mathews; the same
     picture Welles found in the Missing Person Archive.

     Welles reads the article, writing on a LEGAL PAD.

     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, FAYETTEVILLE SUBURB -- DAY

     A tree-lined street of poor, boxy homes.  Welles' car parks
     in front of one HOUSE with a neglected lawn.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles, clean shaven, picks a CLIPBOARD with a file folder
     and his legal pad on it, thumbs pages.  He drums his
     fingers, opens the glove compartment, pulls out the car's
     registration, other papers and "Jiffy-Lube" service reports,
     uses them to pad the file.

     Welles takes a BOTTLE of COLOGNE from his pocket.  He
     considers it, opens the bottle, applies cologne to his neck.

     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- DAY

     Welles knocks, clipboard in hand.  A sad, middle-aged woman
     answers, MRS. MATHEWS, looking through the screen door.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Yes... ?

                             WELLES
                       (smiles)
                 Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's
                 Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed
                 investigator...

     Welles holds up his identification only long enough for Mrs.
     Mathews to see it looks official.

                             WELLES
                 I've been hired as an independent
                 contractor by the U.S. Resource
                 Center for Missing Persons as part
                 of an internal audit.  If you have
                 any time over the next few days, I'd
                 like to make an appointment to ask
                 some questions about the
                 disappearance of your daughter.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I don't understand, who are... ?

                             WELLES
                 I'm sorry, let me explain, the
                 R.C.M.P. is a support organization
                 and archive, not unlike the Center
                 for Missing and Exploited Children
                 in Washington.  I'm sure you've
                 dealt with them before?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Yes, but... 

                             WELLES 
                 These volunteer organizations are
                 sort of interconnected, functioning
                 hand in hand with law enforcement.
                 The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review
                 their investigations...
                       (holds up clipboard)
                 ... fact-check their records, see if
                 there's anything they missed,
                 anything they should be doing
                 different.  I'm here for a few days,
                 before I head back up to Virginia.
                 These reports go to the Justice
                 Department eventually.  I spoke to
                 your F.B.I. contact a few days ago,
                 uh...

     Welles pretends to look for the name on a Jiffy Lube page...

                             WELLES 
                 What was the name... ? I've got it
                 here somewhere...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Neil... Neil Cole.

                             WELLES
                       (pretends he found it)
                 Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call
                 and let you know to expect me.  He
                 didn't call?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No.

                             WELLES
                       (looking on legal pad)
                 Well, I'm following up on your
                 daughter, Mary, height; five four,
                 weight; hundred ten pounds, brown
                 eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24,
                 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A
                 runaway, that's how she's listed.
                 Is this information correct... ?

     Mrs. Mathews stares, nods.

                             WELLES
                 I'm sorry, I know this isn't easy.
                 Is there a more convenient time... ?
                       (looks at watch)
                 Can I buy you lunch, would that be
                 alright?

     Mrs. Mathews looks him up and down.


     EXT.  DAIRY QUEEN RESTAURANT -- DAY

     Welles and Mrs. Mathews eat at a PICNIC TABLE on the patio.

                             WELLES
                 It's very important you don't let
                 this raise your expectations.  It's
                 not going to effect any ongoing
                 efforts.  All I'm saying is, please
                 know, I'm not here to create any
                 false hope.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 They hired you.  You're like, a
                 private detective?

                             WELLES
                 That's exactly what I am.

     Mrs. Mathews chews, staring off into the distance.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I didn't think there were private
                 detectives anymore, except on TV.

                             WELLES
                 You probably expect me to be wearing
                 a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking
                 whiskey, chasing women and getting
                 beaten up by guys with broken noses.
                 Want to know what it's really like? 
                 It's sitting in a car and staring at
                 a hotel window for three days
                 straight, pissing in a plastic
                 bottle, pardon me, because some guy
                 thinks his wife's cheating on him.
                 Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who
                 hired you, he has a hair-lip,
                 dandruff and crooked teeth, and you
                 could have told him the minute you
                 laid eyes on him his wife's
                 cheating, and you don't blame her.

     Mrs. Mathews smiles.

                             WELLES
                 It's refreshing to actually sit down
                 and meet someone face to face,
                 someone nice like you.

     Welles smiles.  Mrs. Mathews takes out a cigarette.  Welles
     lights her, joins her in smoking, refers to his clipboard.

                             WELLES
                 So, she didn't leave a note?  She
                 never gave any indication where she
                 might go, before she left?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No.

                             WELLES
                 She just seemed... depressed... ?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 She didn't seem herself.  For months
                 there never was any way to get her
                 to talk about it.  One night we went
                 to bed... the next morning she was
                 gone.  She took some clothes.

                             WELLES
                 What was she running from?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I don't know.

                             WELLES
                 If there's anything you feel
                 uncomfortable talking about, tell
                 me, but I have to ask.  Your
                 husband... he committed suicide?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Yes.

                             WELLES
                 September 4th, 1993.  About a year
                 after Mary disappeared.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 We were divorced by then.  Things
                 fell apart... he was living with a
                 friend...

                             WELLES
                 Why do you think he did it?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 It got to be too much for him.

                             WELLES
                 You have to forgive me, but in these
                 circumstances... with your
                 daughter...
                       (pause)
                 Were there any indications of... any
                 sort of abuse?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 There wasn't anything like that.
                 The police and the FBI people asked,
                 but there wasn't anything happened
                 like that, never.  My husband... his
                 heart broke when Mary left...

                             WELLES
                 I didn't mean to...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 You try going through what we did.
                 Bob couldn't take it, that's all.
                 Christ, there's times when it still
                 seems like I can't either.

                             WELLES
                 I had to ask.  I apologize.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No one knows what it's like.  You
                 can't even imagine how much it hurts. 

     Welles is miserable.  A few CUSTOMERS walk past, looking at
     Mrs. Mathews.  She tries not to notice then noticing.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 People remember me from the news.
                       (pause)
                 Can you drive me back now?

                             WELLES
                 Of course. 


     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, MARY'S ROOM -- DAY

     Mrs. Mathews enters.  Welles follows. 

     This was the girl's room, exactly as she left it -- POSTERS
     of ACTORS on the wall, many STUFFED ANIMALS on the pink
     sheets of the carefully made bed.  Perfectly preserved.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 This is her room.

     Welles looks around, uncomfortable.
     Shelves have PICTURES of MARY with female friends, a
     collection of CERAMIC FIGURINES of CLOWNS and ANIMALS.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 The police made a wreck of it, but
                 I put it back exactly how it was.
                 Just how she likes it.

     Welles takes a few steps into the room, looks down at a DESK
     where there are SIX brightly wrapped GIFTS.

                             MRS MATHEWS

                 Those are for her birthday.  One for
                 every year she's missed.  They'll be
                 waiting for her when she comes back. 

     Welles is nearly overwhelmed by sadness, struggling to hide
     it.  He backs to the door, looks at his watch...

                             WELLES
                 I... I shouldn't take anymore of
                 your time.  Maybe we can finish
                 tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Okay.

     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- DAY

     Welles escapes to his car, climbing in.  He starts it up...

     IN THE CAR

     Welles drives, tears welling up in his eyes.  He has to pull
     over and park, wiping his tears, fighting for composure.


     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles has unpacked.  He's on the bed, on his CELLULAR...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 You should be able to take a shower
                 and still have hot water left, honey.
                       (listens)
                 Call him back and tell him I said
                 so.  The goddamn thing's still under
                 warranty.
                       (listens)
                 I'm okay.  It's hard here.  It's
                 hard.
                       (listens)
                 I've got a lead I have to follow
                 through.  To be honest, I don't
                 think I'm going to get very far.
                 I miss you.  I love you.


     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING

     Welles sits at the kitchen table.  Mrs. Mathews makes
     coffee.  The home's decor is cheap and flowery.

                             MRS MATHEWS 
                 We weren't religious.  We never
                 forced religion down her throat,
                 like I've seen some parents do to
                 their kids.  We never made her go to
                 church.  But, after Mary was gone,
                 that's when I got religious.

     Mrs. Mathews brings two cups of coffee, sits.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Doesn't make much sense, does it?
                 When everything's happy, when life's
                 fine and you have every reason to
                 believe there's a God, you don't
                 bother.  Then, something horrible
                 happens... that's when you start
                 praying all the time.  That's when
                 you start going to church.

                             WELLES
                 We're all like that.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Are you religious?

                             WELLES
                 No.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 You should be.

     Mrs. Mathews drinks coffee, stares into the cup.

                             WELLES
                 I've got what I need for my report.
                 There is... there is one thing that
                 bothers me though.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 What? 

                             WELLES
                 It's not really my place, but it's
                 not easy for me to set aside the
                 private detective part of me either.
                 See, I know a little about missing
                 persons.  When kids run, they almost
                 always leave a note.  It's guilt.
                 They want to say goodbye.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 There wasn't one.  The police looked.

                             WELLES
                 Do you think the police did a good
                 job?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I don't know.  I think so.

                             WELLES
                 It is possible... and I know this
                 isn't something you want to hear.
                 Your daughter may have tried to hide
                 a note where she thought you would
                 eventually find it, but where she
                 knew your husband would never find
                 it.  She might have wanted to tell
                 you something...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No.  You don't have any reason to
                 think that...

                             WELLES
                 If the police focused their search
                 in her room, her belongings, well
                 that'd be only natural, but they may
                 have been looking in the wrong place.

     Mrs. Mathews is getting upset.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 How... how can you say that to me...?

                             WELLES
                 Will you let me look?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 My husband never laid a hand on her.
                 She would have told me... she would
                 have told me...

                             WELLES 
                 You're probably right, and I
                 probably won't find anything.
                 I don't have a right to ask this,
                 and you can kick me out of your
                 house if you want, but this is my
                 profession and there's a part of me
                 that can't let it go.  Police are
                 just as human as you or I.  They
                 could have missed something.  They
                 probably didn't.
                       (pause)
                 Wouldn't you rather know?

     Mrs. Mathews thinks about it, tortured, shakes her head sadly.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Go ahead and look if you want.  I
                 don't care what you do.

     Mrs. Mathews gets up and walks out of the room.


     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- SEARCH MONTAGE -- DAY

     -In MRS. MATHEWS' BEDROOM, Welles looks through DRESSER
      drawers, methodically, replacing everything as it was...
      searches hat boxes and shoe boxes in a CLOSET... takes
      BOOKS off SHELVES, fanning the pages, shaking them out...

     -In a BATHROOM, Welles examines the contents of a MEDICINE
      CABINET, examining old prescription bottles... opens
      CABINETS under the sink...

     -In the LIVING ROOM, Mrs. Mathews sits slumped in a chair,
      staring at a soap opera on TELEVISION, a BOTTLE of scotch
      on TV tray beside her, drink in hand.

     -In the KITCHEN, Welles stands on a chair, searches high
      CABINETS... looks through low CABINETS, on his knees, pulls
      out pots and pans... fans the pages of COOK BOOKS...

     -Welles stands in the doorway of MARY'S ROOM, just stares.
      He takes a few steps back into the HALLWAY, looks up at the
      ceiling.  There's an ATTIC DOOR there.  Welles reaches to
      the door's handle, opens it, unfolds the portable stairs...

      -In the small ATTIC, Welles uses a penlight FLASHLIGHT,
      crouched under the low ceiling, looking through dusty BOXES
      of PHOTOGRAPHS; old photos of a wedding, of grandparents...
      Welles moves to pull back dusty sheets, finds a large
      WICKER BASKET and broken BICYCLE underneath...

      Welles opens the basket, takes out BLANKETS and QUILTS
      in mothballs.  He finds a wide VELVET BOX, takes it out,
      opens its hinged lid to reveal a set of good SILVERWARE.
      He touches the tarnished silverware, lifts out the top tray.
      Underneath, resting on top of more silverware, is a DIARY.

      Welles opens the DIARY, finds written: "Mary Anne Mathews."

      Welles turns pages.  The DIARY'S about half-full of
      feminine, cursive handwriting.  After the last written
      page, a PAGE has been TORN OUT.  Welles fingers the ragged
      edge, flips through the blank pages till he comes to the
      very last page, a GOODBYE NOTE.  Welles sits and reads...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (emotionless monotone)
                 "Dear mom.  If you're reading this,
                 it means I called you from
                 Hollywood, California and told you
                 where to find my diary.  I don't
                 think I'll be able to tell you this
                 when I talk to you, so I'm writing
                 it down here.  You know I haven't
                 been happy for a long, long time.
                 For a long time now dad's been doing
                 things I couldn't tell you.  He's
                 been touching me and it's getting
                 worse.  I can't stay anymore.  I
                 know you and I haven't always gotten
                 along sometimes, but please don't
                 blame yourself.  There isn't
                 anything you can do.  I'm going to
                 make a whole new life in California.
                 Maybe someday you'll see me on TV or
                 in magazines.  Don't worry about me.
                 Love, Mary Anne."

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, HALLWAY OUTSIDE MARY'S ROOM -- DAY

     Welles shuts the attic door, takes the DIARY from his
     pocket, hides it in his waistband at the small of his back.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles enters.  Mrs. Mathews looks up from the TV.

                             WELLES
                 You were right.
                       (pause)
                 I didn't find anything.  I'm going
                 to run and get something to eat.
                 Are you hungry?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Yes.


     INT.  COPY SHOP -- LATE DAY

     Welles uses a self-serve COPY MACHINE, flattening the DIARY
     on the glass, photocopying the DIARY as quickly as he can.


     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles sits picking at fast food in front of him.  Mrs.
     Mathews' food isn't even unwrapped. 

     She's numb from her drink, watching a GAME SHOW, smoking. 

                             WELLES
                 Do you ever consider... do you
                 realize that Mary may never come
                 back?

     Mrs. Mathews looks to Welles, looks back at the TV.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I think about it everyday.  But,
                 every time the phone rings... every
                 single time, I still think it's her.

                             WELLES
                 It's been six years.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 What am I supposed to do?  Forget
                 her?  Time heals all wounds, right?
                       (misery building)
                 She's all I think about, and I've
                 learned to live with that.  But, you
                 want the truth... the real truth?
                 If I had a choice... if I had to
                 choose, between her being out there,
                 living a good life and being happy,
                 and me not knowing; never finding
                 out what happened to her...
                       (pause)
                 ... or her being dead and me
                 knowing...
                       (pause)
                 I'd choose to know.

     Mrs. Mathews stares into the TV, wipes tears.
     Welles takes a deep breath and holds it.  He watches her a
     long moment, motionless.  Finally he stands, voice unsteady.

                             WELLES
                 Excuse me, I have to use your
                 bathroom.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, HALLWAY OUTSIDE MARY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles comes to the attic door, quietly pulls it open.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, ATTIC -- NIGHT

     Welles uses his penlight, digs out the DIARY from the hiding
     place in his waistband, replaces it in the box of
     silverware, closes the box.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, MARY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles enters, takes a PICTURE FRAME off one shelf, opens
     the back and takes out the PHOTO of MARY from inside.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Mrs. Mathews still gazes into the TV.  Welles passes the
     doorway, not looking in, heading to the front door, opening
     the door and walking out...

     Mrs. Mathews doesn't even notice, doesn't look up.

     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Welles crosses the front lawn, not looking back, heading to
     the street, getting into his car, starting his car, doing a
     U-turn, driving away down the street.


     EXT.  FAYETTEVILLE AIRPORT, LONG TERM PARKING -- MORNING

     Welles' boxes of belongings are piled in the back seat of
     his car.  Welles covers them with a blanket, shuts the door.

     Welles opens the trunk of his car, pulls back the carpeting.
     He opens the brown BRIEFCASE.  The briefcase is full of
     CASH, about $10,000, twenties and fifties in bundles.

     Welles transfers half the money into a carry-on bag, shuts
     the briefcase, covers it, closes the trunk.


     INT.  AIRPLANE, COACH -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     The cabin's half-full, dark.  Passengers sleep.  Under the
     only illuminated reading light, Welles reads the PHOTOCOPIED
     DIARY.  MARY'S VOICE is a again a flat monotone...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (as Welles reads)
                 "Dear diary.  I have a big math test
                 tomorrow.  I have to get better
                 grades.  How come everybody does
                 better than me?  Kathy doesn't even
                 study and she gets B's.  Two boys
                 got in a fight after school today.
                 One boy knocked the other boy's
                 tooth out, at least that's what it
                 looked like.  His nose and mouth
                 were bleeding all over the place..."

     INT.  HOLLYWOOD HOTEL -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles' suitcase is open on the bed.  Welles sits in a chair
     with his feet up, sweating in the heat, reading the DIARY.

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (as Welles reads)
                 "... We're reading The Great Gatsby
                 in English class.  It's the story of
                 this guy who has lots of fancy
                 parties and all his friends come
                 around and party with him, but later
                 when he dies nobody comes to his
                 funeral.  Someone said there's a
                 movie about it, but I looked in the
                 video store and it wasn't there."

     Welles flips pages, further back in the DIARY...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (as Welles reads)
                 "Dear diary.  I started my first job
                 last week working part time at Price
                 Mart department store..."

                 old and fat.  All they live for is

                 smoke..."

                 "... They eat lunch at the snack
                 counter.  Hot dogs and soft
                 pretzels.  Nachos with that orange
                 cheese that comes out of a pump.  I
                 don't know what I'd do if I'm still

                 actress.  I know it's a stupid
                 dream, but I know I can do it if I
                 get a chance..."

                 "... Everyone's always telling me
                 how pretty I am.  I don't think I
                 am.  When I look in the mirror I

                 "... She said she liked it, but she
                 didn't seem too happy.  She didn't

                 I don't think mom wants to let me
                 go.  Every time I try to talk about

                 she changes the subject."

     EXT.  CHURCH, SOUP KITCHEN -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     A long line of HOMELESS PERSONS trails out the door.  Welles

                 happened today when dad and I were
                 alone.  I can't tell anyone.  I feel
                 sick.  What did I ever do to make
                 this happen to me?"

     The volunteer and priest can't help.  Welles is weary,
     futility beginning to wear on him, walks to his car...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "Dear diary.  My stomach hurts all
                 the time.  I just want to go to
                 sleep and never wake up.  I want to
                 get out of my head and stop hearing
                 myself think."

                 visit her in the hospital.
                 Hospitals smell like dead people."

     EXT.  FREEWAY -- HELICOPTER SHOT -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     FOLLOW Welles' car speeding along...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "Dear diary.  It's happening all the
                 time now.  There s nothing I can do.
                 I'm all alone.  Everything is bad.
                 I used to have lots of dreams and
                 I'd remember them when I woke up,
                 but that doesn't happen anymore."

     PULL BACK: still FOLLOWING WELLES' CAR, over the FREEWAY...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "Dear diary.  If I can get to
                 California, I'll be okay.  I've got
                 money saved.  I can work as a
                 waitress till I get something
                 better.  Billy says he and his
                 family went to California once on
                 vacation.  He says it never rains.
                 They stayed near the beach and he
                 went swimming in the ocean..."

     CONTINUE TO PULL BACK -- till Welles' car is very, very far
     below -- REVEALING the staggering size of the City of Los
     Angeles, where the lights go on forever and forever.

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles is seated, elbows on his knees, reading the DIARY...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "... I hope I can be an actress.  I
                 hope I can be happy.  I'll probably
                 have to go to acting school.  I wish
                 I knew someone who lived there.
                 I'll miss my friends, but at least
                 I'll be far away where no one can
                 ever find me."

     Welles has come to the end of the writing in the DIARY.  The
     next PHOTOCOPIED PAGE shows an image of the TORN RAGGED EDGE
     of the diary's missing page.


     EXT.  VIDEO PORN SHOP -- DAY

     Welles enters this "ADULT VIDEO" storefront.

     INT.  VIDEO PORN SHOP -- DAY

     The CLERK is a sleazy forty-year-old man with rings in his
     pierced nose and lips, behind a counter by the door.  He
     watches Welles pass.

     Welles looks around, uncomfortable.  A few of the other
     CUSTOMERS, all men, sneak glances at Welles.  Display
     shelves run floor to ceiling, full of hundreds of shrink-
     wrapped XXX PORNO TAPES.  Welles pretends to browse.

     Handmade signs above each section identify content: "ANAL,"
     "BIG TITS," "CUMSHOTS," "BONDAGE and FETISH," etc...

     Welles looks back at the clerk, who stares at Welles.
     Welles feels obligated to pick up a box and act like he's
     considering it.  He glances at other customers.

     Each man keeps his eyes forward on the pornography.  One guy
     has his arms full of about ten videos.

     Welles puts the tape back, walks to the front counter.  The
     clerk watches him the whole time.

                             WELLES
                 Is this pretty much it?

     The clerk just stares at Welles.

                             WELLES
                 Just... just videos?

                             PIERCED CLERK
                 What are you looking for?

     Welles considers, decides to leave, exiting...

                             WELLES
                 Nothing.

                             PIERCED CLERK
                 Fuck-head.


     INT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY

     Welles comes in through the blacked-out door.  This place is
     larger than the last.  TWO CLERKS are behind the counter.
     One clerk's pricing porn, the other, MAX, 25, reads a porno-
     novel.  Max has long hair, colorful tattoos covering his
     forearms, has a HIGHLIGHTER MARKER in his mouth.

     Welles browses.  There's a huge video bargain bin.  Walls
     are covered in videos, sex toys, inflatable women, etc. 

     CUSTOMERS, again all wary males, follow proper porn-shop
     etiquette; look at the porn, not your fellow shopper.

     There are "PEEP SHOW" booths in the back.  A MAN looks
     around, trying to be nonchalant, sweating profusely,
     slipping behind one curtain.

     Welles pretends to read the packaging on a triple-pack of
     dildos, looks towards the front...

     Behind the register, Max takes a look to make sure the other
     clerk is busy, takes the cap of his Highlighter pen and
     highlights a section in the book he's reading.

     Welles notes this.  He goes to the substantial MAGAZINE
     RACK, picks up a porn tabloid, pages through it.  He selects
     sex MAGAZINES and NEWSPAPERS, choosing about twenty-five.

     Welles takes this pile up to Max, gets out his wallet.  Max
     starts ringing everything up.

                             MAX
                 Big date tonight?

                             WELLES
                       (embarrassed)
                 Yeah... guess so.

                             MAX 
                 Can I interest you in a battery
                 operated-vagina?

                             WELLES
                 Pardon me?

                             MAX
                 My boss tells me I have to do more
                 suggestive selling.

                             WELLES 
                 Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.

                             MAX
                 It's your call, but you're gonna be
                 sorry when you're in one of those
                 everyday situations that call for a
                 battery-operated vagina and you
                 don't have one.

                             WELLES
                 I'll risk it. 

     Max shoves everything into a bag and hands it over.

                             MAX
                 Thank you for shopping at Adult
                 Bookstore.  Have a nice day.

     Welles takes the bag.  Max returns to his book.  Welles is
     leaving, but stops at the end of the counter.

                             WELLES
                 What are you reading?

     Max holds up the book, "ANAL SECRETARY."

                             MAX
                 Once you pick it up you can't put it
                 down.

                             WELLES
                 Catchy title.  What are you really
                 reading?
                       (off Max's look)
                 Hard to believe that book's got any
                 parts worth highlighting.

     Max takes a glance at the other clerk, opens the pages of
     the book and shows it to Welles.  "Music for Chameleons."

                             WELLES
                 Truman Capote.

                             MAX
                 I tear off the cover and paste this
                 one on...
                       (nods towards clerk)
                 You know how it is.

                             WELLES
                 Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself
                 in front of your fellow perverts.

                             MAX
                       (smiles, shrugs)
                 Might get drummed out of the
                 pornographer's union, and then where
                 would I be?

     Another CUSTOMER clears his throat, waiting at the register.
     Max turns to help him.  Welles heads out.


     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles is at a table, porn publications spread out before
     him, looking through the back of a PORNO TABLOID...

     Turning pages of HARDCORE ADVERTISEMENTS: "Adults Only,"
     "She Male Films," "Amateur Sex Videos," "Women and
     Animals -- you've got to see it to believe it..."

     Welles moves on to the next MAGAZINE, turning to the back,
     again, page after page: "Watersports and Fisting
     Specialists," "100's of Anal Films," "Asian Sex..."

     HUNDREDS of 900 NUMBER ads with naked women urging callers
     to pick up the phone.  EROTIC CLASSIFIEDS; hundreds of
     amateur photos of naked men and women with faces and
     genitalia blacked over... "Men Seeking Women," "Women
     Seeking Women", "Men Seeking Men," "Transvestites..."

     It is endless.  More CLASSIFIEDS: "Sex Slaves Wanted,"
     "ACTRESSES WANTED," "Underground Films," "SPECIALTY FILMS
     OFFERED," "S+M and BONDAGE," "Fetish Videos."

     Welles leaves it, overwhelmed, goes to lay down on the bed.
     He picks up his cellular phone, dialing.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Hi, honey, how are you?  How's Cindy?
                       (listens)
                 The way it's going I'm about ready
                 to pack my bags...

     INT.  NONDESCRIPT ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     In a dark room, we don't know where, a DARK FIGURE of a MAN
     is silhouetted.  He wears HEADPHONES, listening...

                             WELLES' VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphones)
                 ... I've got a feeling the person
                 I'm looking for came out here and
                 got swallowed up by the place.

                             AMY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphone)
                 Come back now. Just drop it and
                 come back...

                             WELLES' VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphone)
                 I would if I could.  I'll be home
                 soon, believe me.  It won't be long.

                             AMY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphone)
                 I miss you.

     INT.  WELLES ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles shuts his eyes, still on the cellular...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 I miss you too.  I love you very
                 much.  Give Cinderella a kiss for me
                 and tell her I love her, alright?
                       (listens)
                 Goodnight.


     INT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY

     Max is at the register.  A crewcut WOMAN in overalls works
     behind the counter with him.  Welles approaches.

                             WELLES
                 Remember me?

                             MAX
                 Came back for that battery-operated
                 vagina, right?  Told you you would.

     Welles shows his IDENTIFICATION, lets Max get a good look.

                             WELLES
                 I need some information.  Thought
                 you might be able to help.

                             MAX
                       (of identification)
                 Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.

     Welles takes out an ENVELOPE, puts it on the counter.

                             WELLES
                 I'll be outside having a cigarette.

     Welles leaves.  Max watches him go.  Max opens the envelope,
     takes out two fifty dollar bills, pockets them.

                             MAX
                       (to other clerk)
                 Cover me, Beth.  I'm taking a break.

     EXT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY

     Welles stands down the sidewalk, smoking.  Max comes out
     from the porn shop, walks to Welles, looking around.

                             MAX
                 I don't know what you're looking
                 for, mister, but so we're clear from
                 the start, I'm straight.

                             WELLES
                 Good for you.

     Welles and Max walk down the block, past HOMELESS MEN with
     shopping carts overflowing with junk.

                             WELLES
                 How long you been working there?

                             MAX
                 Three, four years.

                             WELLES
                 What's your name, if you don't mind
                 me asking? 

                             MAX
                 Max.

                             WELLES
                 Well, here's the deal, Max.  This
                 thing I'm on right now has something
                 to do with underground pornography.
                 Stuff that's sold under the counter,
                 illegally...

                             MAX
                 There's not much illegal.

                             WELLES
                 Well, whatever there is, whoever's
                 dealing, however it's done, I want
                 to know.  I want a good look, so if
                 you've got that kind of connection,
                 great.  If not, speak now.

                             MAX
                 You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask
                 and you are, you have to tell me.

                             WELLES
                 I'm not a cop.

                             MAX
                 You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.

                             WELLES
                 Not quite.

                             MAX
                 From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA.
                 What are you doing out here?

                             WELLES
                 Well, there's the thing; you're not
                 gonna know anything about what I'm
                 doing, but you can make some money.

                             MAX
                 How much?

                             WELLES
                 How much do you make now?

                             MAX
                 Four hundred a week, off the books.

                             WELLES
                 Okay, let's pretend I live in the
                 same fantasy world where you make
                 four hundred a week in that dump.
                 I'll give you six hundred for a few
                 days. 

                             MAX
                 Sounds good, pops.

                             WELLES
                 Here's my number if you need it...
                       (writes on scrap paper)
                 When can you start?

                             MAX
                 Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.

                             WELLES
                 See you then.  Oh, and, don't call
                 me "pops."

     Welles walks away. 


     INT.  WELLES ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles sleeps, despite the stead SOUND of TRAFFIC racing by
     his window.  The PHONE RINGS, waking him.  Welles looks at
     the clock radio, 2:23am, reaches to answer the phone...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 ... Hello... ?

                             MAX (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Wake up, pops.  Your education
                 begins tonight.

     EXT.  DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT

     Against the backdrop of downtown LA's bright skyscrapers,
     Welles' rental car heads into the lower bowels of the city,
     smaller, older, darker buildings...

     EXT.  DOWNTOWN STREETS -- NIGHT

     The only people on the street are HOMELESS and SHADY
     CHARACTERS.  Welles' car makes its way to a big deserted
     PARKING LOT.  There are a few cars parked in one corner.

     Welles parks near the other cars and gets out.  Max stands
     against a chain link fence.  Welles goes to meet him.

                             MAX
                 Come on.

     Max leads the way, across the lot, towards dark alleyways.

     EXT.  DOWNTOWN ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

     Max and Welles move through this filth strewn alley between
     decaying brink buildings.  They cone to a STAIRWELL leading
     down to pitch dark...

     INT.  OLD BUILDING -- NIGHT

     Max enters through a crooked door, heads into a narrow,
     labyrinth hallway lit by bare bulbs.  Welles follows.

     They come to another STAIRWAY leading down.  At the bottom,
     a thick-necked GOON stands guarding double doors. 

                             GOON
                 Are you a law enforcement agent or
                 in any way affiliated with law
                 enforcement?

                             MAX
                 Fuck you, Larry.

     Max heads to the double doors, waits for Welles.

                             GOON
                       (to Welles)
                 Are you a law enforcement... ?

                             WELLES
                 No.

     INT.  BASEMENT -- NIGHT

     Max and Welles enter through the double doors, into a kind
     of small, underground porn flea market.  It's incredibly
     quiet.  About fifteen CARD TABLES are set up in rows.  The
     MEN behind the tables and the thirty or so "CUSTOMERS"
     looking through the merchandise make those in the previous
     porn shops look like high society.

     These are MIDDLE-AGED MEN, most balding, some with pot
     bellies, in shorts and tube socks, in sweatpants and Members
     Only jackets: plain men, but with a look of desperation in
     their eyes, glancing around nervously, greasy and afraid.

                             ONE DEALER
                 We're shutting down in fifteen
                 minutes.  Fifteen minutes.

     Welles makes his way to the tables, wary.  One table is
     covered in dirty cardboard boxes, filled with HUNDREDS of
     PHOTOS of young children, mostly boys, naked.  Each photo is
     wrapped in plastic, censored by masking tape.

     Welles swallows back disgust.

     The next table is piled high with used pornographic
     MAGAZINES.  There are baggies with COLORFUL PILLS laid out.
     X-rated Polaroids wrapped in rubberbands.

     Max follows behind, unaffected, smokes a cigarette.

     Another table offers VIDEO TAPES with no identifying marks
     other than hand written labels with numbers written out,
     "two," "sixteen," "five."  And many bootleg VIDEOS with
     grainy, homemade labels showing WOMEN in extreme BONDAGE.

     Welles watches out the corner of his eye as the PLUMP MAN
     beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures.
     Welles waits till the man moves on, addresses the angry
     looking DEALER who's counting money.

                             WELLES
                       (points to numbered videos)
                 What are these?

                             ANGRY DEALER
                 Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films.
                 Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.

     Welles looks around, wipes sweat off his top lip.

                             WELLES
                 Anything harder?

                             ANGRY DEALER
                 There's nothing harder.

                             WELLES
                 Snuff?

                             ANGRY DEALER
                 What you see is what I got, mister.

                             WELLES
                 You know where I can get it?  I have
                 a lot of money to spend.

                             ANGRY DEALER
                 There ain't no such thing as snuff.
                 Why don't you fuck off? 

     The dealer sits and keeps counting cash.
     Welles moves on Beyond the tables there's a CURTAINED
     DOORWAY.  Welles walks to it, enters...

     INSIDE THE CURTAIN

     Folding chairs face a SCREEN.  A PROJECTOR shows a silent
     movie; a BUXOM WOMAN in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag
     and tube.  A hairy, overweight MAN lays face down on an
     examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back.

     In the darkness, a MAN shifts in his chair, grunting,
     obviously masturbating.  A few chairs away, a man is bent
     over, moving his head in the lap of SOMEONE in a BLONDE WIG.

     A LARGE MAN approaches Welles from the dark.

                             LARGE MAN
                 You have to pay to come in here. 

     Welles backs away, shuts the curtain.


     INT.  ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT

     Not many people in the place.  Welles drinks coffee.  Max
     eats a huge breakfast.

                             MAX
                 You've got Penthouse, Playboy,
                 Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers
                 them pornography anymore.  Then,
                 there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple
                 X.  The difference is penetration.
                 That's hardcore.  That whole
                 industry's up in the valley.
                 Writers, directors, porn stars.
                 They're celebrities, or they think
                 they are.  They pump out 150 videos
                 a week.  A week.  They've even got
                 a porno Academy Awards.  America
                 loves pornography.  Anybody tells
                 you they never use pornography,
                 they're lying.  Somebody's buying
                 those videos.  Somebody's out there
                 spending 900 million dollars a year
                 on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's
                 only gonna get worse.  More and more
                 you'll see perverse hardcore coming
                 into the mainstream, because that's
                 evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my
                 God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his
                 hips, how offensive!  Nowadays,
                 Mtv's showing girls dancing around
                 in thong bikinis with their asses
                 hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For
                 the porn-addict, big tits aren't big
                 enough after a while.  They have to
                 be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn
                 chicks are putting in breast
                 implants bigger than your head,
                 literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be
                 Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler,
                 Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore
                 films'll be medical films.
                 People'll be jerking off to women
                 laying around with open wounds.
                 There's nowhere else for it to go.

                             WELLES
                 Interesting theory.

                             MAX
                 What you saw tonight, we're not
                 talking about a video some dentist
                 takes home over the weekend.  We're
                 talking about stuff where people get
                 hurt.  Specialty product. 

                             WELLES
                 Child pornography.

                             MAX
                 There's two kinds of specialty
                 product; legal and illegal.  Foot
                 fetish, shit films, watersports,
                 bondage, spanking, fisting, she-
                 males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond
                 hardcore, but legal.  This is the
                 kind of hardcore where one guy's
                 going to look at it and throw up,
                 another guy looks at it and falls in
                 love.  Now, with some of the S+M and
                 bondage films, they straddle the
                 line.  How are you supposed to tell
                 if the person tied up with the ball
                 gag in their mouth is a consenting
                 or not?  Step over that line, you're
                 into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but
                 there aren't many.  I've never seen
                 one.

                             WELLES
                 Snuff films.

                             MAX
                 I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't
                 yanking you around.  There's no such
                 thing.

                             WELLES
                 What other ways are there to get
                 illegal films?  Who do you see?

                             MAX
                 First of all, basement sales like
                 tonight aren't gonna last much
                 longer.  It's too risky, one, and
                 two, everything's going on the
                 internet.  Anyone with a computer
                 and enough patience can find
                 anything he wants.  It's heaven for
                 those degenerate chicken-hawks.
                 They're swapping pictures back and
                 forth as fast as their modems can
                 zap 'em.  But, there's still some
                 weird shit under the counter where
                 I work sometimes.  No one knows where
                 it comes from.  That's local
                 underground, where information
                 spreads by word of mouth.  Those are
                 zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their
                 hands are permanently pruned.  They
                 go out in the sun they don't burn,
                 they blister.  Other than that, all
                 I know about is the mail.
                 Classified ads in the paper with
                 hidden codes.  Secret couriers.
                 Credit card orders to dummy
                 corporations.  Interstate wire
                 transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes.
                 But, if you're asking me who do you
                 go to to get illegal shit... who
                 knows?  That's the whole point --
                 the seller stays as far away from
                 the buyer as possible, and vice
                 versa, and cops can't trace the
                 deal.  There's ways to do it so
                 nobody knows who anybody is.

     Welles watches Max eat.

                             WELLES
                 How old are you?

                             MAX
                 Twenty-five.

                             WELLES
                 Where are your parents?

                             MAX
                 I don't know, where are yours?

                             WELLES
                 I don't mean any offense... but what
                 are you doing mixed up in all this?

                             MAX
                 I'm not mixed up in anything,
                 hayseed.  What are you talking about?

                             WELLES
                 You just strike me as smart enough
                 to be doing something else.

                             MAX
                 Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What
                 choices have I got?  Fuck, just
                 because I know about stuff like
                 tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I
                 work a job.  It beats pumping gas,
                 beats making hamburgers.

                             WELLES
                 You're telling me it doesn't get to
                 you?

                             MAX
                 You can't sit there all day watching
                 the parade of losers that comes into
                 that place without going numb.  So
                 what? 
                 Am I gonna go off and be a race car
                 driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for
                 President?  What about you, pops?

                             WELLES
                 What about me?

                             MAX
                 I see a ring on your finger.  You
                 have any kids?

                             WELLES
                 A daughter.

                             MAX
                 So, you have a wife and kid waiting
                 for you in Pennsylvania... what are
                 you doing mixed up in all this?

                             WELLES
                 Good question.

     EXT.  ALL NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT

     Max and Welles comes out to the sidewalk, talking.

     ACROSS THE STREET

     INSIDE A PARKED CAR, through the windshield, SOMEONE watches
     Max and Welles say goodnight.  Max walks to a waiting taxi.

     It's the sinister lawyer watching, LONGDALE, the late Mr.
     Christian's attorney, watching Welles go to his rental car.


     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles is seated, PROJECTOR RUNNING, watching the 8MM film.

     The last of the film makes its way through, threading out.
     The take-up reel spins, the film's tail flapping...

     Welles stares at the blank white square of light projected
     onto the wall.  CELLULAR PHONE is HEARD RINGING...

     Welles finally looks to the projector, turns it off.  The
     PHONE'S RINGING.  Welles goes to sit on the bed, looking at
     the cellular phone on the bedside table.  RINGING...

     Welles lets it RING.  RINGING... RINGING... till it finally
     stops.  Welles lays back on the bed and shuts his eyes.


     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

     Mrs. Christian is behind the desk, surrounded by BOXES of
     BANK RECORDS and FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, on the PHONE. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                       (into phone)
                 My husband had five cash accounts he
                 used to temporarily hold stock
                 profits.  Between November of 1991
                 and March of 1992, he wrote one
                 check out to cash from each account.
                 He wrote these himself...

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH, HOLLYWOOD -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles is in the booth, listening...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Okay...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 My husband never dealt with money
                 personally, certainly not cash.

                             WELLES
                 I'm not positive this means anything.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 The checks were for odd amounts...

     INT.  MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

     Mrs. Christian has the amounts written out on paper.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                       (into phone)
                 One was for two hundred thousand,
                 one dollar and thirteen cents.
                 Another was for three hundred
                 thousand, six hundred fifty four
                 dollars and seventy six cents...

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Okay, I follow you so far...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 Totalled together, these five checks
                 from five different accounts, they
                 equal one million dollars.

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

                       (into phone)
                 You're joking.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 To the penny.  Exactly one million
                 dollars in cash. 

     Welles considers this, lost in thought.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 Hello... ?

                             WELLES
                 I'm here.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 Do you think the film could have
                 cost that much?

                             WELLES
                 For a human life... murder on film,
                 no statute of limitations.  Who
                 knows?  It sure could have.  I'd
                 like you to overnight me a copy of
                 those checks, then put them in a
                 safe deposit box. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 Okay.

                             WELLES
                 Send it to me through the post
                 office like we arranged.  No return
                 address.  You dug this up all by
                 yourself?

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 You told me to look, so I looked.

                             WELLES
                 You're one hell of a detective, Mrs.
                 Christian.


     EXT.  MISSION YOUTH HOSTEL -- DAY

     TEENAGERS work cleaning this large DORMITORY, sweeping and
     mopping the floor, making the bunk beds, washing windows.
     Welles stands with an elderly, black NUN in plain clothing.

                             WELLES
                 Her name was Mary Anne Mathews.

     Welles hands the woman the PICTURE of MARY.  The woman puts
     on her glasses, looks at the picture... looks at Welles.

                             NUN
                 Yes... I remember Mary

                             WELLES
                 You... you do?  You're sure?
                 Please, Sister, will you take
                 another look, make sure... 

                             NUN 
                      (examines picture)
                 Yes.  I remember her.

     INT.  MISSION YOUTH HOSTEL, STORAGE AREA -- DAY

     In a basement corner, Welles watches as the nun uses keys to
     open the door of a chain-link STORAGE CAGE.  The cage is
     full of junk, BOXES, LAMPS, stacks of CHAIRS.

                             NUN
                 She lived here for only about a
                 month, if I recall correctly.  She
                 didn't return one night.  She never
                 came back.  I didn't know what to
                 think...

     The nun enters the cage, pushes old BOXES out of her way,
     looks up a cob-web covered METAL SHELVES.

                             NUN
                 Do you know what happened to her?

                             WELLES
                 I'm trying to find out.  She was a
                 runaway.  I'm looking into it for
                 her parents.

     The nun sees what she wants, finds a STEP LADDER, tries to
     open it.  Welles comes to help her.

                             NUN
                       (pointing on shelf)
                 Can you get that down for me?

     Welles climbs the ladder, points at boxes...

                             NUN
                 No, the next shelf... there...

     Welles takes down a small SUITCASE.  It's covered in dust.
     He climbs down the ladder with it.

                             WELLES
                 What is this?

                             NUN
                 Those are her belongings.

                             WELLES
                 Her belongings?

                             NUN
                 That's her suitcase.  I had
                 forgotten it, till you showed me
                 her picture.

     Welles puts the suitcase down, examines the LUGGAGE TAG:
     "Mary Anne Mathews," no address.  Welles looks to the nun. 

                             WELLES
                 Whatever possessed you to keep this
                 all this time?

                             NUN
                 She was the kindest, sweetest girl
                 you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I
                 adored her.  I supposed I always
                 hoped she'd be back.  After a time,
                 all I could do was pray she had
                 moved on to better things.  Can you
                 get this suitcase to her parents, if
                 you think it's appropriate?

                             WELLES
                 I'll do what I can.


     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles puts Mary's SUITCASE on the bed, opens it.  He takes
     out some of Mary's clothing, examines it, lays it aside.

     He takes out a ROSARY, more CLOTHING.  Resting on a SWEATER
     are two CERAMIC FIGURINES; a teddy bear and kitten.  Welles
     examines them, frowning, puts them aside.

     He takes out yellowed NEWSPAPER; Help Wanted CLASSIFIEDS,
     "July 2, 1992."  Several job possibilities circled, others
     crossed out.  He finds baggie containing a few old JOINTS.

     All that's left are more items of CLOTHING, a TOOTHBRUSH and
     an ADDRESS BOOK.  Welles examines the address book, finds a
     folded piece of paper in the blank pages, unfolds it... it's
     the TORN DIARY PAGE, a POEM written in Mary's hand...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (as Welles reads)
                 "Star light, star bright, First star
                 I've seen tonight, Wish I may, wish
                 I might, Have this wish I wish
                 tonight."

     Welles goes to a drawer, takes out the photocopy of Mary's
     DIARY.  He turns to the ragged edge of the torn page, puts
     the DIARY PAGE against it.  Perfect match.

     Welles stands looking at the poem.  He turns the page over,
     finds written, in cursive:

                           Models Wanted 213-555-6643


     EXT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY

     Welles dials the number off the back of the torn diary page,
     phone to his ear.  It RINGS, RINGS, RINGS... 

                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.) 
                       (from phone)
                 Celebrity Films.

     Welles hangs up, begins searching the booth's YELLOW PAGES.

     EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

     A poverty stricken business section of Wilshire.  Welles
     gets out of his parked car, looks up at a decaying Art Deco
     building that's painted blue top-to-bottom.

     Welles crosses through traffic.

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, LOBBY -- DAY

     Welles studies the REGISTRY, finds "Celebrity Films."

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- DAY

     Paint's peeling.  Walls are water stained.  Welles climbs
     stairs, winded, sweating, up the stairwell...

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- DAY

     Welles comes out a stairwell DOOR, catching his breath.  A
     couple of SECRETARIES wait for the elevator.  Welles moves
     down the hall, around a corner.

     Each office door has a window of pebbled, translucent glass.
     There's a "Dental Office," "Wilson Travel Cruises," and at
     the end of the hall, "Celebrity Films Inc., Eddie Poole,
     Professional Casting and Distribution, Suite 804."

     Welles heads back the way he came.

     EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

     Welles crosses back to the other side of the street, goes to
     stand near his car.  He looks up at the blue office
     building, counting up floors, counting windows across.

     Satisfied, he turns, backing up, looking up at the tall
     OFFICE BUILDING across from the blue building.  There's a
     sign on this adjacent building, "OFFICE SPACE AVAILABLE."

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE, 9TH FLOOR -- DAY

     Empty office.  Welles is let in by a disinterested LANDLORD.
     Welles gives a cursory look around, goes to the windows and
     opens the blinds.

     These windows afford an excellent view of the blue building
     across the street, at about 8th floor level.

                             WELLES 
                 This is better. 
                       (turns to landlord) 
                 This will be fine.


     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles has transferred most of his belongings here, SUITCASE
     open on the floor, CARD TABLE set up with fast food on it,
     an ARMY COT against one wall.  Welles sits in a chair at the
     window, looks through BINOCULARS on a TRIPOD.

     WELLES' P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: searching up the dark
     floors of the blue building, as Welles counts under his
     breath.  Moving over... stopping on one window, FOCUSING...

     Welles locks the tripod.  He goes to sit on the army cot,
     picks up his CELLULAR.  He looks at the phone, deciding.
     He puts down the phone.  He turns off the LAMP on the floor,
     lays back in the cot, going to sleep.


     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     WELLES' P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: watching the window of
     Celebrity Films Inc.  We can see most of the office from
     here.  It's crowded with junk, BOXES, piles of VIDEO TAPES.
     There's a disorganized DESK by the window.

     Welles sits looking through the binoculars.

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: a pudgy man, EDDIE POOLE, in a loud,
     print shirt, comes to sit at the desk, looks through mail.
     He smells sleazy even from here, lots of jewelry, Lots of
     rings.  He drinks coffee, answers the phone.  He talks into
     the phone, looking for something on his desk, agitation
     growing, till he's shouting, then slams the phone down.

     Welles rises.  He looks to the wall where THREE PHOTOGRAPHS
     culled from the snuff film are pinned up; the picture of
     Mary, the picture of Masked Man's tattooed hand, and...

     ... the grainy image of the Third Man in the mirror.
     Welles comes to study this third photo.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie packs VIDEO TAPES into a box,
     covering them with Styrofoam peanuts, sealing the box.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie finishes a call and hangs up.  He
     sits back in his chair.  He starts looking in his desk
     drawers, finds a MAGAZINE and opens it on the desk.  It's
     porn.  Eddie turns pages, looking at naked women.  He sits
     back in his chair, begins unbuckling his belt.

     Welles pulls back from the binoculars in disgust. 

                             WELLES 
                 No thank you.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- NIGHT

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's on the phone, pouring himself a
     drink from the liquor bottle on his desk, finishing the
     call, hanging up.  He shakes his head in disgust, drinks the
     drink, walks out of view.  After a moment, the lights go out.

     EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS -- NIGHT

     An old, dented CAR makes its way up the tight, twisting
     roads of the Hollywood Hills.  Eddie's at the wheel.  Not
     far behind, Welles' rental car follows...

     FURTHER ON

     Eddie's car pulls into the driveway under the porch of a
     ramshackle HOUSE, parks.  Welles' car passes by...

     FURTHER, AROUND A CURVE

     Welles' car slows once it's out of sight, turns around,
     moving back down the hill, slowly...

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles turns out his headlights, coming around the curve
     just far enough so the ramshackle house is in view.  Welles
     watches Eddie walk up the stairs to the house.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie has a visitor.  There's a pretty
     GIRL, wearing a tube top, in a chair facing his desk.
     Eddie's talking, gesticulating, smiling, cajoling.

     Welles watches through binoculars.

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's still taking, stands, coming
     around the desk and placing a hand on the girl's shoulder.
     The girl says something.  Eddie responds.  The woman shakes
     her head, getting up to leave.  Eddie seems to be asking her
     to stay, following as she moves out of view.  Eddie comes
     back alone, sits at his desk, picks up the phone.


     INT.  ESPIONAGE SHOP -- DAY

     Ultra high tech for sale.  Welles examines items on the
     sales counter as the SALESPERSON watches: a pair of sma1l,
     round LISTENING DEVICES, a complicated RECEIVER/TAPE
     RECORDER, and a TONE DECODER with LED window.

                             WELLES 
                 Okay, I'll take it all.

                             SALESPERSON 
                 Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and
                 American Express.

                             WELLES
                 Cash.

     Welles takes out a thick wad, starts counting.

                             SALESPERSON
                 Alright.
                       (at register) 
                 May I have your phone number, area
                 code first?

                             WELLES
                 No, you may not.

                             SALESPERSON
                 Okay.  Fine.

     Welles lays the money on the counter.  The salesperson takes
     the money, recounting.

                             SALESPERSON
                 I'm required by state law to inform
                 you that, while it's perfectly legal
                 for you to purchase these items, it
                 is illegal for you to use them for
                 any sort of...

                             WELLES
                 Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you
                 could bag it, I'll be on my way,
                 thank you.

                             SALESPERSON
                 Certainly, sir.

     The salesperson starts punching keys on the register.


     EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- NIGHT

     The blue building sits completely dark.

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT

     Welles comes quietly out from the stairwell, wears gloves.
     He moves down the hall to the door of "Celebrity Films Inc."

     He kneels, begins using LOCK-PICKING TOOLS on the door.

     INT.  CELEBRITY FILMS OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles enters, shuts the door and locks it.  He takes out
     his penlight.  There are POSTERS for cheap PORN FILMS on the
     wall that we couldn't see through binoculars.  Titles like
     "Sex Doctor," "Deep Ass," and "Penal Colony."

     There a two FILE CABINETS.  Welles pulls a few drawers,
     finds them locked.  VIDEO CASSETTES are everywhere, on the
     cabinets, on shelves, piled high on the floor.

     Welles goes to Eddie's desk, looking in drawers.  One drawer
     is full of X-RATED MAGAZINES.  Another's stuffed with
     paperwork, call sheets, contracts.

     Welles picks up Eddie's phone, unscrews the earpiece.  He
     takes the small, round LISTENING DEVICE from his pocket,
     peels off backing to expose adhesive.  He attaches the
     listening device inside the phone, puts it back together.

     Welles moves towards the door, sweeps the room with the
     penlight.  He stops at the file cabinets, takes his lock-
     picking tools out, begins working on one file's lock.

     He turns the lock, opens a file drawer.  Empty.  He opens
     another.  Inside: piles of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.

     Welles clenches his jaw.

     Faces of children.  Shirtless boys.  Girls in pigtails.


     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     Welles' RECEIVER/TAPE RECORDER'S set up by the window,
     recording, with the TONE DECODER plugged into it.  Welles
     LISTENS through HEADPHONE, looking through binoculars.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                       (through headphones)
                 ... half a dozen.  This is good
                 stuff, Jimbo...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's at his desk, on the PHONE...

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 You know how my tapes sell.  People
                 eat this stuff up.

                             MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 I had three jerkoffs trying to
                 return your tapes last month.  Do
                 you know how bad a skin flick has to
                 be for some jackass to come back
                 into my place with a fucking receipt,
                 and try to fucking return it? 

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Maybe there's something wrong with
                 the scumbag customers coming into
                 your place, ever think of that?

                             MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                 The only thing wrong is the cheap,
                 softcore crap you're peddling,
                 Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Look, you cocksucker...

                             MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                 Get together some upscale product
                 where the girls still have teeth in
                 their head.  Till then, fuck you.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Fuck you!

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie slams down the phone.  He CANNOT
     BE HEARD any longer.  He's cursing, shuffling paperwork.

     Welles takes off headphones, picks up his cellular phone.
     He drinks soda, opens the phone, dials, nervous, then looks
     back through the binoculars.  He waits, clears his throat.
     The PHONE'S RINGING... RINGING...

     On the floor, the REELS of the tape recorder are TURNING...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie answers the phone...

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Celebrity Films.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 Eddie.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Yeah, who's this?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 I know what you did.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 What?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 I know what you did.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Who is this.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six
                 years ago... 

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 What the fuck are you.. ?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 You killed that girl and you put it
                 on film.  You and your pals, you're
                 fucked.  You fucked up real good.

     Welles hits disconnect, still looking through binoculars.

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's slow to hang up the phone.  He
     stands, looking down at the phone, frozen.  Finally, he runs
     his hands through his hair, looks around the room, sits back
     down.  He gets out his bottle and pours himself a drink.

     Welles watches through binoculars, puts headphones back on.

                             WELLES
                 Come on, Eddie...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie sits motionless.

                             WELLES (O.S.)
                 ... come on...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie picks up the phone, DIALS a
     NUMBER.  We hear the PHONE RING in the HEADPHONES

                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphones)
                 ... Hello?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                       (through headphones)
                 Dino, it's Eddie... Eddie Poole...

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 What do you want?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 I just got a call... two seconds
                 ago, some motherfucker called...
                 says he knows about the loop.

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 What are you talking about?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 The loop!  The girl we did, what the
                 fuck do you think I'm talking
                 about?!  This guy calls and says he
                 knows about the fucking loop...

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 Bullshit.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 I'm telling you... 

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's
                 impossible.  Why are you bothering
                 me with this... ?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Because somebody just fucking called
                 me and fucking laid it out!

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 There's nothing there, you brain-
                 dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's
                 absolutely no way in this world to
                 connect us to anything.  I want you
                 to hang the phone up, and if you
                 call me about this again I'm going
                 to send a friend of mine out there
                 and have him crack you open with a
                 fucking rib spreader.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Dino...

                             DINO (V.O)
                 Nobody knows anything.

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: as DINO is HEARD HANGING UP, Eddie
     reacts, picks up his phone and throws it across the office.

     Welles sits back, trying to accept the realization that he's
     found them.  He looks to the PHOTO of the Third Man.

                             WELLES
                 That is you, isn't it, Eddie?

     Welles goes to the RECORDER, turns on the TONE DECODER.  Its
     LED window LIGHTS UP.  Welles hits STOP, REWIND, PLAY...

                             WELLES VOICE (V.O.)
                       (from recorder)
                 ... and your pals, you're fucked...

     Hits FAST FORWARD... hits PLAY, watching the TONE DECODER.
     From the RECORDER, the SOUND of EDDIE DIALING a NUMBER on
     his touch tone phone... and as EACH TONE is HEARD, a
     corresponding NUMBER appears on the DECODER'S LED readout:

                               ...1 212 555 9906...

     The recorder continues, REPLAYING the CONVERSATION between
     Eddie and Dino, while Welles studies the green LED digits.

                             WELLES
                       (quiet, to himself)
                 Two one two.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- NIGHT

     The brilliant lights of New York's peerless skyscrapers.

     EXT.  59TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT

     FOLLOW Welles' Ford as it moves along with traffic, crossing
     the 59th Street Bridge, into the heart of Manhattan.

     EXT.  BANK -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

     "Chase Manhattan Bank," mid-town.

     INT.  CHASE MANHATTAN BANK, SAFE DEPOSIT BOOTH -- DAY

     Welles puts the 8MM FILM into SAFE DEPOSIT DRAWER, shuts it.


     INT.  NY PUBLIC LIBRARY, REFERENCE -- DAY

     Busy and crowded, but quiet.  Welles places a massive tome
     down on a table:  "Haines Criss-Cross Directory."

     Welles sits, takes out his notepad, referring to the phone
     number written: "(212) 555-9906."  He opens the reference
     book, searching pages...

     Thousands of TELEPHONE NUMBERS are LISTED in SEQUENCE, each
     with an address.  Welles runs his finger down the page.

     EXT.  SOHO STREETS -- DAY

     PEDESTRIANS everywhere.  Streets are clogged with DELIVERY
     TRUCKS loading and unloading.  Cars horns blow.  Welles
     walks to an old, WAREHOUSE BUILDING shoulder to shoulder
     with other buildings, labeled "1204" in burnished steel.

     Welles climbs the stairs, examines the buzzers.

     The top button's labeled "Greystone Imports," the bottom
     button reads "Lang Interior Design, by appt."  The middle
     button is labeled only by a drawing of a BLACK WIDOW SPIDER.

     Welles looks up at the building.

     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, SOHO -- LATER DAY

     The sun is low.  Less activity on the street.  Welles leans
     against a car down the street, smoking a cigarette.

     TWO WOMEN walk this way, both in spiked high heels, dressed
     in cheap, short, formfitting skirts, both carrying duffel
     bags.  They start up the stairs of 1204...

     Welles throws his cigarette, walks to follow.

     The women hit the center button.  A BUZZER sounds as they
     head inside.  Welles hurries up the stairs, catching the
     door before it closes.

     INT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, ELEVATOR -- DAY

     Welles follows the women into a decrepit ELEVATOR.  One
     woman hits "2."  Welles hits "3," steps back in the corner.
     Elevator doors creak closed.  The two women are heavily made
     up, pretty, but worn, eyes dull.

     Welles looks down at the leg of one woman, noticing bruises
     through her fishnet stockings, poorly covered by make-up.

     Elevator doors open on the SECOND FLOOR.  The two women get
     out and walk down a grey hallway, towards DOUBLE DOORS
     painted black.  Welles stops the elevator door from closing.

     The women push the INTERCOM at the black doors.  Another
     dull BUZZ is HEARD as the women enter.  The low rumble of
     HEAVY METAL MUSIC is HEARD, SILENCED as doors swing shut.

     Welles lets the elevator close.

     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     The elevator opens on the FIRST FLOOR.  Welles gets out,
     instead of leaving the way he came, heads towards the
     rear... FOLLOW him down a hallway, past a SERVICE ELEVATOR...

     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles comes out BACK DOORS into an sunless alleyway with
     fire escapes above.  There's a TRASH DUMPSTER, overflowing.
     Rats scatter upon Welles, arrival.

     Welles looks to make sure he's alone.  He starts tearing
     open GARBAGE BAGS.  Flies swarm.  One bag's filled with
     empty food containers and old newspapers.

     Welles tears open another bag, finds burnt out FLORESCENT
     LIGHTBULBS, digs out a handful of empty PHOTO PAPER
     PACKAGES, bottles of DEVELOPING CHEMICALS.  He pulls out a
     few MAGAZINES; Time, Newsweek, etc...

     The magazines are cut up, falling apart, with pictures
     chopped out from many pages.  Welles examines ADDRESS LABELS:

     "Dino Velvet/D.V. Films
      1204 Keller Street
      New York, NY 10049"

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH, NYC STREETS -- NIGHT

     Welles is on the PHONE.  The city bustles past.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 What do you know about a guy called
                 Dino Velvet?  Dino Velvet Films?

     INT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY -- INTERCUT

     Max is on the phone by the register, ringing purchases.

                             MAX
                       (into phone)
                 Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the
                 John Luc Godard of S+M flicks,
                 supposed to be a real weirdo.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd
                 have thought it?

                             MAX
                       (into phone)
                 His stuff comes out of New York.
                 Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic
                 Hardcore.  Definitely not for the
                 squeamish.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 Specialty product.

                             MAX
                 You're learning.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 Where does he sell it?

                             MAX
                 Out of the back of bondage magazines
                 mostly, but you can find it on the
                 street if you look.  He'll also do
                 commissions, for enough money...

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

                             MAX (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Nothing illegal, it's always
                 borderline.  Like if some freak
                 wants to see a transvestite in a
                 full rubber immersion suit getting
                 an enema from a...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Alright, I get the picture.

                             MAX (V.O.)
                 He cuts all kinds of other stuff
                 into his movies; photographs,
                 newsreel footage, subliminal images.
                 Thinks he's making art.

                             WELLES 
                 Well, I'm in New York now.  What do
                 you say to flying out and giving me
                 a hand?

                             MAX (V.O.)
                 I'm a working stiff, pops.

                             WELLES
                 Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four
                 hundred a day, plus expenses.

                             MAX (V.O.)
                 You want me to come out there and
                 play private eye?

                             WELLES
                 Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up
                 whatever Dino Velvet films you can.
                 Get receipts.  I'll call back.

                             MAX (V.O.)
                 See ya.

     Welles hangs up, starts feeding quarters into the phone.

     INT.  MRS. CHRISTIAN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     Mrs. Christian's in bed, pale and sickly.  The PHONE RINGS.
     Mrs. Christian reaches for it.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                       (into phone, weakly)
                 Hello?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                       (coughing)
                 How are you?  Having any luck?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 I don't know if luck's the word.
                 Are you feeling alright?

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 I've been ordered into bed.  The
                 doctor says I've gotten the flu, or
                 some other wretched ailment.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 I hope it's nothing serious.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 Nothing more than a bother.  Have
                 you any news for me?

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 I've made progress.  I'm in
                 Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces
                 fall into place, I'll drive to you
                 and give you an update.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Fine...

     MRS. CHRISTIAN is HEARD COUGHING.  Welles waits.

                             WELLES
                 I've got about five thousand left in
                 cash, but I'll need another thirty,
                 if you approve.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 How will I get it to you?

                             WELLES
                 If you have a pencil and paper, I'll
                 tell you how to send it.


     EXT.  MOTEL, HELL'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     A TAXI pulls over in front of this flea-bag motel.  Max gets
     out with a SUITCASE, looks at the dubious accommodations.

     INT.  MOTEL, MAX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Max enters with Welles, turns on a light and throws his
     suitcase on the bed.  The room is disgusting.

                             MAX
                 You didn't say it was gonna be this
                 luxurious.

                             WELLES
                 It's their Presidential Suite.

                             MAX
                 Great.

     Max looks in the bathroom.

                             MAX
                 Oh, come on, man, what are we doing
                 in this flea bag?

                             WELLES
                 It's cheap, and people know to mind
                 their own business. What have you
                 got for me? 

     Max opens his suitcase, takes out THREE VIDEO TAPES.

     He hands them to Welles.  The boxes are covered in jumbled
     PHOTO COLLAGES: American flag, S+M men and women, a skull,
     mannequins, a scorpion, cut-outs of arms, legs and eyeballs.

                             MAX
                 Dino Velvet.

     INT.  WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles is lit by the flicker from the TELEVISION SCREEN.  WE
     SEE NOTHING.  We HEAR the rhythmic MUFFLED MOANS of a WOMAN
     from the TV, can't tell if it's pleasure or pain.

     Max is asleep in the bed, PIZZA BOX near his feet.

     Welles drinks beer, gets up and ejects the CASSETTE from a
     VCR, tosses it aside, tired.  He picks another Dino Velvet
     TAPE, puts it in, sits.

     ON TV: GOTHIC ROCK is HEARD over old, scratchy IMAGES: of
     Klansmen around a burning cross... Dracula menacing a
     sleeping woman... a man in a Devil costume dancing...

     Welles opens another beer.

     ON TV: a WOMAN is tied up, arms in the air, hanging from the
     ceiling, gagged and blindfolded, in a dungeon lit by
     candelabras.  Then, glimpsed IMAGES: worms writhing in
     slime... gargoyles... a guillotine falling.  Then, the bound
     woman, struggling.  A MASKED MAN in a leather jacket enters.
     He wears a LEATHER MASK with zipper eyes and mouth...

     This focuses Welles' attention.

     ON TV: the Masked Man circles the captured woman...

                             WELLES
                 Max... wake up...

     Max awakens, rolling over, groggy.

                             MAX
                 Wha... ?

                             WELLES
                       (points at TV)
                 Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?

     Max tries to see, eyes barely open.

                             MAX
                 He's one of the lunatics Dino uses.
                 He's in a bunch of these.

     Welles watches.  On the TV, Masked Man takes off his jacket
     shirtless, reveals an impossibly muscled body.  Huge arms,
     thick chest, oiled, dotted in pimples. 

                             MAX
                 Why?  He have something to do with
                 whatever you're into?

     Still watching the behemoth on TV, Welles is less sure.

     ON TV: the bulging Masked Man flexes, ripped.

                             WELLES
                 No... it's nothing... that's not him.

     Welles rubs his eyes, sits back.  Max sits up, watching.

     ON TV: Masked Man pulls the bound woman's head back by her
     hair, licks her face with his thick tongue...

     CLOSE ON: Masked Man grips the woman's head, still licking.
     He pulls down the woman's blindfold...

     Welles sits forward, realizing, horrified...

     Welles goes to the VCR, hits PAUSE.  The IMAGE on TV
     FREEZES.  Welles goes back, FRAME by FRAME...

     ... to the CLOSE UP where Masked Man grips the woman's face.
     FREEZE FRAME.  On Masked Man's hand: a TATTOO, on the arch
     between his forefinger and thumb, same as the scrawny Masked
     Man in the snuff film.  A PENTAGRAM TATTOO.

                             WELLES
                 Who is he?

                             MAX
                 I told you, he's one of Dino
                 Velvet's stock players...

                             WELLES
                 Who is he, his name?

                             MAX
                 Nobody knows his name.  That's his
                 thing.  He always wears a mask.  You
                 never see his face.  He calls
                 himself "Machine," that's what they
                 call him.  Machine. 

     Welles hits PLAY.  On TV, Masked Man runs his hands up and
     down the woman's body.  The woman's eyes are filled with
     fear.  Welles sits, unnerved, watching.

                             MAX
                 They say he's half brain-dead from
                 all the steroids he's using.

     Max rolls over, trying to get back to sleep.

                             MAX
                 He's a brutal motherfucker, man.  He
                 loves what he does for a living. 


     INT.  WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- DAY

     Welles enters, carries an OVERNIGHT PACKAGE and his LOCK
     BOX.  At the desk, he tears open the package, opens the
     MANILA ENVELOPE inside; finds FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in
     thousand dollar bills, wrapped in plastic and masking tape.

     Welles takes the lock box to the bed and works the
     combination, opens it.  He takes out the holster, stands
     looking down at the gun.  He puts the holster on.


     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles' Ford waits with turn signal on.  A car pulls out of
     a parking space.  Welles takes the space.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY

     Max is in the passenger seat.  Welles looks to 1204.

                             WELLES
                 You don't need to be here.

                             MAX
                 What kind of Junior P.I. would I be
                 if I didn't go with you?

     INT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY

     Welles and Max get off the elevator, moving down the grey
     hall, to the black doors.  Welles pushes the INTERCOM
     BUTTON.  After a moment, the INTERCOM CRACKLES...

                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (from intercom)
                 Who is it?

     Welles waits, presses the button again.

     INT.  DINO VELVET STUDIO -- DAY

     The doors BUZZ and Welles and Max warily enter this large,
     dark, converted warehouse.  Square pillars shoot from floor
     to ceiling.  Shafts of light cut down from high windows.

     A large THUG in a pinstripe suit crosses from a far DESK.

                             THUG
                 You're in the wrong place.

                             WELLES
                 We're looking for Mr. Velvet.

                             THUG
                 He's not here. 

     Welles looks around, at piles of PROPS; a huge faux-stone
     ANGEL and GARGOYLES, elaborate CANDELABRAS, a huge BIRDCAGE,
     massive WOODEN CROSS, NAZI FLAGS.

                             WELLES
                 Why don't you tell him we're here to
                 give him a large sum of money.  If
                 he's not interested, we'll go.

                             THUG
                 You should leave now, before I have
                 to remove you.

     Welles just stands looking at the thug.  A VOICE is HEARD...

                             DINO VELVET'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (from SPEAKERS)
                 Show them in, Milo.

     Welles and Max look up.  There are SPEAKERS mounted high up
     on the pillars, and SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS looking down.

                             WELLES
                 You heard the boss, Milo.

     The disgruntled thug starts back across the studio towards
     a distant DOOR.  Welles and Max follow...

     They notice an elaborate set built in one corner, a TORTURE
     CHAMBER, complete with RACK and IRON MAIDEN.

     INT.  DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- DAY

     Thug opens the door and lets Welles and Max in.
     The office is huge, windowless walls covered in thousands of
     PICTURES from every conceivable source, torn and cut, pinned
     up to form an indecipherable collage.  A tall LADDER leans
     against one wall, near three TELEVISIONS.

     DINO VELVET rises behind his desk, a small, bird-like man,
     wearing a black suit and bad hairpiece.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Come in.  Make yourself comfortable.

     Welles shakes Dino's hand.  Max looks up at the walls.
     IMAGES; porn pictures, news photos, world leaders, autopsy
     photos, armies and insects, the naked and the dead.

                             WELLES
                 It's an honor to meet you.  Thank
                 you for seeing us.

                             DINO VELVET
                 What can I do for you today?

     Welles sits.  Shelves behind Dino's desk are piled high with
     VIDEO CASSETTES, old MOVIE CAMERAS, big REELS of 16mm FILM.
     VIDEOS and MAGAZINES are stacked everywhere.

                             WELLES
                 I'd like to commission a work.  I'm
                 a great admirer of yours.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Flattering.  And, who's your
                 colorful little chum?

                             WELLES
                 A fellow investor.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Hmm.

                             MAX
                 You're the only one still shooting
                 film and transferring it to video.
                 Nobody appreciates that kind of
                 integrity anymore... the grain, the
                 gritty look you get.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Well, I'm glad you appreciate it.
                       (to Welles)
                 What would you say is your favorite
                 piece?

     Welles considers.  Max glances over, looks back to the walls.

                             MAX
                 I know if I had to pick, it'd be
                 "Choke," or "Devil."

                             WELLES
                 "Devil" frightened me as much as it
                 excited me, but I'd be hard pressed
                 to choose a favorite.

     Dino grins, showing yellowed teeth.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You said something about money.

                             WELLES
                 Yes.  What we're looking for is
                 rather specific.

     Welles takes out an ENVELOPE, puts it on the desk.

                             WELLES
                 That's five thousand dollars.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Is it?

                             WELLES
                 Five thousand now, five thousand on
                 delivery. 
                 Two women, one white and one black,
                 as long as they have large breasts.
                 Hard bondage, or course.  Other than
                 that, trusting your artistic
                 interpretation, I have only two
                 stipulations.

                             DINO VELVET
                 And they are?

                             WELLES
                 I want to watch you work.

                             DINO VELVET
                 I'll consider it.

                             WELLES
                 And the other performer... it has to
                 be that monster you use... the man
                 in the mask.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Machine.

                             WELLES
                 If it's not him, there's no deal.

     Dino drums his painted fingernails on his lips.

                             DINO VELVET
                 He might be interested... but it
                 would mean another five thousand.

                             WELLES
                 We can do that.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Well, well, I'll have to put my
                 thinking-cap on about all this.
                 You'll leave the money as a deposit?
                       (off Welles' nod)
                 Very good.

     Dino stands, picks up a still CAMERA off his desk and comes
     to look at Welles, studying him.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You have a beautiful face... the way
                 the light hits it.  I'd like to take
                 your picture.  You don't mind?

                             WELLES
                 I'd rather you didn't.

                             DINO VELVET
                 What's the problem? 

                             WELLES
                 I'm camera shy.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You trust me to keep your money, but
                 not to take your picture?

                             WELLES
                 Those are two different kinds of
                 trust.
                       (stands)
                 Thank you for your time.  I hope we
                 can do business.

     Welles leaves.  Max goes with him.  Dino watches them leave.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN STREET -- NIGHT

     HORNS BLARE.  TWO CARS have collided head-on.  A large CROWD
     gathers.  One windshield's shattered, blood spattered.  The
     driver is slumped over the wheel, gushing blood.

     On a nearby street corner, Welles in on a PAY PHONE.
     HEAVY METAL can be HEARD filtered through the receiver.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 So, what do you say?

     INT.  DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     Dino's stands in the middle of his office, naked, his back
     to us, 8MM camera in hand, on the phone.  A NAKED WOMAN
     dances for Dino.  A Heavy Metal MUSIC VIDEO plays on a TV.

                             DINO VELVET
                       (into phone)
                 I'll do this for you.  Fifteen
                 thousand dollars.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Machine's in?

                             DINO VELVET
                       (into phone)
                 He's in.  It will be his pleasure.

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

                             DINO VELVET (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Be at 366 Hoyt Avenue, three
                 o'clock, tomorrow.

     Welles digs out his notepad, writing. 

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Where's that?

                             DINO VELVET (V.O.)
                 Brooklyn.  Don't be late.


     EXT.  MOTEL COURTYARD, POOL -- NIGHT

     HORNS and TRAFFIC are HEARD.  Max and Welles sit in lawn
     chairs at the tiny pool.  Welles smokes.  Max drinks beer.
     They watch an ELDERLY WOMAN in a one piece bathing suit
     climb from the pool and walk to the diving board, diving in.

                             MAX
                 What's next?

                             WELLES
                 I'm trying to figure that out
                 myself.  I have to see Machine
                 without his mask.

                             MAX
                 Still don't want to tell me what
                 you're doing?

                             WELLES
                 Nope.

     The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.
     Welles takes out a thick ENVELOPE, hands it to Max.

                             WELLES
                 This is for you.

     Max doesn't understand, opens the envelope, finds about
     fifteen thousand dollars in the envelope.

                             MAX
                 What's this?

                             WELLES
                 It's money.  People use it to
                 purchase goods and services.

     Max looks at it again, can't believe it.

                             MAX
                 Look... that's awful generous and
                 everything...

                             WELLES
                 It's not my money.  The woman I got
                 it from is never going to give it a
                 second thought.  Let's not make a
                 big deal out of this, okay? 
                       (pause)
                 Go be a race car driver.  Go run for
                 President.  Whatever.

     Welles puts his cigarette out, stands.

                             WELLES
                 I'll see you around.

     Welles walks away, heading to his room.  Max watches him go,
     doesn't know what to say, looks in the envelope.

     The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.


     EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS -- DAY

     A deserted, war zone neighborhood of abandoned, graffittied
     buildings.  A few burnt out cars on the street.  Welles
     drives through, watchful.

     Welles drives past a huge TWO-STORY WAREHOUSE, does a u-turn.
     He parks the car.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY

     Welles checks his gun, returns it to his holster.

     EXT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles climbs crumbling concrete stairs, looking all
     directions, crossing a LOADING DOCK towards a DOOR...

     INT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles enters slowly, trying to get his eyes to adjust to
     the darkness.  A vast, empty space looms before him.

     In the middle of the warehouse, Dino Velvet stands, in a
     powder blue suit, holding an archery BOW and ARROW.

                             DINO VELVET
                 There you are.  Come join us.

     There's a wrought IRON BED not far from Dino.  MACHINE is
     seated on the mattress, a huge man, wearing a leather S+M
     harness and the same WRESTLING MASK as in the snuff film.

     Welles gathers his courage, walks towards them.

     Dino pulls back on the bow, aiming away across the
     warehouse.  He stands by a TABLE with a QUIVER of ARROWS
     propped up.  He shoots an arrow toward a large TARGET...

     Strikes the target dead center, BULL'S-EYE.  As Welles gets
     closer, he notices several things ... 

     ... a 16MM CAMERA mounted on a TRIPOD, facing the bed, along
     with several movie LIGHTS

     ... several BOWIE KNIFES are laid out on the table, beside
     a pair of HANDCUFFS...

     ... Machine is watching him as he approaches...

     Welles stops, not far from Dino and Machine, but keeping his
     distance.  Dino's still firing arrows at the target.
     Machine's still staring at Welles.

                             WELLES
                       (to Machine)
                 Hello.

     Machine just stares at him with bloodshot eyes.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You brought the money?

                             WELLES
                       (takes out envelope)
                 Right here.

     Dino lets fly another arrow... another bull's-eye, then
     turns to look at Welles with a smile.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Excellent.

                             WELLES
                 Where are the women?

                             DINO VELVET
                 They should be here any minute.

     Welles comes forward slowly, places the envelope on the
     table, beside Bowie knifes.  He's sweating.

                             WELLES
                       (of the knifes)
                 What are these for?

                             DINO VELVET
                 Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just
                 props.  Nice, aren't they?

                             WELLES
                 Sure.

     Dino walks across towards the target.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Machine and I were just talking
                 about knifes.  The beauty of
                 knifes...

     Dino pulls arrows from the target.

                             DINO VELVET
                 He was saying how fascinated he is
                 by their simple ability to be sharp.
                 The ability of a piece of metal to
                 be so thin that it is almost
                 nothing...

     Dino walks back to the table, replaces the arrows in the
     quiver, cueing another arrow in is bow.

                             DINO VELVET
                 So close to nothingness that it cuts
                 with minimum effort, because it's so
                 non-intrusive.  Flesh is fooled.  It
                 blooms open as the blade widens, but
                 by then it's too late, because the
                 knife's already doing its pure,
                 simple damage.

     Dino shoots another arrow to the target.
     A CLATTER attracts Welles attention.  Far across the
     warehouse, a DELIVERY DOOR rolls upwards.  A CAR with tinted
     windows drives in...

     The MAN who opened the door, silhouetted in sunlight, stays
     behind to close the door as the car pulls forward...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Ah, ours guests have arrived.

     Machine stands.  He is a giant.
     Welles takes a few steps back, wary, sweating hard now.

     The car parks across the warehouse, not far from the target.

     Dino puts another arrow in his bow, pulls it taunt, aims at
     the target... turns, aims the arrow at Welles.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Mister Welles... would you be so
                 kind as to remove any firearms from
                 your person?

                             WELLES
                 What are you... ?

                             DINO VELVET
                 Take out your gun!

     Welles brings his hand towards his holster...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Slowly.  Let me see it.

     Welles takes out his gun, looks across the warehouse...

     The SILHOUETTED MAN is walking this way.  Can't tell who he
     is yet.  Machine heads the direction of the parked car.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Empty the gun onto the table, very
                 carefully.

                             WELLES
                 Look, I don't know what this...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say,
                 or I'll put this arrow through your
                 throat.

     Welles obeys, helpless, dumps the bullets out on the table.

     The SILHOUETTED MAN'S getting closer.  It's Eddie Poole.

                             EDDIE
                 Is that him?

                             DINO VELVET
                       (to Welles)
                 Put the gun down, take the
                 handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the
                 bed.

     Welles obeys, walks to the bed.
     Welles attaches one cuff to the bed's iron rail, fastens the
     other cuff around his wrist. Dino puts down the bow and arrow.

                             DINO VELVET
                       (still to Welles)
                 Didn't know what to make of you at
                 first, and you certainly had Eddie
                 on pins and needles.  But, lo and
                 behold, from out of the blue came an
                 old business acquaintance to explain
                 everything...

     Welles looks across to the car...
     The sinister lawyer, Longdale, gets out from behind the
     wheel and hands the keys to Machine, walks this way...

                             EDDIE
                 This is the fucker?  Motherfucker,
                 doesn't look like anything...

     Eddie walks around the bed, studies Welles.  Welles watches
     him.  Eddie goes to stand behind Welles, rushes forward...

     PUNCHES Welles in the side of the head.
     Welles goes down, clutching his face.

                             EDDIE
                 Doesn't look like shit.

     Eddie pulls Welles to his feet, throws him against the bed,
     frisking him from head to toe.

     Longdale comes to stand beside Dino, nervous, taking out a
     tiny HANDGUN and pointing it at Welles.  Welles looks up,
     holding his head, afraid, sits on the bed.

                             DINO VELVET
                     (to Welles)
                 You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?

                             WELLES
                 I remember him.

                             LONGDALE
                 Let's get this over with.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Fine idea.

     Dino comes to sit on the bed beside Welles.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You're going to go get the film you
                 received from Mrs. Christian, bring
                 it here and put it in my hand.  And
                 to save time, so we make this as
                 efficient as possible, there's an
                 incentive...

     Dino puts his fingers in his mouth, lets out a sharp WHISTLE.

     Across the warehouse, Machine uses the car keys to open the
     trunk of the car, pulls SOMEONE out...

     It's Max, beaten bloody, bound, face swollen, gagged, hardly
     conscious.  Machine throws him to the floor.

                             WELLES
                 No...

     Welles tries to go towards Max, yanked back by the
     handcuffs, pulls the bed a few inches, but it's heavy.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Friend of yours?

                             WELLES
                 Look, he's got nothing to do with
                 this... let him go...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Can you guess what I'm going to say
                 next?

                             WELLES
                 He doesn't know anything... he's got
                 nothing to do with this...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Bring the film, or we kill him.

     Sorrow and rage rises up in Welles, but there's no choice.

                             WELLES
                 I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit
                 box, in the city...

                             DINO VELVET
                 How cooperative.  Longdale will keep
                 you company.

     Dino takes out HANDCUFF KEYS, throws them to Longdale.
     Longdale approaches Welles carefully, unlocking him.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Don't let Longdale's questionable
                 choice of weapon give you any ideas.
                 If his fey little gun puts enough
                 little holes in you, you'll be just
                 as dead... and so will Max.

                             EDDIE
                 Move it, dirtbag... !

     Eddie comes to SHOVE Welles.  Welles stumbles to the
     ground, gets to his feet.  Welles walks, takes one last
     glance back towards Max.  Longdale follows.

                             DINO VELVET
                       (watching them go)
                 Do hurry.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN STREETS -- DAY

     Welles' car moves in the slow flow of traffic into mid-town.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles is at the wheel.  Longdale is in the passenger seat,
     gun held in his lap.

                             WELLES
                 You were the middleman, am I right?
                 Old man Christian wasn't about to go
                 shopping for a snuff film himself.

                             LONGDALE
                 Wouldn't exactly have been possible
                 for a man of his stature.

                             WELLES
                 So, he sent you, gave you the money,
                 his errand-boy.  And if you refused,
                 it wasn't like you could tell anyone
                 your pervert boss just asked you to
                 get him a snuff film.  That's the
                 beauty of lawyer/client privilege.

                             LONGDALE
                 That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted
                 me implicitly.

                             WELLES
                 Must have paid you a lot, for you to
                 risk everything.  Would've had to
                 have cut yourself a real nice piece
                 of money.

                             LONGDALE
                 I was well compensated.

                             WELLES
                 That's why you got scared when Mrs.
                 Christian hired me.  You knew about
                 the film, figured it had to be in
                 that safe.  How'd you find me?

                             LONGDALE
                 Never mind how I found you.

                             WELLES
                 Followed me... must have freaked out
                 when you saw me closing in on your
                 buddies...

                             LONGDALE
                 They're no friends of mine.

                             WELLES
                 Except, you're willing commit murder
                 with them.

                             LONGDALE
                 None of this would be happening if
                 you would have left it alone.  If
                 you weren't digging up a girl who
                 died six years ago.  A girl no one
                 even remembers.

                             WELLES
                 Mary Anne Mathews, that was her
                 name.  Her mom remembers her.

     Welles looks at Longdale.

                             WELLES
                 You found these smut dealers and
                 asked to buy a snuff film, right?
                 Wanted them to find you one.  Well,
                 they didn't find you one, Longdale,
                 they went out and made you one...

                             LONGDALE
                 Shut up.

                             WELLES
                 Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you
                 paid money to have her murdered.

                             LONGDALE
                 Shut your mouth and drive!

                             WELLES
                 Did it get him off, huh, watching
                 them cut her up?  Tell me, because
                 I really want to understand.  Did he
                 jerk off to it?  You watch it with
                 him, sit there giving him a handjob
                 while you both watched... ?

     Longdale jams the gun against Welles' side.

                             LONGDALE 
                 You're making me very angry.

                             WELLES
                 Just tell me.  Tell me some more of
                 the secrets you and Christian
                 shared. What kind of degenerate
                 pervert was he really?  What the
                 fuck did he want with a snuff film?

                             LONGDALE
                 You're asking me why?

                             WELLES
                 I'm asking.

     Longdale sits back, wipes sweat from his face.

                             LONGDALE
                 A man like Mr. Christian, a great
                 man... all his money, all his
                 power... a man who attained
                 everything there was to attain...

                             WELLES
                 Why did he buy a film of some poor,
                 lost girl getting butchered?

                             LONGDALE
                 Isn't it incredibly obvious?

                             WELLES
                 Enlighten me.

                             LONGDALE
                 Because he could.  He did it because
                 he could.
                       (pause)
                 What other reason were you looking
                 for?

     Welles tightens his grip on the wheel, numbed. 


     EXT.  CHASE MANHATTAN BANK -- DAY

     Welles double parks, puts his hazard lights on.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS

     Longdale sits forward, looks to the bank.

                             LONGDALE
                 You've got four minutes till I call
                 Mr. Velvet and let him know there's
                 a problem.

     Longdale takes a CELLULAR PHONE from his pocket, shows it.
     Welles climbs out, heading to the bank...

     INT.  BANK, SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT -- DAY

     Welles and the SAFE DEPOSIT MANAGER enter.  They go to put
     their KEYS in one drawer, unlocking it a pulling it out.

                             MANAGER
                 May I show you to a booth...

                             WELLES
                 No, I've got it.

     Welles pulls the drawer open, takes the 8MM film out and
     hands the empty drawer to the manager, exiting.

     INT.  BANK -- DAY

     Welles comes out from the SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT, pocketing the
     film, crossing towards the entrance, looking around...

     ... at other CUSTOMERS waiting on line...

     ... at a GUARD with a GUN at his side...

     Welles detours, toward one of the LOAN DESKS.  The BANK
     EMPLOYEE behind the desk is occupied, on the phone.

     As Welles moves past the desk, he grabs a PAIR of SCISSORS
     from a pencil holder and palms it, heading to the door...

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY

     Welles gets behind the wheel.  Longdale looks at his watch.

                             LONGDALE
                 You almost went over your limit.

                             WELLES
                 Fuck you.

     Welles puts the car in gear and drives. 

                             LONGDALE
                 Give me the film.

                             WELLES 
                 You'll get it when we get there.

     Longdale puts the gun to the side of Welles' head.

                             LONGDALE
                 Give me the film.

                             WELLES
                 Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try
                 driving to Brooklyn with my brains
                 all over the windshield.

     Welles keeps driving.  Longdale sits back, stewing.


     INT.  WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     The door is kicked open.  Welles enters, takes the 8MM FILM
     out and holds it in his hand.  Longdale follows.

     As Welles moves forward, his face goes slack...

     Machine is seated on the bed, Eddie and Dino stand smoking
     cigarettes, and further on, Max is tied to the target,
     slumped over, three arrows in his chest.  Dead.

                             WELLES
                 No!!

     Welles runs towards Max, crying out, tears in his eyes...

     Machine rises, goes to intercept Welles, grabbing him.
     Welles tries to break free, but Machine lifts Welles up and
     throws him brutally to the ground.

     Welles scrambles to get up...

                             WELLES
                 You fuckers!

     Eddie comes to KICK Welles in the face.
     Welles is sent sprawling, blood gushing from his nose.  He
     lays there, stunned, weeping.

     Eddie pries the 8MM FILM from Welles' hand, tosses it...

     Dino catches the film.

     Machine comes to drag Welles towards the bed.

     Dino unspools the film, holding it up to examine it.

     Machine handcuffs Welles to the metal bedframe.  Welles
     falls to his knees, holding his face.
     Eddie PUNCHES Welles in the head.

                             EDDIE
                 You're a dead man.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Leave him alone.

                             EDDIE
                 Fuck off.

     Eddie PUNCHES Welles in the kidney.  Welles tries to protect
     himself.  Eddie raises his fist to punch again, but Machine
     catches Eddie's fist, throws Eddie back...

                             EDDIE
                 What the fuck... !

                             DINO
                 I promised him to Machine.

     Eddie looks up at Machine, who towers over him.

                             EDDIE
                 ... sorry...

                             DINO VELVET
                 First things first.  You might want
                 to watch this, Mr. Welles...

     Welles looks up through tears...
     Dino drops the 8MM FILM on the floor, takes a small bottle
     of lighter fluid from his pocket.  Longdale comes to watch.

     Welles watches helpless, agonizing...

                             WELLES
                 Don't... please...

     Dino drops the film to the floor, sprays it with fluid,
     takes out matches, light one, drops it...

     The 8MM FILM goes up in flame...

     Welles watches, quaking, hysterical, trying to pull himself
     towards the flame, dragging the bed...

     The film is destroyed by flame...

     Welles gives up, presses his face to the floor, eyes shut.

                             DINO VELVET
                 And so it ends.  It's as if she
                 never existed.

     Welles falls back, gasping, wiping blood and tears and
     spittle from his face, getting slowly, to his feet.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Don't blame yourself.  You were in
                 way over your head.

     He looks to Max's corpse, to the smoldering film...
     Swallowing back his fear, panic and rage...

                             WELLES
                 Motherfuckers.  Small time,
                 motherfuckers... !  Tell me
                 something...

     Welles spits blood, hangs onto the bed for support.

                             WELLES
                 I know why you did it, Dino,
                 Eddie... but, why'd the lawyer do
                 it?  Must have been a helluva lot of
                 money, right?  One fuckload of
                 money...

     Welles sits on the bed, eyes burning with fury.

                             WELLES
                 So, what are you all still doing
                 small time, huh?  What are you still
                 doing in the sewer, Eddie?!
                 Christian gave Longdale a million
                 dollars to find him a snuff film.
                 How much did you ever see... ?

     Eddie and Dino look to Longdale.

                             EDDIE
                 What's he talking about?

                             WELLES
                 One million dollars, Dino.  How much
                 did he tell you he had...

     Longdale's getting very nervous.

                             LONGDALE
                 He's lying.

                             WELLES
                 Look at him.  You think he played it
                 square?  How much did he give you,
                 how much did he keep for himself?

     Eddie walks towards Longdale...

                             EDDIE
                 What the fuck's he talking about?

     Longdale takes out his gun, aims it at Machine, Dino and
     Eddie, scared...

                             LONGDALE
                 Stay away from me. 

                             DINO VELVET
                 What's going on, Longdale?  Did this
                 happen?

                             EDDIE
                 You sell us short, you fuck?

                             LONGDALE
                 Stay back!  You have a gun, Eddie,
                 show it to me.  Now!

     Eddie slowly takes out his gun, seething.

                             LONGDALE
                 Put it on the ground, kick it here...

     Eddie puts the gun down, kicks it...
     Longdale picks it up, throws it far away.

                             EDDIE
                 You fucking lawyer...

                             LONGDALE
                 Move back!  All of you... move!

     Machine, Dino and Eddie stand between Longdale and the car
     with tinted windows parked across the warehouse...

                             DINO VELVET
                 What were you thinking?

     Welles watches as Machine, Dino and Eddie back slowly away
     from Longdale.  Longdale's gun hand is shaky...

     Welles tries to drag himself towards the table where his gun
     and bullets are, dragging the bed, inch by inch...

     Longdale back away, trying to angle around the menacing trio
     so he can get to the car...

                             LONGDALE
                 Back off!  Everything's been taken
                 care of, and I'm leaving now...

                             DINO VELVET
                 You're not going anywhere if you
                 fucked us, lawyer.

                             LONGDALE
                 I'm leaving.

                             EDDIE
                 You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna
                 kill us all, is that it?

                             DINO VELVET
                 You betrayed us.

                             LONGDALE
                 Stay where you are!

     Machine edges forward, holding his hands in the air.
     Longdale brandishes the gun...

                             LONGDALE
                 Keep back!

     Machine, Eddie and Dino are held at bay...

                             DINO VELVET
                 You're not gonna live through this.

     Welles still tries to get to the table, wrist bleeding in
     the cuff, bed screeching across the floor...

     Machine, hands up, slowly reaches behind his shoulder,
     touches the handle of a huge KNIFE sheathed to his back.

                             LONGDALE
                 Our business is done, I'm leaving,
                 no one's going to stop me...

     Longdale glances towards the car, seems like he's about to
     make a run for it.  Dino Velvet takes a step forward...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Fuck you!

     Machine unsheathes the KNIFE and THROWS...

     THUNK!  The knife imbeds to the hilt in Longdale's chest and
     Longdale's gun FIRES...

     Dino Velvet flies backwards, shot in the face!

     Dino hits the ground, screaming, writhing, hands to his
     face, blood pouring out between his fingers.

     Longdale falls back onto his ass, sitting there, eyes bugged
     out in surprise.  He looks down at the knife in his chest.

     Machine lets out a SCREAM, runs to Dino...

     Machine falls to his knees and grips Dino, tries to hold
     him.  Dino's screaming, squirming frantically...

     Longdale sits looking down at the knife in his chest, looks
     up, and gallons of blood pour from his mouth...

                             EDDIE
                 Fuck.

     Eddie comes to look down at the Longdale.  Longdale falls
     back, dead, blood still flowing from his maw.

     Welles drags the heavy bed, getting closer to the table...

     Eddie spins, looks across to see Welles struggling...

     Dino breaks free from Machine, runs blindly, still holding
     his gushing face, falls, tries to get back up...

     Eddie runs towards Welles.

     Dino stumbles forwards, writhing, then suddenly lays still.

     Machine rises, looking at Dino.  Tears come out from
     Machine's eyes and roll down his mask.

     One last gasp and shudder from Dino's body; death rattle.

     Welles pulls the bed, practically pulling his arm from the
     socket, desperately clawing towards the table...
     The table is mere feet away...

     Eddie arrives, KICK Welles in the ribs...

     Welles recoils.  Eddies KICKS again.  Welles curls into a
     ball.  Eddie KICKS again...

                             MACHINE (O.S.)
                 NO!

     Eddie stops, looks to Machine.

                             MACHINE
                 He's mine!

     Machine strides over the Longdale's corpse, puts his foot on
     Longdale's chest, yanks out the knife...
     Machine starts this way...

     Eddie backs from Welles.  Welles looks up, trying to shake
     off unconsciousness, sees Machine coming...

     Welles bows down, on his knees, as if to accept his fate...
     Reaching his free hand into his suit pocket...

                             WELLES
                 No, no, no... please, don't kill
                 me... please... !

     Machine arrives, knife in hand, lifts Welles' head back by
     the hair, brings the knife hand back...

                             EDDIE
                 Do him good.

     Welles rises suddenly, arm shooting forward, STABBING
     SCISSORS deep in Machine stomach...

     Machine ROARS, falling back, pitching forward...

     Machine's knife clatters to the ground.

     Eddie's eyes go wide. 

     Machine hits the floor, clutching his guts.

     Welles pushes upwards with all he's got left, turns the iron
     bedframe onto its side, flipping the mattress off...

     Eddie moves forward, furious...

     Welles grabs Machine's knife, wielding it, holding Eddie off.

                             WELLES
                 Back off, Eddie...

     Welles drags the now lightened bed frame towards the table.
     Eddie's sorely tempted, but keeps away.

     Eddie turns, looks across the warehouse...

     There's his gun, lying there, far away.

     Eddie runs for the gun.

     Welles pulls himself to the table, reaches for the gun,
     knocks the table over.  He's got the gun, but...

     Bullets hit the floor as the table falls.

     Welles struggles to open his gun with his sole free hand,
     gets it open, holds it between his knees...

     Welles grabs a bullet...

     Eddie's running toward his gun, gasping for air...

     Machine's on his knees, pulling the scissors out with
     trembling hands...

     Welles puts the bullet in the gun, flips it shut, rises,
     taking aim across the warehouse...

                             WELLES
                 Stop Eddie!

     Eddie's running...

                             WELLES
                       (pulls back the hammer)
                 I swear to Christ I'll shoot you in
                 the back... !

     Eddie stops, hands up, about ten feet from his gun...

     Machine stays on his knees, holding his bleeding stomach.
     Welles points his gun at Machine.

                             WELLES
                 Come back, or I put a hole in him.

     Eddie's looking at his gun, so close, so far away.

                             WELLES
                 You might make it to your gun, but
                 not before I shoot Machine.  And if
                 I have to shoot him because of you,
                 and I don't kill him, right after he
                 kills me, he's gonna kill you.

     Eddie turns, starts walking back...

                             WELLES
                       (to Machine)
                 Take off the mask.

     Machine shakes his head.

                             WELLES
                 Take it off!

                             MACHINE
                 You got one bullet.

     Welles looks to see Eddie heading back, keeps the gun on
     Machine, backs away, dragging the bed frame, looks to the
     DOOR behind him...

                             MACHINE
                 The only choice you have now, is
                 which one of us kills you.

     Welles backs away, drags the bedframe.  Eddie's getting
     close.  Welles points the gun at Eddie.  Eddie slows.

     Welles points the gun at Machine, points the gun at Eddie.

     Welles puts the gun to the chain of his handcuffs, FIRES...
     breaks the handcuff chain.

     Welles bolts to the door...

                             MACHINE
                 Get the gun!

     Eddie runs back towards his gun.
     Machine rises with a grunt of pain, moves towards the door,
     but agony doubles him back over to his knees.

     INT.  WELLES' HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

                       (into phone)

     Welles makes sure the bedroom's empty, looks in the
     bathroom.  He puts his gun away, leaves the lights off.

     He goes to the PHONE on the bedside table, unscrews the
     earpiece.  He removes a small, wire-mesh BUGGING DEVICE.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Dark.  Welles picks up the cordless phone, struggles to pry
     the receiver open.  He discovers another small BUG.

     He drops the BUGS to the floor, crushes them under foot.

     He puts the phone back together and is replacing it when it
     RINGS LOUDLY.  Welles is startled, drops the phone...

     Welles takes a breath, trying to shake off the jitters.  He
     picks up the RINGING PHONE, answers it...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Honey... ?

                             MACHINE (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Not quite.

     Welles stiffens.

                             MACHINE (V.O.)
                 Nothing like getting home after a
                 rough day.  Home sweet home.

     Welles moves into the HALL, towards the front door...

                             MACHINE (V.O.)
                 Walk away.  Pack your bags, put the
                 wife and kid in the car and find a
                 place to hide.  If you're lucky,
                 you'll never see me again.

     Welles takes out his gun, opens the front door, looking out.
     The street in front of the house is empty.  CRICKETS CHIRP.

                             WELLES
                 I don't know if I can do that.

                             MACHINE (V.O.)
                 I know who you are.  I know where
                 you live.  I know everything I need
                 to know to find you.
                       (pause)
                 Who am I?

     MACHINE is HEARD HANGING UP the phone.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Cindy's crying.  Amy opens the door with the chain on, sees
     Welles, lets him in.  Amy and Welles embrace, kissing.  Amy
     touches Welles damaged face, worried...

                             AMY
                 What happened to you?

                             WELLES 
                 I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you
                 alright?

                             AMY
                 What's going on, Tom?  What happened?

                             WELLES
                 I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I
                 can't.  You have to trust me...

                             AMY
                 Tom...

                             WELLES 
                 It has to be this way for now.  It
                 won't be long.

     Welles goes to pick up Cindy, tries to comfort her, kisses
     her red face as she keeps crying.

                             AMY
                 Why haven't you called?  Why don't
                 you answer your phone?

                             WELLES
                 I don't know.  I'm sorry...

                             AMY
                 You're sorry?  What was I supposed
                 to think?

     Amy comes to take Cindy from him.

                             AMY
                 You owe me an explanation.  You
                 can't treat me like this.

                             WELLES
                 I wanted to call.  I couldn't.

                             AMY
                 You couldn't?

                             WELLES
                 You don't understand...

                             AMY
                 No, I don't, because you're not
                 telling me anything!

                             WELLES
                 I was in hell.  If I called you...
                 if I heard your voice... it would
                 have been so easy for me to quit.
                 I couldn't do that.

     Tears comes to Amy's eyes.

                             AMY
                 You should have.

                             WELLES
                 Amy, I'm not going to let anything
                 happen to us.

                             AMY
                 Look where we are.  Look at
                 yourself.  You son of a bitch,
                 you don't have any idea what
                 you're putting me through...

                             WELLES
                 I don't know what to say

                             AMY
                 You're killing me...

                             WELLES
                 Don't...

                             AMY
                 What was I supposed to think
                 happened to you?!

                             WELLES
                 Amy...

     Welles goes to Amy, but she pulls away.  She sits on the
     bed.  Cindy's still crying.  Welles sits beside Amy, puts
     her arms around her.

                             WELLES
                 Forgive me.

     Amy cradles Cindy.  Welles rests his head on Amy's shoulder,
     places one hand on Cindy.

                             WELLES
                 We have to stay here a few days.
                 I'll get more clothing from the
                 house if I can.  I'm sorry.
                       (pause)
                 We're going to be okay.

     Welles rises.  He goes to the PHONE, starts dialing.  Amy
     looks at him, wipes tears.

                             AMY
                 Who are you calling?

                             WELLES
                 Mrs. Christian.

                             AMY
                 What?

                             WELLES
                 She's all I've got.  She's the only
                 witness.

                             AMY
                 Tom... she's dead.

     Welles looks to Amy.

                             AMY 
                 She died in her sleep three days
                 ago.  It was in the paper...

                             WELLES
                 I just talked to her.

     Cindy's crying.  Welles sits into a chair, trying to
     understand this, his mind racing.  He hangs up the phone.

                             AMY
                 How could you not know?

     Misery pulls down the corners of Welles' mouth.  He tries to
     find words, but none come.  He sits forward and hides his
     face in his hands, overwhelmed.  Cindy's crying.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Cindy sleeps, encircled by pillows and blankets on the bed.
     Amy watches her, runs her hand gently across Cindy's head.

     Amy rises, turns out the light, goes to a BALCONY DOOR...

     EXT.  HOTEL ROOM, BALCONY -- NIGHT

     Welles sits with his feet up on the balcony rail, looking
     into the parking lot.  Amy joins him, sits.

                             AMY
                 Promise you'll stay.

     Welles looks at Amy.

                             WELLES
                 Promise you won't go back there,
                 wherever you were.  Whatever it was,
                 forget it.

     Welles takes a deep breath, nods his head.

                             AMY
                 Promise me.

     Welles looks out into the night sky of stars.

                             WELLES
                 I promise.

     Amy comes to kiss Welles.  Welles wraps his arms around her
     and holds her tight.  She holds him.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Amy is asleep on the bed beside Cindy.  Welles comes out
     from the bathroom in a fresh shirt and suit, turns off the
     bathroom light.  He stands looking at Cindy and Amy.

     EXT.  HOTEL -- NIGHT

     Welles exits the hotel, heading to his Ford.


     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT

     Welles drives, staring ahead.  Through the windshield, the
     headlights illuminate the endless roadway.

     EXT.  KENNEDY AIRPORT -- NIGHT

     Airplanes take flight.  Manhattan glitters in the distance.


     EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

     Eddie Poole's building.  A typically bright, sunny LA day.
     In the street, Welles parks a rental car, gets out.

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- DAY

     ELEVATOR doors open and Welles gets off.  He moves down the
     hall, around a corner, heading to "Celebrity Films."

     Welles tries the door knob, finds it locked.  He looks
     around, takes two steps back, KICKS forward... SMASHES the
     translucent glass of the door...

     INT.  CELEBRITY FILMS OFFICE -- DAY

     Welles pushes broken glass out of the way, reaches in to
     open the door.  The office has been cleaned out, trash on
     the floor, desk drawers hanging open and empty, shelves
     empty, posters gone...

     Welles grabs one of the file cabinets, pulls it open, finds
     it empty, pulls it all the way out and throws it.

     INT.  8TH FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     People peer out from other offices, worried.  Welles exits
     Eddie's office, ignoring them, goes around the corner,
     straight to the STAIRWELL, heading downstairs...


     EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS -- DAY

     Welles rental car parks down the hill.  Welles climbs out,
     walking up the hill, heading for Eddie's ramshackle HOUSE.

     EXT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY

     Under the stilts of the porch, Welles passes Eddie's car,
     looks in to see it loaded with BOXES and belongings.

     Welles moves on to a door at the back of the garage.  He
     takes out LOCK-PICKING TOOLS.

     INT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE, STAIRWAY -- DAY

     Welles enters slow, pockets the tools, takes out his gun.
     FOLLOW him up the stairs, into a hallway, past a LAUNDRY
     ROOM with washer and dryer, into a LIVING ROOM...

     Welles sweeps the room with his gun, wired.  Eddie's house
     is predictably a trash heap, strewn with VIDEOS, MAGAZINES,
     dirty DISHES and fast food remnants.  Welles moves on...

     INT.  EDDIE'S BEDROOM -- DAY

     Eddie's throwing clothing into a suitcase, hurried.  Welles
     comes into the doorway, taking aim, edging forward.

                             WELLES
                 Hello, Eddie.

     Eddie spins, startled.

                             WELLES
                 Put your hands on your head.

     Eddie looks out of the corner of his eye... to his GUN.

                             WELLES
                 Put your hands behind your head,
                 lock your finger together, get down
                 on your knees.

     Eddie does as commanded, gets to his knees.  Welles moves
     towards him, very nervous, white-knuckling the gun.
     He KICKS Eddie in the stomach, doubles him over.

                             WELLES
                 I owe you a few.

     Welles KICKS again.


     INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY

     Welles enters the filthy kitchen, carrying Eddie's gun.  At
     the sink, Welles pops the gun's clip.  He pushes the bullets
     out into his palm, one by one.

     He dumps the bullets into the GARBAGE DISPOSAL, drops the
     clip in, turns it on.  The DISPOSAL makes a terrible
     GRINDING NOISE, straining, till it finally goes dead.

     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles goes to the picture window and closes the curtains.
     He turns on a lamp, goes back towards the bedroom.  After a
     moment, he returns, dragging Eddie on the floor...

     Eddie's bleeding out his nose, hands DUCT-TAPED together
     behind his back, legs bound at the ankle, dragged by a belt
     around his neck, choking...

     Welles drops the belt, undoes it from Eddie's neck.  Eddie
     gasps for air.  Welles pulls him up, puts him on the couch.

                             WELLES
                 Don't go anywhere.

     Welles heads for the stairs...

     EXT.  EDDIE'S GARAGE -- DAY

     Welles goes to Eddie car, tries the door, it's unlocked...

     IN THE CAR

     Welles takes the thick THOMAS GUIDE map book off the dash.

     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles returns.  Eddie's on the floor, wriggling.  Welles
     drops the Thomas Guide on the coffee table, picks Eddie up,
     throws him back onto the couch.

                             EDDIE
                 I'm gonna kill you.

                             WELLES
                 Don't bore me with that bullshit.

                             EDDIE
                 How'd you find me here?

     Welles PUNCHES Eddie in the ear.

                             WELLES
                 Don't ask questions.

                             EDDIE
                 Fuck you! 

     Welles PUNCHES Eddie in the same ear.  Eddie's hurting.
     Welles rubs his aching knuckles.

                             WELLES
                 Starting to recognize a pattern?

                             EDDIE
                 What do you want?

                             WELLES
                 Who is Machine?

                             EDDIE
                 I don't know...

                             WELLES
                 I want his name.

                             EDDIE
                 I told you, I don't know.

                             WELLES 
                 I will never get tired of hurting
                 you, Eddie, so you might want to
                 change your attitude.

                             EDDIE
                 What the fuck am I gonna protect
                 that freak for?  He was Dino's boy,
                 not mine.  He shows up with his mask
                 on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody
                 knows.

     Welles kicks junk off a chair, sits, takes out his gun.

                             WELLES
                 Okay, we'll come back to that.  So,
                 six years ago a guy contacts you,
                 through the classifieds, over the
                 phone, however he does it.  It's
                 Longdale, looking for a snuff film.
                 And you, entrepreneur that you are,
                 tell him you can hook him up.

                             EDDIE
                 Yeah, the fucking lawyer.

                             WELLES
                 Told him you could get him a snuff
                 film.

                             EDDIE
                 Yeah.

                             WELLES
                 How much did he pay you?

                             EDDIE
                 Thirty thousand each, that fucking
                 cocksucker.

                             WELLES
                 That's all?  Thirty each.  That's
                 all it took for you to murder her?

                             EDDIE
                 It was a lot of fucking money.

     Welles stands and paces, despairing.  He picks up a LAMP and
     throws it, SHATTERS a MIRROR, keeps pacing...

                             WELLES
                 So... you brought Dino in, and he
                 brought Machine.  And, one day, a
                 girl walked into your office because
                 you had an ad in the paper for
                 models.  And she never walked out.

                             EDDIE
                 Something like that.

                             WELLES
                 What did you do, knock her out,
                 shoot her up... ?

                             EDDIE
                 What the fuck do you want from me?

                             WELLES
                 I want to know.  I want to know
                 exactly what you did to her!

                             EDDIE
                 Fuck you then, you want to know?  I
                 talked her up, told her how
                 beautiful she was, told her she was
                 gonna be a star.  I told her I was
                 gonna get her a screen test, and
                 while I'm doing that, I got her a
                 soda and dropped a mickey.  When it
                 was dark enough, I rang Dino and
                 told him it was go time, I put her
                 in the trunk of my car and we went
                 and we fucking did it.  That's what
                 happened.  She's dead.  She's been
                 dead a long fucking time.  Nobody
                 fucking cares!

     Welles puts down his gun, picks up the Thomas Guide, holding
     it in both hands, SWINGS -- SLAMS Eddie across the face...

     Eddie's stunned, lips bleeding.  He faces forward.

                             EDDIE
                 You wanted to know, now you know.

     Welles SWINGS the Thomas Guide -- POUNDS Eddie's face again.

     Welles drops the Thomas Guide in a chair, picks up his gun,
     leaves the room...

     INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY

     Welles enters, starts looking through DRAWERS, searching.
     He finds SILVERWARE, selects a serrated STEAK KNIFE...

     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles returns, goes to grasp Eddie by the shirt collar,
     drags him to the floor, face down.  Welles stands on Eddie's
     neck, uses the knife to cut the duct tape on Eddie's hands.

                             EDDIE
                 That's right, motherfucker, cut me
                 loose.  Be a man.

     Welles tosses the knife, gun trained on Eddie, picks up the
     Thomas Guide and throws it at Eddie... 

                             WELLES
                 Show me!

     Eddie, hands now free, pushes himself to a seated position,
     looks at the Thomas Guide.

                             WELLES
                 Show me where you did it, on the
                 map, exactly where you did it.

                             EDDIE
                 Why?

                             WELLES
                 Because we're going there.


     EXT.  134 FREEWAY -- DAY

     Welles' rental car SPEEDS down the highway, east towards
     Pasadena, leaving the City of Los Angeles on the horizon.

     EXT.  MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY -- DAY

     Welles' car travels a winding HIGHWAY that serpentines up
     into the scenic, forested SAN BERNADINO MOUNTAINS.

     EXT.  BIG BEAR -- DUSK

     The sun is low.  Big Bear Lake is vast, surrounded by
     wilderness on all sides.  Welles' car follows a TWO-LANE
     ROADWAY that runs along the lake's southern shore.

     Welles' car passes sporadic SUMMER HOMES and CABINS.

     EXT.  DESERTED ROADWAY -- NIGHT

     Heavy forests border close to the road.  Welles' car travels
     alone, headlights on, slowing as it comes to an overgrown
     gravel DRIVEWAY with a rusty CHAIN strung across it.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles leans forward to look up at an old SIGN of broken
     neon and peeled paint: "Big Bear Motor Lodge."

     Welles pulls forward, puts the car in reverse...

     ON THE ROADWAY

     Welles' car backs up, angling, till the rear bumper comes
     against the chain, BACKING... till the CHAIN SNAPS.

     Welles' car pulls forward across the empty roadway, turns
     around... accelerates down the overgrown driveway...

     EXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT

     Welles' car comes down the driveway, into a small LOT.

     IN THE CAR

     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: headlights reveal what's left of the
     abandoned MOTOR LODGE, a REGISTRATION OFFICE at the center
     with attached wings of rooms on both sides.

     The LEFT WING of rooms is a fire ravaged, burnt-out
     skeleton.  What remains of the OFFICE and RIGHT WING is
     boarded over, falling apart.  No window has gone unbroken.

     IN THE LOT

     Welles turns out headlights and parks.
     He gets out, walks to look up the driveway.  A CAR is HEARD.
     HEADLIGHTS can be seen a good distance away through the
     forest as the CAR PASSES.

     Welles goes to his car, unlocks the trunk and opens it.
     Eddie's lying in there, arms and legs bound, gagged.

     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT

     The door is shoved inward, hanging crooked by one hinge.
     Eddie enters first, hands still bound behind him.  Welles
     pushes Eddie forward, gun out.

     Welles turns on his penlight FLASHLIGHT, shining it into the
     room.  There dead leaves all over the floor.  The room's
     empty except for a CHAIR lying on its side.

     Welles sweeps the room with the inadequate light.  This is
     where Mary Anne Mathews died, vaguely recognizable from the
     snuff film, without the furniture.

                             EDDIE
                 What are we doing here?

     Welles goes to the bathroom door, keeping the gun trained on
     Eddie, pushes the bathroom door open with his foot...

     The bathroom's cracked MIRROR reflects the penlight and
     Welles' palely lit face.

                             WELLES 
                 That night... you didn't have to be
                 in the room, but you were.
                       (looks to Eddie)
                 Why?  Why did you watch?

     Eddie goes to the chair, tips it upright with his foot, sits.

                             EDDIE
                 I don't know.  I felt like it.  I
                 never saw anyone get done before.

                             WELLES
                 You enjoy it? 

                             EDDIE
                 Made me sick, but what did I care?
                 What did I care if some hump wants
                 to beat off to that.  It was just
                 something I was doing for money.

                             WELLES
                 Tell me what happened.

                             EDDIE
                 What do you want to know?  You saw
                 it, you saw the loop...

                             WELLES
                 Nobody saw you bring her in?

                             EDDIE
                 There wasn't nobody around.  This
                 place was a shit-hole.  I backed up
                 the car to the door and we carried
                 her in, like groceries.  Dino made
                 her eat a bunch of pills, we laid
                 out the plastic, put film in the
                 camera and Machine went to work.

                             WELLES
                 What did you do with her body?

                             EDDIE
                 Took it out the bathroom window.
                 Buried it in the woods.

                             WELLES
                 Show me.

     EXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT

     Eddie and Welles come around the corner of the abandoned
     motel, Eddie leading the way, Welles following with gun and
     flashlight, into the dense forest...

                             EDDIE
                 What are you thinking you're gonna
                 do... ?

     Welles shoves Eddie ahead.

                             WELLES
                 Keep moving.

                             EDDIE
                 Where do you think you're taking
                 this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero,
                 avenge that little girl's death?
                 Gonna make everything right with the
                 world?  How you gonna do that... ? 

     FURTHER ON

     Welles and Eddie come over a hill, deeper into the forest...

                             EDDIE
                 You can't go to the cops.  All you
                 can do is cut me loose and walk
                 away, because you got nothing...

                             WELLES
                 Stop talking.

                             EDDIE
                 You got absolute zero.

                             WELLES
                 Show me where you buried her.

                             EDDIE
                 I don't know...
                       (nods to forest)
                 ... out there somewhere.

                             WELLES
                 Where?  Show me where.

                             EDDIE
                 I fucking don't know.  What do you
                 think... we weren't burying
                 treasure.  We didn't pace it out so
                 we could come back and get it.  We
                 dug a hole and we put her in it.
                 Your guess is as good as mine.

     Welles walks ahead of Eddie, distraught, shining his
     flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor.

                             EDDIE
                 You'll never find her.  Nobody ever
                 will, and even if they did, it
                 doesn't mean nothing.  Bring in the
                 cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em
                 all.  Without the film, it never
                 happened.  Don't you get it?  It's
                 over.  You can't do anything.

     Welles turns, aims his gun at Eddie, furious.

                             WELLES
                 I can kill you.  I can leave you out
                 here, just like you left her.

     Eddie's not backing down.

                             EDDIE
                 Do it.

                             WELLES
                 Don't think I won't.

                             EDDIE
                 Do it!  Put me out of my misery so
                 I don't have to listen to you
                 whining anymore.  You think it's so
                 easy?

                             WELLES
                 Easy enough for you.

                             EDDIE
                 I never killed anyone.

                             WELLES
                 That's right, you just stood there
                 and watched, because you "felt like
                 it."  Almost makes you worse.

                             EDDIE
                 What do you want?  You want me to
                 fall to my knees and start crying
                 like a baby... ?

     Eddie walks towards Welles.  Welles backs away...

                             EDDIE
                 Where you going?  You're the one
                 with the gun.  Aren't I defenseless
                 enough?  Come on...

     Eddie comes ahead, defiant, the gun inches from his face.

                             EDDIE
                 Go ahead and kill me.  Kill me with
                 that gun, your gun, right,
                 registered in your name?  Dig the
                 hole yourself, with your bare hands,
                 bury the body with your bullets in
                 it.  Fucking do it!

     Welles step forward, presses the gun against Eddie's
     forehead, pulls back the hammer... 

     Eddie just stares back at Welles with hatred in his eyes.

     Welles is terrified, unsure... trying to muster the courage
     to do it... gun hand trembling... finger on the trigger...


     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT

     Eddie's thrown face down to the floor.  Welles comes to sit
     on Eddie's back, facing Eddie's feet, holsters his gun,
     takes out duct tape and grabs Eddie's feet, wrapping them...

                             EDDIE
                 You pussy.

     Welles keeps going around Eddie's ankles with the duct tape,
     till Eddie's securely bound.

     He rips the tape roll free and gets up, walking out...

                             EDDIE
                 Fucking pussy!

     EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT

     Welles pulls the door closed behind him, walks to his car.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles opens the passenger door and sits, shaken, at his
     wit's end.  He opens the glove compartment, finds
     cigarettes, digs one out and lights it.

     He looks back to the motel room.

     He looks down to the glove compartment, at his CELLULAR
     PHONE.  After a moment, Welles picks up the phone, looks at
     it in his hand.

     IN THE LOT

     Welles gets out of the car, gets up on the hood, lays back,
     staring at the sky.  He closes his eyes, smokes.

     Welles opens the phone, looks at the illuminated numbers.
     He digs in his suit jacket pocket, takes out his notepad,
     pages through, studies one page.

     Welles sits up.  He gathers himself, throws his cigarette,
     dials a number, puts the cellular to his ear, afraid...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Hello... ?

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you
                 remember, I was there a few weeks
                 ago... asking about your daughter...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 I remember.  You just left...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 I have to tell you something.  It
                 won't be easy for you to hear.  It's
                 about your daughter... Mary Anne...
                       (struggling)
                 When I... when I was there with you,
                 her diary, in your attic, in
                 silverware.  If you read it, you'll
                 know what I'm telling you is true... 

     Welles climbs off the car, paces, aching with misery...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 What are you talking about... ?

                             WELLES
                 She went to California, to Los
                 Angeles... she wanted to start over.
                 She wanted to be an actress...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 What... ?

     Tears comes to Welles' eyes.  It's the hardest thing he's
     ever had to do in his entire life.

                             WELLES
                 Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead.
                 She's dead.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Who is this... ?

                             WELLES
                 Someone... some men, they took your
                 daughter and they drugged her, and
                 they took her to a motel room...
                 they did terrible things to her...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 Who are you?

                             WELLES
                 They brought her into the room...
                 one man, he put a knife to her
                 throat and he raped her...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No...

                             WELLES
                 He raped her and...and...and he
                 murdered her...he cut her up with
                 knifes...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 No... no... no...

                             WELLES
                 They killed her, and they took her
                 out in the forest somewhere and they
                 buried her...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 Why... why are you doing this to
                 me... ?

                             WELLES
                 They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm
                 sorry.  It happened a month after
                 she ran away.  She's been dead all
                 this time...

     MRS MATHEWS is HEARD SCREAMING, letting out a CHOCKING SOB.
     Welles falls back against the car, holds his head, weeping...

                             WELLES
                 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... there
                 wasn't anything anyone could do...

     Welles pushes disconnect, lowers the phone, drops it to the
     ground, utterly drained.  He puts his forearm over his eyes,
     gasping, sucking air...

     He looks to the motel room, tamping down his sorrow, willing
     it to fuel his rage...

     He takes out his gun, hands unsteady, determined, opens the
     gun and pours the bullets out.  He closes the gun and walks
     towards the motel room...

     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles SHOVES the door aside.  The door's hinge breaks and
     the door falls...

     Eddie sits propped up against one wall, turns to look...

     The door SLAMS to the floor.

     Welles moves forward, enraged, closing on Eddie, raising his
     arm with the gun grasped by the butt...

     Eddie's eyes go wide with fear...

     Welles SWINGS the gun down at Eddie's head...

     EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     The only SOUNDS come from the NIGHT FOREST.  CRICKETS and
     distant BIRDS.  We can't see anything but the TOTAL DARKNESS
     through the open door of the room.  A CAR is HEARD, getting
     LOUDER as it passes, FAINTER as it gets further away.

     Finally, Welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying
     himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered
     red.  His gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood.

     Welles looks back into the room, backing away.  He turns and
     goes to his car...

     IN THE CAR

     Welles climbs in the driver's side, shoves his bloody gun
     into his holster, tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his
     shirt, revolted.  He starts the car. 

     INT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles enters and crosses through...

     INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Welles goes to the kitchen sink, turns on the water, starts
     scrubbing his bloody hands, using dishwashing liquid,
     scrubbing his hands desperately under running water.

     EXT.  EDDIE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT

     Welles comes out of the house, goes to open the rear door of
     Eddie's car, looking through BOXES of Eddie's belongings...

     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles comes up the stairs with a BOX, dumps the contents
     onto the living room floor: it's CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, Eddie's
     collection from the office, HUNDREDS of PHOTOS...

     INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Welles pulls open Eddie's cabinets, searching.  He finds
     POTS and PANS, choosing a few of the largest...

     EXT.  EDDIE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT

     Welles uses a cut piece of GARDEN HOSE, siphoning GAS out
     from Eddie's car, filling several kitchen POTS...

     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles comes up the stairs, carries POTS of gasoline, dumps
     the gasoline onto the pile of PHOTOGRAPHS...

     INT.  EDDIE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles dumps gasoline over Eddie's bed...

     INT.  LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles stands at the pile of gasoline soaked photos, taking
     out a MATCHBOOK, lighting one, lighting the whole book...

     EXT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Welles walks down the dark hill, heading to his car.  He
     gets in, starts the car and drives downhill, leaving the
     headlights off.  BEHIND, the windows of Eddie's ramshackle
     HOUSE grow bright as FIRE SPREADS and CURTAINS BURN.


     INT.  LOS ANGELES AIRPORT -- NIGHT

     Welles stares ahead, in fresh shirt and suit, waiting at a
     CHECK-IN COUNTER. 

     The female AIRLINE AGENT behind the counter types in her
     COMPUTER, stamps his ticket.

     Welles shifts his gaze, something catches his eye...

     Beside a stapler on the counter, a PAIR of SCISSORS.

                             AGENT
                 There you are, Mr. Welles, confirmed
                 through to Kennedy.  Gate 32B.

     Welles stares, fixated on the SCISSORS.

                             AGENT
                 Mr. Welles?

     Welles looks to the agent holding up the ticket.

                             AGENT
                 Gate 32B.

     Welles accepts the ticket.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN MOTEL -- NIGHT

     The Empire State Building in the distance says NYC, and a
     CAMERA PAN DOWN says another seedy MOTEL...

     INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles sits at a small desk, looking through a PHONE BOOK,
     white pages, finds... "HOSPITALS."

     Welles picks up the PHONE, chooses a number, dials it...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Hello, can you connect me with the
                 duty nurse?
                      (waits)
                 Hello, this is Lieutenant Anderson
                 down here in the Thirteenth
                 Precinct.  I've got a helluva
                 problem I was hoping you could give
                 me a hand with.  We had a stabbing
                 incident a couple of days ago, and
                 it looks like the supposed victim
                 gave us a false name and address.
                 Can you tell me if you had an adult
                 male with an abdominal wound in you
                 ER in the last forty-eight hours?
                       (listens)
                 You'd remember this guy; a body-
                 builder, real big guy, five foot
                 eleven, with acne all over his chest
                 and back...
                       (listens)
                 Alright, thanks for your help. 

     Welles hangs up, uses a pen to cross out a number in the
     phone book, starts dialing the next number.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Welles lies on the bed, on the phone, rubbing his eyes.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 ... guy sticks out like a sore
                 thumb.  Five foot ten or eleven,
                 body-builder, bad acne...
                       (listen)
                 Okay, thanks anyway.

     Welles gets up, hangs up, brings the phone back to the desk.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING

     The PHONE BOOK'S open on the desk with nearly a hundred
     hospital phone numbers crossed out.

                             WELLES (O.S.)
                 ... abdominal wound.  You'd know him
                 if you saw him... 

     Light cuts into the room from between the curtains.  Welles
     paces, carrying the phone with him, weary.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 He's a body-builder, stands just
                 under six feet...

     Welles stops in his track, listening, suddenly attentive.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 That's right... covered in acne.
                 That's him, that's the guy.  Listen,
                 we, uh... we think he filed a bogus
                 report on this stabbing, gave us a
                 false name and address...
                       (listens)
                 Yes, I'll hold.

     Welles goes to the desk, takes out his notepad.  He starts
     feeling his pockets for his pen, can't find it, telephone
     book, searching, looks under the desk...

     Welles ducks under the desk to grab the pen off the floor.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Yes... yes.
                       (sits, writing in pad)
                 Christopher Higgins.  Thirty-
                 fifteen, Thirty Fifth Street.
                 Where?  Astoria, Queens.

     Welles is scribbling all this down in his notepad.


     EXT.  QUEENS STREET -- DAY

     A relatively quiet residential street.  HOMES are small, two
     story affairs, close together, each very much like its
     neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls.

     Welles' Ford comes slowly down the street.  CHILDREN in
     school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups.

     Welles parallel parks.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles turns off the engine.
     He's watching a HOUSE on the other side of the street.  The
     house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top,
     quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a
     GARAGE underneath, plastic PINK FLAMINGOS on the small lawn.

     Cars pass in the street.  Welles watches school children
     pass on the near sidewalk.  He slumps down a little in his
     seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side
     mirror, rolling up the window.

     Welles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun,
     pours bullets out and pockets them.  He picks up a PAPER BAG
     off the passenger seat and opens it.

     He takes out a long, thin metal FILE, pulling off the shrink
     wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb.

     Keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, Welles
     slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along
     the gun's inner barrel.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- LATER DAY

     Welles sits smoking a cigarette, watching the quaint house.
     He looks in his side mirror...

     There's a large CAR coming down the block with its turn
     signal on.  Welles slumps a little lower.

     The car passes, slowing.  The GARAGE DOOR of the quaint
     house begins to open. 

     Welles watches...
     Can't really see the driver of the car except for the back
     of his head, but he's huge.  It's a good bet it's Machine.
     Beside him in the passenger seat is a GREY HAIRED OLD WOMAN.

     The car pulls into the darkness of the quaint house's
     garage.  After a moment, the OLD WOMAN comes from the
     garage, walks with a cane, wears glasses.  She goes to the
     sidewalk, checks her MAILBOX, finds it empty.

     Welles watches.

     The old woman goes back to the garage.  She goes inside.
     The garage door closes behind her.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT

     Welles still watches the house.  There's a light on in one
     of the second floor windows, curtains closed.

     Welles yawns, shaking his head, trying to stay awake.

     At the quaint house, a light comes on in the front picture
     window.  Looks like a living room or dining room.  The old
     woman comes to sit at a table.

     Welles takes binoculars off the front seat...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS

     The old woman says something to someone we cannot see.
     She's at the dinner table, with a place setting in front of
     her.  After a moment, someone joins her...

     It's Machine, you can tell by his bulk, by his huge
     forearms.  The lacy curtains of the window block part of our
     view, so we never see his face.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles lowers the binoculars, still watching.

     Through the window across the street, Machine can be seen
     putting a plate of food in front of the old woman.  The old
     woman smiles up at him, says something.

     Machine goes to light two candles on the table with matches,
     then goes back to stand beside the old woman.

     Machine is seen from behind, bends to give the old woman a
     kiss on the cheek, then leaves the room.  The old woman
     starts to eat.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY

     Dawn light is just breaking.  Welles has fallen asleep,
     slumped low behind the wheel, snoring lightly.

     Welles awakens with a start, looking around, confused.  He
     calms, rubbing his eyes, wiping sweat from his features.

     ACROSS THE STREET

     The quaint house's garage door begins to rise.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles sees this, keeps low, watching...
     The big car backs out into the street.  The old woman's
     behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone.

     Welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror.

     ON THE STREET

     Welles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind
     him.  He starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all
     directions, making sure no one's around.

     Ahead, the garage door begins to close.

     Welles picks up the pace, trying not to look too
     conspicuous.  The garage door's halfway down...

     Welles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get
     there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes.

     ABOVE

     In ONE WINDOW of the quaint house, an eyeball is peering out
     from lacy curtains, then moves away and curtains fall shut.

     INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY

     Welles gets up, takes out his gun, brushing off.
     The garage is dark, full of BOXES and JUNK.  Welles moves
     towards the door to the house.

     INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY

     Machine, in T-shirt and jeans, seen only from behind, comes
     to a DRESSER and opens a bottom drawer.  His huge hands push
     clothing aside, digging deep to the bottom of the drawer,
     taking out the WRESTLING MASK.

     Machine stands straight, pulling the mask down over his head.

     INT.  BASEMENT -- DAY

     Welles enters from the garage, gun up.  The dank basement is
     small.  A PILE of LAUNDRY lies on the floor near a WASHING
     MACHINE. 

     SHEETS hang off several CLOTHES LINES strung across two
     metal poles.  Welles leads with his gun...

     He moves around the sheets, looking behind them.  There's a
     WOODEN STAIRCASE leading upstairs.  Welles starts up,
     treading lightly, trying not to make a sound...

     INT.  KITCHEN -- DAY

     Welles slowly opens the door to the kitchen, pointing his
     gun.  No one here.  The decor is feminine, neat and tidy.
     It's grandma's house, and it shows, with gaudy PRINT
     WALLPAPER everywhere, every shelf displaying HUMMEL
     FIGURINES or COLLECTORS PLATES.  Very Home Shopping Network.

     INT.  DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles slowly opens the swinging door, entering from the
     kitchen, sweeping the room with his gun.  No sign of
     Machine.  The whole house is dead quiet.

     He passes the dining room TABLE where he watched the old
     woman eat last night... passes fake PAINTINGS on the walls,
     of waterfalls and sunset mountain landscapes... moves into
     the living room area...

     Yellow shag CARPET.  A pink SOFA is covered in clear
     plastic, facing an old TELEVISION in faux-wooden cabinet.
     Welles heads for a staircase leading to the second floor.

     Welles creeps up the stairs...

     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     Welles comes up from the stairs, arrives at a closed DOOR.
     He opens the door.  It's a linen closet, with TOWELS and
     SHEETS on shelves, and a shelf of MEDICINE.

     Welles shuts the door and moves on.  There are TWO DOORS
     ahead, both closed.  Welles takes the one to the right...

     INT.  MACHINE'S BEDROOM -- DAY

     Welles pushes the door in, enters warily.  There's a
     constant SCRATCHING HEARD.  The room is like a child's,
     except the BED is huge.  Shelves are full of BOARDGAMES and
     COMIC BOOKS.  A DANZIG POSTER on the wall.  There's a RECORD
     PLAYER with LP RECORDS beside it.  A record turns on the
     turntable, the needle caught at the center, SCRATCHING...

     Welles eases his way over to the closet... reaching...
     Pulls it open, steps back, gun up.  Nothing.  Just clothing.

     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     Welles crosses, opens the door across the hall, enters...

     DOWN THE HALL, very slowly, Machine's head rises on the
     stairs, in the garish wrestling mask, peering.

     INT.  GRANDMA'S ROOM -- DAY

     Welles stays near the door, looks around.  There's a fuzzy
     sky-blue COMFORTER on the bed, fuzzy blue SLIPPERS nearby.
     Lots of bottles of MEDICINE on the bedside table.

     Welles lowers his gun, takes a step back, into the hall...

     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     Welles turns...
     Machine charges down the hall, screaming with rage, BOWIE
     KNIFE raised to kill...

     Welles brings his gun up, but Machine's upon him, stabbing...

     Welles catches Machine's hand, stops the knife.  Machine
     grips Welles' gun hand, shoving him back...

     Welles is SLAMMED against the wall, grappling, gun hand
     pinned.  Welles GUN GOES OFF, once... twice...

     BLOWING HOLES in the ceiling.  Machine's grunts, pushing the
     knife forward... closer to Welles, face... closer...

     Welles struggles, overpowered.  The tip of the horrible
     knife is inches away...

     Welles bends his knees, crouching, trying to gain distance
     from the blade...

     Machine pulls Welles gun hand lower, brings it against the
     swinging LAUNDRY CHUTE DOOR built into the wall, begins
     twisting Welles' hand back, trying to pry the gun loose...

     Welles looks out the corner of his eyes to his gun...

     Welles turns his gun hand, slowing struggling to aim the gun
     towards the knife, but it's awful close to his face...

     The knife's shaking, less than an inch from Welles' cheek...

     Welles shuts his eyes and turns his head, letting out a CRY,
     FIRES his gun...

     The bullet BLASTS Machine's knife, knocks it away!

     Machine recoils for a millisecond, but brings his now free
     hand to Welles' throat, choking him.  Welles' face reddens,
     bleeding from bullet fragments...

     Welles tries to pry Machine's fingers from his throat.

     Machine works on Welles' gun hand with violent, renewed
     effort -- SLAMS Welles' hand against the laundry chute...
     SLAMS it... SLAMS it... till Welles DROPS the GUN...
     The gun can be HEARD CLATTERING down the chute. 

     Machine brings his hand to join the other around Welles'
     throat.  Welles can't break the grip...

     Welles PUNCHES Machine's face, till blood runs out from the
     mask's nose hole, but it's having no effect...

     Welles brings his KNEE UP HARD -- into Machine's stomach!

     Machine falls to his knees with a ROAR, holds his already
     wounded stomach, bleeding through his shirt...

     Welles falls, clutching his throat, gasping.  He struggles
     to his feet, leaps past, headlong towards the stairs...

     Machine rises, charging after...

     ON THE STAIRCASE

     Welles is TACKLED from behind...
     Welles and Machine TUMBLE down the stairs, SMASHING the
     wooden railing, toppling a BOOKSHELF... LANDING HARD...

     Welles PUNCHES and KICKS, breaking free, running across the
     living room.  Machine rises to give chase...

     Welles grabs a dining room CHAIR and THROWS it...
     Machine knocks the chair aside, keeps coming.  Welles grips
     another chair, uses it to hold Machine off...

     Machine grips the chair by the legs.  Welles SHOVES forward,
     pushes Machine back, letting go...

     Welles dives under the dining table, crawling on his hands
     and knees, scrambling...

     Machine throws the chair, runs, leaps...
     Machine lands on the table, crawls to the far edge, GRABBING
     down with his meaty fists as Welles moves forward...

     Under the table, Welles jerks back, avoiding, then rises,
     extending his knees, PUSHING upwards from underneath...

     Welles FLIPS the table, throwing Machine to the floor...

     Welles charges towards the kitchen door, falls, gets up...
     Machine gets to his feet...

     IN THE KITCHEN

     Welles SHOVES through the swinging door...
     Machine BURSTS through, catching Welles, TACKLING him...

     Welles hits the floor with Machine on top.  Machine begins
     to rein PUNCHES down on Welles, head and back...

     Welles tries to cover up, taking a real beating...

     Machine rises, gripping Welles, LIFTING him, THROWS him...

     Welles SMASHES into shelves of knick-knacks over the kitchen
     sink, SHATTERING a WINDOW, landing on the sink and counter.

     Machine comes to grip Welles again, drags him across the
     counter, KNOCKING EVERYTHING to the floor...
     Machine SWINGS Welles, releases him...

     Welles SLAMS the refrigerator and slumps to the ground,
     tries to stay conscious, trying weakly to get back up...
     Machine comes to Welles, gets on his knees...

     Machine wraps his arm around Welles' neck from behind, gets
     him in a CHOKE HOLD, tightens his grip, cutting off Welles
     airway with his forearm...

     Welles tries to break Machine's impossible grip with one
     hand, begins searching the floor with his other hand...
     frantically feeling for anything he can use...

     Welles' face is blood red...

     Welles' hand grasps desperately... finds a FORK, grips it...

     Welles SWINGS the fork back, STABS it into Machine's thigh!

     Machine SCREAMS, releases Welles and falls back, reaching
     around to the fork...

     Welles gets to his knees, sucking air, turns to look...

     Machine crawls away, pulls the fork out with trembling
     fingers.  Beyond him, there's the BASEMENT DOOR.

     Welles gets to his feet, looking...
     He grabs a FRYING PAN off the counter, gripping it in both
     hands and moving towards Machine...

     Machine's getting up...
     Welles BASHES Machine in the face with an upward swing of
     the frying pan...

     Machine is sent backpedaling, CRASHING into the oven!

     Welles drops the pan, leaps over Machine, to the door...

     IN THE BASEMENT

     Welles comes down the stairs, falls when he gets to the
     bottom, barely has any strength left.  He looks all
     directions, sees the LAUNDRY CHUTE in the ceiling...

     Welles gets up, stumbling, falls to his knees at the PILE of
     dirty LAUNDRY, starts digging through it, searching
     desperately, throwing clothing aside...

     Behind, Machine comes down the stairs, a bloody mess...

     Welles searches the laundry pile... 

     Machine reaches the bottom of the stairs, heading for
     Welles.  Welles turns, has the GUN in hand, FIRES TWICE...
     HITTING Machine in the shoulder and stomach, knocking
     Machine a few steps backwards...

     Welles FIRES...

     Machine's HIT in the CHEST, falling back, into hanging
     laundry, pulling down the clothes line and sheets...

     Machine hits the ground, wrapped in sheets.

     Welles stands, still aiming the gun, pulls the trigger on an
     empty chamber.  Out of bullets.

     Machine's trying to pull free from the sheets, trying to get
     back up to his feet.  Welles lets out a sob, drops the gun,
     walking to Machine...

     Welles climbs onto Machine from behind, takes clothing line
     in hand, starts wrapping the cord around Machine's throat...

     Welles pulls back on the clothes line, pulling it tight...

     Machine tries to get his fingers around the cord.  Welles
     stands, pulling tighter, putting a foot on Machine's back,
     pulling the clothes line with all his might...

     The cord's cutting into Welles' hand, drawing blood.

     Machine, face down, lets out a gurgling sound, struggling,
     struggling... till he finally stops moving.

     Welles releases the cord, takes a step back, breathing hard,
     trembling.  He looks around the basement.

     Welles walks to pick up his gun, replaces the gun in his
     holster.  He stands looking at Machine.

     Welles walks to Machine, bends, grasps Machine wrestling
     mask, pulling it off.  He rolls Machine over...

     Welles stares down at Machine.  We never see Machine's face.

     INT.  KITCHEN -- DAY

     Welles comes up from the basement, slow, hurting.  He looks
     around at the damage done, looks down to see he's still
     holding Machine's mask.  He drops it.

     EXT.  QUAINT HOUSE -- DAY

     Welles crosses the street, going to his car.  He gets into
     his car, starts it, pulls out and drives away.


     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- DAY

     BIRDS SING.  KIDS are kicking around a soccer ball down the
     street.  Welles' Ford arrives, pulls into the driveway.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY -- DAY

     Welles comes in the front door, still a horrible mess.

                             WELLES
                 Hello?!  Amy?

     He waits.  The house is quiet.  No one home.


     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- LATER DAY

     Dusk.  A CAR comes down the street, slows...

     IN THE CAR

     Amy sits forward, seeing Welles' car in the driveway.
     Cindy's in a child safety seat in back.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY -- DAY

     Amy comes in the front door, carrying Amy.

                             AMY
                 Tom?!

     No answer.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY

     Any pushes the bedroom door open and looks in.  Welles is
     asleep on the bed, still in his clothing and shoes.  Amy
     watches him sleep, sad.

     Amy backs out of the room, pulls the door shut.


     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Dark.  Welles sleeps, still in bloody clothing.  He's
     restless, shifting, MUTTERING under his breath.  Bad dreams.

     Welles suddenly sits bolt upright in the bed, looking around
     the dark room, breathing hard.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Cindy's in her high-chair by the table.  Amy's at the
     KITCHEN SINK, washing vegetables, peeling potatoes.

     Welles comes to stand in the doorway behind her.  Amy turns
     to look at him.  It breaks her heart to see him so wounded,
     but she forces herself to continue working in the sink.

                             AMY
                 How much forgiveness do you think I
                 have in me?

     Welles comes into the kitchen, stands beside Cindy, puts his
     hand out and clasp's Cindy's tiny hand.

                             WELLES
                 I can't talk about it yet... not
                 yet.

     Amy keeps peeling potatoes, refuses to look at him.  Welles
     looks down at Cindy, pats Cindy's head, looks back at Amy.
     He stands looking at Amy for a long moment.


     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BACKYARD -- DAY

     Welles wears his fishing cap, pushing his lawn mower, mowing
     his yard.  He has done some healing, though his face is
     still swollen and terribly bruised.

     INT.  KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Welles feeds Cindy with one hand, eating his own dinner with
     the other.  Amy's across the table, eating, watching them.

     INT.  BASEMENT -- DAY

     Welles works on the WATER HEATER, wrench in hand, reading an
     instruction sheet.  He puts the sheet aside, uses the wrench
     to begin loosening one of the pipe fittings.

     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Welles drags two GARBAGE CANS from the garage to the street,
     leaving them by the mailbox, walking back to the house.

     INT.  BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles and Amy are in bed.  Amy's asleep, on her side,
     facing away from Welles.  Welles lays awake, on his back,
     staring up at the ceiling.

     INT.  SUPERMARKET AISLE -- DAY

     Welles pushes a cart down one aisle.  He looks at his LIST,
     takes a BOX of CEREAL off one shelf, puts it in the cart.

     INT.  SUPERMARKET CHECK-OUT -- DAY

     Welles waits in line with his cart.  It's a long line.
     He takes out his wallet, opens it.

     In the fold of the wallet, there's a PHOTO folded into
     quarters.  Welles unfolds it and looks at it dolefully.
     It's the PHOTO of Mary Anne Mathews, the image Welles
     printed from early in the snuff film.  Sad girl. 

     Welles folds in back up, puts it in another pocket.  He
     looks forward in the line to see if it's moving.

     EXT.  SUPERMARKET -- DAY

     Welles transfers BAGS of GROCERIES from the shopping cart
     into the back seat of his Ford.

     INT.  WELLES' FORD -- DAY

     Welles drives on the HIGHWAY, groceries in back.  He watches
     the roadway ahead.  There's little traffic.

     Welles glances down, turns on the RADIO.  Some CLASSICAL
     MUSIC PLAYS.  Welles stares forward through the windshield.

     After a moment, Welles turns the RADIO OFF.  He drives.  The
     ONLY SOUND is the DRONE of the ENGINE and TIRES.

     Welles is suddenly overwhelmed by emotion, eyes filling with
     tears.  He tries to fight it, but can't help himself.  His
     face contorts with sorrow and he cannot stop crying, letting
     out a loud WAIL of misery...

     EXT.  HIGHWAY -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles' car moves to the shoulder, brakes to a sudden HALT.

     INT.  WELLES' FORD -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles takes great deep breathes and lets them out, over and
     over again, wiping at his tears.  He lets out a little high-
     pitched WHINE from far back in his throat...

                             WELLES
                 Why... why... ?

     He's wracked by SOBBING.


     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, CINDY'S ROOM -- DAY

     Amy's in a chair, reading a BOOK, not far from Cindy's crib.
     Cindy's asleep.  The FRONT DOOR of the house is HEARD
     OPENING and CLOSING from far off in the house.  Amy looks up
     momentarily, then returns to reading.

     FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming through the house, getting
     CLOSER.  Amy looks up from her book.  The bedroom door's
     open a crack.  The door slowly pushes open.  Welles stands
     there, eyes red from crying.

                             AMY
                 Tom... ?

     Welles comes into the room, stands before Amy.  He gets to
     his knees, puts his head in Amy's lap, wraps his arms around
     her waist.  Amy holds him, worried, eyes filling with tears.

                             WELLES
                 I have to tell you... I have to tell
                 you what happened.  I have to tell
                 you everything, but we can't tell
                 anyone else.  No one else can ever
                 know.

     Amy runs her fingers through his hair, bends down to rest
     her head on his back, holding him with her eyes closed.
     Welles holds tighter.

                             WELLES
                 You're all I've got.  You're all
                 I've ever had.
                       (pause)
                 You're the only one who can save me.

     INT.  MIAMI AIRPORT, TERMINAL -- DAY

     Amongst the weary tourist families and solitary businessmen
     sits TOM WELLES, middle-aged, hair neat, suit crisp and
     gray.  He's eating crackers from a cellophane package,
     sipping soda from a paper cup, watching an ARRIVAL GATE.

     AT THE GATE

     PASSENGERS arrive: the paunchy, graying men of First Class
     leading the pack, except for a handsome YOUNG REPUBLICAN
     poster boy hurrying along.

     ACROSS THE TERMINAL

     Welles gets up and FOLLOWS...

     EXT.  MIAMI AIRPORT, CURBSIDE -- DAY

     Welles comes outside, squinting in the sun, moving down the
     sidewalk, looking back over his shoulder...

     The Young Republican is lead to a waiting LIMO by a DRIVER.

     Welles moves to the nearby TAXI STAND...

     INT.  TAXI -- DAY

     Welles gets in, turning in his seat to watch behind.

                             CAB DRIVER
               Where to?

     Welles keeps watching, sees the limo pull away and pass.

                             WELLES
               Follow that limousine.  Don't get
               too close, don't let it get too far
               away.  Just keep with it.

                             CAB DRIVER
               You kidding?

                             WELLES
               Nope.

     The cab set in motion.  Welles takes out cigarettes,
     lighting one, takes out a small NOTEPAD and makes notations.

                             CAB DRIVER
               Uh, listen... you're not supposed to
               be smoking in here.  I'm sorry,
               that's company policy...

                             WELLES
               How about this... every cigarette I
               smoke, I give you five dollars?

                             CAB DRIVER
               Okay... okay, yeah, that'd be good...


     EXT.  MIAMI BEACH, "GOLD COAST" -- DAY

     In front of an Art Deco hotel, the driver opens the
     limousine door and the Young Republican steps out. 

     ACROSS THE STREET 

     Welles watches from inside the double-parked taxicab. 


     EXT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY 

     Not exactly four-star.  "AD LT MOVIES EVERY ROOM." 

     INT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY

     Welles is asleep on the bed, full dressed, hands folded
     across his stomach, snoring lightly, sweaty. 

     INT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE, RESTAURANT -- DAY 

     Welles sits alone at the bar, eating a sandwich, bored.  He
     watches some fuzzy ESPN on the t.v., looks at his watch. 

     EXT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY 

     Welles walks across the parking lot, gets into his RENTAL
     CAR, starts it and drives away. 


     EXT.  MIAMI BEACH DISCOTHEQUE -- NIGHT 

     Young Republican and a GAUDY WOMAN exit the disco, MUSIC
     THROBBING out from the doors behind them.  They join hands,
     drunk, heading to the street, looking for their limo. 

     DOWN THE STREET

     Welles is seated in his parked rental car, raises a CAMERA
     with TELEPHOTO LENS: whir, CLICK, whir, CLICK, whir, CLICK...
     Welles lowers the camera, letting out a yawn. 


     INT.  AIRPLANE, COACH -- NIGHT 

     The familiar DRONE of flight.  Welles is shoehorned into his
     aisle seat, using tiny utensils to eat his tiny meal.

     An OLDER WOMAN arrives in the aisle.  Welles picks up his
     tray, closes his tray table, unbuckling his seatbelt,
     struggling to get up... finally successful, balancing his
     tray, letting the woman in to the window seat. 

                             OLDER WOMAN 
                 Thank you. 

     Welles nods, forcing a smile, sitting back down.  He returns
     to toiling over his miniature supper. 


     EXT.  HARRISBURG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT 

     Welles' AIRPLANE ROARS down with a SCREECH, landing lights
     gleaming.  The airport is small, relatively isolated.

     TITLE:      Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

     INT.  HARRISBURG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT

     Passengers arrive.  Welles is with them, searching the few
     PEOPLE waiting in the terminal hallway.  Welles smiles...

     Welles' wife, AMY, smiles when she sees him.  She's plain
     and pretty, holding one hand on a BABY STROLLER beside her.
     Welles comes to her, embracing her, appreciating her.

                             AMY
                 Welcome home.

                             WELLES
                 Do you know how much I missed you?

     They kiss, but Amy pulls away, sniffs him.

                             AMY 
                 What's this... have you been
                 smoking... ? 

                             WELLES 
                 Smoking?  I'm not smoking. 

                             AMY 
                 Your clothing reeks of it. 

                             WELLES 
                 You know, Amy, I've been sitting
                 around in bars and everywhere
                 following this guy... I mean, is
                 this what I get first thing?  Before
                 you even "hello," you accuse me... ?

                             AMY 
                 I'm not accusing you... 

                             WELLES 
                 Well, I'm not smoking, okay? 

                             AMY 
                 Okay, I believe you. 

                             WELLES 
                 We've been all through that.  I've
                 been on my best behavior.

     Welles bends to the stroller, picks up his infant daughter,
     CINDY, and hoists her in the air, overjoyed. 

                             WELLES 
                 Hello, pumpkin-head, did you miss
                 me?  I sure missed you... 

     He kisses the happy child, holding her in one arm. 

                             WELLES 
                 Let's get my bags and get the hell
                 out of here. 

     Welles pulls Amy close and kisses her again, leads the way.
     Amy follows, pushing the stroller. 

                             AMY 
                 How's the detective business?

                             WELLES 
                 Business was fine.  I'll tell you
                 what, you couldn't pay me enough to
                 live down there. 

                             AMY 
                 You better not be smoking, that's
                 all I can say. 

                             WELLES 
                 Honey, I'm not, please... 

     Amy takes Welles hand, smiling at him. 


     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles and Amy make love in the darkness.  Standard,
     missionary position sex, little passion.  They slow to a
     finish, uneventfully, holding each other.  Their breathing
     quiets.  Their daughter CINDY can be HEARD CRYING elsewhere.

     Welles kisses his wife again, rolls off of her and sits on
     the edge of the bed.  Amy covers herself. 

                             AMY
                 I love you.

                             WELLES
                 I love you. 

     He looks towards her in the dark.  He gets up, gets a towel
     from the bathroom and wraps it around him. 

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BABY'S ROOM -- NIGHT 

     Cindy's crying.  Welles enters, goes to lean into the crib.

                             WELLES 
                 What's all the trouble, Cinderella?
                 What are you crying about, huh? 

     He lifts and cradles Cindy, comforting her. 


     EXT.  HARRISBURG CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING --DAY 

     A small city of moderate architecture facing the Susquehanna.

     INT.  OFFICE -- DAY 

     An old money office with windows over the river.  A well-to-
     do POLITICIAN looks unhappily through PHOTOS on his desk.
     Welles sits by the Pennsylvania state flag, watching.

     PHOTOS show the Young Republican and Gaudy Woman in Miami:
     leaving the Art Deco hotel, the Discotheque, a restaurant...

                             WELLES 
                 Your son-in-law dealt with the dry
                 cleaning franchise during the day,
                 saw that woman every night. 
                       (clears his throat) 
                 The specifics are in the report, and
                 information about the woman.  It's
                 unpleasant, I know.  I apologize... 

                             POLITICIAN 
                 None too discreet, is he? 

                             WELLES 
                 No, sir, he is not. 

                             POLITICIAN 
                 He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn
                 my daughter, but what can you do? 

     The politician shakes his head in disgust.  Welles rises. 

                             WELLES 
                 The um... you'll find my invoice in
                 the envelope. If that's all...

                             POLITICIAN 
                 Yes, Mister Welles, thank you. 

                             WELLES 
                 Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever
                 be of further assistance.

     Welles leaves, glances back, shuts the door. 

     EXT.  HARRISBURG STREETS -- DAY 

     Welles drives his plain Ford past the CAPITAL BUILDING. 

     EXT.  HARRISBURG, BRIDGE -- DAY 

     Welles' car crosses the Susquehanna, leaving the city. 

     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BACKYARD -- DAY 

     Sunny day.  Welles wears tan khakis, T-shirt and fishing
     cap, mowing his lawn with his ROARING lawnmower.  Welles'
     yard is modest, surrounding his modest split level suburban
     one in a neighborhood of similar homes and similar yards.

     Welles turns the lawnmower, stopping to mop his brow.  One
     of his neighbors is repainting a back porch.  The neighbor
     waves.  Welles waves, resumes mowing. 


     INT.  BOWLING ALLEY -- NIGHT

     MUSIC'S LOUD.  League Night.  Every lane full.  Welles is
     with his team in BOWLING SHIRTS.  Welles hoists his ball,
     preparing to bowl.  He takes three steps, releases...

     Down the lane, PINS SCATTER.  One pin remains standing.

     Welles balls up his fists and curses, walks back towards his
     rowdy, mocking teammates.  He shouts back at them, laughing,
     grabbing his beer and drinking, waiting at the ball return. 

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT 

     Dinner.  Welles and Amy eat at the kitchen table with Cindy
     in a high chair.  Amy feeds Cindy between bites.  Welles is
     still in his league shirt. 

                             AMY 
                 You think you'll have time for the
                 water heater this weekend?

                             WELLES 
                 Sure.  I'll call the guy. 

                             AMY 
                 You're not using the same guy who
                 tried to fix it? 

                             WELLES 
                 I'm not using him again for
                 anything.  He was worthless. 
                       (eating)
                 You have bridge here Saturday? 

                             AMY 
                 Betty's out of town so we're playing
                 next week. 

     Welles nods, eating.  He watches Amy feed Cindy.  The PHONE
     starts RINGING.  Welles goes to answer it. 

                             WELLES 
                       (into PHONE) 
                 Hello.  Yes... could you hold on a
                 minute...?

     Welles hands the phone to Amy, pats Cindy's head as he heads
     downstairs, through the LIVING ROOM... 

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles enters his well kept OFFICE, turns on a light at the
     desk.  The room is filled with FILE CABINETS and shelves of
     BOOKS, hundreds of PHONE BOOKS and a COPY MACHINE.  Welles
     picks up the phone and cups the receiver. 

                             WELLES 
                       (shouts upstairs)
                 Okay, I've got it.
                       (into phone)
                 Hello... sorry, I was switching
                 phones.  It's a pleasure to make
                 your acquaintance, Mrs. Christian.
                       (listens)
                 Yes.  Yes, I understand... tomorrow
                 evening should be fine...

     Welles listens, clears space on his desk, taking notes. 


     EXT.  CHRISTIAN COMPOUND -- DUSK 

     A huge OLD WORLD MANSION is situated at the center of acres
     of Pennsylvania forest and vast gardens.  Welles' car heads
     down a long tree lined drive, to the dark mansion. 

     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT 

     Welles follows a BUTLER down a long hall. 

     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, LIBRARY -- NIGHT 

     The butler shows Welles in, shuts the door.
     Towering SHELVES of BOOKS are serviced by ladders.  Far
     across the room, an old, sad woman, MRS. CHRISTIAN, sits
     waiting with a tall, thin, sinister ghoul of a LAWYER.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Mister Welles. You're very prompt.   

                             WELLES 
                 I try to be.

     Welles crosses towards them. It takes a while. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I appreciate your coming on such
                 short notice. 

     Mrs. Christian holds out her hand and Welles takes it. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 This is Mister Longdale, my late
                 husband's attorney. 

     Welles shakes Longdale's limp hand, looking him over. 

                             WELLES 
                 Uh huh, pleasure. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Apparently Mr. Longdale has
                 something he feels he simply must
                 say before you and I speak.

                             LONGDALE 
                 Yes, I do have something to say.  I
                 insisted on being here as soon as I
                 heard Mrs. Christian contacted you. 

                             WELLES 
                 I'm listening. 

                             LONGDALE 
                 As Mr. Christian's attorney and one
                 of the executors of his estate, it
                 concerns me that a meeting of this
                 sort should take place without my
                 being asked to attend. 

                             WELLES
                 Of what sort? 

                             LONGDALE
                 You are a private investigator? 

                             WELLES 
                 That's right. 

                             LONGDALE 
                 Well, whatever reasons Mrs.
                 Christian has for engaging the
                 services of a private investigator,
                 I should certainly be a party to.
                 But, since she feels differently, I
                 can only go on the record as having
                 expressed my adamant disapproval. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Yes, how theatrical.  So you've gone
                 on the record, and now perhaps you
                 should just be gone. 

     Longdale's irritated, but has no choice.  He walks away. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Have a pleasant evening. 
                       (to Welles) 
                 Will you have tea, Mister Welles? 

                             WELLES
                 Thank you. 

     Mrs. Christian begins pouring tea from the service on a
     table.  Welles watches Longdale exit. 

                             WELLES 
                 He's odd.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 He's a lawyer.
                       (offers tea)
                 Please, sit, here...

     Welles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer, taking a seat.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I've spoken to friends of mine and
                 my husband's, in Harrisburg, in
                 Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about
                 you.  I must say you have friends in
                 influential places. 

                             WELLES
                 I've been privileged to provide
                 services for people I admire.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 You are highly recommended.  Praised
                 for your discretion... your strict
                 adherence to confidentiality. 

     Welles nods, sipping tea. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 As you know, my husband passed away
                 recently.  Two weeks ago now.

                             WELLES 
                 My condolences. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 His passing has left me with...
                 something of a dilemma.  A terrible,
                 terrible dilemma. 

                             WELLES 
                 I'll do whatever I can to help. 

     Mrs. Christian studies Welles.

     INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Mrs. Christian and Welles enter.  This office has been lived
     in for a lifetime.  Giant DESK.  AMERICAN FLAG.  Walls
     covered in old b+w PHOTOGRAPHS and ACHIEVEMENTS. A large,
     baked enamel sign nailed up, "CHRISTIAN STEEL." 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 His inner sanctum. 

     Welles looks up at the OIL PAINTING over the fireplace: MR.
     CHRISTIAN, a powerful, old man, posed with a dark, teeming,
     industrial landscape behind him. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Not many people have been inside
                 this room. 

     Welles examines PHOTOS of Mr. Christian visiting various
     STEEL PLANTS, COAL MINES and ground-breaking ceremonies,
     shaking hands with WORKMEN, with POLITICIANS. 


                             WELLES 
                 Pittsburgh? 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Mostly.  That's where he started his
                 empire building.
                       (looks up at portrait)
                 He was a good man.  Notorious as an
                 eccentric, but that was something he
                 cultivated.  He wanted to be
                 legendary.

                             WELLES 
                 He succeeded. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 We were married forty-five years.
                 Hard even for me to imagine.  We had
                 our troubles.  There were plenty of
                 places for him to be other than
                 here, but he was always loyal to me,
                 and I to him.  I loved him deeply.

     Welles waits. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles? 

                             WELLES 
                 I wear a gun when I can tell a
                 client expects me to.  Other than
                 that, there's never any reason. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Just curious. 

     Mrs. Christian crosses to take down a PICTURE, revealing a
     WALL SAFE.  The safe is ajar, burnt and scarred, broken into.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 My husband was the only one with the
                 combination to this safe.  I knew
                 about it, but as far as I was
                 concerned it was none of my
                 business.  Not till now, that is. 

                             WELLES 
                 You hired someone to open it.  I'll
                 bet the lawyer loved that.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 There was nothing he could do.  My
                 husband left everything to me.
                       (looks at safe)
                 I prevented anyone from seeing the
                 contents.  I felt these were my
                 husband's private things.  I
                 didn't... I didn't realize... 

                             WELLES 
                 Do you want to tell me what you
                 found? 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Cash, stock certificates, and this...

     She takes something from her pocket, puts it on the desk: a
     plastic bag containing a short 8MM FILM on a plastic reel.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 It's a film... of a girl being
                 murdered. 

                             WELLES 
                 I'm afraid I don't... 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 This is a movie showing a girl being
                 murdered.  She's sitting on a bed,
                 and a man rapes her... and he begins
                 to cut her with a knife...
                       (pause)
                 I only watched what I could.

     Welles picks up the film, looks at it. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I didn't know what to think.  I
                 can't tell you how horrible it's
                 been, to know this belonged to my
                 husband.  To know that he watched
                 this... this atrocity.  But, I can't
                 go to the police...

                             WELLES
                 Mrs. Christian... please, will you
                 sit down a moment? 
                       (leads her to a chair) 
                 I want you to listen carefully.
                 What you're talking about is a
                 "snuff film."  But, from what I
                 know, snuff films are a kind of...
                 urban myth.  Like, red light
                 district folklore.  There's no such
                 thing, I can assure you. 

     Mrs. Christian shakes her head. 

                             WELLES 
                 Please, believe me.  This is
                 probably a stag film.  Simulated
                 rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might
                 seem real, but there are ways of
                 making it look realistic... fake
                 blood and special effects...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 No. 

                             WELLES 
                 If you were to study it you'd see
                 the camera cutting away... you'd see
                 the tricks they can play...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I'm telling you it's not that. 

                             WELLES 
                 I'm sure it is. 
                       (smiles) 
                 It's probably something your husband
                 was given as a bad joke.  More than
                 likely he never even watched it. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Will you watch it and see for
                 yourself? 

                             WELLES 
                 Of course.  But, I'm certain it's
                 nothing to worry about. 


     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 

     An 8MM PROJECTOR faces a wall.  Welles looks back to Mrs.
     Christian in the doorway.  Mrs. Christian leaves, shuts the
     door.  Darkness.  Welles turns on the projector and sits.
     The PROJECTOR CLATTERS, shooting bright images...

     ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, over exposure, then... the grainy
     FILM is HAND HELD, constantly in motion, showing a skinny
     GIRL, 16 or 17, in a negligee, sitting on a bed in a
     nondescript room with little furniture.  Looks like a hotel
     room.  We only ever see three walls.  The once beautiful
     girl looks worn, drugged, dark circles under her eyes,
     staring blankly.  The CAMERA'S tungsten SPOTLIGHT casts
     long, shifting shadows as the camera moves, but the girl
     still stares oblivious.  The bed is wrapped in PLASTIC and
     DUCT TAPE.  The floor is covered by PLASTIC SHEETING...

     Welles watches, crossing his arms, already uncomfortable.

     ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a
     bathroom, and a MASKED MAN enters.

     The Masked Man wears a garish, Mexican WRESTLING MASK with
     eye holes and a mouth.  The mask covers his entire head.
     He's naked except for red shorts, his body scrawny, oiled,
     pale.  The man goes to stand in front of the girl.  He seems
     to be saying something to her, but the film is silent and
     the ONLY SOUND is the PROJECTOR'S LOUD sprocket hole
     CLATTER.  It's all one long take.  The CAMERA MOVES to favor
     the girl...

     Welles sits straight in his chair, wary.

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man raises his open hand and SLAPS the
     girl, knocking her back on the bed...

     Welles grimaces.

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man pulls the girl back to a seated
     position.  The girl's like a rag doll, face reddened, eyes
     closed, but she remains upright.  Masked Man uses his thumbs
     to open her unseeing eyes.  He touches her mouth with his
     fingers, presses his lips to hers.  Then, Masked Man backs
     away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked
     Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid
     out.  Masked Man runs his fingers over the blades...

     Welles rises slowly, still watching.

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man selects a huge Bowie knife and moves
     back towards the girl...

     Welles crosses his arms tight, disbelieving, fearful.
     WE WILL NEVER SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THE FILM, but Welles
     does.  In the flickering, reflected light, Welles backs
     involuntarily away from the horrible images, holding his
     fist to his mouth, breathing hard.

     Welles keeps backing away, till he's backed against a wall.
     The PROJECTOR'S CLATTERING.  Welles is sickened, sweating,
     still watching, till he finally shuts his eyes.

     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, ADJOINING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Silence.  Mrs. Christian sits waiting, troubled.
     The door to the dining room opens and Welles enters from the
     dark, visibly shaken.  Mrs. Christian watches him, her
     sorrow now shared.

                             WELLES
                 You... you need to go to the police. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I told you I can't, not yet. 

                             WELLES
                 You don't have any other choice. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                       (stands, shakes her head) 
                 No.  For me to live with the ruin of
                 my husband's name, I need know that
                 whoever did this will be punished.
                 If you can find them, I will take
                 their names to the police.  I'll say
                 my husband confessed on his death
                 bed. I'll say I didn't have courage
                 to come forward at first...

                             WELLES 
                 It won't work like that.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Any evidence you collect can be
                 given to the police later,
                 anonymously.  I've thought about it
                 and there's no other way.  If you
                 can't find them... if the only thing
                 that comes from this film is that
                 this is all my husband will be
                 remembered for, well I can't let
                 that happen.  I'm telling you I
                 won't.  If there's no chance that
                 poor girl's memory can be served,
                 then I'll just have to spend my last
                 days trying to forget her. 

     Welles sits, rests his head in his hands. 

                             WELLES 
                 I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate
                 investigations...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 You've found missing persons before. 

                             WELLES 
                 Nothing remotely like this. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I know what I'm asking.  Your
                 compensation will be appropriate to
                 the risk.  You'll need cash to buy
                 information, and I'll provide it.
                       (pause)
                 I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.
                       (pause)
                 You saw what he did to her.

     Welles stands, torn apart and uncertain, looks back to the
     dining room where the projector sits idle.


     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BABY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Cindy is sound asleep in her crib.
     Welles is seated near, staring at his sleeping child.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles digs in piles of SHOEBOXES and BOOKS on the floor of
     his cluttered closet, finds what he wants: a LOCK BOX.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Welles twists the lock box dial's combination, opens the box
     to reveal his GUN, HOLSTER and CLEANING SUPPLIES.  Welles
     takes out the gun, cleaning it.  Amy watches.

                             WELLES 
                 This is the mortgage.  This is
                 Cindy's college money. 

                             AMY
                 I understand.

                             WELLES 
                 Sometimes you can't know what I'm
                 doing.  It's better that way.

                             AMY
                 I know.

                             WELLES 
                 It's a missing persons case... a
                 long shot.  I'll give it two months,
                 two months at most, then I'll be
                 back.  We'll take a vacation.

                             AMY
                 Why the gun? 

                             WELLES 
                 I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even
                 wear it.  It's a precaution.
                       (cleaning gun)
                 Don't worry about me.


     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles looks through one file cabinet.  He pulls out a FILE.
     It contains all sorts of POLICE ARTIST SKETCHES.  Welles
     finds one of a TEENAGE GIRL with dark hair, looks at it.

     Welles positions the sketch on his COPY MACHINE, hits copy.

     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE, DRIVEWAY -- MORNING

     Welles loads BOXES and a SUITCASE into his car's back seat.

     Welles puts the lock box in the car's trunk, in a hiding
     place beside the spare tire.  He places a brown BRIEFCASE on
     top, covers them both with carpet.  He closes the trunk.

     EXT.  PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE -- MORNING 

     Little traffic.  Welles' Ford races down the highway.


     EXT.  CLEVELAND CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

     City skyline, overcast.  Looks like rain.

     TITLE:       Cleveland, Ohio

     EXT.  CLEVELAND STREETS -- DAY

     Welles' car moves slowly in a not-so-great neighborhood.
     Welles leans forward, peering through the windshield...

     An APARTMENT BUILDING'S crooked SIGN lists "WEEKLY RATES."

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM, CLEVELAND -- DAY

     Dingy room.  Welles locks the door, puts the chain on. His
     suitcase and boxes are on the bed.  He begins unpacking,
     taking a PHOTO ENLARGER from one box and an 8MM PROJECTOR.

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM, BATHROOM -- DAY

     The developer's on the toilet.  DEVELOPING PANS are on the
     floor, developer bath, stop bath and fixing bath, with
     BOTTLES of CHEMICALS and packages of PHOTO PAPER.  Welles
     uses tape and ALUMINUM FOIL to black-out a window.

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- DAY

     Pizza box on the bedside table.  Welles' suits hang in the
     closet.  Welles sits facing a small REEL TO REEL on a desk.
     He wears white gloves, handles the 8MM FILM, careful to hold
     it by the edges, holding it up to the light, squinting.

     Welles puts in a magnifying EYEPIECE, leaning close...

     WELLES' P.O.V. THROUGH MAGNIFYING LENS: studying the first
     few inches of exposed film, coming upon TINY LETTERS printed
     just below the sprocket holes: "SUPRAlux 544."
 
     INT.  WELLES' ROOM, BATHROOM -- DAY

     RED BULB in the light socket.  Welles threads the 8MM FILM
     into his enlarger, still in white gloves.

     He flicks the enlarger on, projecting a sideways IMAGE down
     onto the enlarger's baseboard, FOCUSING... it's the girl
     sitting on the bed, early in the snuff film.

     Welles makes an adjustment to the enlarger's lens; framing
     tighter on the girl's face, REFOCUSING.

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles comes out of the makeshift darkroom, holding a PHOTO
     of the girl.  He props the photo up on a dresser, stands
     looking at it.  Sad girl, staring forward.

     Welles goes to pick up his CELLULAR PHONE, dials.

                             WELLES 
                       (into phone) 
                 Hello, honey, it's me.
                       (listens)
                 I'm fine, how are you?

     Welles listens.  He turns to look at the girl's photo.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE -- DAY

     Nondescript.  "U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons."

     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, OFFICES -- DAY 

     Small.  Cubicles.  Employees work phones and computers.
     BULLETIN BOARDS are covered in FAMILY PHOTOS, Polaroids and
     familiar "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?" missing person/children POSTERS.

     IN ONE CUBICLE, Welles opens his billfold, shows his
     identification: a laminated "LICENSED INVESTIGATOR,
     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania", with WELLES' PHOTO...

     The DIRECTOR of the center, a tired looking official in
     bifocals, studies the card.  Welles sits.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?

                             WELLES 
                 Call me Tom.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Alright, Tom.

                             WELLES
                 What I'd like, very simply, is
                 access to your archive.  And, now I
                 understand this isn't something you
                 normally do for private citizens...

                             DIRECTOR 
                 There are reasons for the way we do
                 things here.

                             WELLES 
                 Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by
                 whatever decision you make, but I'd
                 appreciate if you'll hear me out... 

     The director sits back in his chair.

                             WELLES 
                 Few days ago, I was contacted by a
                 couple living in Philadelphia, a
                 doctor and his wife.  What happened
                 was they picked up a young girl
                 hitchhiking off 81, which heads into
                 Philadelphia, started up a
                 conversation with this girl, she
                 looked homeless, seemed about
                 eighteen maybe.  They convinced her
                 to let them buy her a meal in the
                 city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have
                 much to say, but they got a sense
                 she's a runaway, so all through
                 dinner the doctor's working on her,
                 trying to convince her that at the
                 very least she should pick up a
                 telephone.  Not surprisingly, she
                 ate her food, excused herself...
                       (snaps fingers)
                 That's the last they saw her.  The
                 reason they came to me for help, the
                 reason I'm coming to you, is we had
                 a friend of mine in the department
                 work up a sketch...
                       (shows the POLICE ARTIST
                        SKETCH he photocopied)
                 They want to see if I can I.D. this
                 girl, somehow pass along a message
                 to let the parents know the kid's
                 alive, doing alright.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or
                 N.C.M.E.C.? 

                             WELLES 
                 I figured you share information. 

                             DIRECTOR 
                 We do. 

                             WELLES 
                 For whatever reasons I thought you
                 might be more receptive.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Why don't they come to me? 

                             WELLES 
                 This doctor and wife, they're nice
                 people, but they don't want to get
                 too involved.  They're not trying to
                 have the parents come looking for
                 the girl either. 
                 You and I both know sometimes, not
                 often, but sometimes there's real
                 reasons why a kid'll run. 
                 Molestation, whatever.  Besides
                 that, the girl's probably eighteen,
                 so she's legal.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 I'm not so sure about this. 

                             WELLES 
                 They're putting themselves in place
                 of this kid's parents and thinking
                 they'd want to hear their girl's
                 okay, even if that's all they hear. 

                             DIRECTOR
                 I can give you my card, if your
                 clients want to call me... 

     Welles accepts a CARD, disappointed.

                             WELLES 
                 They were pretty clear they didn't
                 want this coming back on them.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry. 

     Welles looks at the director, stands, hangs his head.

                             WELLES 
                 Who knows... maybe she's already
                 given her parents a call, right?

     Welles leaves. 

     EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE -- DAY

     Welles comes out the front doors, pissed.

                             WELLES 
                 Fuck.

     He tears the card in half and drops it as he heads for his
     car.  After a moment, the director comes out after him...

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Excuse me... Tom, hold on...

     Welles looks back, walks back, glances down...
     makes sure he stands on the torn card, hiding it underfoot.

                             DIRECTOR
                 Listen, maybe I can help after all.
                 Why don't you come on back in...
                 we'll see what we can do. 

     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY

     Director leads Welles into this RESEARCH ROOM, a small
     library with long tables, old COMPUTERS, lots of FILE
     CABINETS and CARD CATALOGS.  Secretaries tend to the files.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 This is it.  It's not much. 
                       (points at computers) 
                 We've got less than five percent on
                 computer and we lose that funding in
                 December.  I'll have someone show it
                 to you anyway.  Other than that, I'm
                 afraid it's the wet thumb method.

     Welles looks to the many, many file drawers. 

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Files are mostly by state and year
                 of disappearance.  We try to keep
                 the children and adults separate.
                 No eating or smoking in here, but
                 there's a coffee machine in the hall.

                             WELLES 
                 Any good?

                             DIRECTOR
                 It's horrible, but it'll be your
                 best friend after a few days.  I
                 hope you realize what kind of long
                 shot you're chasing after. 

                             WELLES
                 You're gonna be seeing a lot of me.
                 You're sure you don't mind?

                             DIRECTOR 
                 It's good what you're doing.

     The director puts out his hand.  Welles looks, shakes.


     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     ON A COMPUTER SCREEN: files open and close -- PICTURE after
     PICTURE of a MISSING CHILDREN, mostly teenagers, each with
     physical description, age, date of disappearance, etc.  Lost
     souls, although these are posed portraits, high school
     yearbook photos and vacation photos, so the children are
     mostly smiling, happy and healthy. But, all "MISSING."

     Welles works the computer keyboard and mouse...

     ON THE SCREEN: the FACES of TEENAGERS, boys and girls, one
     after the other, MISSING... MISSING... MISSING...


     INT.  CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles searches the SHELVES of the LIBRARY.  He begins
     taking down various books...

     "Motion Picture Photography."  "Film Stocks and Physical
     Characteristics."  "Super 8 Filmmaking."

     INT.  CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- LATER -- MONTAGE

     In Welles' notepad: "SUPRAlux 544."
     Welles sits paging through technical photography books. 


     INT. WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded through the projector.  He
     turns the CLATTERING projector on and sits, watching.

     ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, then... the skinny GIRL in a
     negligee, sitting on the bed.  The CAMERA'S SPOTLIGHT casts
     long shadows.  The girl stares, oblivious...

     ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a
     bathroom, and the MASKED MAN enters, wearing the ghastly
     WRESTLING MASK.  The man goes to stand in front of the
     girl.  He seems to be saying something.  The FILM halts.

     Welles sits forward, hand on the projector.  He's seen
     something.  He PLAYS the FILM in REVERSE...

     ON THE WALL: the Masked Man walks backwards, away from the
     girl, backwards into the bathroom, door shutting...

     Welles stops the projector, not taking his eyes from the
     image.  He ADVANCES the film FRAME BY FRAME...

     FRAME BY FRAME... as the bathroom door opens, and the Masked
     Man enters... FRAME BY FRAME... as the Masked Man moves
     forward... door closing behind him... STOP...

     FREEZE FRAME: a THIRD MAN is reflected in the bathroom
     mirror.  Grainy and blurred, but he's in the room with the
     girl, standing there, captured in the mirror in this one
     brief instant just before the bathroom door closes.

     Welles walks to take a closer look, studying the almost
     ethereal image of the Third Man.


     EXT.  CLEVELAND STREET CORNER -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles is in a PHONE BOOTH, feeds many quarters into the
     phone, waiting, looking at his notepad. 

                             WELLES
                       (into PHONE) 
                 Hello, Mrs. Christian?  Tom Welles.
                 Here's where we stand.  I checked
                 the film stock and it's called Supra-
                 lux 544.  The company that made that
                 stock discontinued it in '92...
                       (listens)
                 Yeah, about five or six years ago.
                 Anyway, do what you can to dig up
                 your husband's old financial
                 records, look for anything out of
                 the ordinary...

     Welles is back at the computer, alone, drinking coffee.
     ON THE COMPUTER: endless PHOTOS of MISSING CHILDREN.
     The PHONE CALL CONTINUES in VOICE OVER:

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 Nobody really uses eight millimeter
                 film anymore, so we can assume there
                 are reasons our guys did.  First,
                 they could develop it themselves if
                 they had any sort of expertise.
                 Obviously, this isn't the kind of
                 movie you can just drop off at the
                 one-hour photo...

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles just stands, staring at the PHOTO of the GIRL.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 Second, the film that went through
                 the camera is what we've got.
                 There's no negative.  Unlike video,
                 it wasn't meant to be duplicated.
                 No reason for them to risk having
                 more than one copy of their murder
                 floating around...

     INT.  CLEVELAND BAR -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Local bar.  Welles sits drinking with the archive's
     director, talking, smiling at something the director said.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 There don't seen to be many
                 fingerprints on the film itself, but
                 I'm going to have to be careful to
                 leave them intact...

     INT.  MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles is tired, unshaven.  He's moved on to the physical
     files, at one table, looking through HUNDREDS of MISSING
     PERSON BULLETINS.  Secretaries tend to other files. 

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 It's okay for yours and your
                 husbands fingerprints to be on the
                 film, but you'll have to use me as
                 a middleman if you go to the police.
                 That way I don't have to explain why
                 my prints are on it...

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles sits with the PROJECTOR ON, watching the film again.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 There were three men.  Two are
                 obvious; the man in the mask and the
                 man running the camera, but I caught
                 a glimpse of a third man in a
                 mirror.  It's nothing that can be
                 used for identification, but he was
                 there, watching...

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man touches the girl's mouth, presses
     his lips to hers.  Masked Man backs away, leaving frame,
     till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked Man standing at a table
     with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid out...

     Welles notices something, puts the projector on FREEZE FRAME.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 So, there were three.  They would
                 have kept it small, wouldn't have
                 let anyone in on it they didn't have
                 to.  That's all for now... except,
                 I feel I should tell you... with
                 this looking like it happened at
                 least five or six years ago...

     Welles walks to the frozen IMAGE on the wall.  It shows the
     Masked Man's hands in frame, fingering the blades.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 Well, it's not very likely we'll
                 ever find out who this girl was. 
                       (listens) 
                 I will, I'll keep trying. Goodbye.

     V.O. PHONE CALL ends with the SOUND of the PHONE HANGING UP.

     ON THE WALL: there's a DARK SPOT on Masked Man's hand, on
     the arch between his index finger and thumb.  Grainy and
     hard to make out, but looks like a small TATTOO.

     INT.  WELLES ROOM, BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- END MONTAGE

     Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded into his photo enlarger,
     projecting the IMAGE we just saw down onto the baseboard.

     He re-frames, CLOSER ON the masked Man's hand, REFOCUSING...
     the black spot is a little clearer, looks like a small STAR
     tattoo on the back of Masked Man's hand.

     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY

     Welles sits hunched over the card catalog, still unshaven,
     drinking coffee, flipping through smaller PICTURES of
     MISSING CHILDREN in one drawer, one by one by one...

     Welles rolls his neck.  He looks to see the archive's
     director in the doorway.  The director nods, leaving.
     Welles gets back to it, stooped over the catalog.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     TITLE CARD:      three weeks later

     EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE -- DAY

     In the lot, Welles gets wearily from his car, smoking.  He
     tosses the cigarette, gets a Thermos off the front seat.

     INT.  MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY

     Welles pulls out a card catalog drawer labeled "North
     Carolina 1992," flipping through picture cards.  The FACES
     of TEENAGERS: a happy BOY with blue eyes... a red headed
     GIRL with freckles... a ruddy faced BOY... a pretty GIRL
     with a ribbon in her hair... a black GIRL in a pink dress...
     a blonde haired BOY with curly hair...

     Welles furrows his brow.

     He backtracks to the pretty GIRL with the ribbon in her hair.

     Welles sits straight.  He reaches into his pocket, hands
     shaking a little, takes out and unfolds the PHOTO he printed
     of the girl from the snuff film.  It's her.

     Welles compares the two pictures.  She's prettier in the
     card catalog photo, but it's her.

     Welles can't believe it, looks around.  Secretaries at other
     files don't even know he's there.  Welles pulls out his
     notepad, scribbling down INFORMATION off the card...

     Writing the girl's name: "Mary Anne Matthews."


     EXT.  INTERSTATE HIGHWAY -- NIGHT

     Welles, car races past, alone on the dark freeway.

     EXT.  FAYETTEVILLE CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

     Another small city.  Blue skies above.

     TITLE:     Fayetteville, North Carolina

     EXT.  PUBLIC LIBRARY -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

     Suburban library.  Kids play hop-scotch in the parking lot.

     INT.  FAYETTEVILLE LIBRARY, MICROFICHE ROOM -- DAY

     Welles works the MICROFICHE MACHINE, scrolling through old
     issues of the LOCAL NEWSPAPER, finds an ARTICLE headlined
     "Search Continues for Local Teen."

     There's a PICTURE of the GIRL, Mary Anne Mathews; the same
     picture Welles found in the Missing Person Archive.

     Welles reads the article, writing on a LEGAL PAD.

                                              TIME CUT:

     NEWSPRINT SCROLLS past on the MICROFICHE MACHINE, till...
     "No Leads in Girl's Disappearance."  Same picture.
     The date at the top: "July 12, 1992."

                                              TIME CUT:

     NEWSPRINT BLURS past... stops on a page of OBITUARIES.
     Top of the page: "September 4, 1993."

     CLOSE ON: "Mathews, Robert Steven, 1948-1993."
     "Dead in an apparent suicide, Robert Mathews was discovered
     yesterday morning in the basement of..."


     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, FAYETTEVILLE SUBURB -- DAY

     A tree-lined street of poor, boxy homes.  Welles' car parks
     in front of one HOUSE with a neglected lawn.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles, clean shaven, picks a CLIPBOARD with a file folder
     and his legal pad on it, thumbs pages.  He drums his
     fingers, opens the glove compartment, pulls out the car's
     registration, other papers and "Jiffy-Lube" service reports,
     uses them to pad the file.

     Welles takes a BOTTLE of COLOGNE from his pocket.  He
     considers it, opens the bottle, applies cologne to his neck.

     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- DAY

     Welles knocks, clipboard in hand.  A sad, middle-aged woman
     answers, MRS. MATHEWS, looking through the screen door.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Yes... ?

                             WELLES
                       (smiles)
                 Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's
                 Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed
                 investigator...

     Welles holds up his identification only long enough for Mrs.
     Mathews to see it looks official.

                             WELLES
                 I've been hired as an independent
                 contractor by the U.S. Resource
                 Center for Missing Persons as part
                 of an internal audit.  If you have
                 any time over the next few days, I'd
                 like to make an appointment to ask
                 some questions about the
                 disappearance of your daughter.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I don't understand, who are... ?

                             WELLES
                 I'm sorry, let me explain, the
                 R.C.M.P. is a support organization
                 and archive, not unlike the Center
                 for Missing and Exploited Children
                 in Washington.  I'm sure you've
                 dealt with them before?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Yes, but... 

                             WELLES 
                 These volunteer organizations are
                 sort of interconnected, functioning
                 hand in hand with law enforcement.
                 The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review
                 their investigations...
                       (holds up clipboard)
                 ... fact-check their records, see if
                 there's anything they missed,
                 anything they should be doing
                 different.  I'm here for a few days,
                 before I head back up to Virginia.
                 These reports go to the Justice
                 Department eventually.  I spoke to
                 your F.B.I. contact a few days ago,
                 uh...

     Welles pretends to look for the name on a Jiffy Lube page...

                             WELLES 
                 What was the name... ? I've got it
                 here somewhere...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Neil... Neil Cole.

                             WELLES
                       (pretends he found it)
                 Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call
                 and let you know to expect me.  He
                 didn't call?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No.

                             WELLES
                       (looking on legal pad)
                 Well, I'm following up on your
                 daughter, Mary, height; five four,
                 weight; hundred ten pounds, brown
                 eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24,
                 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A
                 runaway, that's how she's listed.
                 Is this information correct... ?

     Mrs. Mathews stares, nods.

                             WELLES
                 I'm sorry, I know this isn't easy.
                 Is there a more convenient time... ?
                       (looks at watch)
                 Can I buy you lunch, would that be
                 alright?

     Mrs. Mathews looks him up and down.


     EXT.  DAIRY QUEEN RESTAURANT -- DAY

     Welles and Mrs. Mathews eat at a PICNIC TABLE on the patio.

                             WELLES
                 It's very important you don't let
                 this raise your expectations.  It's
                 not going to effect any ongoing
                 efforts.  All I'm saying is, please
                 know, I'm not here to create any
                 false hope.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 They hired you.  You're like, a
                 private detective?

                             WELLES
                 That's exactly what I am.

     Mrs. Mathews chews, staring off into the distance.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I didn't think there were private
                 detectives anymore, except on TV.

                             WELLES
                 You probably expect me to be wearing
                 a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking
                 whiskey, chasing women and getting
                 beaten up by guys with broken noses.
                 Want to know what it's really like? 
                 It's sitting in a car and staring at
                 a hotel window for three days
                 straight, pissing in a plastic
                 bottle, pardon me, because some guy
                 thinks his wife's cheating on him.
                 Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who
                 hired you, he has a hair-lip,
                 dandruff and crooked teeth, and you
                 could have told him the minute you
                 laid eyes on him his wife's
                 cheating, and you don't blame her.

     Mrs. Mathews smiles.

                             WELLES
                 It's refreshing to actually sit down
                 and meet someone face to face,
                 someone nice like you.

     Welles smiles.  Mrs. Mathews takes out a cigarette.  Welles
     lights her, joins her in smoking, refers to his clipboard.

                             WELLES
                 So, she didn't leave a note?  She
                 never gave any indication where she
                 might go, before she left?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No.

                             WELLES
                 She just seemed... depressed... ?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 She didn't seem herself.  For months
                 there never was any way to get her
                 to talk about it.  One night we went
                 to bed... the next morning she was
                 gone.  She took some clothes.

                             WELLES
                 What was she running from?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I don't know.

                             WELLES
                 If there's anything you feel
                 uncomfortable talking about, tell
                 me, but I have to ask.  Your
                 husband... he committed suicide?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Yes.

                             WELLES
                 September 4th, 1993.  About a year
                 after Mary disappeared.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 We were divorced by then.  Things
                 fell apart... he was living with a
                 friend...

                             WELLES
                 Why do you think he did it?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 It got to be too much for him.

                             WELLES
                 You have to forgive me, but in these
                 circumstances... with your
                 daughter...
                       (pause)
                 Were there any indications of... any
                 sort of abuse?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 There wasn't anything like that.
                 The police and the FBI people asked,
                 but there wasn't anything happened
                 like that, never.  My husband... his
                 heart broke when Mary left...

                             WELLES
                 I didn't mean to...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 You try going through what we did.
                 Bob couldn't take it, that's all.
                 Christ, there's times when it still
                 seems like I can't either.

                             WELLES
                 I had to ask.  I apologize.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No one knows what it's like.  You
                 can't even imagine how much it hurts. 

     Welles is miserable.  A few CUSTOMERS walk past, looking at
     Mrs. Mathews.  She tries not to notice then noticing.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 People remember me from the news.
                       (pause)
                 Can you drive me back now?

                             WELLES
                 Of course. 


     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, MARY'S ROOM -- DAY

     Mrs. Mathews enters.  Welles follows. 

     This was the girl's room, exactly as she left it -- POSTERS
     of ACTORS on the wall, many STUFFED ANIMALS on the pink
     sheets of the carefully made bed.  Perfectly preserved.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 This is her room.

     Welles looks around, uncomfortable.
     Shelves have PICTURES of MARY with female friends, a
     collection of CERAMIC FIGURINES of CLOWNS and ANIMALS.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 The police made a wreck of it, but
                 I put it back exactly how it was.
                 Just how she likes it.

     Welles takes a few steps into the room, looks down at a DESK
     where there are SIX brightly wrapped GIFTS.

                             MRS MATHEWS

                 Those are for her birthday.  One for
                 every year she's missed.  They'll be
                 waiting for her when she comes back. 

     Welles is nearly overwhelmed by sadness, struggling to hide
     it.  He backs to the door, looks at his watch...

                             WELLES
                 I... I shouldn't take anymore of
                 your time.  Maybe we can finish
                 tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Okay.

     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- DAY

     Welles escapes to his car, climbing in.  He starts it up...

     IN THE CAR

     Welles drives, tears welling up in his eyes.  He has to pull
     over and park, wiping his tears, fighting for composure.


     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles has unpacked.  He's on the bed, on his CELLULAR...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 You should be able to take a shower
                 and still have hot water left, honey.
                       (listens)
                 Call him back and tell him I said
                 so.  The goddamn thing's still under
                 warranty.
                       (listens)
                 I'm okay.  It's hard here.  It's
                 hard.
                       (listens)
                 I've got a lead I have to follow
                 through.  To be honest, I don't
                 think I'm going to get very far.
                 I miss you.  I love you.


     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING

     Welles sits at the kitchen table.  Mrs. Mathews makes
     coffee.  The home's decor is cheap and flowery.

                             MRS MATHEWS 
                 We weren't religious.  We never
                 forced religion down her throat,
                 like I've seen some parents do to
                 their kids.  We never made her go to
                 church.  But, after Mary was gone,
                 that's when I got religious.

     Mrs. Mathews brings two cups of coffee, sits.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Doesn't make much sense, does it?
                 When everything's happy, when life's
                 fine and you have every reason to
                 believe there's a God, you don't
                 bother.  Then, something horrible
                 happens... that's when you start
                 praying all the time.  That's when
                 you start going to church.

                             WELLES
                 We're all like that.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Are you religious?

                             WELLES
                 No.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 You should be.

     Mrs. Mathews drinks coffee, stares into the cup.

                             WELLES
                 I've got what I need for my report.
                 There is... there is one thing that
                 bothers me though.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 What? 

                             WELLES
                 It's not really my place, but it's
                 not easy for me to set aside the
                 private detective part of me either.
                 See, I know a little about missing
                 persons.  When kids run, they almost
                 always leave a note.  It's guilt.
                 They want to say goodbye.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 There wasn't one.  The police looked.

                             WELLES
                 Do you think the police did a good
                 job?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I don't know.  I think so.

                             WELLES
                 It is possible... and I know this
                 isn't something you want to hear.
                 Your daughter may have tried to hide
                 a note where she thought you would
                 eventually find it, but where she
                 knew your husband would never find
                 it.  She might have wanted to tell
                 you something...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No.  You don't have any reason to
                 think that...

                             WELLES
                 If the police focused their search
                 in her room, her belongings, well
                 that'd be only natural, but they may
                 have been looking in the wrong place.

     Mrs. Mathews is getting upset.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 How... how can you say that to me...?

                             WELLES
                 Will you let me look?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 My husband never laid a hand on her.
                 She would have told me... she would
                 have told me...

                             WELLES 
                 You're probably right, and I
                 probably won't find anything.
                 I don't have a right to ask this,
                 and you can kick me out of your
                 house if you want, but this is my
                 profession and there's a part of me
                 that can't let it go.  Police are
                 just as human as you or I.  They
                 could have missed something.  They
                 probably didn't.
                       (pause)
                 Wouldn't you rather know?

     Mrs. Mathews thinks about it, tortured, shakes her head sadly.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Go ahead and look if you want.  I
                 don't care what you do.

     Mrs. Mathews gets up and walks out of the room.


     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- SEARCH MONTAGE -- DAY

     -In MRS. MATHEWS' BEDROOM, Welles looks through DRESSER
      drawers, methodically, replacing everything as it was...
      searches hat boxes and shoe boxes in a CLOSET... takes
      BOOKS off SHELVES, fanning the pages, shaking them out...

     -In a BATHROOM, Welles examines the contents of a MEDICINE
      CABINET, examining old prescription bottles... opens
      CABINETS under the sink...

     -In the LIVING ROOM, Mrs. Mathews sits slumped in a chair,
      staring at a soap opera on TELEVISION, a BOTTLE of scotch
      on TV tray beside her, drink in hand.

     -In the KITCHEN, Welles stands on a chair, searches high
      CABINETS... looks through low CABINETS, on his knees, pulls
      out pots and pans... fans the pages of COOK BOOKS...

     -Welles stands in the doorway of MARY'S ROOM, just stares.
      He takes a few steps back into the HALLWAY, looks up at the
      ceiling.  There's an ATTIC DOOR there.  Welles reaches to
      the door's handle, opens it, unfolds the portable stairs...

      -In the small ATTIC, Welles uses a penlight FLASHLIGHT,
      crouched under the low ceiling, looking through dusty BOXES
      of PHOTOGRAPHS; old photos of a wedding, of grandparents...
      Welles moves to pull back dusty sheets, finds a large
      WICKER BASKET and broken BICYCLE underneath...

      Welles opens the basket, takes out BLANKETS and QUILTS
      in mothballs.  He finds a wide VELVET BOX, takes it out,
      opens its hinged lid to reveal a set of good SILVERWARE.
      He touches the tarnished silverware, lifts out the top tray.
      Underneath, resting on top of more silverware, is a DIARY.

      Welles opens the DIARY, finds written: "Mary Anne Mathews."

      Welles turns pages.  The DIARY'S about half-full of
      feminine, cursive handwriting.  After the last written
      page, a PAGE has been TORN OUT.  Welles fingers the ragged
      edge, flips through the blank pages till he comes to the
      very last page, a GOODBYE NOTE.  Welles sits and reads...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (emotionless monotone)
                 "Dear mom.  If you're reading this,
                 it means I called you from
                 Hollywood, California and told you
                 where to find my diary.  I don't
                 think I'll be able to tell you this
                 when I talk to you, so I'm writing
                 it down here.  You know I haven't
                 been happy for a long, long time.
                 For a long time now dad's been doing
                 things I couldn't tell you.  He's
                 been touching me and it's getting
                 worse.  I can't stay anymore.  I
                 know you and I haven't always gotten
                 along sometimes, but please don't
                 blame yourself.  There isn't
                 anything you can do.  I'm going to
                 make a whole new life in California.
                 Maybe someday you'll see me on TV or
                 in magazines.  Don't worry about me.
                 Love, Mary Anne."

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, HALLWAY OUTSIDE MARY'S ROOM -- DAY

     Welles shuts the attic door, takes the DIARY from his
     pocket, hides it in his waistband at the small of his back.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles enters.  Mrs. Mathews looks up from the TV.

                             WELLES
                 You were right.
                       (pause)
                 I didn't find anything.  I'm going
                 to run and get something to eat.
                 Are you hungry?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Yes.


     INT.  COPY SHOP -- LATE DAY

     Welles uses a self-serve COPY MACHINE, flattening the DIARY
     on the glass, photocopying the DIARY as quickly as he can.


     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles sits picking at fast food in front of him.  Mrs.
     Mathews' food isn't even unwrapped. 

     She's numb from her drink, watching a GAME SHOW, smoking. 

                             WELLES
                 Do you ever consider... do you
                 realize that Mary may never come
                 back?

     Mrs. Mathews looks to Welles, looks back at the TV.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I think about it everyday.  But,
                 every time the phone rings... every
                 single time, I still think it's her.

                             WELLES
                 It's been six years.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 What am I supposed to do?  Forget
                 her?  Time heals all wounds, right?
                       (misery building)
                 She's all I think about, and I've
                 learned to live with that.  But, you
                 want the truth... the real truth?
                 If I had a choice... if I had to
                 choose, between her being out there,
                 living a good life and being happy,
                 and me not knowing; never finding
                 out what happened to her...
                       (pause)
                 ... or her being dead and me
                 knowing...
                       (pause)
                 I'd choose to know.

     Mrs. Mathews stares into the TV, wipes tears.
     Welles takes a deep breath and holds it.  He watches her a
     long moment, motionless.  Finally he stands, voice unsteady.

                             WELLES
                 Excuse me, I have to use your
                 bathroom.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, HALLWAY OUTSIDE MARY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles comes to the attic door, quietly pulls it open.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, ATTIC -- NIGHT

     Welles uses his penlight, digs out the DIARY from the hiding
     place in his waistband, replaces it in the box of
     silverware, closes the box.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, MARY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles enters, takes a PICTURE FRAME off one shelf, opens
     the back and takes out the PHOTO of MARY from inside.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Mrs. Mathews still gazes into the TV.  Welles passes the
     doorway, not looking in, heading to the front door, opening
     the door and walking out...

     Mrs. Mathews doesn't even notice, doesn't look up.

     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Welles crosses the front lawn, not looking back, heading to
     the street, getting into his car, starting his car, doing a
     U-turn, driving away down the street.


     EXT.  FAYETTEVILLE AIRPORT, LONG TERM PARKING -- MORNING

     Welles' boxes of belongings are piled in the back seat of
     his car.  Welles covers them with a blanket, shuts the door.

     Welles opens the trunk of his car, pulls back the carpeting.
     He opens the brown BRIEFCASE.  The briefcase is full of
     CASH, about $10,000, twenties and fifties in bundles.

     Welles transfers half the money into a carry-on bag, shuts
     the briefcase, covers it, closes the trunk.


     INT.  AIRPLANE, COACH -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     The cabin's half-full, dark.  Passengers sleep.  Under the
     only illuminated reading light, Welles reads the PHOTOCOPIED
     DIARY.  MARY'S VOICE is a again a flat monotone...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (as Welles reads)
                 "Dear diary.  I have a big math test
                 tomorrow.  I have to get better
                 grades.  How come everybody does
                 better than me?  Kathy doesn't even
                 study and she gets B's.  Two boys
                 got in a fight after school today.
                 One boy knocked the other boy's
                 tooth out, at least that's what it
                 looked like.  His nose and mouth
                 were bleeding all over the place..."

     EXT.  LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- MORNING -- MONTAGE

     An airplane ROARS downwards, heading in for a landing.

     An ugly city.  "HOLLYWOOD" sign on the smoggy horizon.

     EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HOTEL -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     A cheap, stucco hotel in a wounded Hollywood neighborhood.

     INT.  HOLLYWOOD HOTEL -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles' suitcase is open on the bed.  Welles sits in a chair
     with his feet up, sweating in the heat, reading the DIARY.

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (as Welles reads)
                 "... We're reading The Great Gatsby
                 in English class.  It's the story of
                 this guy who has lots of fancy
                 parties and all his friends come
                 around and party with him, but later
                 when he dies nobody comes to his
                 funeral.  Someone said there's a
                 movie about it, but I looked in the
                 video store and it wasn't there."

     Welles flips pages, further back in the DIARY...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (as Welles reads)
                 "Dear diary.  I started my first job
                 last week working part time at Price
                 Mart department store..."

     INT.  LOS ANGELES BANK, SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles and a BANK EMPLOYEE both put keys into a SAFE DEPOSIT

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "... The people I work with are all
                 old and fat.  All they live for is
                 their next coffee break so they can
                 smoke..."

     INT.  BANK, PRIVACY BOOTH -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles is alone, opens the empty safe deposit drawer, takes
     the 8MM FILM from his pocket and puts it in the drawer.

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "... They eat lunch at the snack
                 counter.  Hot dogs and soft
                 pretzels.  Nachos with that orange
                 cheese that comes out of a pump.  I
                 don't know what I'd do if I'm still
                 working there when I get old..."

     EXT.  YOUTH HOSTEL -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY -- MONTAGE

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "... I want to be a singer or an
                 actress.  I know it's a stupid
                 dream, but I know I can do it if I
                 get a chance..."

     INT.  YOUTH HOSTEL -- DAY -- MONTAGE
 
     Welles talks to the MAN behind the counter, shows the
     PICTURE of MARY taken from Mrs. Mathews' house.

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "... Everyone's always telling me
                 how pretty I am.  I don't think I
                 am.  When I look in the mirror I
                 wonder who they're talking about."

     The MAN behind the counter shakes his head.

     INT.  HOMELESS SHELTER -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     A run-down shelter.  Welles shows the PICTURE of MARY to the

                 "Dear diary.  I went out with Bob
                 today, the cute boy in my science
                 class.  He took me to a movie..."

                 "... It was the middle of the day,
                 but we held hands.  I think he likes
                 me.  I really like him.  He has
                 black hair and grey eyes..."

     EXT.  LA FREEWAY -- DUSK -- MONTAGE

     Welles sits in his rental CAR, in a massive TRAFFIC JAM.

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "... He opened the car door for me
                 and paid for the movie.  When he
                 took me home he said we should go
                 out again soon.  I hope he calls..."

     EXT.  HOLLYWOOD, RED LIGHT DISTRICT -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles drives, looking out the windshield...
     at decaying "PEEP SHOWS," an "ADULT BOOKSHOP" and "SEX SHOP."

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "Dear diary.  Janet says she slept
                 with her boyfriend.  I can't believe
                 it.  She says they did it last
                 weekend while her parents were out
                 of town..."

     EXT.  HOLLYWOOD, SUNSET BOULEVARD -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles drives, watching overweight PROSTITUTES and tall,
     muscular TRANSVESTITES prowling the sidewalks in mini-skirts
     and stained, tight spandex pants.

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "... She said she liked it, but she
                 didn't seem too happy.  She didn't
                 tell me many details.  She said he
                 used a condom."

     EXT.  SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Teenaged MALE PROSTITUTES hang out in front of a PIZZA
     PARLOR.  A few have their shirts off, crewcut and muscular.

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "Dear diary.  If I save enough money
                 to go to community college maybe I
                 can get good enough grades for a
                 scholarship somewhere else..."

     EXT.  HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     A tribe of HOMELESS TEENAGERS sits on the sidewalk in front
     of SOUVENIR SHOPS.  They beg money off pedestrians.

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "... I've never been anywhere else.
                 I don't think mom wants to let me
                 go.  Every time I try to talk about
                 it she says it'll cost too much or
                 she changes the subject."

     EXT.  CHURCH, SOUP KITCHEN -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     A long line of HOMELESS PERSONS trails out the door.  Welles
     stands out front, showing the PICTURE to a VOLUNTEER with a
     broom, and a PRIEST...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "Dear diary.  Something terrible
                 happened today when dad and I were
                 alone.  I can't tell anyone.  I feel
                 sick.  What did I ever do to make
                 this happen to me?"

     The volunteer and priest can't help.  Welles is weary,
     futility beginning to wear on him, walks to his car...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "Dear diary.  My stomach hurts all
                 the time.  I just want to go to
                 sleep and never wake up.  I want to
                 get out of my head and stop hearing
                 myself think."

     INT.  WELLES' RENTAL CAR -- IN MOTION -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles smokes, driving, blankly watching the road ahead...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "Dear diary.  Grandma fell and broke
                 her leg last week.  We drove down to
                 visit her in the hospital.
                 Hospitals smell like dead people."

     EXT.  FREEWAY -- HELICOPTER SHOT -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     FOLLOW Welles' car speeding along...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "Dear diary.  It's happening all the
                 time now.  There s nothing I can do.
                 I'm all alone.  Everything is bad.
                 I used to have lots of dreams and
                 I'd remember them when I woke up,
                 but that doesn't happen anymore."

     PULL BACK: still FOLLOWING WELLES' CAR, over the FREEWAY...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "Dear diary.  If I can get to
                 California, I'll be okay.  I've got
                 money saved.  I can work as a
                 waitress till I get something
                 better.  Billy says he and his
                 family went to California once on
                 vacation.  He says it never rains.
                 They stayed near the beach and he
                 went swimming in the ocean..."

     CONTINUE TO PULL BACK -- till Welles' car is very, very far
     below -- REVEALING the staggering size of the City of Los
     Angeles, where the lights go on forever and forever.

     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles is seated, elbows on his knees, reading the DIARY...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont)
                 "... I hope I can be an actress.  I
                 hope I can be happy.  I'll probably
                 have to go to acting school.  I wish
                 I knew someone who lived there.
                 I'll miss my friends, but at least
                 I'll be far away where no one can
                 ever find me."

     Welles has come to the end of the writing in the DIARY.  The
     next PHOTOCOPIED PAGE shows an image of the TORN RAGGED EDGE
     of the diary's missing page.


     EXT.  VIDEO PORN SHOP -- DAY

     Welles enters this "ADULT VIDEO" storefront.

     INT.  VIDEO PORN SHOP -- DAY

     The CLERK is a sleazy forty-year-old man with rings in his
     pierced nose and lips, behind a counter by the door.  He
     watches Welles pass.

     Welles looks around, uncomfortable.  A few of the other
     CUSTOMERS, all men, sneak glances at Welles.  Display
     shelves run floor to ceiling, full of hundreds of shrink-
     wrapped XXX PORNO TAPES.  Welles pretends to browse.

     Handmade signs above each section identify content: "ANAL,"
     "BIG TITS," "CUMSHOTS," "BONDAGE and FETISH," etc...

     Welles looks back at the clerk, who stares at Welles.
     Welles feels obligated to pick up a box and act like he's
     considering it.  He glances at other customers.

     Each man keeps his eyes forward on the pornography.  One guy
     has his arms full of about ten videos.

     Welles puts the tape back, walks to the front counter.  The
     clerk watches him the whole time.

                             WELLES
                 Is this pretty much it?

     The clerk just stares at Welles.

                             WELLES
                 Just... just videos?

                             PIERCED CLERK
                 What are you looking for?

     Welles considers, decides to leave, exiting...

                             WELLES
                 Nothing.

                             PIERCED CLERK
                 Fuck-head.


     INT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY

     Welles comes in through the blacked-out door.  This place is
     larger than the last.  TWO CLERKS are behind the counter.
     One clerk's pricing porn, the other, MAX, 25, reads a porno-
     novel.  Max has long hair, colorful tattoos covering his
     forearms, has a HIGHLIGHTER MARKER in his mouth.

     Welles browses.  There's a huge video bargain bin.  Walls
     are covered in videos, sex toys, inflatable women, etc. 

     CUSTOMERS, again all wary males, follow proper porn-shop
     etiquette; look at the porn, not your fellow shopper.

     There are "PEEP SHOW" booths in the back.  A MAN looks
     around, trying to be nonchalant, sweating profusely,
     slipping behind one curtain.

     Welles pretends to read the packaging on a triple-pack of
     dildos, looks towards the front...

     Behind the register, Max takes a look to make sure the other
     clerk is busy, takes the cap of his Highlighter pen and
     highlights a section in the book he's reading.

     Welles notes this.  He goes to the substantial MAGAZINE
     RACK, picks up a porn tabloid, pages through it.  He selects
     sex MAGAZINES and NEWSPAPERS, choosing about twenty-five.

     Welles takes this pile up to Max, gets out his wallet.  Max
     starts ringing everything up.

                             MAX
                 Big date tonight?

                             WELLES
                       (embarrassed)
                 Yeah... guess so.

                             MAX 
                 Can I interest you in a battery
                 operated-vagina?

                             WELLES
                 Pardon me?

                             MAX
                 My boss tells me I have to do more
                 suggestive selling.

                             WELLES 
                 Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.

                             MAX
                 It's your call, but you're gonna be
                 sorry when you're in one of those
                 everyday situations that call for a
                 battery-operated vagina and you
                 don't have one.

                             WELLES
                 I'll risk it. 

     Max shoves everything into a bag and hands it over.

                             MAX
                 Thank you for shopping at Adult
                 Bookstore.  Have a nice day.

     Welles takes the bag.  Max returns to his book.  Welles is
     leaving, but stops at the end of the counter.

                             WELLES
                 What are you reading?

     Max holds up the book, "ANAL SECRETARY."

                             MAX
                 Once you pick it up you can't put it
                 down.

                             WELLES
                 Catchy title.  What are you really
                 reading?
                       (off Max's look)
                 Hard to believe that book's got any
                 parts worth highlighting.

     Max takes a glance at the other clerk, opens the pages of
     the book and shows it to Welles.  "Music for Chameleons."

                             WELLES
                 Truman Capote.

                             MAX
                 I tear off the cover and paste this
                 one on...
                       (nods towards clerk)
                 You know how it is.

                             WELLES
                 Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself
                 in front of your fellow perverts.

                             MAX
                       (smiles, shrugs)
                 Might get drummed out of the
                 pornographer's union, and then where
                 would I be?

     Another CUSTOMER clears his throat, waiting at the register.
     Max turns to help him.  Welles heads out.


     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles is at a table, porn publications spread out before
     him, looking through the back of a PORNO TABLOID...

     Turning pages of HARDCORE ADVERTISEMENTS: "Adults Only,"
     "She Male Films," "Amateur Sex Videos," "Women and
     Animals -- you've got to see it to believe it..."

     Welles moves on to the next MAGAZINE, turning to the back,
     again, page after page: "Watersports and Fisting
     Specialists," "100's of Anal Films," "Asian Sex..."

     HUNDREDS of 900 NUMBER ads with naked women urging callers
     to pick up the phone.  EROTIC CLASSIFIEDS; hundreds of
     amateur photos of naked men and women with faces and
     genitalia blacked over... "Men Seeking Women," "Women
     Seeking Women", "Men Seeking Men," "Transvestites..."

     It is endless.  More CLASSIFIEDS: "Sex Slaves Wanted,"
     "ACTRESSES WANTED," "Underground Films," "SPECIALTY FILMS
     OFFERED," "S+M and BONDAGE," "Fetish Videos."

     Welles leaves it, overwhelmed, goes to lay down on the bed.
     He picks up his cellular phone, dialing.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Hi, honey, how are you?  How's Cindy?
                       (listens)
                 The way it's going I'm about ready
                 to pack my bags...

     INT.  NONDESCRIPT ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     In a dark room, we don't know where, a DARK FIGURE of a MAN
     is silhouetted.  He wears HEADPHONES, listening...

                             WELLES' VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphones)
                 ... I've got a feeling the person
                 I'm looking for came out here and
                 got swallowed up by the place.

                             AMY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphone)
                 Come back now. Just drop it and
                 come back...

                             WELLES' VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphone)
                 I would if I could.  I'll be home
                 soon, believe me.  It won't be long.

                             AMY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphone)
                 I miss you.

     INT.  WELLES ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles shuts his eyes, still on the cellular...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 I miss you too.  I love you very
                 much.  Give Cinderella a kiss for me
                 and tell her I love her, alright?
                       (listens)
                 Goodnight.


     INT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY

     Max is at the register.  A crewcut WOMAN in overalls works
     behind the counter with him.  Welles approaches.

                             WELLES
                 Remember me?

                             MAX
                 Came back for that battery-operated
                 vagina, right?  Told you you would.

     Welles shows his IDENTIFICATION, lets Max get a good look.

                             WELLES
                 I need some information.  Thought
                 you might be able to help.

                             MAX
                       (of identification)
                 Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.

     Welles takes out an ENVELOPE, puts it on the counter.

                             WELLES
                 I'll be outside having a cigarette.

     Welles leaves.  Max watches him go.  Max opens the envelope,
     takes out two fifty dollar bills, pockets them.

                             MAX
                       (to other clerk)
                 Cover me, Beth.  I'm taking a break.

     EXT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY

     Welles stands down the sidewalk, smoking.  Max comes out
     from the porn shop, walks to Welles, looking around.

                             MAX
                 I don't know what you're looking
                 for, mister, but so we're clear from
                 the start, I'm straight.

                             WELLES
                 Good for you.

     Welles and Max walk down the block, past HOMELESS MEN with
     shopping carts overflowing with junk.

                             WELLES
                 How long you been working there?

                             MAX
                 Three, four years.

                             WELLES
                 What's your name, if you don't mind
                 me asking? 

                             MAX
                 Max.

                             WELLES
                 Well, here's the deal, Max.  This
                 thing I'm on right now has something
                 to do with underground pornography.
                 Stuff that's sold under the counter,
                 illegally...

                             MAX
                 There's not much illegal.

                             WELLES
                 Well, whatever there is, whoever's
                 dealing, however it's done, I want
                 to know.  I want a good look, so if
                 you've got that kind of connection,
                 great.  If not, speak now.

                             MAX
                 You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask
                 and you are, you have to tell me.

                             WELLES
                 I'm not a cop.

                             MAX
                 You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.

                             WELLES
                 Not quite.

                             MAX
                 From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA.
                 What are you doing out here?

                             WELLES
                 Well, there's the thing; you're not
                 gonna know anything about what I'm
                 doing, but you can make some money.

                             MAX
                 How much?

                             WELLES
                 How much do you make now?

                             MAX
                 Four hundred a week, off the books.

                             WELLES
                 Okay, let's pretend I live in the
                 same fantasy world where you make
                 four hundred a week in that dump.
                 I'll give you six hundred for a few
                 days. 

                             MAX
                 Sounds good, pops.

                             WELLES
                 Here's my number if you need it...
                       (writes on scrap paper)
                 When can you start?

                             MAX
                 Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.

                             WELLES
                 See you then.  Oh, and, don't call
                 me "pops."

     Welles walks away. 


     INT.  WELLES ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles sleeps, despite the stead SOUND of TRAFFIC racing by
     his window.  The PHONE RINGS, waking him.  Welles looks at
     the clock radio, 2:23am, reaches to answer the phone...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 ... Hello... ?

                             MAX (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Wake up, pops.  Your education
                 begins tonight.

     EXT.  DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT

     Against the backdrop of downtown LA's bright skyscrapers,
     Welles' rental car heads into the lower bowels of the city,
     smaller, older, darker buildings...

     EXT.  DOWNTOWN STREETS -- NIGHT

     The only people on the street are HOMELESS and SHADY
     CHARACTERS.  Welles' car makes its way to a big deserted
     PARKING LOT.  There are a few cars parked in one corner.

     Welles parks near the other cars and gets out.  Max stands
     against a chain link fence.  Welles goes to meet him.

                             MAX
                 Come on.

     Max leads the way, across the lot, towards dark alleyways.

     EXT.  DOWNTOWN ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

     Max and Welles move through this filth strewn alley between
     decaying brink buildings.  They cone to a STAIRWELL leading
     down to pitch dark...

     INT.  OLD BUILDING -- NIGHT

     Max enters through a crooked door, heads into a narrow,
     labyrinth hallway lit by bare bulbs.  Welles follows.

     They come to another STAIRWAY leading down.  At the bottom,
     a thick-necked GOON stands guarding double doors. 

                             GOON
                 Are you a law enforcement agent or
                 in any way affiliated with law
                 enforcement?

                             MAX
                 Fuck you, Larry.

     Max heads to the double doors, waits for Welles.

                             GOON
                       (to Welles)
                 Are you a law enforcement... ?

                             WELLES
                 No.

     INT.  BASEMENT -- NIGHT

     Max and Welles enter through the double doors, into a kind
     of small, underground porn flea market.  It's incredibly
     quiet.  About fifteen CARD TABLES are set up in rows.  The
     MEN behind the tables and the thirty or so "CUSTOMERS"
     looking through the merchandise make those in the previous
     porn shops look like high society.

     These are MIDDLE-AGED MEN, most balding, some with pot
     bellies, in shorts and tube socks, in sweatpants and Members
     Only jackets: plain men, but with a look of desperation in
     their eyes, glancing around nervously, greasy and afraid.

                             ONE DEALER
                 We're shutting down in fifteen
                 minutes.  Fifteen minutes.

     Welles makes his way to the tables, wary.  One table is
     covered in dirty cardboard boxes, filled with HUNDREDS of
     PHOTOS of young children, mostly boys, naked.  Each photo is
     wrapped in plastic, censored by masking tape.

     Welles swallows back disgust.

     The next table is piled high with used pornographic
     MAGAZINES.  There are baggies with COLORFUL PILLS laid out.
     X-rated Polaroids wrapped in rubberbands.

     Max follows behind, unaffected, smokes a cigarette.

     Another table offers VIDEO TAPES with no identifying marks
     other than hand written labels with numbers written out,
     "two," "sixteen," "five."  And many bootleg VIDEOS with
     grainy, homemade labels showing WOMEN in extreme BONDAGE.

     Welles watches out the corner of his eye as the PLUMP MAN
     beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures.
     Welles waits till the man moves on, addresses the angry
     looking DEALER who's counting money.

                             WELLES
                       (points to numbered videos)
                 What are these?

                             ANGRY DEALER
                 Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films.
                 Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.

     Welles looks around, wipes sweat off his top lip.

                             WELLES
                 Anything harder?

                             ANGRY DEALER
                 There's nothing harder.

                             WELLES
                 Snuff?

                             ANGRY DEALER
                 What you see is what I got, mister.

                             WELLES
                 You know where I can get it?  I have
                 a lot of money to spend.

                             ANGRY DEALER
                 There ain't no such thing as snuff.
                 Why don't you fuck off? 

     The dealer sits and keeps counting cash.
     Welles moves on Beyond the tables there's a CURTAINED
     DOORWAY.  Welles walks to it, enters...

     INSIDE THE CURTAIN

     Folding chairs face a SCREEN.  A PROJECTOR shows a silent
     movie; a BUXOM WOMAN in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag
     and tube.  A hairy, overweight MAN lays face down on an
     examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back.

     In the darkness, a MAN shifts in his chair, grunting,
     obviously masturbating.  A few chairs away, a man is bent
     over, moving his head in the lap of SOMEONE in a BLONDE WIG.

     A LARGE MAN approaches Welles from the dark.

                             LARGE MAN
                 You have to pay to come in here. 

     Welles backs away, shuts the curtain.


     INT.  ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT

     Not many people in the place.  Welles drinks coffee.  Max
     eats a huge breakfast.

                             MAX
                 You've got Penthouse, Playboy,
                 Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers
                 them pornography anymore.  Then,
                 there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple
                 X.  The difference is penetration.
                 That's hardcore.  That whole
                 industry's up in the valley.
                 Writers, directors, porn stars.
                 They're celebrities, or they think
                 they are.  They pump out 150 videos
                 a week.  A week.  They've even got
                 a porno Academy Awards.  America
                 loves pornography.  Anybody tells
                 you they never use pornography,
                 they're lying.  Somebody's buying
                 those videos.  Somebody's out there
                 spending 900 million dollars a year
                 on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's
                 only gonna get worse.  More and more
                 you'll see perverse hardcore coming
                 into the mainstream, because that's
                 evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my
                 God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his
                 hips, how offensive!  Nowadays,
                 Mtv's showing girls dancing around
                 in thong bikinis with their asses
                 hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For
                 the porn-addict, big tits aren't big
                 enough after a while.  They have to
                 be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn
                 chicks are putting in breast
                 implants bigger than your head,
                 literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be
                 Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler,
                 Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore
                 films'll be medical films.
                 People'll be jerking off to women
                 laying around with open wounds.
                 There's nowhere else for it to go.

                             WELLES
                 Interesting theory.

                             MAX
                 What you saw tonight, we're not
                 talking about a video some dentist
                 takes home over the weekend.  We're
                 talking about stuff where people get
                 hurt.  Specialty product. 

                             WELLES
                 Child pornography.

                             MAX
                 There's two kinds of specialty
                 product; legal and illegal.  Foot
                 fetish, shit films, watersports,
                 bondage, spanking, fisting, she-
                 males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond
                 hardcore, but legal.  This is the
                 kind of hardcore where one guy's
                 going to look at it and throw up,
                 another guy looks at it and falls in
                 love.  Now, with some of the S+M and
                 bondage films, they straddle the
                 line.  How are you supposed to tell
                 if the person tied up with the ball
                 gag in their mouth is a consenting
                 or not?  Step over that line, you're
                 into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but
                 there aren't many.  I've never seen
                 one.

                             WELLES
                 Snuff films.

                             MAX
                 I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't
                 yanking you around.  There's no such
                 thing.

                             WELLES
                 What other ways are there to get
                 illegal films?  Who do you see?

                             MAX
                 First of all, basement sales like
                 tonight aren't gonna last much
                 longer.  It's too risky, one, and
                 two, everything's going on the
                 internet.  Anyone with a computer
                 and enough patience can find
                 anything he wants.  It's heaven for
                 those degenerate chicken-hawks.
                 They're swapping pictures back and
                 forth as fast as their modems can
                 zap 'em.  But, there's still some
                 weird shit under the counter where
                 I work sometimes.  No one knows where
                 it comes from.  That's local
                 underground, where information
                 spreads by word of mouth.  Those are
                 zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their
                 hands are permanently pruned.  They
                 go out in the sun they don't burn,
                 they blister.  Other than that, all
                 I know about is the mail.
                 Classified ads in the paper with
                 hidden codes.  Secret couriers.
                 Credit card orders to dummy
                 corporations.  Interstate wire
                 transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes.
                 But, if you're asking me who do you
                 go to to get illegal shit... who
                 knows?  That's the whole point --
                 the seller stays as far away from
                 the buyer as possible, and vice
                 versa, and cops can't trace the
                 deal.  There's ways to do it so
                 nobody knows who anybody is.

     Welles watches Max eat.

                             WELLES
                 How old are you?

                             MAX
                 Twenty-five.

                             WELLES
                 Where are your parents?

                             MAX
                 I don't know, where are yours?

                             WELLES
                 I don't mean any offense... but what
                 are you doing mixed up in all this?

                             MAX
                 I'm not mixed up in anything,
                 hayseed.  What are you talking about?

                             WELLES
                 You just strike me as smart enough
                 to be doing something else.

                             MAX
                 Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What
                 choices have I got?  Fuck, just
                 because I know about stuff like
                 tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I
                 work a job.  It beats pumping gas,
                 beats making hamburgers.

                             WELLES
                 You're telling me it doesn't get to
                 you?

                             MAX
                 You can't sit there all day watching
                 the parade of losers that comes into
                 that place without going numb.  So
                 what? 
                 Am I gonna go off and be a race car
                 driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for
                 President?  What about you, pops?

                             WELLES
                 What about me?

                             MAX
                 I see a ring on your finger.  You
                 have any kids?

                             WELLES
                 A daughter.

                             MAX
                 So, you have a wife and kid waiting
                 for you in Pennsylvania... what are
                 you doing mixed up in all this?

                             WELLES
                 Good question.

     EXT.  ALL NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT

     Max and Welles comes out to the sidewalk, talking.

     ACROSS THE STREET

     INSIDE A PARKED CAR, through the windshield, SOMEONE watches
     Max and Welles say goodnight.  Max walks to a waiting taxi.

     It's the sinister lawyer watching, LONGDALE, the late Mr.
     Christian's attorney, watching Welles go to his rental car.


     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles is seated, PROJECTOR RUNNING, watching the 8MM film.

     The last of the film makes its way through, threading out.
     The take-up reel spins, the film's tail flapping...

     Welles stares at the blank white square of light projected
     onto the wall.  CELLULAR PHONE is HEARD RINGING...

     Welles finally looks to the projector, turns it off.  The
     PHONE'S RINGING.  Welles goes to sit on the bed, looking at
     the cellular phone on the bedside table.  RINGING...

     Welles lets it RING.  RINGING... RINGING... till it finally
     stops.  Welles lays back on the bed and shuts his eyes.


     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

     Mrs. Christian is behind the desk, surrounded by BOXES of
     BANK RECORDS and FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, on the PHONE. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                       (into phone)
                 My husband had five cash accounts he
                 used to temporarily hold stock
                 profits.  Between November of 1991
                 and March of 1992, he wrote one
                 check out to cash from each account.
                 He wrote these himself...

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH, HOLLYWOOD -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles is in the booth, listening...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Okay...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 My husband never dealt with money
                 personally, certainly not cash.

                             WELLES
                 I'm not positive this means anything.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 The checks were for odd amounts...

     INT.  MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

     Mrs. Christian has the amounts written out on paper.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                       (into phone)
                 One was for two hundred thousand,
                 one dollar and thirteen cents.
                 Another was for three hundred
                 thousand, six hundred fifty four
                 dollars and seventy six cents...

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Okay, I follow you so far...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 Totalled together, these five checks
                 from five different accounts, they
                 equal one million dollars.

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 You're joking.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 To the penny.  Exactly one million
                 dollars in cash. 

     Welles considers this, lost in thought.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 Hello... ?

                             WELLES
                 I'm here.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 Do you think the film could have
                 cost that much?

                             WELLES
                 For a human life... murder on film,
                 no statute of limitations.  Who
                 knows?  It sure could have.  I'd
                 like you to overnight me a copy of
                 those checks, then put them in a
                 safe deposit box. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 Okay.

                             WELLES
                 Send it to me through the post
                 office like we arranged.  No return
                 address.  You dug this up all by
                 yourself?

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 You told me to look, so I looked.

                             WELLES
                 You're one hell of a detective, Mrs.
                 Christian.


     EXT.  MISSION YOUTH HOSTEL -- DAY

     TEENAGERS work cleaning this large DORMITORY, sweeping and
     mopping the floor, making the bunk beds, washing windows.
     Welles stands with an elderly, black NUN in plain clothing.

                             WELLES
                 Her name was Mary Anne Mathews.

     Welles hands the woman the PICTURE of MARY.  The woman puts
     on her glasses, looks at the picture... looks at Welles.

                             NUN
                 Yes... I remember Mary

                             WELLES
                 You... you do?  You're sure?
                 Please, Sister, will you take
                 another look, make sure... 

                             NUN 
                      (examines picture)
                 Yes.  I remember her.

     INT.  MISSION YOUTH HOSTEL, STORAGE AREA -- DAY

     In a basement corner, Welles watches as the nun uses keys to
     open the door of a chain-link STORAGE CAGE.  The cage is
     full of junk, BOXES, LAMPS, stacks of CHAIRS.

                             NUN
                 She lived here for only about a
                 month, if I recall correctly.  She
                 didn't return one night.  She never
                 came back.  I didn't know what to
                 think...

     The nun enters the cage, pushes old BOXES out of her way,
     looks up a cob-web covered METAL SHELVES.

                             NUN
                 Do you know what happened to her?

                             WELLES
                 I'm trying to find out.  She was a
                 runaway.  I'm looking into it for
                 her parents.

     The nun sees what she wants, finds a STEP LADDER, tries to
     open it.  Welles comes to help her.

                             NUN
                       (pointing on shelf)
                 Can you get that down for me?

     Welles climbs the ladder, points at boxes...

                             NUN
                 No, the next shelf... there...

     Welles takes down a small SUITCASE.  It's covered in dust.
     He climbs down the ladder with it.

                             WELLES
                 What is this?

                             NUN
                 Those are her belongings.

                             WELLES
                 Her belongings?

                             NUN
                 That's her suitcase.  I had
                 forgotten it, till you showed me
                 her picture.

     Welles puts the suitcase down, examines the LUGGAGE TAG:
     "Mary Anne Mathews," no address.  Welles looks to the nun. 

                             WELLES
                 Whatever possessed you to keep this
                 all this time?

                             NUN
                 She was the kindest, sweetest girl
                 you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I
                 adored her.  I supposed I always
                 hoped she'd be back.  After a time,
                 all I could do was pray she had
                 moved on to better things.  Can you
                 get this suitcase to her parents, if
                 you think it's appropriate?

                             WELLES
                 I'll do what I can.


     INT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles puts Mary's SUITCASE on the bed, opens it.  He takes
     out some of Mary's clothing, examines it, lays it aside.

     He takes out a ROSARY, more CLOTHING.  Resting on a SWEATER
     are two CERAMIC FIGURINES; a teddy bear and kitten.  Welles
     examines them, frowning, puts them aside.

     He takes out yellowed NEWSPAPER; Help Wanted CLASSIFIEDS,
     "July 2, 1992."  Several job possibilities circled, others
     crossed out.  He finds baggie containing a few old JOINTS.

     All that's left are more items of CLOTHING, a TOOTHBRUSH and
     an ADDRESS BOOK.  Welles examines the address book, finds a
     folded piece of paper in the blank pages, unfolds it... it's
     the TORN DIARY PAGE, a POEM written in Mary's hand...

                             MARY'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (as Welles reads)
                 "Star light, star bright, First star
                 I've seen tonight, Wish I may, wish
                 I might, Have this wish I wish
                 tonight."

     Welles goes to a drawer, takes out the photocopy of Mary's
     DIARY.  He turns to the ragged edge of the torn page, puts
     the DIARY PAGE against it.  Perfect match.

     Welles stands looking at the poem.  He turns the page over,
     finds written, in cursive:

                           Models Wanted 213-555-6643


     EXT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY

     Welles dials the number off the back of the torn diary page,
     phone to his ear.  It RINGS, RINGS, RINGS... 

                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.) 
                       (from phone)
                 Celebrity Films.

     Welles hangs up, begins searching the booth's YELLOW PAGES.

     EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

     A poverty stricken business section of Wilshire.  Welles
     gets out of his parked car, looks up at a decaying Art Deco
     building that's painted blue top-to-bottom.

     Welles crosses through traffic.

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, LOBBY -- DAY

     Welles studies the REGISTRY, finds "Celebrity Films."

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- DAY

     Paint's peeling.  Walls are water stained.  Welles climbs
     stairs, winded, sweating, up the stairwell...

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- DAY

     Welles comes out a stairwell DOOR, catching his breath.  A
     couple of SECRETARIES wait for the elevator.  Welles moves
     down the hall, around a corner.

     Each office door has a window of pebbled, translucent glass.
     There's a "Dental Office," "Wilson Travel Cruises," and at
     the end of the hall, "Celebrity Films Inc., Eddie Poole,
     Professional Casting and Distribution, Suite 804."

     Welles heads back the way he came.

     EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

     Welles crosses back to the other side of the street, goes to
     stand near his car.  He looks up at the blue office
     building, counting up floors, counting windows across.

     Satisfied, he turns, backing up, looking up at the tall
     OFFICE BUILDING across from the blue building.  There's a
     sign on this adjacent building, "OFFICE SPACE AVAILABLE."

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE, 9TH FLOOR -- DAY

     Empty office.  Welles is let in by a disinterested LANDLORD.
     Welles gives a cursory look around, goes to the windows and
     opens the blinds.

     These windows afford an excellent view of the blue building
     across the street, at about 8th floor level.

                             WELLES 
                 This is better. 
                       (turns to landlord) 
                 This will be fine.


     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles has transferred most of his belongings here, SUITCASE
     open on the floor, CARD TABLE set up with fast food on it,
     an ARMY COT against one wall.  Welles sits in a chair at the
     window, looks through BINOCULARS on a TRIPOD.

     WELLES' P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: searching up the dark
     floors of the blue building, as Welles counts under his
     breath.  Moving over... stopping on one window, FOCUSING...

     Welles locks the tripod.  He goes to sit on the army cot,
     picks up his CELLULAR.  He looks at the phone, deciding.
     He puts down the phone.  He turns off the LAMP on the floor,
     lays back in the cot, going to sleep.


     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     WELLES' P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: watching the window of
     Celebrity Films Inc.  We can see most of the office from
     here.  It's crowded with junk, BOXES, piles of VIDEO TAPES.
     There's a disorganized DESK by the window.

     Welles sits looking through the binoculars.

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: a pudgy man, EDDIE POOLE, in a loud,
     print shirt, comes to sit at the desk, looks through mail.
     He smells sleazy even from here, lots of jewelry, Lots of
     rings.  He drinks coffee, answers the phone.  He talks into
     the phone, looking for something on his desk, agitation
     growing, till he's shouting, then slams the phone down.

     Welles rises.  He looks to the wall where THREE PHOTOGRAPHS
     culled from the snuff film are pinned up; the picture of
     Mary, the picture of Masked Man's tattooed hand, and...

     ... the grainy image of the Third Man in the mirror.
     Welles comes to study this third photo.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie packs VIDEO TAPES into a box,
     covering them with Styrofoam peanuts, sealing the box.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie finishes a call and hangs up.  He
     sits back in his chair.  He starts looking in his desk
     drawers, finds a MAGAZINE and opens it on the desk.  It's
     porn.  Eddie turns pages, looking at naked women.  He sits
     back in his chair, begins unbuckling his belt.

     Welles pulls back from the binoculars in disgust. 

                             WELLES 
                 No thank you.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- NIGHT

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's on the phone, pouring himself a
     drink from the liquor bottle on his desk, finishing the
     call, hanging up.  He shakes his head in disgust, drinks the
     drink, walks out of view.  After a moment, the lights go out.

     EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS -- NIGHT

     An old, dented CAR makes its way up the tight, twisting
     roads of the Hollywood Hills.  Eddie's at the wheel.  Not
     far behind, Welles' rental car follows...

     FURTHER ON

     Eddie's car pulls into the driveway under the porch of a
     ramshackle HOUSE, parks.  Welles' car passes by...

     FURTHER, AROUND A CURVE

     Welles' car slows once it's out of sight, turns around,
     moving back down the hill, slowly...

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles turns out his headlights, coming around the curve
     just far enough so the ramshackle house is in view.  Welles
     watches Eddie walk up the stairs to the house.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie has a visitor.  There's a pretty
     GIRL, wearing a tube top, in a chair facing his desk.
     Eddie's talking, gesticulating, smiling, cajoling.

     Welles watches through binoculars.

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's still taking, stands, coming
     around the desk and placing a hand on the girl's shoulder.
     The girl says something.  Eddie responds.  The woman shakes
     her head, getting up to leave.  Eddie seems to be asking her
     to stay, following as she moves out of view.  Eddie comes
     back alone, sits at his desk, picks up the phone.


     INT.  ESPIONAGE SHOP -- DAY

     Ultra high tech for sale.  Welles examines items on the
     sales counter as the SALESPERSON watches: a pair of sma1l,
     round LISTENING DEVICES, a complicated RECEIVER/TAPE
     RECORDER, and a TONE DECODER with LED window.

                             WELLES 
                 Okay, I'll take it all.

                             SALESPERSON 
                 Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and
                 American Express.

                             WELLES
                 Cash.

     Welles takes out a thick wad, starts counting.

                             SALESPERSON
                 Alright.
                       (at register) 
                 May I have your phone number, area
                 code first?

                             WELLES
                 No, you may not.

                             SALESPERSON
                 Okay.  Fine.

     Welles lays the money on the counter.  The salesperson takes
     the money, recounting.

                             SALESPERSON
                 I'm required by state law to inform
                 you that, while it's perfectly legal
                 for you to purchase these items, it
                 is illegal for you to use them for
                 any sort of...

                             WELLES
                 Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you
                 could bag it, I'll be on my way,
                 thank you.

                             SALESPERSON
                 Certainly, sir.

     The salesperson starts punching keys on the register.


     EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- NIGHT

     The blue building sits completely dark.

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT

     Welles comes quietly out from the stairwell, wears gloves.
     He moves down the hall to the door of "Celebrity Films Inc."

     He kneels, begins using LOCK-PICKING TOOLS on the door.

     INT.  CELEBRITY FILMS OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles enters, shuts the door and locks it.  He takes out
     his penlight.  There are POSTERS for cheap PORN FILMS on the
     wall that we couldn't see through binoculars.  Titles like
     "Sex Doctor," "Deep Ass," and "Penal Colony."

     There a two FILE CABINETS.  Welles pulls a few drawers,
     finds them locked.  VIDEO CASSETTES are everywhere, on the
     cabinets, on shelves, piled high on the floor.

     Welles goes to Eddie's desk, looking in drawers.  One drawer
     is full of X-RATED MAGAZINES.  Another's stuffed with
     paperwork, call sheets, contracts.

     Welles picks up Eddie's phone, unscrews the earpiece.  He
     takes the small, round LISTENING DEVICE from his pocket,
     peels off backing to expose adhesive.  He attaches the
     listening device inside the phone, puts it back together.

     Welles moves towards the door, sweeps the room with the
     penlight.  He stops at the file cabinets, takes his lock-
     picking tools out, begins working on one file's lock.

     He turns the lock, opens a file drawer.  Empty.  He opens
     another.  Inside: piles of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.

     Welles clenches his jaw.

     Faces of children.  Shirtless boys.  Girls in pigtails.


     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     Welles' RECEIVER/TAPE RECORDER'S set up by the window,
     recording, with the TONE DECODER plugged into it.  Welles
     LISTENS through HEADPHONE, looking through binoculars.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                       (through headphones)
                 ... half a dozen.  This is good
                 stuff, Jimbo...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's at his desk, on the PHONE...

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 You know how my tapes sell.  People
                 eat this stuff up.

                             MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 I had three jerkoffs trying to
                 return your tapes last month.  Do
                 you know how bad a skin flick has to
                 be for some jackass to come back
                 into my place with a fucking receipt,
                 and try to fucking return it? 

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Maybe there's something wrong with
                 the scumbag customers coming into
                 your place, ever think of that?

                             MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                 The only thing wrong is the cheap,
                 softcore crap you're peddling,
                 Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Look, you cocksucker...

                             MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                 Get together some upscale product
                 where the girls still have teeth in
                 their head.  Till then, fuck you.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Fuck you!

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie slams down the phone.  He CANNOT
     BE HEARD any longer.  He's cursing, shuffling paperwork.

     Welles takes off headphones, picks up his cellular phone.
     He drinks soda, opens the phone, dials, nervous, then looks
     back through the binoculars.  He waits, clears his throat.
     The PHONE'S RINGING... RINGING...

     On the floor, the REELS of the tape recorder are TURNING...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie answers the phone...

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Celebrity Films.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 Eddie.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Yeah, who's this?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 I know what you did.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 What?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 I know what you did.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Who is this.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six
                 years ago... 

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 What the fuck are you.. ?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 You killed that girl and you put it
                 on film.  You and your pals, you're
                 fucked.  You fucked up real good.

     Welles hits disconnect, still looking through binoculars.

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's slow to hang up the phone.  He
     stands, looking down at the phone, frozen.  Finally, he runs
     his hands through his hair, looks around the room, sits back
     down.  He gets out his bottle and pours himself a drink.

     Welles watches through binoculars, puts headphones back on.

                             WELLES
                 Come on, Eddie...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie sits motionless.

                             WELLES (O.S.)
                 ... come on...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie picks up the phone, DIALS a
     NUMBER.  We hear the PHONE RING in the HEADPHONES

                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphones)
                 ... Hello?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                       (through headphones)
                 Dino, it's Eddie... Eddie Poole...

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 What do you want?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 I just got a call... two seconds
                 ago, some motherfucker called...
                 says he knows about the loop.

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 What are you talking about?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 The loop!  The girl we did, what the
                 fuck do you think I'm talking
                 about?!  This guy calls and says he
                 knows about the fucking loop...

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 Bullshit.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 I'm telling you... 

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's
                 impossible.  Why are you bothering
                 me with this... ?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Because somebody just fucking called
                 me and fucking laid it out!

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 There's nothing there, you brain-
                 dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's
                 absolutely no way in this world to
                 connect us to anything.  I want you
                 to hang the phone up, and if you
                 call me about this again I'm going
                 to send a friend of mine out there
                 and have him crack you open with a
                 fucking rib spreader.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Dino...

                             DINO (V.O)
                 Nobody knows anything.

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: as DINO is HEARD HANGING UP, Eddie
     reacts, picks up his phone and throws it across the office.

     Welles sits back, trying to accept the realization that he's
     found them.  He looks to the PHOTO of the Third Man.

                             WELLES
                 That is you, isn't it, Eddie?

     Welles goes to the RECORDER, turns on the TONE DECODER.  Its
     LED window LIGHTS UP.  Welles hits STOP, REWIND, PLAY...

                             WELLES VOICE (V.O.)
                       (from recorder)
                 ... and your pals, you're fucked...

     Hits FAST FORWARD... hits PLAY, watching the TONE DECODER.
     From the RECORDER, the SOUND of EDDIE DIALING a NUMBER on
     his touch tone phone... and as EACH TONE is HEARD, a
     corresponding NUMBER appears on the DECODER'S LED readout:

                               ...1 212 555 9906...

     The recorder continues, REPLAYING the CONVERSATION between
     Eddie and Dino, while Welles studies the green LED digits.

                             WELLES
                       (quiet, to himself)
                 Two one two.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- NIGHT

     The brilliant lights of New York's peerless skyscrapers.

     EXT.  59TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT

     FOLLOW Welles' Ford as it moves along with traffic, crossing
     the 59th Street Bridge, into the heart of Manhattan.

     EXT.  BANK -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

     "Chase Manhattan Bank," mid-town.

     INT.  CHASE MANHATTAN BANK, SAFE DEPOSIT BOOTH -- DAY

     Welles puts the 8MM FILM into SAFE DEPOSIT DRAWER, shuts it.


     INT.  NY PUBLIC LIBRARY, REFERENCE -- DAY

     Busy and crowded, but quiet.  Welles places a massive tome
     down on a table:  "Haines Criss-Cross Directory."

     Welles sits, takes out his notepad, referring to the phone
     number written: "(212) 555-9906."  He opens the reference
     book, searching pages...

     Thousands of TELEPHONE NUMBERS are LISTED in SEQUENCE, each
     with an address.  Welles runs his finger down the page.

     EXT.  SOHO STREETS -- DAY

     PEDESTRIANS everywhere.  Streets are clogged with DELIVERY
     TRUCKS loading and unloading.  Cars horns blow.  Welles
     walks to an old, WAREHOUSE BUILDING shoulder to shoulder
     with other buildings, labeled "1204" in burnished steel.

     Welles climbs the stairs, examines the buzzers.

     The top button's labeled "Greystone Imports," the bottom
     button reads "Lang Interior Design, by appt."  The middle
     button is labeled only by a drawing of a BLACK WIDOW SPIDER.

     Welles looks up at the building.

     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, SOHO -- LATER DAY

     The sun is low.  Less activity on the street.  Welles leans
     against a car down the street, smoking a cigarette.

     TWO WOMEN walk this way, both in spiked high heels, dressed
     in cheap, short, formfitting skirts, both carrying duffel
     bags.  They start up the stairs of 1204...

     Welles throws his cigarette, walks to follow.

     The women hit the center button.  A BUZZER sounds as they
     head inside.  Welles hurries up the stairs, catching the
     door before it closes.

     INT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, ELEVATOR -- DAY

     Welles follows the women into a decrepit ELEVATOR.  One
     woman hits "2."  Welles hits "3," steps back in the corner.
     Elevator doors creak closed.  The two women are heavily made
     up, pretty, but worn, eyes dull.

     Welles looks down at the leg of one woman, noticing bruises
     through her fishnet stockings, poorly covered by make-up.

     Elevator doors open on the SECOND FLOOR.  The two women get
     out and walk down a grey hallway, towards DOUBLE DOORS
     painted black.  Welles stops the elevator door from closing.

     The women push the INTERCOM at the black doors.  Another
     dull BUZZ is HEARD as the women enter.  The low rumble of
     HEAVY METAL MUSIC is HEARD, SILENCED as doors swing shut.

     Welles lets the elevator close.

     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     The elevator opens on the FIRST FLOOR.  Welles gets out,
     instead of leaving the way he came, heads towards the
     rear... FOLLOW him down a hallway, past a SERVICE ELEVATOR...

     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles comes out BACK DOORS into an sunless alleyway with
     fire escapes above.  There's a TRASH DUMPSTER, overflowing.
     Rats scatter upon Welles, arrival.

     Welles looks to make sure he's alone.  He starts tearing
     open GARBAGE BAGS.  Flies swarm.  One bag's filled with
     empty food containers and old newspapers.

     Welles tears open another bag, finds burnt out FLORESCENT
     LIGHTBULBS, digs out a handful of empty PHOTO PAPER
     PACKAGES, bottles of DEVELOPING CHEMICALS.  He pulls out a
     few MAGAZINES; Time, Newsweek, etc...

     The magazines are cut up, falling apart, with pictures
     chopped out from many pages.  Welles examines ADDRESS LABELS:

     "Dino Velvet/D.V. Films
      1204 Keller Street
      New York, NY 10049"

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH, NYC STREETS -- NIGHT

     Welles is on the PHONE.  The city bustles past.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 What do you know about a guy called
                 Dino Velvet?  Dino Velvet Films?

     INT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY -- INTERCUT

     Max is on the phone by the register, ringing purchases.

                             MAX
                       (into phone)
                 Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the
                 John Luc Godard of S+M flicks,
                 supposed to be a real weirdo.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd
                 have thought it?

                             MAX
                       (into phone)
                 His stuff comes out of New York.
                 Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic
                 Hardcore.  Definitely not for the
                 squeamish.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 Specialty product.

                             MAX
                 You're learning.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 Where does he sell it?

                             MAX
                 Out of the back of bondage magazines
                 mostly, but you can find it on the
                 street if you look.  He'll also do
                 commissions, for enough money...

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

                             MAX (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Nothing illegal, it's always
                 borderline.  Like if some freak
                 wants to see a transvestite in a
                 full rubber immersion suit getting
                 an enema from a...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Alright, I get the picture.

                             MAX (V.O.)
                 He cuts all kinds of other stuff
                 into his movies; photographs,
                 newsreel footage, subliminal images.
                 Thinks he's making art.

                             WELLES 
                 Well, I'm in New York now.  What do
                 you say to flying out and giving me
                 a hand?

                             MAX (V.O.)
                 I'm a working stiff, pops.

                             WELLES
                 Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four
                 hundred a day, plus expenses.

                             MAX (V.O.)
                 You want me to come out there and
                 play private eye?

                             WELLES
                 Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up
                 whatever Dino Velvet films you can.
                 Get receipts.  I'll call back.

                             MAX (V.O.)
                 See ya.

     Welles hangs up, starts feeding quarters into the phone.

     INT.  MRS. CHRISTIAN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     Mrs. Christian's in bed, pale and sickly.  The PHONE RINGS.
     Mrs. Christian reaches for it.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                       (into phone, weakly)
                 Hello?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                       (coughing)
                 How are you?  Having any luck?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 I don't know if luck's the word.
                 Are you feeling alright?

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 I've been ordered into bed.  The
                 doctor says I've gotten the flu, or
                 some other wretched ailment.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 I hope it's nothing serious.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 Nothing more than a bother.  Have
                 you any news for me?

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 I've made progress.  I'm in
                 Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces
                 fall into place, I'll drive to you
                 and give you an update.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Fine...

     MRS. CHRISTIAN is HEARD COUGHING.  Welles waits.

                             WELLES
                 I've got about five thousand left in
                 cash, but I'll need another thirty,
                 if you approve.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 How will I get it to you?

                             WELLES
                 If you have a pencil and paper, I'll
                 tell you how to send it.


     EXT.  MOTEL, HELL'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     A TAXI pulls over in front of this flea-bag motel.  Max gets
     out with a SUITCASE, looks at the dubious accommodations.

     INT.  MOTEL, MAX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Max enters with Welles, turns on a light and throws his
     suitcase on the bed.  The room is disgusting.

                             MAX
                 You didn't say it was gonna be this
                 luxurious.

                             WELLES
                 It's their Presidential Suite.

                             MAX
                 Great.

     Max looks in the bathroom.

                             MAX
                 Oh, come on, man, what are we doing
                 in this flea bag?

                             WELLES
                 It's cheap, and people know to mind
                 their own business. What have you
                 got for me? 

     Max opens his suitcase, takes out THREE VIDEO TAPES.

     He hands them to Welles.  The boxes are covered in jumbled
     PHOTO COLLAGES: American flag, S+M men and women, a skull,
     mannequins, a scorpion, cut-outs of arms, legs and eyeballs.

                             MAX
                 Dino Velvet.

     INT.  WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles is lit by the flicker from the TELEVISION SCREEN.  WE
     SEE NOTHING.  We HEAR the rhythmic MUFFLED MOANS of a WOMAN
     from the TV, can't tell if it's pleasure or pain.

     Max is asleep in the bed, PIZZA BOX near his feet.

     Welles drinks beer, gets up and ejects the CASSETTE from a
     VCR, tosses it aside, tired.  He picks another Dino Velvet
     TAPE, puts it in, sits.

     ON TV: GOTHIC ROCK is HEARD over old, scratchy IMAGES: of
     Klansmen around a burning cross... Dracula menacing a
     sleeping woman... a man in a Devil costume dancing...

     Welles opens another beer.

     ON TV: a WOMAN is tied up, arms in the air, hanging from the
     ceiling, gagged and blindfolded, in a dungeon lit by
     candelabras.  Then, glimpsed IMAGES: worms writhing in
     slime... gargoyles... a guillotine falling.  Then, the bound
     woman, struggling.  A MASKED MAN in a leather jacket enters.
     He wears a LEATHER MASK with zipper eyes and mouth...

     This focuses Welles' attention.

     ON TV: the Masked Man circles the captured woman...

                             WELLES
                 Max... wake up...

     Max awakens, rolling over, groggy.

                             MAX
                 Wha... ?

                             WELLES
                       (points at TV)
                 Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?

     Max tries to see, eyes barely open.

                             MAX
                 He's one of the lunatics Dino uses.
                 He's in a bunch of these.

     Welles watches.  On the TV, Masked Man takes off his jacket
     shirtless, reveals an impossibly muscled body.  Huge arms,
     thick chest, oiled, dotted in pimples. 

                             MAX
                 Why?  He have something to do with
                 whatever you're into?

     Still watching the behemoth on TV, Welles is less sure.

     ON TV: the bulging Masked Man flexes, ripped.

                             WELLES
                 No... it's nothing... that's not him.

     Welles rubs his eyes, sits back.  Max sits up, watching.

     ON TV: Masked Man pulls the bound woman's head back by her
     hair, licks her face with his thick tongue...

     CLOSE ON: Masked Man grips the woman's head, still licking.
     He pulls down the woman's blindfold...

     Welles sits forward, realizing, horrified...

     Welles goes to the VCR, hits PAUSE.  The IMAGE on TV
     FREEZES.  Welles goes back, FRAME by FRAME...

     ... to the CLOSE UP where Masked Man grips the woman's face.
     FREEZE FRAME.  On Masked Man's hand: a TATTOO, on the arch
     between his forefinger and thumb, same as the scrawny Masked
     Man in the snuff film.  A PENTAGRAM TATTOO.

                             WELLES
                 Who is he?

                             MAX
                 I told you, he's one of Dino
                 Velvet's stock players...

                             WELLES
                 Who is he, his name?

                             MAX
                 Nobody knows his name.  That's his
                 thing.  He always wears a mask.  You
                 never see his face.  He calls
                 himself "Machine," that's what they
                 call him.  Machine. 

     Welles hits PLAY.  On TV, Masked Man runs his hands up and
     down the woman's body.  The woman's eyes are filled with
     fear.  Welles sits, unnerved, watching.

                             MAX
                 They say he's half brain-dead from
                 all the steroids he's using.

     Max rolls over, trying to get back to sleep.

                             MAX
                 He's a brutal motherfucker, man.  He
                 loves what he does for a living. 


     INT.  WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- DAY

     Welles enters, carries an OVERNIGHT PACKAGE and his LOCK
     BOX.  At the desk, he tears open the package, opens the
     MANILA ENVELOPE inside; finds FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in
     thousand dollar bills, wrapped in plastic and masking tape.

     Welles takes the lock box to the bed and works the
     combination, opens it.  He takes out the holster, stands
     looking down at the gun.  He puts the holster on.


     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles' Ford waits with turn signal on.  A car pulls out of
     a parking space.  Welles takes the space.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY

     Max is in the passenger seat.  Welles looks to 1204.

                             WELLES
                 You don't need to be here.

                             MAX
                 What kind of Junior P.I. would I be
                 if I didn't go with you?

     INT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY

     Welles and Max get off the elevator, moving down the grey
     hall, to the black doors.  Welles pushes the INTERCOM
     BUTTON.  After a moment, the INTERCOM CRACKLES...

                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (from intercom)
                 Who is it?

     Welles waits, presses the button again.

     INT.  DINO VELVET STUDIO -- DAY

     The doors BUZZ and Welles and Max warily enter this large,
     dark, converted warehouse.  Square pillars shoot from floor
     to ceiling.  Shafts of light cut down from high windows.

     A large THUG in a pinstripe suit crosses from a far DESK.

                             THUG
                 You're in the wrong place.

                             WELLES
                 We're looking for Mr. Velvet.

                             THUG
                 He's not here. 

     Welles looks around, at piles of PROPS; a huge faux-stone
     ANGEL and GARGOYLES, elaborate CANDELABRAS, a huge BIRDCAGE,
     massive WOODEN CROSS, NAZI FLAGS.

                             WELLES
                 Why don't you tell him we're here to
                 give him a large sum of money.  If
                 he's not interested, we'll go.

                             THUG
                 You should leave now, before I have
                 to remove you.

     Welles just stands looking at the thug.  A VOICE is HEARD...

                             DINO VELVET'S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (from SPEAKERS)
                 Show them in, Milo.

     Welles and Max look up.  There are SPEAKERS mounted high up
     on the pillars, and SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS looking down.

                             WELLES
                 You heard the boss, Milo.

     The disgruntled thug starts back across the studio towards
     a distant DOOR.  Welles and Max follow...

     They notice an elaborate set built in one corner, a TORTURE
     CHAMBER, complete with RACK and IRON MAIDEN.

     INT.  DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- DAY

     Thug opens the door and lets Welles and Max in.
     The office is huge, windowless walls covered in thousands of
     PICTURES from every conceivable source, torn and cut, pinned
     up to form an indecipherable collage.  A tall LADDER leans
     against one wall, near three TELEVISIONS.

     DINO VELVET rises behind his desk, a small, bird-like man,
     wearing a black suit and bad hairpiece.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Come in.  Make yourself comfortable.

     Welles shakes Dino's hand.  Max looks up at the walls.
     IMAGES; porn pictures, news photos, world leaders, autopsy
     photos, armies and insects, the naked and the dead.

                             WELLES
                 It's an honor to meet you.  Thank
                 you for seeing us.

                             DINO VELVET
                 What can I do for you today?

     Welles sits.  Shelves behind Dino's desk are piled high with
     VIDEO CASSETTES, old MOVIE CAMERAS, big REELS of 16mm FILM.
     VIDEOS and MAGAZINES are stacked everywhere.

                             WELLES
                 I'd like to commission a work.  I'm
                 a great admirer of yours.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Flattering.  And, who's your
                 colorful little chum?

                             WELLES
                 A fellow investor.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Hmm.

                             MAX
                 You're the only one still shooting
                 film and transferring it to video.
                 Nobody appreciates that kind of
                 integrity anymore... the grain, the
                 gritty look you get.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Well, I'm glad you appreciate it.
                       (to Welles)
                 What would you say is your favorite
                 piece?

     Welles considers.  Max glances over, looks back to the walls.

                             MAX
                 I know if I had to pick, it'd be
                 "Choke," or "Devil."

                             WELLES
                 "Devil" frightened me as much as it
                 excited me, but I'd be hard pressed
                 to choose a favorite.

     Dino grins, showing yellowed teeth.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You said something about money.

                             WELLES
                 Yes.  What we're looking for is
                 rather specific.

     Welles takes out an ENVELOPE, puts it on the desk.

                             WELLES
                 That's five thousand dollars.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Is it?

                             WELLES
                 Five thousand now, five thousand on
                 delivery. 
                 Two women, one white and one black,
                 as long as they have large breasts.
                 Hard bondage, or course.  Other than
                 that, trusting your artistic
                 interpretation, I have only two
                 stipulations.

                             DINO VELVET
                 And they are?

                             WELLES
                 I want to watch you work.

                             DINO VELVET
                 I'll consider it.

                             WELLES
                 And the other performer... it has to
                 be that monster you use... the man
                 in the mask.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Machine.

                             WELLES
                 If it's not him, there's no deal.

     Dino drums his painted fingernails on his lips.

                             DINO VELVET
                 He might be interested... but it
                 would mean another five thousand.

                             WELLES
                 We can do that.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Well, well, I'll have to put my
                 thinking-cap on about all this.
                 You'll leave the money as a deposit?
                       (off Welles' nod)
                 Very good.

     Dino stands, picks up a still CAMERA off his desk and comes
     to look at Welles, studying him.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You have a beautiful face... the way
                 the light hits it.  I'd like to take
                 your picture.  You don't mind?

                             WELLES
                 I'd rather you didn't.

                             DINO VELVET
                 What's the problem? 

                             WELLES
                 I'm camera shy.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You trust me to keep your money, but
                 not to take your picture?

                             WELLES
                 Those are two different kinds of
                 trust.
                       (stands)
                 Thank you for your time.  I hope we
                 can do business.

     Welles leaves.  Max goes with him.  Dino watches them leave.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN STREET -- NIGHT

     HORNS BLARE.  TWO CARS have collided head-on.  A large CROWD
     gathers.  One windshield's shattered, blood spattered.  The
     driver is slumped over the wheel, gushing blood.

     On a nearby street corner, Welles in on a PAY PHONE.
     HEAVY METAL can be HEARD filtered through the receiver.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 So, what do you say?

     INT.  DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     Dino's stands in the middle of his office, naked, his back
     to us, 8MM camera in hand, on the phone.  A NAKED WOMAN
     dances for Dino.  A Heavy Metal MUSIC VIDEO plays on a TV.

                             DINO VELVET
                       (into phone)
                 I'll do this for you.  Fifteen
                 thousand dollars.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Machine's in?

                             DINO VELVET
                       (into phone)
                 He's in.  It will be his pleasure.

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

                             DINO VELVET (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Be at 366 Hoyt Avenue, three
                 o'clock, tomorrow.

     Welles digs out his notepad, writing. 

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Where's that?

                             DINO VELVET (V.O.)
                 Brooklyn.  Don't be late.


     EXT.  MOTEL COURTYARD, POOL -- NIGHT

     HORNS and TRAFFIC are HEARD.  Max and Welles sit in lawn
     chairs at the tiny pool.  Welles smokes.  Max drinks beer.
     They watch an ELDERLY WOMAN in a one piece bathing suit
     climb from the pool and walk to the diving board, diving in.

                             MAX
                 What's next?

                             WELLES
                 I'm trying to figure that out
                 myself.  I have to see Machine
                 without his mask.

                             MAX
                 Still don't want to tell me what
                 you're doing?

                             WELLES
                 Nope.

     The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.
     Welles takes out a thick ENVELOPE, hands it to Max.

                             WELLES
                 This is for you.

     Max doesn't understand, opens the envelope, finds about
     fifteen thousand dollars in the envelope.

                             MAX
                 What's this?

                             WELLES
                 It's money.  People use it to
                 purchase goods and services.

     Max looks at it again, can't believe it.

                             MAX
                 Look... that's awful generous and
                 everything...

                             WELLES
                 It's not my money.  The woman I got
                 it from is never going to give it a
                 second thought.  Let's not make a
                 big deal out of this, okay? 
                       (pause)
                 Go be a race car driver.  Go run for
                 President.  Whatever.

     Welles puts his cigarette out, stands.

                             WELLES
                 I'll see you around.

     Welles walks away, heading to his room.  Max watches him go,
     doesn't know what to say, looks in the envelope.

     The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.


     EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS -- DAY

     A deserted, war zone neighborhood of abandoned, graffittied
     buildings.  A few burnt out cars on the street.  Welles
     drives through, watchful.

     Welles drives past a huge TWO-STORY WAREHOUSE, does a u-turn.
     He parks the car.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY

     Welles checks his gun, returns it to his holster.

     EXT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles climbs crumbling concrete stairs, looking all
     directions, crossing a LOADING DOCK towards a DOOR...

     INT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles enters slowly, trying to get his eyes to adjust to
     the darkness.  A vast, empty space looms before him.

     In the middle of the warehouse, Dino Velvet stands, in a
     powder blue suit, holding an archery BOW and ARROW.

                             DINO VELVET
                 There you are.  Come join us.

     There's a wrought IRON BED not far from Dino.  MACHINE is
     seated on the mattress, a huge man, wearing a leather S+M
     harness and the same WRESTLING MASK as in the snuff film.

     Welles gathers his courage, walks towards them.

     Dino pulls back on the bow, aiming away across the
     warehouse.  He stands by a TABLE with a QUIVER of ARROWS
     propped up.  He shoots an arrow toward a large TARGET...

     Strikes the target dead center, BULL'S-EYE.  As Welles gets
     closer, he notices several things ... 

     ... a 16MM CAMERA mounted on a TRIPOD, facing the bed, along
     with several movie LIGHTS

     ... several BOWIE KNIFES are laid out on the table, beside
     a pair of HANDCUFFS...

     ... Machine is watching him as he approaches...

     Welles stops, not far from Dino and Machine, but keeping his
     distance.  Dino's still firing arrows at the target.
     Machine's still staring at Welles.

                             WELLES
                       (to Machine)
                 Hello.

     Machine just stares at him with bloodshot eyes.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You brought the money?

                             WELLES
                       (takes out envelope)
                 Right here.

     Dino lets fly another arrow... another bull's-eye, then
     turns to look at Welles with a smile.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Excellent.

                             WELLES
                 Where are the women?

                             DINO VELVET
                 They should be here any minute.

     Welles comes forward slowly, places the envelope on the
     table, beside Bowie knifes.  He's sweating.

                             WELLES
                       (of the knifes)
                 What are these for?

                             DINO VELVET
                 Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just
                 props.  Nice, aren't they?

                             WELLES
                 Sure.

     Dino walks across towards the target.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Machine and I were just talking
                 about knifes.  The beauty of
                 knifes...

     Dino pulls arrows from the target.

                             DINO VELVET
                 He was saying how fascinated he is
                 by their simple ability to be sharp.
                 The ability of a piece of metal to
                 be so thin that it is almost
                 nothing...

     Dino walks back to the table, replaces the arrows in the
     quiver, cueing another arrow in is bow.

                             DINO VELVET
                 So close to nothingness that it cuts
                 with minimum effort, because it's so
                 non-intrusive.  Flesh is fooled.  It
                 blooms open as the blade widens, but
                 by then it's too late, because the
                 knife's already doing its pure,
                 simple damage.

     Dino shoots another arrow to the target.
     A CLATTER attracts Welles attention.  Far across the
     warehouse, a DELIVERY DOOR rolls upwards.  A CAR with tinted
     windows drives in...

     The MAN who opened the door, silhouetted in sunlight, stays
     behind to close the door as the car pulls forward...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Ah, ours guests have arrived.

     Machine stands.  He is a giant.
     Welles takes a few steps back, wary, sweating hard now.

     The car parks across the warehouse, not far from the target.

     Dino puts another arrow in his bow, pulls it taunt, aims at
     the target... turns, aims the arrow at Welles.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Mister Welles... would you be so
                 kind as to remove any firearms from
                 your person?

                             WELLES
                 What are you... ?

                             DINO VELVET
                 Take out your gun!

     Welles brings his hand towards his holster...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Slowly.  Let me see it.

     Welles takes out his gun, looks across the warehouse...

     The SILHOUETTED MAN is walking this way.  Can't tell who he
     is yet.  Machine heads the direction of the parked car.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Empty the gun onto the table, very
                 carefully.

                             WELLES
                 Look, I don't know what this...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say,
                 or I'll put this arrow through your
                 throat.

     Welles obeys, helpless, dumps the bullets out on the table.

     The SILHOUETTED MAN'S getting closer.  It's Eddie Poole.

                             EDDIE
                 Is that him?

                             DINO VELVET
                       (to Welles)
                 Put the gun down, take the
                 handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the
                 bed.

     Welles obeys, walks to the bed.
     Welles attaches one cuff to the bed's iron rail, fastens the
     other cuff around his wrist. Dino puts down the bow and arrow.

                             DINO VELVET
                       (still to Welles)
                 Didn't know what to make of you at
                 first, and you certainly had Eddie
                 on pins and needles.  But, lo and
                 behold, from out of the blue came an
                 old business acquaintance to explain
                 everything...

     Welles looks across to the car...
     The sinister lawyer, Longdale, gets out from behind the
     wheel and hands the keys to Machine, walks this way...

                             EDDIE
                 This is the fucker?  Motherfucker,
                 doesn't look like anything...

     Eddie walks around the bed, studies Welles.  Welles watches
     him.  Eddie goes to stand behind Welles, rushes forward...

     PUNCHES Welles in the side of the head.
     Welles goes down, clutching his face.

                             EDDIE
                 Doesn't look like shit.

     Eddie pulls Welles to his feet, throws him against the bed,
     frisking him from head to toe.

     Longdale comes to stand beside Dino, nervous, taking out a
     tiny HANDGUN and pointing it at Welles.  Welles looks up,
     holding his head, afraid, sits on the bed.

                             DINO VELVET
                     (to Welles)
                 You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?

                             WELLES
                 I remember him.

                             LONGDALE
                 Let's get this over with.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Fine idea.

     Dino comes to sit on the bed beside Welles.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You're going to go get the film you
                 received from Mrs. Christian, bring
                 it here and put it in my hand.  And
                 to save time, so we make this as
                 efficient as possible, there's an
                 incentive...

     Dino puts his fingers in his mouth, lets out a sharp WHISTLE.

     Across the warehouse, Machine uses the car keys to open the
     trunk of the car, pulls SOMEONE out...

     It's Max, beaten bloody, bound, face swollen, gagged, hardly
     conscious.  Machine throws him to the floor.

                             WELLES
                 No...

     Welles tries to go towards Max, yanked back by the
     handcuffs, pulls the bed a few inches, but it's heavy.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Friend of yours?

                             WELLES
                 Look, he's got nothing to do with
                 this... let him go...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Can you guess what I'm going to say
                 next?

                             WELLES
                 He doesn't know anything... he's got
                 nothing to do with this...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Bring the film, or we kill him.

     Sorrow and rage rises up in Welles, but there's no choice.

                             WELLES
                 I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit
                 box, in the city...

                             DINO VELVET
                 How cooperative.  Longdale will keep
                 you company.

     Dino takes out HANDCUFF KEYS, throws them to Longdale.
     Longdale approaches Welles carefully, unlocking him.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Don't let Longdale's questionable
                 choice of weapon give you any ideas.
                 If his fey little gun puts enough
                 little holes in you, you'll be just
                 as dead... and so will Max.

                             EDDIE
                 Move it, dirtbag... !

     Eddie comes to SHOVE Welles.  Welles stumbles to the
     ground, gets to his feet.  Welles walks, takes one last
     glance back towards Max.  Longdale follows.

                             DINO VELVET
                       (watching them go)
                 Do hurry.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN STREETS -- DAY

     Welles' car moves in the slow flow of traffic into mid-town.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles is at the wheel.  Longdale is in the passenger seat,
     gun held in his lap.

                             WELLES
                 You were the middleman, am I right?
                 Old man Christian wasn't about to go
                 shopping for a snuff film himself.

                             LONGDALE
                 Wouldn't exactly have been possible
                 for a man of his stature.

                             WELLES
                 So, he sent you, gave you the money,
                 his errand-boy.  And if you refused,
                 it wasn't like you could tell anyone
                 your pervert boss just asked you to
                 get him a snuff film.  That's the
                 beauty of lawyer/client privilege.

                             LONGDALE
                 That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted
                 me implicitly.

                             WELLES
                 Must have paid you a lot, for you to
                 risk everything.  Would've had to
                 have cut yourself a real nice piece
                 of money.

                             LONGDALE
                 I was well compensated.

                             WELLES
                 That's why you got scared when Mrs.
                 Christian hired me.  You knew about
                 the film, figured it had to be in
                 that safe.  How'd you find me?

                             LONGDALE
                 Never mind how I found you.

                             WELLES
                 Followed me... must have freaked out
                 when you saw me closing in on your
                 buddies...

                             LONGDALE
                 They're no friends of mine.

                             WELLES
                 Except, you're willing commit murder
                 with them.

                             LONGDALE
                 None of this would be happening if
                 you would have left it alone.  If
                 you weren't digging up a girl who
                 died six years ago.  A girl no one
                 even remembers.

                             WELLES
                 Mary Anne Mathews, that was her
                 name.  Her mom remembers her.

     Welles looks at Longdale.

                             WELLES
                 You found these smut dealers and
                 asked to buy a snuff film, right?
                 Wanted them to find you one.  Well,
                 they didn't find you one, Longdale,
                 they went out and made you one...

                             LONGDALE
                 Shut up.

                             WELLES
                 Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you
                 paid money to have her murdered.

                             LONGDALE
                 Shut your mouth and drive!

                             WELLES
                 Did it get him off, huh, watching
                 them cut her up?  Tell me, because
                 I really want to understand.  Did he
                 jerk off to it?  You watch it with
                 him, sit there giving him a handjob
                 while you both watched... ?

     Longdale jams the gun against Welles' side.

                             LONGDALE 
                 You're making me very angry.

                             WELLES
                 Just tell me.  Tell me some more of
                 the secrets you and Christian
                 shared. What kind of degenerate
                 pervert was he really?  What the
                 fuck did he want with a snuff film?

                             LONGDALE
                 You're asking me why?

                             WELLES
                 I'm asking.

     Longdale sits back, wipes sweat from his face.

                             LONGDALE
                 A man like Mr. Christian, a great
                 man... all his money, all his
                 power... a man who attained
                 everything there was to attain...

                             WELLES
                 Why did he buy a film of some poor,
                 lost girl getting butchered?

                             LONGDALE
                 Isn't it incredibly obvious?

                             WELLES
                 Enlighten me.

                             LONGDALE
                 Because he could.  He did it because
                 he could.
                       (pause)
                 What other reason were you looking
                 for?

     Welles tightens his grip on the wheel, numbed. 


     EXT.  CHASE MANHATTAN BANK -- DAY

     Welles double parks, puts his hazard lights on.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS

     Longdale sits forward, looks to the bank.

                             LONGDALE
                 You've got four minutes till I call
                 Mr. Velvet and let him know there's
                 a problem.

     Longdale takes a CELLULAR PHONE from his pocket, shows it.
     Welles climbs out, heading to the bank...

     INT.  BANK, SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT -- DAY

     Welles and the SAFE DEPOSIT MANAGER enter.  They go to put
     their KEYS in one drawer, unlocking it a pulling it out.

                             MANAGER
                 May I show you to a booth...

                             WELLES
                 No, I've got it.

     Welles pulls the drawer open, takes the 8MM film out and
     hands the empty drawer to the manager, exiting.

     INT.  BANK -- DAY

     Welles comes out from the SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT, pocketing the
     film, crossing towards the entrance, looking around...

     ... at other CUSTOMERS waiting on line...

     ... at a GUARD with a GUN at his side...

     Welles detours, toward one of the LOAN DESKS.  The BANK
     EMPLOYEE behind the desk is occupied, on the phone.

     As Welles moves past the desk, he grabs a PAIR of SCISSORS
     from a pencil holder and palms it, heading to the door...

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY

     Welles gets behind the wheel.  Longdale looks at his watch.

                             LONGDALE
                 You almost went over your limit.

                             WELLES
                 Fuck you.

     Welles puts the car in gear and drives. 

                             LONGDALE
                 Give me the film.

                             WELLES 
                 You'll get it when we get there.

     Longdale puts the gun to the side of Welles' head.

                             LONGDALE
                 Give me the film.

                             WELLES
                 Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try
                 driving to Brooklyn with my brains
                 all over the windshield.

     Welles keeps driving.  Longdale sits back, stewing.


     INT.  WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     The door is kicked open.  Welles enters, takes the 8MM FILM
     out and holds it in his hand.  Longdale follows.

     As Welles moves forward, his face goes slack...

     Machine is seated on the bed, Eddie and Dino stand smoking
     cigarettes, and further on, Max is tied to the target,
     slumped over, three arrows in his chest.  Dead.

                             WELLES
                 No!!

     Welles runs towards Max, crying out, tears in his eyes...

     Machine rises, goes to intercept Welles, grabbing him.
     Welles tries to break free, but Machine lifts Welles up and
     throws him brutally to the ground.

     Welles scrambles to get up...

                             WELLES
                 You fuckers!

     Eddie comes to KICK Welles in the face.
     Welles is sent sprawling, blood gushing from his nose.  He
     lays there, stunned, weeping.

     Eddie pries the 8MM FILM from Welles' hand, tosses it...

     Dino catches the film.

     Machine comes to drag Welles towards the bed.

     Dino unspools the film, holding it up to examine it.

     Machine handcuffs Welles to the metal bedframe.  Welles
     falls to his knees, holding his face.
     Eddie PUNCHES Welles in the head.

                             EDDIE
                 You're a dead man.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Leave him alone.

                             EDDIE
                 Fuck off.

     Eddie PUNCHES Welles in the kidney.  Welles tries to protect
     himself.  Eddie raises his fist to punch again, but Machine
     catches Eddie's fist, throws Eddie back...

                             EDDIE
                 What the fuck... !

                             DINO
                 I promised him to Machine.

     Eddie looks up at Machine, who towers over him.

                             EDDIE
                 ... sorry...

                             DINO VELVET
                 First things first.  You might want
                 to watch this, Mr. Welles...

     Welles looks up through tears...
     Dino drops the 8MM FILM on the floor, takes a small bottle
     of lighter fluid from his pocket.  Longdale comes to watch.

     Welles watches helpless, agonizing...

                             WELLES
                 Don't... please...

     Dino drops the film to the floor, sprays it with fluid,
     takes out matches, light one, drops it...

     The 8MM FILM goes up in flame...

     Welles watches, quaking, hysterical, trying to pull himself
     towards the flame, dragging the bed...

     The film is destroyed by flame...

     Welles gives up, presses his face to the floor, eyes shut.

                             DINO VELVET
                 And so it ends.  It's as if she
                 never existed.

     Welles falls back, gasping, wiping blood and tears and
     spittle from his face, getting slowly, to his feet.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Don't blame yourself.  You were in
                 way over your head.

     He looks to Max's corpse, to the smoldering film...
     Swallowing back his fear, panic and rage...

                             WELLES
                 Motherfuckers.  Small time,
                 motherfuckers... !  Tell me
                 something...

     Welles spits blood, hangs onto the bed for support.

                             WELLES
                 I know why you did it, Dino,
                 Eddie... but, why'd the lawyer do
                 it?  Must have been a helluva lot of
                 money, right?  One fuckload of
                 money...

     Welles sits on the bed, eyes burning with fury.

                             WELLES
                 So, what are you all still doing
                 small time, huh?  What are you still
                 doing in the sewer, Eddie?!
                 Christian gave Longdale a million
                 dollars to find him a snuff film.
                 How much did you ever see... ?

     Eddie and Dino look to Longdale.

                             EDDIE
                 What's he talking about?

                             WELLES
                 One million dollars, Dino.  How much
                 did he tell you he had...

     Longdale's getting very nervous.

                             LONGDALE
                 He's lying.

                             WELLES
                 Look at him.  You think he played it
                 square?  How much did he give you,
                 how much did he keep for himself?

     Eddie walks towards Longdale...

                             EDDIE
                 What the fuck's he talking about?

     Longdale takes out his gun, aims it at Machine, Dino and
     Eddie, scared...

                             LONGDALE
                 Stay away from me. 

                             DINO VELVET
                 What's going on, Longdale?  Did this
                 happen?

                             EDDIE
                 You sell us short, you fuck?

                             LONGDALE
                 Stay back!  You have a gun, Eddie,
                 show it to me.  Now!

     Eddie slowly takes out his gun, seething.

                             LONGDALE
                 Put it on the ground, kick it here...

     Eddie puts the gun down, kicks it...
     Longdale picks it up, throws it far away.

                             EDDIE
                 You fucking lawyer...

                             LONGDALE
                 Move back!  All of you... move!

     Machine, Dino and Eddie stand between Longdale and the car
     with tinted windows parked across the warehouse...

                             DINO VELVET
                 What were you thinking?

     Welles watches as Machine, Dino and Eddie back slowly away
     from Longdale.  Longdale's gun hand is shaky...

     Welles tries to drag himself towards the table where his gun
     and bullets are, dragging the bed, inch by inch...

     Longdale back away, trying to angle around the menacing trio
     so he can get to the car...

                             LONGDALE
                 Back off!  Everything's been taken
                 care of, and I'm leaving now...

                             DINO VELVET
                 You're not going anywhere if you
                 fucked us, lawyer.

                             LONGDALE
                 I'm leaving.

                             EDDIE
                 You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna
                 kill us all, is that it?

                             DINO VELVET
                 You betrayed us.

                             LONGDALE
                 Stay where you are!

     Machine edges forward, holding his hands in the air.
     Longdale brandishes the gun...

                             LONGDALE
                 Keep back!

     Machine, Eddie and Dino are held at bay...

                             DINO VELVET
                 You're not gonna live through this.

     Welles still tries to get to the table, wrist bleeding in
     the cuff, bed screeching across the floor...

     Machine, hands up, slowly reaches behind his shoulder,
     touches the handle of a huge KNIFE sheathed to his back.

                             LONGDALE
                 Our business is done, I'm leaving,
                 no one's going to stop me...

     Longdale glances towards the car, seems like he's about to
     make a run for it.  Dino Velvet takes a step forward...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Fuck you!

     Machine unsheathes the KNIFE and THROWS...

     THUNK!  The knife imbeds to the hilt in Longdale's chest and
     Longdale's gun FIRES...

     Dino Velvet flies backwards, shot in the face!

     Dino hits the ground, screaming, writhing, hands to his
     face, blood pouring out between his fingers.

     Longdale falls back onto his ass, sitting there, eyes bugged
     out in surprise.  He looks down at the knife in his chest.

     Machine lets out a SCREAM, runs to Dino...

     Machine falls to his knees and grips Dino, tries to hold
     him.  Dino's screaming, squirming frantically...

     Longdale sits looking down at the knife in his chest, looks
     up, and gallons of blood pour from his mouth...

                             EDDIE
                 Fuck.

     Eddie comes to look down at the Longdale.  Longdale falls
     back, dead, blood still flowing from his maw.

     Welles drags the heavy bed, getting closer to the table...

     Eddie spins, looks across to see Welles struggling...

     Dino breaks free from Machine, runs blindly, still holding
     his gushing face, falls, tries to get back up...

     Eddie runs towards Welles.

     Dino stumbles forwards, writhing, then suddenly lays still.

     Machine rises, looking at Dino.  Tears come out from
     Machine's eyes and roll down his mask.

     One last gasp and shudder from Dino's body; death rattle.

     Welles pulls the bed, practically pulling his arm from the
     socket, desperately clawing towards the table...
     The table is mere feet away...

     Eddie arrives, KICK Welles in the ribs...

     Welles recoils.  Eddies KICKS again.  Welles curls into a
     ball.  Eddie KICKS again...

                             MACHINE (O.S.)
                 NO!

     Eddie stops, looks to Machine.

                             MACHINE
                 He's mine!

     Machine strides over the Longdale's corpse, puts his foot on
     Longdale's chest, yanks out the knife...
     Machine starts this way...

     Eddie backs from Welles.  Welles looks up, trying to shake
     off unconsciousness, sees Machine coming...

     Welles bows down, on his knees, as if to accept his fate...
     Reaching his free hand into his suit pocket...

                             WELLES
                 No, no, no... please, don't kill
                 me... please... !

     Machine arrives, knife in hand, lifts Welles' head back by
     the hair, brings the knife hand back...

                             EDDIE
                 Do him good.

     Welles rises suddenly, arm shooting forward, STABBING
     SCISSORS deep in Machine stomach...

     Machine ROARS, falling back, pitching forward...

     Machine's knife clatters to the ground.

     Eddie's eyes go wide. 

     Machine hits the floor, clutching his guts.

     Welles pushes upwards with all he's got left, turns the iron
     bedframe onto its side, flipping the mattress off...

     Eddie moves forward, furious...

     Welles grabs Machine's knife, wielding it, holding Eddie off.

                             WELLES
                 Back off, Eddie...

     Welles drags the now lightened bed frame towards the table.
     Eddie's sorely tempted, but keeps away.

     Eddie turns, looks across the warehouse...

     There's his gun, lying there, far away.

     Eddie runs for the gun.

     Welles pulls himself to the table, reaches for the gun,
     knocks the table over.  He's got the gun, but...

     Bullets hit the floor as the table falls.

     Welles struggles to open his gun with his sole free hand,
     gets it open, holds it between his knees...

     Welles grabs a bullet...

     Eddie's running toward his gun, gasping for air...

     Machine's on his knees, pulling the scissors out with
     trembling hands...

     Welles puts the bullet in the gun, flips it shut, rises,
     taking aim across the warehouse...

                             WELLES
                 Stop Eddie!

     Eddie's running...

                             WELLES
                       (pulls back the hammer)
                 I swear to Christ I'll shoot you in
                 the back... !

     Eddie stops, hands up, about ten feet from his gun...

     Machine stays on his knees, holding his bleeding stomach.
     Welles points his gun at Machine.

                             WELLES
                 Come back, or I put a hole in him.

     Eddie's looking at his gun, so close, so far away.

                             WELLES
                 You might make it to your gun, but
                 not before I shoot Machine.  And if
                 I have to shoot him because of you,
                 and I don't kill him, right after he
                 kills me, he's gonna kill you.

     Eddie turns, starts walking back...

                             WELLES
                       (to Machine)
                 Take off the mask.

     Machine shakes his head.

                             WELLES
                 Take it off!

                             MACHINE
                 You got one bullet.

     Welles looks to see Eddie heading back, keeps the gun on
     Machine, backs away, dragging the bed frame, looks to the
     DOOR behind him...

                             MACHINE
                 The only choice you have now, is
                 which one of us kills you.

     Welles backs away, drags the bedframe.  Eddie's getting
     close.  Welles points the gun at Eddie.  Eddie slows.

     Welles points the gun at Machine, points the gun at Eddie.

     Welles puts the gun to the chain of his handcuffs, FIRES...
     breaks the handcuff chain.

     Welles bolts to the door...

                             MACHINE
                 Get the gun!

     Eddie runs back towards his gun.
     Machine rises with a grunt of pain, moves towards the door,
     but agony doubles him back over to his knees.

     EXT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles shoves out into daylight, fleeing down the stairs,
     running towards his car...

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Welles climbs in, gets out his keys, starts the car...
     He pulls away, TIRES SCREECHING.  Behind, Eddie gives chase,
     running, FIRING his gun...

     Welles ducks as BULLETS SLAM the car, SHATTERING WINDOWS.

     EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Welles' car picks up speed, takes a turn, BURNING RUBBER...
     Behind, Eddie curses, runs back to the warehouse.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Welles glances back, ENGINE ROARING.  He tries to keep from
     crying, steers with one hand, holds his bleeding face.

     EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Welles' car races away.


     INT.  WELLES' HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Amy looks tired, like she hasn't slept.  She feeds Cindy.
     PHONE RINGS.  Amy goes to answer it...

                             AMY
                       (into phone)
                 Hello?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Amy, it's me.  Listen very
                 carefully..

                             AMY
                       (into phone)
                 Tom?  Where have you been... ?

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Welles drives, face caked in dried blood, cellular phone to
     his ear.  The HIGHWAY rushes past out the car window.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and
                 get out of the house.  Do it now.
                 Go to a hotel and stay there...

                             AMY (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 What's wrong?  Are you alright?

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't
                 explain.  Don't use the phone, just
                 pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my
                 way.  I'll be back at the house in
                 three hours.  Call me from the hotel
                 when you get there

                             AMY (V.O.)
                 ... What's going on?

                             WELLES
                 Just do it, Amy, please, go.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Amy hangs up, scared.  She goes to grab Cindy up into her
     arms, hurrying out of the kitchen and going upstairs.

     EXT.  HIGHWAY -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Welles' car tears down the freeway, passing other cars.


     EXT.  WELLES' NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT

     Suburban streets.  Welles' car arrives, parks.  Welles gets
     out, starts across a neighbor's yard, cuts between houses...

     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BACKYARD -- NIGHT

     Welles enters his backyard, slowing, taking out his gun.  He
     keeps behind shrubbery, surveying his dark house.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles uses a key to unlock the SLIDING GLASS DOOR, opens it
     slow, enters, gun up, searching the darkness.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles pushes the door open, checks this room.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles makes sure the bedroom's empty, looks in the
     bathroom.  He puts his gun away, leaves the lights off.

     He goes to the PHONE on the bedside table, unscrews the
     earpiece.  He removes a small, wire-mesh BUGGING DEVICE.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Dark.  Welles picks up the cordless phone, struggles to pry
     the receiver open.  He discovers another small BUG.

     He drops the BUGS to the floor, crushes them under foot.

     He puts the phone back together and is replacing it when it
     RINGS LOUDLY.  Welles is startled, drops the phone...

     Welles takes a breath, trying to shake off the jitters.  He
     picks up the RINGING PHONE, answers it...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Honey... ?

                             MACHINE (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Not quite.

     Welles stiffens.

                             MACHINE (V.O.)
                 Nothing like getting home after a
                 rough day.  Home sweet home.

     Welles moves into the HALL, towards the front door...

                             MACHINE (V.O.)
                 Walk away.  Pack your bags, put the
                 wife and kid in the car and find a
                 place to hide.  If you're lucky,
                 you'll never see me again.

     Welles takes out his gun, opens the front door, looking out.
     The street in front of the house is empty.  CRICKETS CHIRP.

                             WELLES
                 I don't know if I can do that.

                             MACHINE (V.O.)
                 I know who you are.  I know where
                 you live.  I know everything I need
                 to know to find you.
                       (pause)
                 Who am I?

     MACHINE is HEARD HANGING UP the phone.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Cindy's crying.  Amy opens the door with the chain on, sees
     Welles, lets him in.  Amy and Welles embrace, kissing.  Amy
     touches Welles damaged face, worried...

                             AMY
                 What happened to you?

                             WELLES 
                 I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you
                 alright?

                             AMY
                 What's going on, Tom?  What happened?

                             WELLES
                 I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I
                 can't.  You have to trust me...

                             AMY
                 Tom...

                             WELLES 
                 It has to be this way for now.  It
                 won't be long.

     Welles goes to pick up Cindy, tries to comfort her, kisses
     her red face as she keeps crying.

                             AMY
                 Why haven't you called?  Why don't
                 you answer your phone?

                             WELLES
                 I don't know.  I'm sorry...

                             AMY
                 You're sorry?  What was I supposed
                 to think?

     Amy comes to take Cindy from him.

                             AMY
                 You owe me an explanation.  You
                 can't treat me like this.

                             WELLES
                 I wanted to call.  I couldn't.

                             AMY
                 You couldn't?

                             WELLES
                 You don't understand...

                             AMY
                 No, I don't, because you're not
                 telling me anything!

                             WELLES
                 I was in hell.  If I called you...
                 if I heard your voice... it would
                 have been so easy for me to quit.
                 I couldn't do that.

     Tears comes to Amy's eyes.

                             AMY
                 You should have.

                             WELLES
                 Amy, I'm not going to let anything
                 happen to us.

                             AMY
                 Look where we are.  Look at
                 yourself.  You son of a bitch,
                 you don't have any idea what
                 you're putting me through...

                             WELLES
                 I don't know what to say

                             AMY
                 You're killing me...

                             WELLES
                 Don't...

                             AMY
                 What was I supposed to think
                 happened to you?!

                             WELLES
                 Amy...

     Welles goes to Amy, but she pulls away.  She sits on the
     bed.  Cindy's still crying.  Welles sits beside Amy, puts
     her arms around her.

                             WELLES
                 Forgive me.

     Amy cradles Cindy.  Welles rests his head on Amy's shoulder,
     places one hand on Cindy.

                             WELLES
                 We have to stay here a few days.
                 I'll get more clothing from the
                 house if I can.  I'm sorry.
                       (pause)
                 We're going to be okay.

     Welles rises.  He goes to the PHONE, starts dialing.  Amy
     looks at him, wipes tears.

                             AMY
                 Who are you calling?

                             WELLES
                 Mrs. Christian.

                             AMY
                 What?

                             WELLES
                 She's all I've got.  She's the only
                 witness.

                             AMY
                 Tom... she's dead.

     Welles looks to Amy.

                             AMY 
                 She died in her sleep three days
                 ago.  It was in the paper...

                             WELLES
                 I just talked to her.

     Cindy's crying.  Welles sits into a chair, trying to
     understand this, his mind racing.  He hangs up the phone.

                             AMY
                 How could you not know?

     Misery pulls down the corners of Welles' mouth.  He tries to
     find words, but none come.  He sits forward and hides his
     face in his hands, overwhelmed.  Cindy's crying.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Cindy sleeps, encircled by pillows and blankets on the bed.
     Amy watches her, runs her hand gently across Cindy's head.

     Amy rises, turns out the light, goes to a BALCONY DOOR...

     EXT.  HOTEL ROOM, BALCONY -- NIGHT

     Welles sits with his feet up on the balcony rail, looking
     into the parking lot.  Amy joins him, sits.

                             AMY
                 Promise you'll stay.

     Welles looks at Amy.

                             WELLES
                 Promise you won't go back there,
                 wherever you were.  Whatever it was,
                 forget it.

     Welles takes a deep breath, nods his head.

                             AMY
                 Promise me.

     Welles looks out into the night sky of stars.

                             WELLES
                 I promise.

     Amy comes to kiss Welles.  Welles wraps his arms around her
     and holds her tight.  She holds him.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Amy is asleep on the bed beside Cindy.  Welles comes out
     from the bathroom in a fresh shirt and suit, turns off the
     bathroom light.  He stands looking at Cindy and Amy.

     EXT.  HOTEL -- NIGHT

     Welles exits the hotel, heading to his Ford.


     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT

     Welles drives, staring ahead.  Through the windshield, the
     headlights illuminate the endless roadway.

     EXT.  KENNEDY AIRPORT -- NIGHT

     Airplanes take flight.  Manhattan glitters in the distance.


     EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

     Eddie Poole's building.  A typically bright, sunny LA day.
     In the street, Welles parks a rental car, gets out.

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- DAY

     ELEVATOR doors open and Welles gets off.  He moves down the
     hall, around a corner, heading to "Celebrity Films."

     Welles tries the door knob, finds it locked.  He looks
     around, takes two steps back, KICKS forward... SMASHES the
     translucent glass of the door...

     INT.  CELEBRITY FILMS OFFICE -- DAY

     Welles pushes broken glass out of the way, reaches in to
     open the door.  The office has been cleaned out, trash on
     the floor, desk drawers hanging open and empty, shelves
     empty, posters gone...

     Welles grabs one of the file cabinets, pulls it open, finds
     it empty, pulls it all the way out and throws it.

     INT.  8TH FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     People peer out from other offices, worried.  Welles exits
     Eddie's office, ignoring them, goes around the corner,
     straight to the STAIRWELL, heading downstairs...


     EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS -- DAY

     Welles rental car parks down the hill.  Welles climbs out,
     walking up the hill, heading for Eddie's ramshackle HOUSE.

     EXT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY

     Under the stilts of the porch, Welles passes Eddie's car,
     looks in to see it loaded with BOXES and belongings.

     Welles moves on to a door at the back of the garage.  He
     takes out LOCK-PICKING TOOLS.

     INT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE, STAIRWAY -- DAY

     Welles enters slow, pockets the tools, takes out his gun.
     FOLLOW him up the stairs, into a hallway, past a LAUNDRY
     ROOM with washer and dryer, into a LIVING ROOM...

     Welles sweeps the room with his gun, wired.  Eddie's house
     is predictably a trash heap, strewn with VIDEOS, MAGAZINES,
     dirty DISHES and fast food remnants.  Welles moves on...

     INT.  EDDIE'S BEDROOM -- DAY

     Eddie's throwing clothing into a suitcase, hurried.  Welles
     comes into the doorway, taking aim, edging forward.

                             WELLES
                 Hello, Eddie.

     Eddie spins, startled.

                             WELLES
                 Put your hands on your head.

     Eddie looks out of the corner of his eye... to his GUN.

                             WELLES
                 Put your hands behind your head,
                 lock your finger together, get down
                 on your knees.

     Eddie does as commanded, gets to his knees.  Welles moves
     towards him, very nervous, white-knuckling the gun.
     He KICKS Eddie in the stomach, doubles him over.

                             WELLES
                 I owe you a few.

     Welles KICKS again.


     INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY

     Welles enters the filthy kitchen, carrying Eddie's gun.  At
     the sink, Welles pops the gun's clip.  He pushes the bullets
     out into his palm, one by one.

     He dumps the bullets into the GARBAGE DISPOSAL, drops the
     clip in, turns it on.  The DISPOSAL makes a terrible
     GRINDING NOISE, straining, till it finally goes dead.

     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles goes to the picture window and closes the curtains.
     He turns on a lamp, goes back towards the bedroom.  After a
     moment, he returns, dragging Eddie on the floor...

     Eddie's bleeding out his nose, hands DUCT-TAPED together
     behind his back, legs bound at the ankle, dragged by a belt
     around his neck, choking...

     Welles drops the belt, undoes it from Eddie's neck.  Eddie
     gasps for air.  Welles pulls him up, puts him on the couch.

                             WELLES
                 Don't go anywhere.

     Welles heads for the stairs...

     EXT.  EDDIE'S GARAGE -- DAY

     Welles goes to Eddie car, tries the door, it's unlocked...

     IN THE CAR

     Welles takes the thick THOMAS GUIDE map book off the dash.

     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles returns.  Eddie's on the floor, wriggling.  Welles
     drops the Thomas Guide on the coffee table, picks Eddie up,
     throws him back onto the couch.

                             EDDIE
                 I'm gonna kill you.

                             WELLES
                 Don't bore me with that bullshit.

                             EDDIE
                 How'd you find me here?

     Welles PUNCHES Eddie in the ear.

                             WELLES
                 Don't ask questions.

                             EDDIE
                 Fuck you! 

     Welles PUNCHES Eddie in the same ear.  Eddie's hurting.
     Welles rubs his aching knuckles.

                             WELLES
                 Starting to recognize a pattern?

                             EDDIE
                 What do you want?

                             WELLES
                 Who is Machine?

                             EDDIE
                 I don't know...

                             WELLES
                 I want his name.

                             EDDIE
                 I told you, I don't know.

                             WELLES 
                 I will never get tired of hurting
                 you, Eddie, so you might want to
                 change your attitude.

                             EDDIE
                 What the fuck am I gonna protect
                 that freak for?  He was Dino's boy,
                 not mine.  He shows up with his mask
                 on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody
                 knows.

     Welles kicks junk off a chair, sits, takes out his gun.

                             WELLES
                 Okay, we'll come back to that.  So,
                 six years ago a guy contacts you,
                 through the classifieds, over the
                 phone, however he does it.  It's
                 Longdale, looking for a snuff film.
                 And you, entrepreneur that you are,
                 tell him you can hook him up.

                             EDDIE
                 Yeah, the fucking lawyer.

                             WELLES
                 Told him you could get him a snuff
                 film.

                             EDDIE
                 Yeah.

                             WELLES
                 How much did he pay you?

                             EDDIE
                 Thirty thousand each, that fucking
                 cocksucker.

                             WELLES
                 That's all?  Thirty each.  That's
                 all it took for you to murder her?

                             EDDIE
                 It was a lot of fucking money.

     Welles stands and paces, despairing.  He picks up a LAMP and
     throws it, SHATTERS a MIRROR, keeps pacing...

                             WELLES
                 So... you brought Dino in, and he
                 brought Machine.  And, one day, a
                 girl walked into your office because
                 you had an ad in the paper for
                 models.  And she never walked out.

                             EDDIE
                 Something like that.

                             WELLES
                 What did you do, knock her out,
                 shoot her up... ?

                             EDDIE
                 What the fuck do you want from me?

                             WELLES
                 I want to know.  I want to know
                 exactly what you did to her!

                             EDDIE
                 Fuck you then, you want to know?  I
                 talked her up, told her how
                 beautiful she was, told her she was
                 gonna be a star.  I told her I was
                 gonna get her a screen test, and
                 while I'm doing that, I got her a
                 soda and dropped a mickey.  When it
                 was dark enough, I rang Dino and
                 told him it was go time, I put her
                 in the trunk of my car and we went
                 and we fucking did it.  That's what
                 happened.  She's dead.  She's been
                 dead a long fucking time.  Nobody
                 fucking cares!

     Welles puts down his gun, picks up the Thomas Guide, holding
     it in both hands, SWINGS -- SLAMS Eddie across the face...

     Eddie's stunned, lips bleeding.  He faces forward.

                             EDDIE
                 You wanted to know, now you know.

     Welles SWINGS the Thomas Guide -- POUNDS Eddie's face again.

     Welles drops the Thomas Guide in a chair, picks up his gun,
     leaves the room...

     INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY

     Welles enters, starts looking through DRAWERS, searching.
     He finds SILVERWARE, selects a serrated STEAK KNIFE...

     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles returns, goes to grasp Eddie by the shirt collar,
     drags him to the floor, face down.  Welles stands on Eddie's
     neck, uses the knife to cut the duct tape on Eddie's hands.

                             EDDIE
                 That's right, motherfucker, cut me
                 loose.  Be a man.

     Welles tosses the knife, gun trained on Eddie, picks up the
     Thomas Guide and throws it at Eddie... 

                             WELLES
                 Show me!

     Eddie, hands now free, pushes himself to a seated position,
     looks at the Thomas Guide.

                             WELLES
                 Show me where you did it, on the
                 map, exactly where you did it.

                             EDDIE
                 Why?

                             WELLES
                 Because we're going there.


     EXT.  134 FREEWAY -- DAY

     Welles' rental car SPEEDS down the highway, east towards
     Pasadena, leaving the City of Los Angeles on the horizon.

     EXT.  MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY -- DAY

     Welles' car travels a winding HIGHWAY that serpentines up
     into the scenic, forested SAN BERNADINO MOUNTAINS.

     EXT.  BIG BEAR -- DUSK

     The sun is low.  Big Bear Lake is vast, surrounded by
     wilderness on all sides.  Welles' car follows a TWO-LANE
     ROADWAY that runs along the lake's southern shore.

     Welles' car passes sporadic SUMMER HOMES and CABINS.

     EXT.  DESERTED ROADWAY -- NIGHT

     Heavy forests border close to the road.  Welles' car travels
     alone, headlights on, slowing as it comes to an overgrown
     gravel DRIVEWAY with a rusty CHAIN strung across it.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles leans forward to look up at an old SIGN of broken
     neon and peeled paint: "Big Bear Motor Lodge."

     Welles pulls forward, puts the car in reverse...

     ON THE ROADWAY

     Welles' car backs up, angling, till the rear bumper comes
     against the chain, BACKING... till the CHAIN SNAPS.

     Welles' car pulls forward across the empty roadway, turns
     around... accelerates down the overgrown driveway...

     EXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT

     Welles' car comes down the driveway, into a small LOT.

     IN THE CAR

     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: headlights reveal what's left of the
     abandoned MOTOR LODGE, a REGISTRATION OFFICE at the center
     with attached wings of rooms on both sides.

     The LEFT WING of rooms is a fire ravaged, burnt-out
     skeleton.  What remains of the OFFICE and RIGHT WING is
     boarded over, falling apart.  No window has gone unbroken.

     IN THE LOT

     Welles turns out headlights and parks.
     He gets out, walks to look up the driveway.  A CAR is HEARD.
     HEADLIGHTS can be seen a good distance away through the
     forest as the CAR PASSES.

     Welles goes to his car, unlocks the trunk and opens it.
     Eddie's lying in there, arms and legs bound, gagged.

     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT

     The door is shoved inward, hanging crooked by one hinge.
     Eddie enters first, hands still bound behind him.  Welles
     pushes Eddie forward, gun out.

     Welles turns on his penlight FLASHLIGHT, shining it into the
     room.  There dead leaves all over the floor.  The room's
     empty except for a CHAIR lying on its side.

     Welles sweeps the room with the inadequate light.  This is
     where Mary Anne Mathews died, vaguely recognizable from the
     snuff film, without the furniture.

                             EDDIE
                 What are we doing here?

     Welles goes to the bathroom door, keeping the gun trained on
     Eddie, pushes the bathroom door open with his foot...

     The bathroom's cracked MIRROR reflects the penlight and
     Welles' palely lit face.

                             WELLES 
                 That night... you didn't have to be
                 in the room, but you were.
                       (looks to Eddie)
                 Why?  Why did you watch?

     Eddie goes to the chair, tips it upright with his foot, sits.

                             EDDIE
                 I don't know.  I felt like it.  I
                 never saw anyone get done before.

                             WELLES
                 You enjoy it? 

                             EDDIE
                 Made me sick, but what did I care?
                 What did I care if some hump wants
                 to beat off to that.  It was just
                 something I was doing for money.

                             WELLES
                 Tell me what happened.

                             EDDIE
                 What do you want to know?  You saw
                 it, you saw the loop...

                             WELLES
                 Nobody saw you bring her in?

                             EDDIE
                 There wasn't nobody around.  This
                 place was a shit-hole.  I backed up
                 the car to the door and we carried
                 her in, like groceries.  Dino made
                 her eat a bunch of pills, we laid
                 out the plastic, put film in the
                 camera and Machine went to work.

                             WELLES
                 What did you do with her body?

                             EDDIE
                 Took it out the bathroom window.
                 Buried it in the woods.

                             WELLES
                 Show me.

     EXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT

     Eddie and Welles come around the corner of the abandoned
     motel, Eddie leading the way, Welles following with gun and
     flashlight, into the dense forest...

                             EDDIE
                 What are you thinking you're gonna
                 do... ?

     Welles shoves Eddie ahead.

                             WELLES
                 Keep moving.

                             EDDIE
                 Where do you think you're taking
                 this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero,
                 avenge that little girl's death?
                 Gonna make everything right with the
                 world?  How you gonna do that... ? 

     FURTHER ON

     Welles and Eddie come over a hill, deeper into the forest...

                             EDDIE
                 You can't go to the cops.  All you
                 can do is cut me loose and walk
                 away, because you got nothing...

                             WELLES
                 Stop talking.

                             EDDIE
                 You got absolute zero.

                             WELLES
                 Show me where you buried her.

                             EDDIE
                 I don't know...
                       (nods to forest)
                 ... out there somewhere.

                             WELLES
                 Where?  Show me where.

                             EDDIE
                 I fucking don't know.  What do you
                 think... we weren't burying
                 treasure.  We didn't pace it out so
                 we could come back and get it.  We
                 dug a hole and we put her in it.
                 Your guess is as good as mine.

     Welles walks ahead of Eddie, distraught, shining his
     flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor.

                             EDDIE
                 You'll never find her.  Nobody ever
                 will, and even if they did, it
                 doesn't mean nothing.  Bring in the
                 cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em
                 all.  Without the film, it never
                 happened.  Don't you get it?  It's
                 over.  You can't do anything.

     Welles turns, aims his gun at Eddie, furious.

                             WELLES
                 I can kill you.  I can leave you out
                 here, just like you left her.

     Eddie's not backing down.

                             EDDIE
                 Do it.

                             WELLES
                 Don't think I won't.

                             EDDIE
                 Do it!  Put me out of my misery so
                 I don't have to listen to you
                 whining anymore.  You think it's so
                 easy?

                             WELLES
                 Easy enough for you.

                             EDDIE
                 I never killed anyone.

                             WELLES
                 That's right, you just stood there
                 and watched, because you "felt like
                 it."  Almost makes you worse.

                             EDDIE
                 What do you want?  You want me to
                 fall to my knees and start crying
                 like a baby... ?

     Eddie walks towards Welles.  Welles backs away...

                             EDDIE
                 Where you going?  You're the one
                 with the gun.  Aren't I defenseless
                 enough?  Come on...

     Eddie comes ahead, defiant, the gun inches from his face.

                             EDDIE
                 Go ahead and kill me.  Kill me with
                 that gun, your gun, right,
                 registered in your name?  Dig the
                 hole yourself, with your bare hands,
                 bury the body with your bullets in
                 it.  Fucking do it!

     Welles step forward, presses the gun against Eddie's
     forehead, pulls back the hammer... 

     Eddie just stares back at Welles with hatred in his eyes.

     Welles is terrified, unsure... trying to muster the courage
     to do it... gun hand trembling... finger on the trigger...


     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT

     Eddie's thrown face down to the floor.  Welles comes to sit
     on Eddie's back, facing Eddie's feet, holsters his gun,
     takes out duct tape and grabs Eddie's feet, wrapping them...

                             EDDIE
                 You pussy.

     Welles keeps going around Eddie's ankles with the duct tape,
     till Eddie's securely bound.

     He rips the tape roll free and gets up, walking out...

                             EDDIE
                 Fucking pussy!

     EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT

     Welles pulls the door closed behind him, walks to his car.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles opens the passenger door and sits, shaken, at his
     wit's end.  He opens the glove compartment, finds
     cigarettes, digs one out and lights it.

     He looks back to the motel room.

     He looks down to the glove compartment, at his CELLULAR
     PHONE.  After a moment, Welles picks up the phone, looks at
     it in his hand.

     IN THE LOT

     Welles gets out of the car, gets up on the hood, lays back,
     staring at the sky.  He closes his eyes, smokes.

     Welles opens the phone, looks at the illuminated numbers.
     He digs in his suit jacket pocket, takes out his notepad,
     pages through, studies one page.

     Welles sits up.  He gathers himself, throws his cigarette,
     dials a number, puts the cellular to his ear, afraid...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Hello... ?

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you
                 remember, I was there a few weeks
                 ago... asking about your daughter...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 I remember.  You just left...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 I have to tell you something.  It
                 won't be easy for you to hear.  It's
                 about your daughter... Mary Anne...
                       (struggling)
                 When I... when I was there with you,
                 her diary, in your attic, in
                 silverware.  If you read it, you'll
                 know what I'm telling you is true... 

     Welles climbs off the car, paces, aching with misery...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 What are you talking about... ?

                             WELLES
                 She went to California, to Los
                 Angeles... she wanted to start over.
                 She wanted to be an actress...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 What... ?

     Tears comes to Welles' eyes.  It's the hardest thing he's
     ever had to do in his entire life.

                             WELLES
                 Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead.
                 She's dead.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Who is this... ?

                             WELLES
                 Someone... some men, they took your
                 daughter and they drugged her, and
                 they took her to a motel room...
                 they did terrible things to her...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 Who are you?

                             WELLES
                 They brought her into the room...
                 one man, he put a knife to her
                 throat and he raped her...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No...

                             WELLES
                 He raped her and...and...and he
                 murdered her...he cut her up with
                 knifes...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 No... no... no...

                             WELLES
                 They killed her, and they took her
                 out in the forest somewhere and they
                 buried her...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 Why... why are you doing this to
                 me... ?

                             WELLES
                 They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm
                 sorry.  It happened a month after
                 she ran away.  She's been dead all
                 this time...

     MRS MATHEWS is HEARD SCREAMING, letting out a CHOCKING SOB.
     Welles falls back against the car, holds his head, weeping...

                             WELLES
                 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... there
                 wasn't anything anyone could do...

     Welles pushes disconnect, lowers the phone, drops it to the
     ground, utterly drained.  He puts his forearm over his eyes,
     gasping, sucking air...

     He looks to the motel room, tamping down his sorrow, willing
     it to fuel his rage...

     He takes out his gun, hands unsteady, determined, opens the
     gun and pours the bullets out.  He closes the gun and walks
     towards the motel room...

     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles SHOVES the door aside.  The door's hinge breaks and
     the door falls...

     Eddie sits propped up against one wall, turns to look...

     The door SLAMS to the floor.

     Welles moves forward, enraged, closing on Eddie, raising his
     arm with the gun grasped by the butt...

     Eddie's eyes go wide with fear...

     Welles SWINGS the gun down at Eddie's head...

     EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     The only SOUNDS come from the NIGHT FOREST.  CRICKETS and
     distant BIRDS.  We can't see anything but the TOTAL DARKNESS
     through the open door of the room.  A CAR is HEARD, getting
     LOUDER as it passes, FAINTER as it gets further away.

     Finally, Welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying
     himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered
     red.  His gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood.

     Welles looks back into the room, backing away.  He turns and
     goes to his car...

     IN THE CAR

     Welles climbs in the driver's side, shoves his bloody gun
     into his holster, tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his
     shirt, revolted.  He starts the car. 

     INT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles enters and crosses through...

     INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Welles goes to the kitchen sink, turns on the water, starts
     scrubbing his bloody hands, using dishwashing liquid,
     scrubbing his hands desperately under running water.

     EXT.  EDDIE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT

     Welles comes out of the house, goes to open the rear door of
     Eddie's car, looking through BOXES of Eddie's belongings...

     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles comes up the stairs with a BOX, dumps the contents
     onto the living room floor: it's CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, Eddie's
     collection from the office, HUNDREDS of PHOTOS...

     INT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Welles pulls open Eddie's cabinets, searching.  He finds
     POTS and PANS, choosing a few of the largest...

     EXT.  EDDIE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT

     Welles uses a cut piece of GARDEN HOSE, siphoning GAS out
     from Eddie's car, filling several kitchen POTS...

     INT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles comes up the stairs, carries POTS of gasoline, dumps
     the gasoline onto the pile of PHOTOGRAPHS...

     INT.  EDDIE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles dumps gasoline over Eddie's bed...

     INT.  LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles stands at the pile of gasoline soaked photos, taking
     out a MATCHBOOK, lighting one, lighting the whole book...

     EXT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Welles walks down the dark hill, heading to his car.  He
     gets in, starts the car and drives downhill, leaving the
     headlights off.  BEHIND, the windows of Eddie's ramshackle
     HOUSE grow bright as FIRE SPREADS and CURTAINS BURN.


     INT.  LOS ANGELES AIRPORT -- NIGHT

     Welles stares ahead, in fresh shirt and suit, waiting at a
     CHECK-IN COUNTER. 

     The female AIRLINE AGENT behind the counter types in her
     COMPUTER, stamps his ticket.

     Welles shifts his gaze, something catches his eye...

     Beside a stapler on the counter, a PAIR of SCISSORS.

                             AGENT
                 There you are, Mr. Welles, confirmed
                 through to Kennedy.  Gate 32B.

     Welles stares, fixated on the SCISSORS.

                             AGENT
                 Mr. Welles?

     Welles looks to the agent holding up the ticket.

                             AGENT
                 Gate 32B.

     Welles accepts the ticket.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN MOTEL -- NIGHT

     The Empire State Building in the distance says NYC, and a
     CAMERA PAN DOWN says another seedy MOTEL...

     INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles sits at a small desk, looking through a PHONE BOOK,
     white pages, finds... "HOSPITALS."

     Welles picks up the PHONE, chooses a number, dials it...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Hello, can you connect me with the
                 duty nurse?
                      (waits)
                 Hello, this is Lieutenant Anderson
                 down here in the Thirteenth
                 Precinct.  I've got a helluva
                 problem I was hoping you could give
                 me a hand with.  We had a stabbing
                 incident a couple of days ago, and
                 it looks like the supposed victim
                 gave us a false name and address.
                 Can you tell me if you had an adult
                 male with an abdominal wound in you
                 ER in the last forty-eight hours?
                       (listens)
                 You'd remember this guy; a body-
                 builder, real big guy, five foot
                 eleven, with acne all over his chest
                 and back...
                       (listens)
                 Alright, thanks for your help. 

     Welles hangs up, uses a pen to cross out a number in the
     phone book, starts dialing the next number.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Welles lies on the bed, on the phone, rubbing his eyes.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 ... guy sticks out like a sore
                 thumb.  Five foot ten or eleven,
                 body-builder, bad acne...
                       (listen)
                 Okay, thanks anyway.

     Welles gets up, hangs up, brings the phone back to the desk.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING

     The PHONE BOOK'S open on the desk with nearly a hundred
     hospital phone numbers crossed out.

                             WELLES (O.S.)
                 ... abdominal wound.  You'd know him
                 if you saw him... 

     Light cuts into the room from between the curtains.  Welles
     paces, carrying the phone with him, weary.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 He's a body-builder, stands just
                 under six feet...

     Welles stops in his track, listening, suddenly attentive.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 That's right... covered in acne.
                 That's him, that's the guy.  Listen,
                 we, uh... we think he filed a bogus
                 report on this stabbing, gave us a
                 false name and address...
                       (listens)
                 Yes, I'll hold.

     Welles goes to the desk, takes out his notepad.  He starts
     feeling his pockets for his pen, can't find it, telephone
     book, searching, looks under the desk...

     Welles ducks under the desk to grab the pen off the floor.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Yes... yes.
                       (sits, writing in pad)
                 Christopher Higgins.  Thirty-
                 fifteen, Thirty Fifth Street.
                 Where?  Astoria, Queens.

     Welles is scribbling all this down in his notepad.


     EXT.  QUEENS STREET -- DAY

     A relatively quiet residential street.  HOMES are small, two
     story affairs, close together, each very much like its
     neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls.

     Welles' Ford comes slowly down the street.  CHILDREN in
     school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups.

     Welles parallel parks.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles turns off the engine.
     He's watching a HOUSE on the other side of the street.  The
     house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top,
     quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a
     GARAGE underneath, plastic PINK FLAMINGOS on the small lawn.

     Cars pass in the street.  Welles watches school children
     pass on the near sidewalk.  He slumps down a little in his
     seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side
     mirror, rolling up the window.

     Welles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun,
     pours bullets out and pockets them.  He picks up a PAPER BAG
     off the passenger seat and opens it.

     He takes out a long, thin metal FILE, pulling off the shrink
     wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb.

     Keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, Welles
     slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along
     the gun's inner barrel.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- LATER DAY

     Welles sits smoking a cigarette, watching the quaint house.
     He looks in his side mirror...

     There's a large CAR coming down the block with its turn
     signal on.  Welles slumps a little lower.

     The car passes, slowing.  The GARAGE DOOR of the quaint
     house begins to open. 

     Welles watches...
     Can't really see the driver of the car except for the back
     of his head, but he's huge.  It's a good bet it's Machine.
     Beside him in the passenger seat is a GREY HAIRED OLD WOMAN.

     The car pulls into the darkness of the quaint house's
     garage.  After a moment, the OLD WOMAN comes from the
     garage, walks with a cane, wears glasses.  She goes to the
     sidewalk, checks her MAILBOX, finds it empty.

     Welles watches.

     The old woman goes back to the garage.  She goes inside.
     The garage door closes behind her.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT

     Welles still watches the house.  There's a light on in one
     of the second floor windows, curtains closed.

     Welles yawns, shaking his head, trying to stay awake.

     At the quaint house, a light comes on in the front picture
     window.  Looks like a living room or dining room.  The old
     woman comes to sit at a table.

     Welles takes binoculars off the front seat...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS

     The old woman says something to someone we cannot see.
     She's at the dinner table, with a place setting in front of
     her.  After a moment, someone joins her...

     It's Machine, you can tell by his bulk, by his huge
     forearms.  The lacy curtains of the window block part of our
     view, so we never see his face.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles lowers the binoculars, still watching.

     Through the window across the street, Machine can be seen
     putting a plate of food in front of the old woman.  The old
     woman smiles up at him, says something.

     Machine goes to light two candles on the table with matches,
     then goes back to stand beside the old woman.

     Machine is seen from behind, bends to give the old woman a
     kiss on the cheek, then leaves the room.  The old woman
     starts to eat.

     INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY

     Dawn light is just breaking.  Welles has fallen asleep,
     slumped low behind the wheel, snoring lightly.

     Welles awakens with a start, looking around, confused.  He
     calms, rubbing his eyes, wiping sweat from his features.

     ACROSS THE STREET

     The quaint house's garage door begins to rise.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles sees this, keeps low, watching...
     The big car backs out into the street.  The old woman's
     behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone.

     Welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror.

     ON THE STREET

     Welles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind
     him.  He starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all
     directions, making sure no one's around.

     Ahead, the garage door begins to close.

     Welles picks up the pace, trying not to look too
     conspicuous.  The garage door's halfway down...

     Welles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get
     there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes.

     ABOVE

     In ONE WINDOW of the quaint house, an eyeball is peering out
     from lacy curtains, then moves away and curtains fall shut.

     INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY

     Welles gets up, takes out his gun, brushing off.
     The garage is dark, full of BOXES and JUNK.  Welles moves
     towards the door to the house.

     INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY

     Machine, in T-shirt and jeans, seen only from behind, comes
     to a DRESSER and opens a bottom drawer.  His huge hands push
     clothing aside, digging deep to the bottom of the drawer,
     taking out the WRESTLING MASK.

     Machine stands straight, pulling the mask down over his head.

     INT.  BASEMENT -- DAY

     Welles enters from the garage, gun up.  The dank basement is
     small.  A PILE of LAUNDRY lies on the floor near a WASHING
     MACHINE. 

     SHEETS hang off several CLOTHES LINES strung across two
     metal poles.  Welles leads with his gun...

     He moves around the sheets, looking behind them.  There's a
     WOODEN STAIRCASE leading upstairs.  Welles starts up,
     treading lightly, trying not to make a sound...

     INT.  KITCHEN -- DAY

     Welles slowly opens the door to the kitchen, pointing his
     gun.  No one here.  The decor is feminine, neat and tidy.
     It's grandma's house, and it shows, with gaudy PRINT
     WALLPAPER everywhere, every shelf displaying HUMMEL
     FIGURINES or COLLECTORS PLATES.  Very Home Shopping Network.

     INT.  DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles slowly opens the swinging door, entering from the
     kitchen, sweeping the room with his gun.  No sign of
     Machine.  The whole house is dead quiet.

     He passes the dining room TABLE where he watched the old
     woman eat last night... passes fake PAINTINGS on the walls,
     of waterfalls and sunset mountain landscapes... moves into
     the living room area...

     Yellow shag CARPET.  A pink SOFA is covered in clear
     plastic, facing an old TELEVISION in faux-wooden cabinet.
     Welles heads for a staircase leading to the second floor.

     Welles creeps up the stairs...

     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     Welles comes up from the stairs, arrives at a closed DOOR.
     He opens the door.  It's a linen closet, with TOWELS and
     SHEETS on shelves, and a shelf of MEDICINE.

     Welles shuts the door and moves on.  There are TWO DOORS
     ahead, both closed.  Welles takes the one to the right...

     INT.  MACHINE'S BEDROOM -- DAY

     Welles pushes the door in, enters warily.  There's a
     constant SCRATCHING HEARD.  The room is like a child's,
     except the BED is huge.  Shelves are full of BOARDGAMES and
     COMIC BOOKS.  A DANZIG POSTER on the wall.  There's a RECORD
     PLAYER with LP RECORDS beside it.  A record turns on the
     turntable, the needle caught at the center, SCRATCHING...

     Welles eases his way over to the closet... reaching...
     Pulls it open, steps back, gun up.  Nothing.  Just clothing.

     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     Welles crosses, opens the door across the hall, enters...

     DOWN THE HALL, very slowly, Machine's head rises on the
     stairs, in the garish wrestling mask, peering.

     INT.  GRANDMA'S ROOM -- DAY

     Welles stays near the door, looks around.  There's a fuzzy
     sky-blue COMFORTER on the bed, fuzzy blue SLIPPERS nearby.
     Lots of bottles of MEDICINE on the bedside table.

     Welles lowers his gun, takes a step back, into the hall...

     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     Welles turns...
     Machine charges down the hall, screaming with rage, BOWIE
     KNIFE raised to kill...

     Welles brings his gun up, but Machine's upon him, stabbing...

     Welles catches Machine's hand, stops the knife.  Machine
     grips Welles' gun hand, shoving him back...

     Welles is SLAMMED against the wall, grappling, gun hand
     pinned.  Welles GUN GOES OFF, once... twice...

     BLOWING HOLES in the ceiling.  Machine's grunts, pushing the
     knife forward... closer to Welles, face... closer...

     Welles struggles, overpowered.  The tip of the horrible
     knife is inches away...

     Welles bends his knees, crouching, trying to gain distance
     from the blade...

     Machine pulls Welles gun hand lower, brings it against the
     swinging LAUNDRY CHUTE DOOR built into the wall, begins
     twisting Welles' hand back, trying to pry the gun loose...

     Welles looks out the corner of his eyes to his gun...

     Welles turns his gun hand, slowing struggling to aim the gun
     towards the knife, but it's awful close to his face...

     The knife's shaking, less than an inch from Welles' cheek...

     Welles shuts his eyes and turns his head, letting out a CRY,
     FIRES his gun...

     The bullet BLASTS Machine's knife, knocks it away!

     Machine recoils for a millisecond, but brings his now free
     hand to Welles' throat, choking him.  Welles' face reddens,
     bleeding from bullet fragments...

     Welles tries to pry Machine's fingers from his throat.

     Machine works on Welles' gun hand with violent, renewed
     effort -- SLAMS Welles' hand against the laundry chute...
     SLAMS it... SLAMS it... till Welles DROPS the GUN...
     The gun can be HEARD CLATTERING down the chute. 

     Machine brings his hand to join the other around Welles'
     throat.  Welles can't break the grip...

     Welles PUNCHES Machine's face, till blood runs out from the
     mask's nose hole, but it's having no effect...

     Welles brings his KNEE UP HARD -- into Machine's stomach!

     Machine falls to his knees with a ROAR, holds his already
     wounded stomach, bleeding through his shirt...

     Welles falls, clutching his throat, gasping.  He struggles
     to his feet, leaps past, headlong towards the stairs...

     Machine rises, charging after...

     ON THE STAIRCASE

     Welles is TACKLED from behind...
     Welles and Machine TUMBLE down the stairs, SMASHING the
     wooden railing, toppling a BOOKSHELF... LANDING HARD...

     Welles PUNCHES and KICKS, breaking free, running across the
     living room.  Machine rises to give chase...

     Welles grabs a dining room CHAIR and THROWS it...
     Machine knocks the chair aside, keeps coming.  Welles grips
     another chair, uses it to hold Machine off...

     Machine grips the chair by the legs.  Welles SHOVES forward,
     pushes Machine back, letting go...

     Welles dives under the dining table, crawling on his hands
     and knees, scrambling...

     Machine throws the chair, runs, leaps...
     Machine lands on the table, crawls to the far edge, GRABBING
     down with his meaty fists as Welles moves forward...

     Under the table, Welles jerks back, avoiding, then rises,
     extending his knees, PUSHING upwards from underneath...

     Welles FLIPS the table, throwing Machine to the floor...

     Welles charges towards the kitchen door, falls, gets up...
     Machine gets to his feet...

     IN THE KITCHEN

     Welles SHOVES through the swinging door...
     Machine BURSTS through, catching Welles, TACKLING him...

     Welles hits the floor with Machine on top.  Machine begins
     to rein PUNCHES down on Welles, head and back...

     Welles tries to cover up, taking a real beating...

     Machine rises, gripping Welles, LIFTING him, THROWS him...

     Welles SMASHES into shelves of knick-knacks over the kitchen
     sink, SHATTERING a WINDOW, landing on the sink and counter.

     Machine comes to grip Welles again, drags him across the
     counter, KNOCKING EVERYTHING to the floor...
     Machine SWINGS Welles, releases him...

     Welles SLAMS the refrigerator and slumps to the ground,
     tries to stay conscious, trying weakly to get back up...
     Machine comes to Welles, gets on his knees...

     Machine wraps his arm around Welles' neck from behind, gets
     him in a CHOKE HOLD, tightens his grip, cutting off Welles
     airway with his forearm...

     Welles tries to break Machine's impossible grip with one
     hand, begins searching the floor with his other hand...
     frantically feeling for anything he can use...

     Welles' face is blood red...

     Welles' hand grasps desperately... finds a FORK, grips it...

     Welles SWINGS the fork back, STABS it into Machine's thigh!

     Machine SCREAMS, releases Welles and falls back, reaching
     around to the fork...

     Welles gets to his knees, sucking air, turns to look...

     Machine crawls away, pulls the fork out with trembling
     fingers.  Beyond him, there's the BASEMENT DOOR.

     Welles gets to his feet, looking...
     He grabs a FRYING PAN off the counter, gripping it in both
     hands and moving towards Machine...

     Machine's getting up...
     Welles BASHES Machine in the face with an upward swing of
     the frying pan...

     Machine is sent backpedaling, CRASHING into the oven!

     Welles drops the pan, leaps over Machine, to the door...

     IN THE BASEMENT

     Welles comes down the stairs, falls when he gets to the
     bottom, barely has any strength left.  He looks all
     directions, sees the LAUNDRY CHUTE in the ceiling...

     Welles gets up, stumbling, falls to his knees at the PILE of
     dirty LAUNDRY, starts digging through it, searching
     desperately, throwing clothing aside...

     Behind, Machine comes down the stairs, a bloody mess...

     Welles searches the laundry pile... 

     Machine reaches the bottom of the stairs, heading for
     Welles.  Welles turns, has the GUN in hand, FIRES TWICE...
     HITTING Machine in the shoulder and stomach, knocking
     Machine a few steps backwards...

     Welles FIRES...

     Machine's HIT in the CHEST, falling back, into hanging
     laundry, pulling down the clothes line and sheets...

     Machine hits the ground, wrapped in sheets.

     Welles stands, still aiming the gun, pulls the trigger on an
     empty chamber.  Out of bullets.

     Machine's trying to pull free from the sheets, trying to get
     back up to his feet.  Welles lets out a sob, drops the gun,
     walking to Machine...

     Welles climbs onto Machine from behind, takes clothing line
     in hand, starts wrapping the cord around Machine's throat...

     Welles pulls back on the clothes line, pulling it tight...

     Machine tries to get his fingers around the cord.  Welles
     stands, pulling tighter, putting a foot on Machine's back,
     pulling the clothes line with all his might...

     The cord's cutting into Welles' hand, drawing blood.

     Machine, face down, lets out a gurgling sound, struggling,
     struggling... till he finally stops moving.

     Welles releases the cord, takes a step back, breathing hard,
     trembling.  He looks around the basement.

     Welles walks to pick up his gun, replaces the gun in his
     holster.  He stands looking at Machine.

     Welles walks to Machine, bends, grasps Machine wrestling
     mask, pulling it off.  He rolls Machine over...

     Welles stares down at Machine.  We never see Machine's face.

     INT.  KITCHEN -- DAY

     Welles comes up from the basement, slow, hurting.  He looks
     around at the damage done, looks down to see he's still
     holding Machine's mask.  He drops it.

     EXT.  QUAINT HOUSE -- DAY

     Welles crosses the street, going to his car.  He gets into
     his car, starts it, pulls out and drives away.


     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- DAY

     BIRDS SING.  KIDS are kicking around a soccer ball down the
     street.  Welles' Ford arrives, pulls into the driveway.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY -- DAY

     Welles comes in the front door, still a horrible mess.

                             WELLES
                 Hello?!  Amy?

     He waits.  The house is quiet.  No one home.


     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- LATER DAY

     Dusk.  A CAR comes down the street, slows...

     IN THE CAR

     Amy sits forward, seeing Welles' car in the driveway.
     Cindy's in a child safety seat in back.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY -- DAY

     Amy comes in the front door, carrying Amy.

                             AMY
                 Tom?!

     No answer.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY

     Any pushes the bedroom door open and looks in.  Welles is
     asleep on the bed, still in his clothing and shoes.  Amy
     watches him sleep, sad.

     Amy backs out of the room, pulls the door shut.


     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Dark.  Welles sleeps, still in bloody clothing.  He's
     restless, shifting, MUTTERING under his breath.  Bad dreams.

     Welles suddenly sits bolt upright in the bed, looking around
     the dark room, breathing hard.

     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Cindy's in her high-chair by the table.  Amy's at the
     KITCHEN SINK, washing vegetables, peeling potatoes.

     Welles comes to stand in the doorway behind her.  Amy turns
     to look at him.  It breaks her heart to see him so wounded,
     but she forces herself to continue working in the sink.

                             AMY
                 How much forgiveness do you think I
                 have in me?

     Welles comes into the kitchen, stands beside Cindy, puts his
     hand out and clasp's Cindy's tiny hand.

                             WELLES
                 I can't talk about it yet... not
                 yet.

     Amy keeps peeling potatoes, refuses to look at him.  Welles
     looks down at Cindy, pats Cindy's head, looks back at Amy.
     He stands looking at Amy for a long moment.


     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BACKYARD -- DAY

     Welles wears his fishing cap, pushing his lawn mower, mowing
     his yard.  He has done some healing, though his face is
     still swollen and terribly bruised.

     INT.  KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Welles feeds Cindy with one hand, eating his own dinner with
     the other.  Amy's across the table, eating, watching them.

     INT.  BASEMENT -- DAY

     Welles works on the WATER HEATER, wrench in hand, reading an
     instruction sheet.  He puts the sheet aside, uses the wrench
     to begin loosening one of the pipe fittings.

     EXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Welles drags two GARBAGE CANS from the garage to the street,
     leaving them by the mailbox, walking back to the house.

     INT.  BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles and Amy are in bed.  Amy's asleep, on her side,
     facing away from Welles.  Welles lays awake, on his back,
     staring up at the ceiling.

     INT.  SUPERMARKET AISLE -- DAY

     Welles pushes a cart down one aisle.  He looks at his LIST,
     takes a BOX of CEREAL off one shelf, puts it in the cart.

     INT.  SUPERMARKET CHECK-OUT -- DAY

     Welles waits in line with his cart.  It's a long line.
     He takes out his wallet, opens it.

     In the fold of the wallet, there's a PHOTO folded into
     quarters.  Welles unfolds it and looks at it dolefully.
     It's the PHOTO of Mary Anne Mathews, the image Welles
     printed from early in the snuff film.  Sad girl. 

     Welles folds in back up, puts it in another pocket.  He
     looks forward in the line to see if it's moving.

     EXT.  SUPERMARKET -- DAY

     Welles transfers BAGS of GROCERIES from the shopping cart
     into the back seat of his Ford.

     INT.  WELLES' FORD -- DAY

     Welles drives on the HIGHWAY, groceries in back.  He watches
     the roadway ahead.  There's little traffic.

     Welles glances down, turns on the RADIO.  Some CLASSICAL
     MUSIC PLAYS.  Welles stares forward through the windshield.

     After a moment, Welles turns the RADIO OFF.  He drives.  The
     ONLY SOUND is the DRONE of the ENGINE and TIRES.

     Welles is suddenly overwhelmed by emotion, eyes filling with
     tears.  He tries to fight it, but can't help himself.  His
     face contorts with sorrow and he cannot stop crying, letting
     out a loud WAIL of misery...

     EXT.  HIGHWAY -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles' car moves to the shoulder, brakes to a sudden HALT.

     INT.  WELLES' FORD -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles takes great deep breathes and lets them out, over and
     over again, wiping at his tears.  He lets out a little high-
     pitched WHINE from far back in his throat...

                             WELLES
                 Why... why... ?

     He's wracked by SOBBING.


     INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, CINDY'S ROOM -- DAY

     Amy's in a chair, reading a BOOK, not far from Cindy's crib.
     Cindy's asleep.  The FRONT DOOR of the house is HEARD
     OPENING and CLOSING from far off in the house.  Amy looks up
     momentarily, then returns to reading.

     FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming through the house, getting
     CLOSER.  Amy looks up from her book.  The bedroom door's
     open a crack.  The door slowly pushes open.  Welles stands
     there, eyes red from crying.

                             AMY
                 Tom... ?

     Welles comes into the room, stands before Amy.  He gets to
     his knees, puts his head in Amy's lap, wraps his arms around
     her waist.  Amy holds him, worried, eyes filling with tears.

                             WELLES
                 I have to tell you... I have to tell
                 you what happened.  I have to tell
                 you everything, but we can't tell
                 anyone else.  No one else can ever
                 know.

     Amy runs her fingers through his hair, bends down to rest
     her head on his back, holding him with her eyes closed.
     Welles holds tighter.

                             WELLES
                 You're all I've got.  You're all
                 I've ever had.
                       (pause)
                 You're the only one who can save me.

                                   Revised Third Draft

                                      July 15, 1991

                

               FADE IN:

               EXT. A SENTRY TOWER --

               -- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere.

               Small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower 
               cut through the ground mist. We HEAR all the unidentifiable 
               sounds of night in the woods. We also HEAR, very, very 
               faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence. And as this starts, 
               we begin to MOVE SLOWLY UP THE TOWER, more becomes visible 
               now:... the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high... the 
               steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure 
               and leading to the lookout post, and finally... THE LOOKOUT 
               POST, maybe forty feet off the ground.

               Standing the post is the silhouette of A MARINE. He's holding 
               a rifle and staring straight out.

               The drum cadence has been building slightly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A WIDER SHOT OF THE FENCELINE. And we see by the moonlight 
               that the tall wire-mesh fence winds its way far, far into 
               the distance.

               SUBTITLE: UNITED STATES NAVAL BASE GUANTANAMO BAY - CUBA.

               The drum cadence continues, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A MARINE BARRACKS

               We HEAR two pairs of footsteps and then

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARRACKS CORRIDOR

               where we see that the footsteps belong to DAWSON and DOWNEY, 
               two young marines who we'll get to know later. They stop 
               when they get to a certain door. The drum cadence is still 
               growing. DAWSON puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it 
               slowly.  He opens's the door and they walk into

               INT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - NIGHT

               WILLY SANTIAGO, a young, very slight marine, lies asleep in 
               his bunk.

               DAWSON kneels down by the bed, puts his hand on SANTIAGO'S 
               shoulder and shakes him gently. SANTIAGO opens his yes, looks 
               at DAWSON, and for a moment there's nothing wrong --

               -- and then SANTIAGO's eyes fill with terror. He lunges out 
               of the bed -- but forget about it. In one flash DAWSON and 
               DOWNEY grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come 
               out, DOWNEY's shoved a piece of cloth into SANTIAGO's mouth.

               Everything that happens next occurs with speed, precision 
               and professionalism.

               -- A strip of duct tape is pulled, ripped, and slapped onto 
               his mouth and eyes --

               -- A length of rope is wrapped around his hands and feet.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (quietly)
                         You're lucky it's us, Willy.

               -- An arm grabs him tightly around the neck, not choking 
               him, just holding his head still --

               -- The drum cadence has built to a crescendo. We HEAR four 
               sharp blasts from a whistle and we

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD - DAY

               and the drum cadence we've been hearing has turned into Semper 
               Fidelis and it's coming from THE U.S. MARINE CORPS BAND, a 
               sight to behold in their red and gold uniforms and polished 
               silver and brass.

               The BAND is performing on the huge and lush parade grounds 
               before a crowd made up mostly of TOURISTS and DAY-CAMPERS.

               As the TITLES ROLL, we watch the BAND do their thing from 
               various angles. Incredible precision is the name of the game. 
               Each polished black shoe hitting the ground as if they were 
               all attached by a rod. Each drumstick raised to the same 
               fraction of a centimeter before striking. A RIFLE DRILL TEAM

               EXT. A RED BRICK BUILDING - DAY

               It's an important building, a main building. A few SAILORS 
               enter and exit and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A WOMAN

               as she walks across the courtyard toward the brick building.  
               The WOMAN is JOANNE GALLOWAY, a navy lawyer in her early 
               30's. She's bright, attractive, impulsive, and has a tendency 
               to speak quickly. If she had any friends, they'd call her 
               JO. As she walks, she mutters to herself ...

                                     JO
                         I'm requesting... I'm... Captain, 
                         I'd like to request that I be the 
                         attorney assigned to rep -- I'd like 
                         to request that it be myself who is 
                         assigned to represent --
                              (she stops)
                         "That it be myself who is assigned 
                         to represent"? ...Good, Jo, that's 
                         confidence inspiring.

               We follow JO, still muttering, as she walks into the brick 
               building which bears the seal of the

               UNITED STATES NAVY - JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL'S CORPS

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WEST'S OFFICE - DAY

               As JO  enters. CAPTAIN WEST and two other officers, GIBBS 
               and LAWRENCE, sit around a conference table.

                                     GIBBS
                         Jo, come on in.

                                     JO
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     GIBBS
                         Captain West, this is Lt. Commander 
                         Galloway. Jo, you know Mike Lawrence.

                                     JO
                         Yes sir.
                              (to WEST)
                         Captain, I appreciate your seeing me 
                         on such short notice.

                                     WEST
                         I understand there was some trouble 
                         over the weekend down in Cuba.

                                     JO
                         Yes sir... This past Friday evening.  
                         Two marines, Corporal Harold Dawson 
                         and Private Louden Downey, entered 
                         the barracks room of a PFC William 
                         Santiago and assaulted him. Santiago 
                         died at the base hospital 
                         approximately an hour later. The NIS 
                         agent who took their statements 
                         maintains they were trying to prevent 
                         Santiago from naming them in a 
                         fenceline shooting incident. They're 
                         scheduled to have a hearing down in 
                         Cuba at 4:00 this afternoon.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         What's the problem?

                                     JO
                         Dawson and Downey are both recruiting 
                         poster marines and Santiago was known 
                         to be a screw-up. I was thinking 
                         that it sounded an awful lot like a 
                         code red.

               Jo lets this sink in a moment.

                                     WEST
                              (under his breath)
                         Christ.

                                     JO
                         I'd like them moved up to Washington 
                         and assigned counsel. Someone who 
                         can really look into this. Someone 
                         who possesses not only the legal 
                         skill, but a familiarity with the 
                         inner workings of the military. In 
                         short, Captain, I'd like to suggest 
                         that... I be the one who, that it be 
                         me who is assigned to represent them.
                              (beat)
                         Myself.

               Jo looks around the room for a response.

                                     WEST
                         Joanne, why don't you get yourself a 
                         cup of coffee.

                                     JO
                         Thank you, sir, I'm fine.

                                     WEST
                         Joanne, I'd like you to leave the 
                         room so we can talk about you behind 
                         your back.

                                     JO
                         Certainly, sir.

               JO gets up and walks out.

                                     WEST
                         I thought this Code Red shit wasn't 
                         going on anymore.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         With the marines at GITMO? Who the 
                         hell knows what goes on down there.

                                     WEST
                         Well lets find out before the rest 
                         of the world does, this thing could 
                         get messy. What about this woman?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Jo's been working a desk at internal 
                         affairs for what, almost a year now.

                                     WEST
                         And before that?

                                     GIBBS
                         She disposed of three cases in two 
                         years.

                                     WEST
                         Three cases in two years? Who was 
                         she handling, the Rosenbergs?

                                     GIBBS
                         She's not cut out for litigation.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         She's a hall of an investigator, 
                         Jerry --

                                     GIBBS
                         In Internal Affairs, sure. She can 
                         crawl up a lawyer's ass with the 
                         best of 'em, but when it comes to 
                         trial work --

                                     WEST
                         I know. All passion, no street smarts. 
                         Bring her back in.

               LAWRENCE goes to the door and motions for JO to come back 
               in.

                                     WEST
                              (continuing)
                         Commander, we're gonna move the 
                         defendants up here in the morning.

                                     JO
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     WEST
                         And I'll have Division assign them 
                         counsel...

                                     JO
                              (beat)
                         But... not me.

                                     WEST
                         From what I understand from your 
                         colleagues, you're much too valuable 
                         in your present assignment to be 
                         wasted on what I'm sure will boil 
                         down to a five minute plea bargain 
                         and a week's worth of paper work.

                                     JO
                         Sir --

                                     WEST
                         Don't worry about it. I promise you, 
                         division'll assign the right man for 
                         the job.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY

               THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB

               His name is LIEUTENANT JUNIOR GRADE DANIEL ALLISTAIR KAFFEE, 
               and it's almost impossible not to like him. At the moment 
               he's hitting fungoes to about a dozen LAWYERS who are spread 
               out on the softball field on a corner of the bass. The '27 
               Yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own 
               against a group of, say, Airforce dentists.

               KAFFEE's in his late 20's, 15 months out of Harvard Law 
               School, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous 
               spirit to drive it. He is, at this point in his life, 
               passionate about nothing... except maybe softball.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (calling out to the 
                              team)
                         Alright, let's get two!

               He smacks one to the SECOND BASE. The ball bounces right 
               between his legs.

                                     SECOND BASE
                         Sorry!

                                     KAFFEE
                         Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby.  
                         Just look the ball into your glove.

               He smacks one out to the same place. It bounces off the heel 
               of SHERBY's glove and into center field.

                                     SECOND BASE (SHERBY)
                         Sorry!

                                     KAFFEE
                         You gotta trust me, Sherby. You keep 
                         your eyes open, your chances of 
                         catching the ball increase by a factor 
                         of ten.

               SPRADLING, a young naval officer, sweaty and out of breath, 
               walks up behind the backstop.

                                     SPRADLING
                         Kaffee!

                                     KAFFEE
                         Let's try it again.

                                     SPRADLING
                         Kaffee!!

                                     KAFFEE
                              (turning)
                         Dave. You seem upset and distraught.

                                     SPRADLING
                         We were supposed to meet in your 
                         office 15 minutes ago to talk about 
                         the McDermott case. You're stalling 
                         on this thing. Now we got this done 
                         and I mean now, or no kidding, Kaffee, 
                         I'll hang your boy from a fuckin' 
                         yardarm.

                                     KAFFEE
                         A yardarm?
                              (calling out)
                         Sherby, does the Navy still hang 
                         people from yardarms?

                                     SHERBY
                              (calling back)
                         I don't think so, Danny.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (back to SPRADLING)
                         Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy 
                         hangs people from yardarms anymore.
                              (back to the field)
                         Let's go, let's get two!

               He goes back to hitting fungoes.

                                     SPRADLING
                         I'm gonna charge him with possession 
                         and being under the influence while 
                         on duty. Plead guilty and I'll 
                         recommend 30 days in the brig with 
                         loss of rank and pay.

                                     KAFFEE
                         It was oregano, Dave, it was ten 
                         dollars worth of oregano.

                                     SPRADLING
                         Yeah, well your client thought it 
                         was marijuana.

                                     KAFFEE
                         My client's a moron, that's not 
                         against the law.

               Swapp! The THIRD BASEMAN takes one in the face.

                              (continuing)
                         Ow. That had to hurt.
                              (calling out)
                         Way to keep your head in the play, 
                         Lester. Walk it off!

                         I've got people to answer to just 
                         like you, I'm gonna charge him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         With what, possession of a condiment?

                                     SPRADLING
                         Kaffee --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Dave, I've tried to help you out of 
                         this, but if you ask for tall time, 
                         I'm gonna file a motion to dismiss.

                                     SPRADLING
                         You won't got it.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I will get it. And if the MTD is 
                         denied, I'll file a motion in liminee 
                         seeking to obtain evidentiary ruling 
                         in advance, and after that I'm gonna 
                         file against pre-trial confinement, 
                         and you're gonna spend an entire 
                         summer going blind on paperwork 
                         because a Signalman Second Class 
                         bought and smoked a dime bag of 
                         oregano.

                         I don't know why I'm agreeing to 
                         this.

                                     KAFFEE
                         'Cause you have wisdom beyond your 
                         years. Dave, can you play third base?

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               About 16 NAVY AND MARINE LAWYERS (several of whom are women) 
               are taking their seats around a large conference table.

               A PARALEGAL is handing out folders and some photocopied papers 
               to the LAWYERS.

               We might notice that one of the lawyers is Lieutenant Junior 
               Grade SAM WEINBERG. Sam's serious and studious looking. If 
               he weren't in uniform, you wouldn't guess that he was a naval 
               officer.

               CAPTAIN WHITAKER walks in.

                                     WHITAKER
                         'Morning.

                              (school class)
                         'Morning Captain Whitaker.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Sam, how's the baby?

                                     SAM
                         I think she's ready to say her first 
                         word any day now.

                                     WHITAKER
                         How can you tell?

                                     SAM
                         She just looks like she has something 
                         to say.

               KAFFEE walks in.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Excuse me, sorry I'm late.

                                     WHITAKER
                         I'm sure you don't have a good excuse, 
                         so I won't force you to come up with 
                         a bad one.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thank you, Isaac, that's nice of 
                         you.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Sit-down, this first one's for you.

               He hands KAFFEE some files.

                                     WHITAKER
                              (continuing)
                         You're moving up in the world, Danny, 
                         you've been requested by Division.

               "Oooh"'s and "Ahhh"'S from the other LAWYERS. (Subtle Note: 
               Kaffee doesn't want to move up in the world.)

                                     KAFFEE
                         Requested to do what?

               WHITAKER hands him a file.

                         Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A marine 
                         corporal named Dawson illegally fires 
                         a round from his weapon over the 
                         fenceline and into Cuban territory.

                         What's a fenceline?

                         Sam?

                                     SAM
                         A big wall separating the good guys 
                         from the bad guys.

                         PFC William Santiago threatens to 
                         rat on Dawson to the Naval 
                         investigative Service. Dawson and 
                         another member of his squad, PFC 
                         Louden Downey, they go into Santiago's 
                         room, tie him up, and stuff a rag 
                         down his throat. An hour later, 
                         Santiago's dead. Attending physician 
                         says the rag was treated with some 
                         kind of toxin.

                                     KAFFEE
                         They poisoned the rag?

                                     WHITAKER
                         Not according to them.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What do they say?

                                     WHITAKER
                         Not much. They're being flown up 
                         here tomorrow and on Thursday at 
                         0600 you'll catch a transport down 
                         to Cuba for the day to find out what 
                         you can. Meantime, go across the 
                         yard and see Lt. Commander Joanne 
                         Galloway. She's the one who had 'em 
                         brought up here. She'll fill you in 
                         on whatever she has. Any questions?

                         The flight to Cuba, was that 0600 in 
                         the morning, sir?

                         It seems important to Division that 
                         this one be handled by the book, so 
                         I'm assigning co-counsel. Any 
                         volunteers?

                                     SAM

                         Doing what? Kaffee'll finish this up 
                         in four days.

               INT. JO'S OFFICE - DAY

               JO sits behind her desk. KAFFEE and SAM stand in the doorway. 
               KAFFEE knocks politely.

               JO looks up.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Hi.
                              (beat)
                         I'm Daniel Kaffee. I was told to 
                         meet with --
                              (checks notes)
                         -- Commander Galloway.

               JO is staring at him. KAFFEE doesn't know why.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         About a briefing.

               JO is finding this hard to believe.

                                     JO
                         You're the attorney that Division 
                         assigned?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm lead counsel. This is Sam 
                         Weinberg.

                                     SAM
                         I have no responsibilities here 
                         whatsoever.

               JO's deeply puzzled.

                                     JO
                              (beat)
                         Come in, please, have a seat...

               KAFFEE and SAM come into the office and sit.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         Lieutenant, how long have you been 
                         in the Navy?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Going on nine months now.

                                     JO
                         And how long have you been out of 
                         law school?

                                     KAFFEE
                         A little over a year.

                                     JO
                              (beat)
                         I see.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Have I done something wrong?

                                     JO
                         No. It's just that when I petitioned 
                         Division to have counsel assigned, I 
                         was hoping I'd be taken seriously.

               KAFFEE and SAM exchange a look.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to JO)
                         No offense taken, if you were 
                         wondering.

                                     SAM
                         Commander, Lt. Kaffee's generally 
                         considered the best litigator in our 
                         office. He's successfully plea 
                         bargained 44 cases in nine months.

                                     KAFFEE
                         One more, and I got a set of steak 
                         knives.

                                     JO
                         Have you ever been in a courtroom?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I once had my drivers license

                         Commander, from what I understand, 
                         if this thing goes to court, they 
                         won't need a lawyer, they'll need a 
                         priest.

                                     JO
                         No. They'll need a lawyer.

               During this, she'll hand KAFFEE a series of files, which 
               KAFFEE will pass To SAM without even glancing at them.

                         Dawson's family has been contacted.

                         Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's 
                         side, she hasn't been Contacted yet.

               None of this really means anything to KAFFEE.

               EXT. CUBAN FIELD - DAY

               SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

               And while we HEAR the letter read in V.O., what we're seeing 
               is this: SANTIAGO's life in Guantanimo Bay over the last 8 
               months. He had a rough time of it.

               THE SHOTS SHOULD INCLUDE:

               -- SANTIAGO running along at the rear of a group of MARINES.  
               It's been over seven miles and he's matted with sweat. A 
               SERGEANT runs up along side, grabs his back, and pushes him 
               to keep up with the group. SANTIAGO falls, struggles to get 
               back up and keep running, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MARINE BARRACKS - DAY

               -- SANTIAGO doing push-ups alone in the rain. He's being 
               supervised by a SERGEANT who sees to it that his face hits 
               the mud every time down and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MESS HALL - DAY

               -- SANTIAGO sitting alone in the mess hall, not a friend 
               within four seats of him and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MARINE BARRACKS - DAY

               -- SANTIAGO being chewed out by a Lieutenant in front of his 
               squad and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ROCKY HILL - DAY

               -- SANTIAGO running with the squad of MARINES again, this 
               time down a rocky hill. It's hot as hell and it looks like 
               he's gonna pass out.

               He stumbles, and the SERGEANT picks him up and pushes him 
               down the hill. He rolls about 30 feet before he stops. Over 
               this, we HEAR

                                     SANTIAGO (V.O.)
                         "...My name is PFC William T. 
                         Santiago. I am a marine stationed at 
                         Marine Barracks, Rifle Security 
                         Company Windward, Second Platoon 
                         Delta. I am writing to inform you of 
                         my problems with my unit here in 
                         Cuba and to ask for your help. I've 
                         fallen out on runs before for several 
                         reasons such as feeling dizzy or 
                         nauseated, but on May 18th, I'd fallen 
                         back about 20 or 30 yards going down 
                         a rocky, unstable hill. My sergeant 
                         grabbed me and pushed me down the 
                         hill. Then I saw all black and the 
                         last thing I remember is hitting the 
                         deck. I was brought to the hospital 
                         where I was told I just had heat 
                         exhaustion and was explained to by 
                         the doctor that my body has trouble 
                         with the hot sun and I hyperventilate. 
                         I ask you to help me. Please sir. I 
                         just need to be transferred out of 
                         RSC. Sincerely. PFC William T. 
                         Santiago. U.S. Marine Corps."

               At this point, with SANTIAGO's letter still in V.O., we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.  JESSEP'S OFFICE - DAY

               THE LETTER - DAY

               It's the last paragraph of the letter we've been hearing, 
               and at the moment, we can't see the hands that are holding 
               it.

                                     SANTIAGO (V.O.)
                         "P.S. In exchange for my transfer 
                         off the base, I'm willing to provide 
                         you with information about an illegal 
                         fenceline shooting that occurred the 
                         night of August 2nd."

               And as these last words are spoken, we PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
               COLONEL NATHAN R. JESSEP, who drops the letter he's been 
               reading on his desk, where it joins a stack of other letters 
               just like it.

               JESSEP's a born leader, considered in many circles to be one 
               of the real fair-haired boys of the Corps. He's smart as a 
               whip with a sense of humor to match. As soon as he drops the 
               letter, he says

                                     JESSEP
                         Who the fuck is PFC William T. 
                         Santiago.

               He's talking to his two senior officers. CAPTAIN MARKINSON 
               is in his late 40's. He's a career marine and a nice guy in 
               a world where nice guys may not finish last, but they sure 
               as shit don't finish first. Lt. JONATHAN JAMES KENDRICK is 
               26, from Georgia, and an Academy graduate.

               If you asked him he'd tell you that the gates to heaven are 
               guarded by the U.S. Marine Corps.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Sir, Santiago is a member of Second 
                         Platoon, Delta.

                                     JESSEP
                         Yeah, well, apparently he's not very 
                         happy down here at Shangri-La, cause 
                         he's written letters to everyone but 
                         Santa Claus asking for a transfer. 
                         And now he's telling tales about a 
                         fenceline shooting.

               He tosses the letter over to MARKINSON. MARKINSON is looking 
               it over. JESSEP is waiting for a response.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         Matthew?

                                     MARKINSON
                         I'm appalled, sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         You're appalled? This kid broke the 
                         Chain of Command and he ratted on a 
                         man of his unit, to say nothing of 
                         the fact that he's a U.S. Marine and 
                         it would appear that he can't run 
                         from here to there without collapsing 
                         from heat exhaustion. What the fuck's 
                         going on over at Windward, Matthew?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Colonel, I think perhaps it would be 
                         better to hold this discussion in 
                         private.

                                     KENDRICK
                         That won't be necessary, Colonel, 
                         I'll handle the situation.

                                     MARKINSON
                         The same way you handled the Curtis 
                         Barnes incident? You're doing 
                         something wrong, Lieutenant this --

                                     KENDRICK
                         My methods of leadership are --

                                     MARKINSON
                         Don't interrupt me, I'm still your 
                         superior officer.

                                     JESSEP
                         And I'm yours, Matthew.

               The room calms down for a moment.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         I want to know what we're gonna do 
                         about this.

                                     MARKINSON
                         I think Santiago should be transferred 
                         off the base. Right away.

                                     JESSEP
                         He's that bad, huh?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Not only that, but word of this 
                         letter's bound to get out. The kid's 
                         gonna get his ass kicked.

                                     JESSEP
                         Transfer Santiago. Yes I suppose 
                         you're right. I suppose that's the 
                         thing to do. Wait. Wait. I've got a 
                         better idea. Let's transfer the whole 
                         squad off the base. Let's -- on second 
                         thought -- Windward. The whole 
                         Windward division, let's transfer 
                         'em off the base. Jon, go on out 
                         there and get those boys down off 
                         the fence, they're packing their 
                         bags.
                              (calling out)
                         Tom!

               The ORDERLY cones in from the outer office.

                                     ORDERLY
                         Sir!

                                     JESSEP
                         Got me the President on the phone, 
                         we're surrendering our position in 
                         Cuba.

                                     ORDERLY
                         Yes sir!

                                     JESSEP
                         Wait a minute, Tom.

               The ORDERLY stops.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         Don't call the President just yet. 
                         Maybe we should consider this for a 
                         second. Maybe -- and I'm just spit 
                         balling here -- but maybe we as 
                         officers have a responsibility to 
                         train Santiago. Maybe we as officers 
                         have a responsibility to this country 
                         to see that the men and women charged 
                         with its security are trained 
                         professionals. Yes. I'm certain I 
                         once read that somewhere. And now 
                         I'm thinking that your suggestion of 
                         transferring Santiago, while 
                         expeditious, and certainly painless, 
                         might not be in a manner of speaking, 
                         the American way. Santiago stays 
                         where he is. We're gonna train the 
                         lad. You're in charge, Jon. Santiago 
                         doesn't make 4.1 on his next fitness 
                         report, I'm gonna blame you. Then 
                         I'm gonna kill you.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes sir.

                                     MARKINSON
                         I think that's a mistake, Colonel.

                                     JESSEP
                         Matthew, I believe I will have that 
                         word in private with you now. Jon, 
                         that's all. Why don't you and I have 
                         lunch at the "O" club, we'll talk 
                         about the training of young William.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes sir, I'd be delighted to hear 
                         any suggestions you have.

                                     JESSEP
                         Dismissed.

               KENDRICK is gone.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         Matthew, sit, please.

               MARKINSON sits.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         What do you think of Kendrick?

                                     MARKINSON
                              (beat)
                         I don't know that --

                                     JESSEP
                         I think he's kind of a weasel, myself. 
                         But he's an awfully good officer, 
                         and in the end we see eye to eye on 
                         the best way to run a marine corps 
                         unit. We're in the business of saving 
                         lives, Matthew. That's a 
                         responsibility we have to take pretty 
                         seriously. And I believe that taking 
                         a marine who's not yet up to the job 
                         and packing him off to another 
                         assignment, puts lives in danger.

               MARKINSON starts to stand --

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         Matthew, siddown.
                              (beat)
                         We go back a while. We went to the 
                         Academy together, we were commissioned 
                         together, we did our tours in Vietnam 
                         together. But I've been promoted up 
                         through the chain with greater speed 
                         and success than you have. Now if 
                         that's a source of tension or 
                         embarrassment for you, well, I don't 
                         give a shit. We're in the business 
                         of saving lives, Captain Markinson. 
                         Don't ever question my orders in 
                         front of another officer.

               JESSEP grabs his hat and walks out, leaving MARKINSON sitting 
               all alone, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WASHINGTON NAVY YARD - MAIN GATE - DAY

               It's maybe a little hazier today than it was yesterday. An 
               M.P. is waving a procession of three Military Police sedans 
               and a fourth unmarked car through the gate. The cars drive 
               through and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE BRIG - DAY

               Another red-brick building. A few M.P.Is stand out front as 
               the cars pull up. As soon as they come to a stop, all the 
               doors swing open and various uniformed and non-uniformed 
               officers hop out and move to the unmarked sedan where they 
               escort DAWSON and DOWNEY, in handcuffs, out of the car.  
               HAROLD DAWSON's a handsome, young, black corporal. Intense, 
               controlled, and utterly professional.

               LOUDEN DOWNEY's a 19-year-old kid off an Iowa farm. He's 
               happiest when someone is telling him exactly what to do.

               DAWSON's his hero.

               The two prisoners stand still for a moment. They might as 
               we'll be in Oz.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Hal?

               DAWSON doesn't say anything.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (continuing)
                         Is this Washington, D.C.?

                                     M.P.
                         Alright, let's move.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT.  SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY

               and KAFFEE's at it again.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Alright, let's get tough out there!

               JO walks up from behind the backstop.

                                     JO
                         Excuse me.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You want to suit up? We need all the 
                         help we can get.

                                     JO
                         No, thank you, I can't throw and 
                         catch things.

                                     KAFFEE
                         That's okay, neither can they.

                                     JO
                         I wanted to talk to you about Corporal 
                         Dawson and Private Downey.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Say again?

                                     JO
                         Dawson and Downey.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Those names sound like they should 
                         mean something to me, but I'm just 
                         not --

                                     JO
                         Dawson! Downey! Your clients!

                                     KAFFEE
                         The Cuba thing! Yes! Dawson and 
                         Downey.
                              (beat)
                         Right.
                              (pause)
                         I've done something wrong again, 
                         haven't I?

                         I was wondering why two guys have 
                         been in a jail cell since this morning 
                         while their lawyer is outside hitting 
                         a ball.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We need the practice.

                                     JO
                         That wasn't funny.

                                     KAFFEE
                         It was a little funny.

                                     JO
                         Lieutenant, would you feel very 
                         insulted if I recommended to your 
                         supervisor that he assign different 
                         counsel?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why?

                                     JO
                         I don't think you're fit to handle 
                         this defense.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You don't even know me. Ordinarily 
                         it takes someone hours to discover 
                         I'm not fit to handle a defense.

               Jo just stares.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Oh come on, that was damn funny.

               Jo moves close to KAFFEE to say this with a degree of 
               confidentiality.

                                     JO
                         I do know you. Daniel AlliStair 
                         Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston 
                         Mercy Hospital. Your father's Lionel 
                         Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate 
                         and Attorney General, of the United 
                         States, died 1985. You went to Harvard 
                         Law on a Navy scholarship, probably 
                         because that's what your father wanted 
                         you to do, and now you're just 
                         treading water for the three years 
                         you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps, 
                         just kinda layin' low til you can 
                         get out and get a real job. And if 
                         that's the situation, that's fine, I 
                         won't tell anyone. But my feeling is 
                         that if this case is handled in the 
                         same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian 
                         Bazaar manner with which you seem to 
                         handle everything else, something's 
                         gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be 
                         doing my job if I allowed Dawson and 
                         Downey to spend any more time in 
                         prison than absolutely necessary, 
                         because their attorney had pre-
                         determined the path of least 
                         resistance.

               KAFFEE can't help but be impressed by that speech.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Wow.
                              (beat)
                         I'm sexually aroused, Commander.

                                     JO
                         I don't think your clients murdered 
                         anybody.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What are you basing this on?

                                     JO
                         There was no intent.

                                     KAFFEE
                         The doctor's report says that Santiago 
                         died of asphyxiation brought on by 
                         acute lactic acidosis, and that the 
                         nature of the acidosis strongly 
                         suggests poisoning.
                              (beat)
                         Now, I don't know what any of that 
                         means, but it sounds pretty bad.

                                     JO
                         Santiago died at one a.m. At three 
                         the doctor was unable to determine 
                         the cause of death, but two hours 
                         later he said it was poison.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Oh, now I see what you're saying.  
                         It had to be Professor Plum in the 
                         library with the candlestick.

                                     JO
                         I'm gonna speak to your supervisor.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Okay. You go straight up Pennsylvania 
                         Avenue. It's a big white house with 
                         pillars in front.

                                     JO
                         Thank you.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I don't think you'll have much luck, 
                         though. I was assigned by Division, 
                         remember? Somebody over there thinks 
                         I'm a good lawyer. So while I 
                         appreciate your interest and admire 
                         your enthusiasm, I think I can pretty 
                         much handle things myself.

                                     JO
                         Do you know what a code red is?

               KAFFEE doesn't, but he doesn't say anything.

                              (continuing)

               And an M.P. is leading KAFFEE and SAM down to DAWSON and

                         Officer on deck, ten-hut.

               DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention. Through the following, 
               the M.P. will unlock the call door and let the lawyers in.

                         playing well with others, Harold.

                         Weinerg, you can sitdown.

               DAWSON and DOWNEY aren't too comfortable sitting in the 
               presence of officers, but they do as they're told. KAFFEE's 
               pulled out some documents, SAM's sitting on one of the cots 
               taking notes.

                         You don't have to call me sir.
                              (to DOWNEY)
                         Is this your signature?

                         And you certainly don't have to do 
                         it twice in one sentence. Harold, 
                         what's a Code Red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir, a Code Red is a disciplinary 
                         engagement.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What does that mean, exactly?

                         Sir, a marine falls out of line,

                         get him back on track.

                         Sir, a marine has refused to bathe 
                         on a regular basis. The men in his 
                         squad would give him a G.I. shower.

                         direct questions you ask him.

                         stuffed in Santiago's mouth, was 
                         there poison on it?

                         No sir.

                         No sir. We were gonna shave his head, 
                         sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         When all of a sudden...?

                                     DOWNEY
                         We saw blood drippinq out of his 
                         mouth. Then we pulled the tape off, 
                         and there was blood all down his 
                         face, sir. That's when Corporal Dawson 
                         called the ambulance.

               KAFFEE tries not to make too big a deal out of this last 
               piece of news.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to DAWSON)
                         Did anyone see you call the ambulance?

                                     DAWSON
                         No sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Were you there when the ambulance 
                         got there?

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir, that's when we were taken 
                         under arrest.

               KAFFEE kinda strolls to the corner of the cell to think for 
               a moment.

                         fire a shot across the fenceline 
                         into Cuba?

                         Why?

                                     DAWSON
                         My mirror engaged, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to SAM)
                         His mirror engaged?

                                     SAM
                         For each American sentry post there's 
                         a Cuban counterpart. They're called 
                         mirrors. The corporal's claiming 
                         that his mirror was about to fire at 
                         him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Santiago's letter to the NIS said 
                         you fired illegally. He's saying 
                         that the guy, the mirror, he never 
                         made a move.

               DAWSON says nothing.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Oh, Harold?

               SAM is staring at DAWSON.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         You see what I'm getting at? If 
                         Santiago didn't have anything on 
                         you, then why did you give him a 
                         Code Red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Because he broke the chain of command, 
                         sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         He what?

                                     DAWSON
                         He went outside his unit, sir. If he 
                         had a problem, he should've spoken 
                         to me, sir. Then his Sergeant, then 
                         Company Commander, then --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah, yeah, alright. Harold, did you 
                         assault Santiago with the intent of 
                         killing him?

                                     DAWSON
                         No sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What was your intent?

                                     DAWSON
                         To train him, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Train him to do what?

                                     DAWSON
                         Train him to think of his unit before 
                         himself. To respect the code.

                                     SAM
                         What's the code?

                                     DAWSON
                         Unit Corps God Country.

                                     SAM
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     DAWSON
                         Unit Corps God Country, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         The Goverrment of the United States 
                         wants to charge you two with murder. 
                         You want me to go to the prosecutor 
                         with unit, corps, god, country?

               DAWSON stares at KAFFEE.

                                     DAWSON
                         That's our code, sir.

               KAFFEE takes a long moment. He picks up his briefcase and he 
               and SAM move to the door.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We'll be back. You guys need anything? 
                         Books paper, cigarettes, a ham 
                         sandwich?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir. No thank you. Sir.

               KAFFEE smiles at DAWSON.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Harold, I think there's a concept 
                         you better start warming up to.

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm the only friend you've got.

               And as KAFFEE and SAM walk out the open cell door, DAWSON 
               and DOWNEY come to attention and snap a salute.

               They hold the salute until KAFFEE and SAM are well out of 
               sight, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.  KAFFEE'S OFFICE - DAY

               He's packing up stuff into his briefcase at the end of the 
               work day. Lt. JACK ROSS, a marine lawyer maybe two years 
               older than Kaffee, opens the door and walks in..

                                     ROSS
                         Dan Kaffee.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sailin' Jack Ross.

                                     ROSS
                         Welcome to the big time.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You think so?

                                     ROSS
                         I hope for Dawson and Downey's sake 
                         you practice law better than you 
                         play softball.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Unfortunately for Dawson and Downey, 
                         I don't do anything better than I 
                         play softball. What are we lookin' 
                         at?

                                     ROSS
                         They plead guilty to manslaughter, 
                         I'll drop the conspiracy and the 
                         conduct unbecoming. 20 years, they'll 
                         be home in half that time.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I want twelve.

                                     ROSS
                         Can't do it.

                                     KAFFEE
                         They called the ambulance, Jack.

                                     ROSS
                         I don't care if they called the Avon 
                         Lady, they killed a marine.

                                     KAFFEE
                         The rag was tested for poison.  The 
                         autopsy, lab report, even the initial 
                         E.R. and C.O.D. reports. They all 
                         say the same thing: Maybe, maybe 
                         not.

                                     ROSS
                         The Chief of Internal Medicine at 
                         the Guantanamo Bay Naval hospital 
                         says he's sure.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What do you know about Code Reds?

               ROSS smiles and shakes his head.

                                     ROSS
                         Oh man.

               He closes the office door.

                                     ROSS
                              (continuing)
                         Are we off the record?

                                     KAFFEE
                         You tell me.

                                     ROSS
                              (pause)
                         I'm gonna give you the twelve years, 
                         but before you go getting yourself 
                         into trouble tomorrow, you should 
                         know this: The platoon commander Lt. 
                         Jonathan Kendrick, had a meeting 
                         with the men. And he specifically 
                         told them not to touch Santiago.

               KAFFEE holds for a moment. Dawson and Downey neglected to 
               mention this... He packs up his briefcase and cleats.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll talk to you when I get back.

                                     ROSS
                         Hey, we got a little four-on-four 
                         going tomorrow night. When does your 
                         plane get in?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT.  THE PARKING LOT - DUSK

               It's dusk and people on the base are going home from work.  
               We can see the flag being lowered in the background.

               KAFFEE's walking toward his car. JO intercepts him and starts 
               walking along with him.

                                     JO
                         Hi there.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Any luck getting me replaced?

                                     JO
                         Is there anyone in this command that 
                         you don't either drink or play 
                         softball with?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Commander --

                                     JO
                         Listen, I came to make peace. We 
                         started off on the wrong foot. What 
                         do you say? Friends?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Look, I don't --

                                     JO
                         By the way, I brought Downey some 
                         comic books he was asking for. The 
                         kid, Kaffee, I swear, he doesn't 
                         know where he is, he doesn't even 
                         know why he's been arrested.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Commander --

                                     JO
                         You can call me Joanne.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Joanne --

                                     JO
                         or Jo.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo?

                                     JO
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo, if you ever speak to a client of 
                         mine again without my permission, 
                         I'll have you disbarred. Friends?

                                     JO
                         I had authorization.

                                     KAFFEE
                         From where?

                                     JO
                         Downey's closest living relative, 
                         Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's 
                         side.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You got authorization from Aunt Ginny?

                                     JO
                         I gave her a call like you asked. 
                         Very nice woman, we talked for about 
                         an hour.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You got authorization from Aunt Ginny.

                                     JO
                         Perfectly within my province.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Does Aunt Ginny have a barn? We can 
                         hold the trial there. I can sew the 
                         costumes, and maybe his Uncle Goober 
                         can be the judge.

               Jo steps aside and lets KAFFEE got into his car.

                         And the hits just keep on comin'.

               HOLD on KAFFEE and Jo. JO smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK NEWSSTAND - DUSK

               KAFFEE IN HIS CAR

               He's driving down a Washington street and pulls over at a 
               sidewalk newsstand.

               He gets out of his car, leaving the lights flashing, and 
               runs up to the newsstand.

               As he plunks his 35 cents down and picks up a newspaper, he 
               engages in his daily ritual with LUTHER, the newsstand 
               operator.

                                     KAFFEE
                         How's it goin', Luther?

                                     LUTHER
                         Another day, another dollar, captain.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You gotta play 'em as they lay, 
                         Luther.

                                     LUTHER
                         What comes around, goes around, you 
                         know what I'm sayin'.

                                     KAFFEE
                         If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

                                     LUTHER
                         Hey, if you've got your health, you 
                         got everything.

                         Love makes the world go round. I'll 
                         see you tomorrow, Luther.

               And we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               A baby sleeping in a crib pull rack to reveal SAM is standing 
               over the crib. KAFFEE's sitting on a beer.

                                     SAM
                         When Nancy gets back, you're my 
                         witness. The baby spoke. My daughter 
                         said a word.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Your daughter made a sound, Sam, I'm 
                         not sure it was a word.

                                     SAM
                         Oh come on, it was a word.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Okay.

                                     SAM
                         You heard her. The girl sat here, 
                         pointed, and said "Pa". She did. She 
                         said "Pa".

                                     KAFFEE
                         She was pointing at a doorknob.

                                     SAM
                         That's right. Pointing, as if to 
                         say, "Pa, look, a doorknob".

               SAM joins KAFFEE in the living room.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jack Ross came to see me today. He 
                         offered me twelve years.

                                     SAM
                         That's what you wanted.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I know, and I'll... I guess, I mean --
                              (beat)
                         I'll take it.

                                     SAM
                         So?

                                     KAFFEE
                         It took albout 45 seconds. He barely 
                         put up a fight.

                                     SAM
                              (beat)
                         Danny, take the twelve years, it's a 
                         gift.

               KAFFEE finishes off his beer, and stands.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You don't believe their story, do 
                         you? You think they ought to go to 
                         jail for the rest of their lives.

                                     SAM
                         I believe every word they said. And 
                         I think they ought to go to jail for 
                         the rest of their lives.

               KAFFEE nods and puts down the empty beer bottle.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll see you tomorrow.

               Sam opens the front door for him and they stand out on the 
               stoop for a moment.

                                     SAM
                         Remember to wear your whites, it's 
                         hot down there.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I don't like the whites.

                                     SAM
                         Nobody likes the whites, but we're 
                         going to Cuba in August. You got 
                         Dramamine?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Dramamine keeps you cool?

                                     SAM
                         Dramamine keeps you from throwing 
                         up, you get sick when you fly.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I get sick when I fly because I'm 
                         afraid of crashing into a large 
                         mountain, I don't think Dramamine'll 
                         help.

                                     SAM
                         I've got some oregano, I hear that 
                         works pretty good.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah, right.

               KAFFEE starts toward his car, then turns around.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         You know, Ross said the strangest 
                         thing to me right before I left. He 
                         said the platoon commander Lieutenant 
                         Jonathan Kendrick had a meeting with 
                         the men and specifically told them 
                         not to touch Santiago.

                                     SAM
                         So?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I never mentioned Kendrick. I don't 
                         even know who he is.
                              (beat)
                         What the hell.
                              (beat)
                         I'll see you tomorrow.

               We hold for a moment on KAFFEE as he walks to his car, then

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE AIRSTRIP AT GUANTANAMO BAY - DAY

               The whole place, in stark contrast to the Washington Navy 
               Yard, is ready to go to war. Fighter jets line the tarmac. 
               Ground crews re-fuel planes. Hurried activity.

               A 36 seat Airforce Jet rolls to a stop on the tarmac and a 
               stair unit is brought up.

               HOWARD, a marine corporal, is waiting by the stairway as the 
               passengers begin to got off. Mostly MARINES, a few SAILORS, 
               a couple of CIVILIANS, and KAFFEE, JO and SAM. KAFFEE and 
               SAM are wearing their summer whites, JO is in khakis.

               KAFFEE and SAM stare out at what they see: They're not in 
               Kansas anymore.

               HOWARD shouts over the noise from the planes.

                                     HOWARD
                         Lieutenants Kaffee and Weinberg?

                         I'm Corporal Howard, ma'am, I'm to 
                         escort you to the Windward side of 
                         the base.

                                     JO
                         Thank you.

                                     HOWARD
                         I've got some camouflage jackets in 
                         the back of the jeep, sirs, I'll 
                         have to ask you both to put them on.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Camouflage jackets?

                                     HOWARD
                         Regulations, sir. We'll be riding 
                         pretty close to the fenceline. The 
                         Cubans see an officer wearing white, 
                         they think it's someone they might 
                         wanna take a shot at.

               KAFFEE turns and glares at SAM.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Good call, Sam.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CUBAN ROAD - THE JEEP - DAY

               Tearing along down the road, and now we see a beautiful 
               expanse of water, maybe 1000 yards across. It's a section of 
               Guantanamo Bay.

                                     HOWARD
                              (shouting)
                         We'll just hop on the ferry and be 
                         over there in no time.

                         Yes sir, to get to the other side of 
                         the bay.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Nobody said anything about a boat.

                              (shouting)
                         Is there a problem, sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (shouting)
                         No. No problem. I'm just not that 
                         crazy about boats, that's all.

                         Lt. Kaffee, I had the pleasure of 
                         seeing your father once. I was a 
                         teenager and he spoke at my high 
                         school.

               KAFFEE smiles and nods.

                                     JESSEP
                         Lionel Kaffee?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Well what do you know. Son, this 
                         man's dad once made a lot of enemies 
                         down in your neck of the woods. 
                         Jefferson vs. Madison County School 
                         District. The folks down there said 
                         a little black girl couldn't go to 
                         an all white school, Lionel Kaffee 
                         said we'll just see about that. How 
                         the hell is your dad?

                                     KAFFEE
                         He passed away seven years ago, 
                         colonel.

                                     JESSEP
                              (pause)
                         Well... don't I feel like the fuckin, 
                         asshole.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Not at all, sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Well, what can we do for you, Danny.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Not much at all, sir, I'm afraid. 
                         This is really a formality more than 
                         anything else. The JAG Corps insists 
                         that I interview all the relevant 
                         witnesses.

                                     JO
                         The JAG Corps can be demanding that 
                         way.

               JESSEP smiles.

                                     JESSEP
                         Jonanthan'll take you out and show 
                         you what you wanna see, then we can 
                         all hook up for lunch, how does that 
                         sound?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Fine, sir.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT.  THE FENCELINE - DAY

               A SQUAD OF MARINES jogs by as a jeep carrying KENDRICK and 
               the three LAWYERS cruises down the road.

               We FOLLOW the jeep.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I understand you had a meeting with 
                         your men that afternoon.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What'd you guys talk about?

                                     KENDRICK
                         I told the men that there was an 
                         informer among us. And that despite 
                         any desire they might have to seek 
                         retribution, Private Santiago was 
                         not to be harmed in any way.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What time was that meeting?

                                     KENDRICK
                         Sixteen-hundred.

               KAFFEE turns around and looks at SAM.

                                     SAM
                              (leaning forward)
                         Four o'clock.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE BARRACKS CORRIDOR - DAY

               KENDRICK leads the LAWYERS down the corridor to Santiago's 
               room.

               Two strips of tape which warn DO NOT ENTER - AT ORDER OF THE 
               MILITARY POLICE are crisscrossed over the closed door. They 
               open the door and step under the tape and walk into

               INT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - DAY

               The room is exactly an it was left that night. The un-made 
               bed, the chair knocked over... The LAWYERS look around for a 
               moment. The room is sparse.

               Kaffee goes to the closet and opens it: A row of uniforms 
               hanging neatly. He thumbs through then for a second, but 
               there's nothing there.

               He opens the footlocker: Socks, underwear... all folded to 
               marine corp precision... A shaving kit, a couple of 
               photographs, a pad of writing paper and some envelopes...

               Kaffee closes the footlocker.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sam, somebody should see about getting 
                         this stuff to his parents. We don't 
                         need it anymore.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Actually, the uniforms belong to the 
                         marine corps.

               The LAWYERS take a moment.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Lt. Kendrick -- can I call you Jon?

                                     KENDRICK
                         No, you may not.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Have I done something to offend you?

                                     KENDRICK
                         No, I like all you Navy boys. Every 
                         time we've gotta go someplace and 
                         fight, you fellas always give us a 
                         ride.

                                     JO
                         Lt. Kendrick, do you think Santiago 
                         was murdered?

                                     KENDRICK
                         Commander, I believe in God, and in 
                         his son Jesus Christ, and because I 
                         do, I can say this: Private Santiago 
                         is dead and that's a tragedy. But 
                         he's dead because he had no code. 
                         He's dead because he had no honor. 
                         And God was watching.

               SAM turns to KAFFEE.

                                     SAM
                         How do you feel about that theory?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Sounds good. Let's move on.

               SAM and KENDRICK walk out the door. JO stops KAFFEE.

                                     JO
                         You planning on doing any 
                         investigating or are you just gonna 
                         take the guided tour?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         I'm pacing myself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE OFFICERS CLUB - DAY

               JESSEP, MARKINSON, KENDRICK and the LAWYERS are seated at a 
               table in the corner.

               Stewards clear the lunch dishes and pour coffee. Jessep is 
               finishing a story.

                                     JESSEP
                         ...And they spent the next three 
                         hours running around, looking for 
                         Americans to surrender to.

               JESSEP laughs. KENDRICK joins him. SAM and KAFFEE force a 
               laugh.

               MARKINSON forces a smile. JO remains silent.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing; to the 
                              STEWARDS)
                         That was delicious, men, thank you.

                                     STEWARD
                         Our pleasure, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel just need to ask you a couple 
                         of questions about August 6th.

                                     JESSEP
                         Shoot.

                                     KAFFEE
                         On the morning of the sixth, you 
                         were contacted by an NIS angent who 
                         said that Santiago had tipped him 
                         off to an illegal fenceline shooting.

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Santiago was gonna reveal the person's 
                         name in exchange for a transfer. An 
                         I getting this right?

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         If you feel there are any details 
                         that I'm missing, you should free to 
                         speak up.

               JESSEP's not quite sure what to say to this Navy Lawyer 
               Lieutenant-Smartass guy who just gave him permission to speak 
               freely on his own base.

                                     JESSEP
                         Thank you.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Now it was at this point that you 
                         called Captain Markinson and Lt. 
                         Kendrick into your office?

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And what happened then?

                                     JESSEP
                         We agreed that for his own safety, 
                         Santiago should be transferred off 
                         the base.

               Here's something else KAFFEE didn't know. Neither did Jo. 
               SAM jots something down on a small notepad.

               MARKINSON doesn't flinch.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Santiago was set to be transferred?

                                     JESSEP
                         On the first available flight to the 
                         states. Six the next morning. Three 
                         hours too late as it turned out.

               KAFFEE nods.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah.

               There's silence for a moment.

               KAFFEE takes a sip of his coffee. Then drains the cup and 
               puts it down.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Alright, that's all I have. Thanks 
                         very much for your time.

                                     KENDRICK
                         The corporal's got the jeep outside, 
                         he'll take you back to the airstrip.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (standing)
                         Thank you.

                                     JO
                         Wait a minute, I've got some 
                         questions.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No you don't.

                                     JO
                         Yes I do.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No you don't.

                                     JO
                         Colonel, on the morning that Santiago 
                         died, did you meet with Doctor Stone 
                         between three and five?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo --

                                     JESSEP
                         Of course I met with the doctor. One 
                         of my men was dead.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to JO)
                         See? The man was dead. Let's go.

                                     JO
                              (to JESSEP)
                         I was wondering if you've ever heard 
                         the term Code Red.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo --

                                     JESSEP
                         I've heard the term, yes.

                                     JO
                         Colonel, this past February, you 
                         received a cautionary memo from the 
                         Naval Investigative Service, warning 
                         that the practice of enlisted men 
                         disciplining their own wasn't to be 
                         condoned by officers.

                                     JESSEP
                         I submit to you that whoever wrote 
                         that memo has never served on the 
                         working end of a Soviet-made Cuban 
                         Ml-Al6 Assault Rifle. However, the 
                         directive having come from the NIS, 
                         I gave it its due attention. What's 
                         your point, Jo?

                                     KAFFEE
                         She has no point. She often has no 
                         point. It's part of her charm. We're 
                         outta here. Thank you.

                                     JO
                         My point is that I think code reds 
                         still go on down here. Do Code Reds 
                         still happen on this base, colonel?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo, the colonel doesn't need to answer 
                         that.

                                     JO
                         Yes he does.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No, he really doesn't.

                                     JO
                         Yeah, he really does. Colonel?

                                     JESSEP
                         You know it just hit me. She outranks 
                         you, Danny.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         I want to tell you something Danny 
                         and listen up 'cause I mean this: 
                         You're the luckiest man in the world. 
                         There is, believe me gentlemen, 
                         nothing sexier on earth than a woman 
                         you have to salute in the morning. 
                         Promote 'em all I say.

               JO's not upset. JO's not mad. But she's gonna ask her question 
               'til she gets an answer.

                                     JO
                         Colonel, the practice of code Reds 
                         is still condoned by officers on 
                         this base, isn't it?

                                     JESSEP
                         You see my problem is, of course, 
                         that I'm a Colonel. I'll just have 
                         to keep taking cold showers 'til 
                         they elect some gal President.

                                     JO
                         I need an answer to my question, 
                         sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Take caution in your tone, Commander.  
                         I'm a fair guy, but this fuckin' 
                         heat's making me absolutely crazy. 
                         You want to know about code reds?  
                         On the record I tell you that I 
                         discourage the practice in accordance 
                         with the NIS directive. Off the record 
                         I tell you that it's an invaluable 
                         part of close infantry training, and 
                         if it happens to go on without my 
                         knowledge, so be it. I run my base 
                         how I run my base. You want to 
                         investigate me, roll the dice and 
                         take your chances. I eat breakfast 
                         80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who 
                         are trained to kill me. So don't for 
                         one second think you're gonna come 
                         down here, flash a badge, and make 
                         me nervous.

               A moment of tense silence before --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Let's go. Colonel, I'll just need a 
                         copy of Santiago's transfer order.

                                     JESSEP
                         What's that?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Santiago's transfer order. You guys 
                         have paper work on that kind of thing, 
                         I just need it for the file.

                                     JESSEP
                         For the file.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah.

                                     JESSEP
                              (pause)
                         Of course you can have a copy of the 
                         transfer order. For the file. I'm 
                         here to help anyway I can.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thank you.

                                     JESSEP
                         You believe that, don't you? Danny? 
                         That I'm here to help anyway I can?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Of course.

                                     JESSEP
                         The corporal'll run you by Ordinance 
                         on your way out to the airstrip. You 
                         can have all the transfer orders you 
                         want.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to JO and SAM)
                         Let's go.

               The LAWYERS start to leave.

                                     JESSEP
                         But you have to ask me nicely.

               KAFFEE stops. Turns around. Sam and JO stop and turn.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     JESSEP
                         You have to ask me nicely. You see, 
                         Danny, I can deal with the bullets 
                         and the bombs and the blood. I can 
                         deal with the heat and the stress 
                         and the fear. I don't want money and 
                         I don't want medals. What I want is 
                         for you to stand there in that faggoty 
                         white uniform, and with your Harvard 
                         mouth, extend me some fuckin' 
                         courtesy. You gotta ask me nicely.

               KAFFEE and JESSEP are frozen. Everyone'staring at Kaffee; 
               The OFFICERS at their tables... KENDRICK... SAM... 
               MARKINSON... JO... KAFFEE makes his decision.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel Jessep... if it's not too 
                         much trouble, I'd like a copy of the 
                         transfer order. Sir.

               JESSEP smiles.

                                     JESSEP
                         No problem.

               HOLD for a moment. JO's very disappointed.

               JESSEP stands there and watches the LAWYERS as they turn and 
               leave the Officer's Club.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         I hate casualties, Matthew. There 
                         are casualties even in victory. A 
                         marine smothers a grenade and saves 
                         his platoon, that marine's a hero. 
                         The foundation of the unit, the fabric 
                         of this base, the spirit of the Corps, 
                         they are things worth fighting for.

               MARKINSON looks at the ground.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         Dawson and Downey, they don't know 
                         it, but they're smothering a grenade.

               MARKINSON looks up as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ANDREWS AIRFORCE BASE - DUSK

               As a plane touches down on the runway. It's dusk in Washington 
               and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - DAY

               A little one-bedroom. Just the essential furniture, barely 
               even that.

               KAFFEE's sitting and watching a baseball came on t.v. He's 
               holding a copy of The Baseball Encyclopedia, normally his 
               favorite reading material, but right now he's having trouble 
               keeping his mind in it. He's holding a baseball bat and 
               fiddling with it.

               The remnants of a pizza and Yoo-Hoo dinner sit next to him.  
               His white uniform in a pile in the corner. There's a BUZZ at 
               the door. KAFFEE's not expecting anyone. He goes to the door.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Who is it?

                                     JO (O.S.)
                         It's me.

               KAFFEE opens the door and JO walks in.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I've really missed you, Jo. I was 
                         just saying to myself, "It's been 
                         almost three hours since I last saw --
                         "

                                     JO
                         Markinson resigned his commission.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         When?

                                     JO
                         This afternoon. Sometime after we 
                         left.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll talk to him in the morning.

                                     JO
                         I already tried, I can't find him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You tried? Joanne, you're coming 
                         dangerously close to the textbook 
                         definition of interfering with a 
                         government investigation.

               JO hands KAFFEE the file she's been holding.

                                     JO
                         I'm Louden Downey's attorney.

               KAFFEE's stunned. He opens the file and begins to read.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         Aunt Ginny. She said she feels like 
                         she's known me for years. I suggested 
                         that she might feel more comfortable 
                         if I were directly involved with the 
                         case. She had Louden sign the papers 
                         about an hour ago.

               KAFFEE looks up. Still too stunned to say anything. Then 
               finally...

                                     KAFFEE
                         I suppose it's way too much to hope 
                         that you're just making this up to 
                         bother me.

                         Don't worry, I'm not gonna make a 
                         motion for separation, you're still 
                         lead counsel.

               KAFFEE hands her back the file.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Splendid.

                                     JO
                         I think Kendrick ordered the Code 
                         Red.
                              (beat)
                         So do you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A HOLDING ROOM IN THE BRIG - NIGHT

               DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention as KAFFEE and JO are led 
               in.

                                     DAWSON
                         Officer on deck, ten hut.

               KAFFEE starts in immediately.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did Kendrick order the code red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Don't say sir like I just asked you 
                         if you cleaned the latrine. You heard 
                         what I said. Did Lt. Kendrick order 
                         you guys to give Santiago a code 
                         red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to Downey)
                         Did he?

                                     DOWNEY
                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You mind telling me why the hell you 
                         never mentioned this before?

                                     DAWSON
                         You didn't ask us, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Cutie-pie shit's not gonna win you a 
                         place in my heart, corporal, I get 
                         paid no matter how much time you 
                         spend in jail.

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir. I know you do, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Fuck you, Harold.

               There's some understandable tension in the room, broken by --

                                     JO
                         Alright. Let's sort this out. There 
                         was a platoon meeting on August 6th 
                         at four in the afternoon. And Lt. 
                         Kendrick, he gave strict instructions 
                         that nothing was to happen to 
                         Santiago. Now is that true? I want 
                         you to speak freely.

                                     DAWSON
                         Ma'am, that's correct. But then he 
                         dismissed the platoon and we all 
                         went to our rooms.

                                     JO
                         And what happened then?

                                     DAWSON
                         Lt. Kendrick came to our room, ma'am.

                                     KAFFEE
                         When?

                                     DAWSON
                         About five minutes after the meeting 
                         broke, sir. About 16:20.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         And what happened then?

                                     DAWSON
                         Lt. Kendrick ordered us to give 
                         Santiago a Code Red.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

               ROSS is playing a game of full-court basketball with some 
               other OFFICERS.

               A door at the far end of the court opens and KAFFEE and JO 
               walk in. They head down the sideline toward Ross.

               KAFFEE shouts --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jack!

               But ROSS is into the game...

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Jack!!

                                     ROSS
                              (waving him off)
                         Hang on...

                                     KAFFEE
                         They were given an order.

               ROSS stops cold and looks over at Kaffee. The game flies by 
               him. He motions to the locker room door in the corner of the 
               gym and the three of them make their way to privacy.

                                     JO
                         How long have you known about the 
                         order?

                                     ROSS
                         I didn't --
                              (to KAFFEE)
                         Who is this?

                                     KAFFEE
                         This is Jo Galloway she's Downey's 
                         lawyer. She's very pleased to meet 
                         you.

                                     ROSS
                         What exactly are you accusing me of, 
                         commander?

                                     JO
                         I'm accusing you of --

               They're in the

               LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

               and KAFFEE slams the door shut behind them.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jack didn't know about the order. 
                         Because if he did and he hadn't told 
                         us, Jack knows he'd be violating 
                         about 14 articles of the code of 
                         ethics. As it is, he's got enough to 
                         worry about. God forbid our clients 
                         decide to plead not guilty and testify 
                         for the record that they were given 
                         an order.

                                     ROSS
                         Kendrick specifically told the men 
                         not to touch Santiago.

                                     KAFFEE
                         That's right. And then he went into 
                         Dawson and Downey's room and 
                         specifically told them to give him a 
                         code red.

                                     ROSS
                         That's not what Kendrick said.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Kendrick's lying.

                                     ROSS
                         You have proof?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I have the defendants.

                                     ROSS
                         And I have 23 marines who aren't 
                         accused of murder and a lieutenant 
                         with four letters of commendation.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why did Markinson resign his 
                         commission?

                                     ROSS
                         We'll never know.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You don't think I can subpoena 
                         Markinson.

                                     ROSS
                         You can try, but you won't find him.  
                         You know what Markinson did for the 
                         first 17 of his 21 years in the corps? 
                         Counter Intelligence. Markinson's 
                         gone. There is no Markinson.

               Some of the wind has been taken Out of Kaffee's sails.

               Kaffee and JO are sitting at a table. Dawson and Downey are 
               at parade rest. Kaffee lights a cigarette.

               KAFFEE can't believe this. He looks over at JO.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did you --
                              (to DAWSON and DOWNEY)
                         Did she put you up to this?

                                     JO
                         No.

                                     DAWSON
                         We have a code, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Well zippity-doo-dah. You and your 
                         code plead not guilty and you'll be 
                         in jail for the rest of your life. 
                         Do what I'm telling you and you'll 
                         be home in six months.

               DAWSON just stares at him.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Do it, Harold. Six months. It's 
                         nothing. It's a hockey season.

                                     DAWSON
                         Permission to --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Speak!

                                     DAWSON
                         What do we do then, sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                         When?

                                     DAWSON
                         After six months. We'd be dishonorably 
                         discharged, right sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes.

                                     DAWSON
                         What do we do then, sir? We joined 
                         the corps 'cause we wanted to live 
                         our lives by a certain code. And we 
                         found it in the corps. And now you're 
                         asking us to sign a piece of paper 
                         that says we have no honor. You're 
                         asking us to say we're not marines. 
                         If a judge and jury decide that what 
                         we did was wrong, I'll accept whatever 
                         punishment they give. But I believe 
                         I was riqht, sir. I believe I did my 
                         job. And I won't dishonor myself, my 
                         unit, or the Corps, so that I can qo 
                         home in six months.
                              (beat)
                         Sir.

               HOLD ON the four of them for a moment, then

                                     KAFFEE
                         Commander, I want to talk to corporal 
                         Dawson alone for a minute.

               Jo waits Just a moment before she calls out --

                                     JO
                              (to Downey)
                         Let's go in another room. Louden, 
                         everything's gonna be alright.

               The M.P. has shown up and unlocked the cell door.

                                     JO
                              (continuing; to M.P.)
                         We're gonna go into a holding room.

                                     M.P.
                         Aye, aye, ma'am.

               JO, DOWNEY, and the M.P. are gone. KAFFEE paces a moment 
               before he says --

                                     KAFFEE
                         You don't like me that much, do you?
                              (beat)
                         Forget it, don't answer that, it 
                         doesn't matter.

               KAFFEE paces another moment, then sits on the cot. He's trying 
               to choose his tack carefully.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         You know, Downey worships you. He's 
                         gonna do whatever you do. Are you 
                         really gonna let this happen to him 
                         because of a code? Harold?

                                     DAWSON
                         Do you think we were right?

                                     KAFFEE
                         It doesn't matter what I --

                                     DAWSON
                         Do you think we were right?

               KAFFEE gets up.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         I think you'd lose.

                                     DAWSON
                              (beat)
                         You're such a coward, I can't believe 
                         they let you wear a uniform.

               KAFFEE stares at DAWSON.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm not gonna feel responsible for 
                         this, Harold. I did everything I 
                         could. You're going to Levenworth 
                         for the better part of your life, 
                         and you know what? I don't give a 
                         shit.

               KAFFEE calls out --

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         M.P.!

               KAFFEE and DAWSON are staring each other down. The M.P. shows 
               up and unlocks the cell door. KAFFEE steps out to leave.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         What happened to saluting an officer 
                         when he leaves the room?

               DAWSON holds on KAFFEE. Then DAWSON, a man who would rather 
               die than breach military protocol, takes his hands and puts 
               them in his pockets.

               The cell door closes and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE OFFICE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               One light is on at the end of the hall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM has joined KAFFEE and JO. The mood is somber.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Dawson's gonna go to jail just to 
                         spite me. Fine. If he wants to jump 
                         off a cliff, that's his business. 
                         I'm not gonna hold his hand on the 
                         way down.
                              (to SAM)
                         I want to get him a new lawyer. How 
                         do I do it?

                                     SAM
                         You just make a motion tomorrow 
                         morning at the arraignment. The 
                         judge'll ask you if you want to enter 
                         a plea. You tell him you want new 
                         counsel assigned.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Then that's that.

                                     JO
                              (beat)
                         Yeah. One thing, though. When you 
                         ask the judge for new counsel, Danny, 
                         be sure and ask nicely.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What do you want from me?

                                     JO
                         I want you to let 'em be judged! I 
                         want you to stand up and make an 
                         argument!

                                     SAM
                         An argument that didn't work for 
                         Calley at My Lai, an argument that 
                         didn't work for the Nazis at 
                         Nuremberg.

                                     KAFFEE
                         For Christ sake, Sam, do you really 
                         think that's the same as two teenage 
                         marines executing a routine order 
                         that they never believed would result 
                         in harm? These guys aren't the Nazis.

               There's a pause in the room.

                                     JO
                         Don't look now, Danny, but you're 
                         making an argument.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         Yeah.
                              (beat)
                         Tomorrow morning I'll get them a new 
                         attorney.

                                     JO
                         Why are you so afraid to be a lawyer? 
                         Were daddy's expectations really 
                         that high?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Please, spare me the psycho-babble 
                         father bullshit. Dawson and Downey'll 
                         have their day in court, but they'll 
                         have it with another lawyer.

                                     JO
                         Another lawyer won't be good enough. 
                         They need you. You know how to win.
                              (beat)
                         You know they have a case. And you 
                         know how to win. You walk away from 
                         this now, and you have sealed their 
                         fate.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Their fate was sealed the moment 
                         Santiago died.

                                     JO
                         Do you believe they have a defense?

                                     KAFFEE
                         You and Dawson both live in the same 
                         dreamland. It doesn't matter what I 
                         believe, it only matters what I can 
                         prove. So please don't tell me what 
                         I know and don't know. I know the 
                         law.

               JO looks at him, shakes her head, and turns to walk away.  
               She turns back.

                                     JO
                         You know nothing about the law. You're 
                         a used car salesman, Daniel. You're 
                         an ambulance chaser with a rank. 
                         You're nothing.
                              (beat)
                         Live with that.

               Jo walks off leaving KAFFEE alone. We HOLD on KAFFEE. He's 
               not having a good night.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A GEORGETOWN BAR - NIGHT

               KAFFEE sits at the bar. The place is crowded with YUPPIES 
               and STUDENTS. KAFFEE's been drinking there a while now. Next 
               to him is a YUPPIE LAWYER, regaling his FRIENDS with the 
               story of his latest brilliant maneuver in the world of high 
               stakes corporate law.

               We HOLD on a KAFFEE a moment longer, then

                                     YUPPIE LAWYER
                         ...So I told duncan if we leverage 
                         the acquisition of Biotech, the 
                         interrogatories would be there on 
                         demand. All I have to do is not pick 
                         up the phone and it'll run Flaherty 
                         ten thousand a day in court costs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A GEORGETOWN STREET - NIGHT

               KAFFEE sits on a bench in the night. He takes a sip from a 
               bottle he's holding in a brown paper bag.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PARADE GROUNDS - DAY

               A bright, sunny morning. The BAND is performing for a group 
               of day campers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

               DAWSON and DOWNEY are at the defense table, ROSS is his place. 
               KAFFEE walks in and joins JO and SAM at their table. Papers 
               are being passed back and forth between ROSS and the SERGEANT 
               AT AMS. Quiet activity.

               The door in the back of the courtroom opens and RANDOLPH, a 
               marine colonel, enters and takes his place at the bench. We 
               can HEAR the band in the background.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         All rise.

               Everyone present in the courtroom stands.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Where are we?

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         Docket number 411275. VR-5. United 
                         States versus Lance Corporal Harold 
                         W. Dawson and Private First Class 
                         Loudon Downey. Defendants are charged 
                         with Conspiracy to Commit Murder, 
                         Murder in the First Degree, and 
                         Conduct Unbecoming a United States 
                         Marine.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Does defense wish to enter a plea?

               KAFFEE stands.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah.
                              (pause)
                         They're not guilty.

               JO, SAM, ROSS, RANDOLPH... it's hard to say who's the most 
               surprised. It takes everything Jo's got to suppress a smile. 
               The silence is broken by ROSS, who takes the two files, drops 
               them into his briefcase, closes the lid, and snaps it shut.

               RANDOLPH looks at KAFFEE and ROSS, then turns to the SERGEANT 
               AT ARMS.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Enter a plea of not guilty for the 
                         defendants. We'll adjourn until ten- 
                         hundred, three weeks from today, at 
                         which time this Court will reconvene 
                         as a General Court-Martial.

               He raps the gavel.

               RANDOLPH walks out. ROSS walks up the aisle without a word 
               to anyone. The M.P.'s come to escort DAWSON and DOWNEY back 
               to their cell.

               KAFFEE and JO and SAM are the only ones remaining. SAM is 
               looking at KAFFEE with question marks in his eyes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why does a junior grade with six 
                         months experience and a track record 
                         for plea bargaining get assigned a 
                         murder case?
                              (beat)
                         Would it be so that it never sees 
                         the inside of a courtroom?

               KAFFEE picks up his briefcase and begins heading toward the 
               door.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         We'll work out of my apartment.  
                         Every night, seven o'clock. Jo, before 
                         you come over tonight, pick up a 
                         carton of legal pads, a half-dozen 
                         boxes of red pens, a half-dozen boxes 
                         of black pens. Sam get a couple of 
                         desk lamps. I need you to start on a 
                         preliminary medical profile and Jo, 
                         we need all the fitness reports on 
                         Dawson, Downey and Santiago. The 
                         only thing I have to eat is Yoo-Hoo 
                         and SugarSnacks, so if you want 
                         anything else, bring it with you. 
                         Okay?

               Jo's still stunned.

                                     JO
                         Yeah.

               KAFFEE's at the door, stops, turns around, and takes it all 
               in for a moment.

                                     KAFFEE
                         So this is what a courtroom looks 
                         like.

               He walks out the door, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Among the stuff, is a blackboard that's been hung on the 
               wall. Written across the top are three headings:

                    INTENT             CODE RED             THE ORDER

               Sam is on the floor, sorting papers into piles. KAFFEE comes 
               in from the kitchen with a fresh bottle of Yoo-Hoo and joins 
               Sam on the floor.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Were you able to speak to your friend 
                         at NIS?

                                     SAM
                         She said if Markinson doesn't want 
                         to be found, we're not gonna find 
                         him. She said I could be Markinson 
                         and you wouldn't know it.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Are you Markinson?

                                     SAM
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Well, I'm not Markinson, that's two 
                         down.

               SAM doesn't laugh.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         What.

                                     SAM
                              (pause)
                         I was wondering, now that Joanne's 
                         working on this... I was wondering 
                         if you still need me.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         They were following an order, Sam.

                                     SAM
                         An illegal order.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You think Dawson and Downey know it 
                         was an illegal order?

                                     SAM
                         It doesn't matter if they know, any 
                         decent human being would've refused 
                         to --

                                     KAFFEE
                         They're not permitted to question 
                         orders.

                                     SAM
                         Then what's the secret? What are the 
                         magic words? I give orders every 
                         day, and nobody follows them.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We have softball games and marching 
                         bands. They work at a place where 
                         you have to wear camouflage or you 
                         might get shot.

               Sam looks away. He doesn't buy it.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing; pause)
                         I need you. You're better at research 
                         than I am and you know how to prepare 
                         a witness.

               Jo lets herself in. She's carrying a huge stack of papers 
               under one arm, and a large brown paper bag under the other.  
               But we stay with KAFFEE and Sam a moment longer.

                                     JO
                         I've got medical reports and Chinese 
                         food. I say we eat first.

               KAFFEE's still looking at SAM. SAM nods his head.

                                     SAM
                         Did you get any dumplings?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAFFEE'S APT. - LATER - NIGHT

               The remnants of the Chinese food is spread around. SAM and 
               JO are sitting and taking notes from KAFFEE. As he speaks, 
               he'll pace slowly around, carrying his baseball bat. He refers 
               to the blackboard.

                                     KAFFEE
                         This is our defense. Intent: No one 
                         can prove there was poison on the 
                         raq. Code Red: They're common and 
                         accepted in Guantanamo Bay. The Order:
                              (he writes)
                         A) Kendrick gave it. B) They had no 
                         choice but to follow it.
                              (beat)
                         That's it.

                                     SAM
                         What about motive?

                                     KAFFEE
                         We're a little weak on motive. They 
                         had one.

                                     JO
                         Just because a person has a motive 
                         doesn't mean --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Relax. We'll deal with the fenceline 
                         shooting when it comes up. For now 
                         we start here --
                              (pointing to INTENT)
                         I don't know what made Santiago die, 
                         I don't want to know. I just want to 
                         be able to show it could've been 
                         something other than poison. Jo, 
                         talk to doctors. Find out everything 
                         there is to know about lactic 
                         acidosis. Let's start prepping for 
                         Stone.

                                     JO
                         As long as we're on the subject of 
                         the doctor --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Here we go.

                                     JO
                         Listen to me, three o'clock he doesn't 
                         know what killed Santiago, then he 
                         meets with Jessep, and at five o'clock 
                         he says it was poison? The doctor's 
                         covering up the truth.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Oh, that's a relief. I was afraid I 
                         wouldn't be able to use the "Liar, 
                         Liar, Pants on Fire" defense. We 
                         can't prove coercion!! Alright, 
                         fitness reports and biographical 
                         information.

                         Cartons 3 and 4.

               KAFFEE looks at the cartons and the mind-numbing amount of 
               paper.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No Cliff-Notes on these things?

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT -

               SERIES OF SCENES

               The scenes cover the three weeks of preparation leading up 
               to the trial, and are interspersed with shots of Kaffee's 
               apartment getting messier, KAFFEE, JO and SAM flipping through 
               documents and reference books, writing on the blackboard, 
               dozzing off...

               We start with

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Jo's on the phone, KAFFEE and SAM are going over testimony, 
               with SAM sitting in a mock witness chair. During this, KAFFEE 
               will go to the door, pay the PIZZA Man for the pizza, and 
               return without missing a single beat.

                                     JO
                              (into phone)
                         Captain Hill, this is Lt. Commander 
                         Galloway, I'm an internal affairs

               Sam steps out the door. JO looks at the ground, then up at

                         I know what you're gonna say. You 
                         don't have to. We've had our 
                         differences. I've said some things I 
                         didn't mean, you've said some things 
                         you didn't means but you're happy 
                         that I stuck with the case. And if 
                         you've gained a certain respect for 
                         me over the last three weeks that 
                         you didn't have before, well, of 
                         course I'm happy about that, but we

                         out of it. You like me. I won't make 
                         you say it.

                         Bet your ass.

               Jo walks out the door and KAFFEE closes it and locks it behind 
               her.

               Then he says, very softly...

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         We're gonna get creamed.

               A few M.P.Is are standing by the entrance. KAFFEE comes around 
               the corner and heads toward the courtroom. We're immediately 
               stricken by something:

               In his dress blue uniform he could easily be mistaken for a 
               real live naval officer. He opens the courtroom doors and 
               walks into

               INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

               A few more M.P.'s are standing around. THE JURORS, nine 
               enlisted navy and marine men and women, are in their place, 
               Ross is at his table looking through some papers, and DAWSON 
               and DOWNEY, in handcuffs, are seated at the defense table. 
               The trial in a few moments from being underway and a few 
               people are milling about. KAFFEE walks down the aisle but is 
               stopped by a voice behind him.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         Lieutenant Kaffee?

               KAFFEE turns around to see a MAN and WOMAN who are clearly 
               Dawson's parents.

                                     MAN
                         You're gonna save our son, aren't 
                         you?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         I'll do my best.

               KAFFEE continues on and stops next to JO, who's talking with 
               a WOMAN in her mid-30's.

                                     JO
                         Danny, I want you to meet Ginny 
                         Miller, Louden's aunt.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You're Aunt Ginny?

                                     GINNY
                         Uh-huh.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm sorry, I was expecting someone  
                         older.

                                     GINNY
                         So was I.

               Not quite the words of inspiration KAFFEE was hoping to hear 
               before he does the hardest thing he's ever had to do.

               He walks over to ROSS.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Last chance. I'll flip you for it.

               RANDOLPH enters.

               KAFFEE walks back to his table as

               RANDOLPH raps the gavel.

               RANDOLPH without objection, the sworn confessions of the two 
               defendants have been read to the jury and entered into the 
               court record.

               ROSS walks to the jury box.

                              (continuing)
                         The facts of the case are this: At 
                         midnight on August 6th, the defendants 
                         went into the barracks room of their 
                         platoon-mate, PFC William Santiago.  
                         They woke him up, tied his arms and 
                         legs with rope, and forced a rag 
                         into his throat. A few minutes later, 
                         a chemical reaction in Santiago's 
                         body called lactic acidosis caused 
                         his lungs to begin bleeding. He 
                         drowned in his own blood and was 
                         pronounced dead at 32 minutes past 
                         midnight. These are the facts of the 
                         case. And they are undisputed. That's 
                         right. The story I just told you is 
                         the exact same story you're going to 
                         hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's 
                         the exact same story you're going to 
                         hear from Private Downey. Furthermore, 
                         the Government will also demonstrate 
                         that the defendants soaked the rag 
                         with poison, and entered Santiago's 
                         room with motive and intent to kill.
                              (beat)
                         Now, Lt. Kaffee, is gonna try to 
                         pull off a little magic act, he's 
                         gonna try a little misdirection. 
                         He's going to astonish you with 
                         stories of rituals and dazzle you 
                         with official sounding terms like 
                         Code Red. He might even cut into a 
                         few officers for you. He'll have no 
                         evidence, mind you, none. But it's 
                         gonna be entertaining. When we get 
                         to the end, all the magic in the 
                         world will not have been able to 
                         divert your attention from the fact 
                         that Willy Santiago is dead, and 
                         Dawson and Downey killed him. These 
                         are the facts of the case.
                              (beat)
                         And they are undisputed.

                         Lt. Kaffee?

               Before KAFFEE's even stood up, these words are coming out of 
               his mouth.

                                     KAFFEE
                         There was no poison on the rag and 
                         there was no intent to kill and any 
                         attempt to prove otherwise is futile 
                         because it just ain't true.
                              (beat)
                         When Dawson and Downey went into 
                         Santiago's room that night, it wasn't 
                         because of vengeance or hatred, it 
                         wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't 
                         because they were looking for kicks 
                         on a Friday night. It's because it 
                         was what they were ordered to do.
                              (beat)
                         Let me say that again: It's because 
                         it was what they were ordered to do. 
                         Now, out in the real world, that 
                         means nothing. And here at the 
                         Washington Navy Yard, it doesn't 
                         mean a whole lot more. But if you're 
                         a marine assigned to Rifle Security 
                         Company Windward, Guantanamo Bay, 
                         Cuba, and you're given an order, you 
                         follow it or you pack your bags.
                              (beat)
                         Make no mistake about it, Harold 
                         Dawson and Louden Downey are sitting 
                         before you in judgement today because 
                         they did their job.

               KAFFEE walks back to the table and takes his seat.

               DAWSON doesn't change his expression.

                         That a member of Private Santiago's

                         Yes. He claims to have been engaged 
                         in some manner by the enemy.

                         Corporal Dawson's been charged with 
                         a number of crimes, why wasn't he 
                         charged with firing at the enemy 
                         without cause?

                         There wasn't enough evidence to 
                         support such a charge.

                         you mean when you say there wasn't 
                         enough evidence to support such a 
                         charge. You had Willy Santiago's 
                         letter.

                         Santiago was the only witness, but I 
                         never had a chance to interview him. 
                         So I don't know what he saw.

                         want us to take matters into our own 
                         hands, sir.

                         Corporal Hammaker, were you in Dawson 
                         and Downey's barracks room ten minutes 
                         after this meeting?

                         Thanks, I have no more questions.

               HAMMAKER gets off the stand, and KAFFEE watches while walks 
               past DAWSON and DOWNEY. A barely perceptible exchange occurs 
               between the eyes of DAWSON and HAMMAKER.

               KAFFEE makes a decision.

                         explicit instructions of the platoon

                         testimony.

                         that all 23 witnesses will testify 
                         substantially as Corporal Hammaker 
                         did, if the Government is willing to

                         If the muscles and other cells of 
                         the body burn sugar instead of oxygen, 
                         lactic acid is produced. That lactic 
                         acid is what caused Santiago's lungs 
                         to bleed.

                         The witness is speculating.

                         Commander Stone is an expert medical 
                         witness, in this courtroom his opinion 
                         isn't considered speculation.

                         facts here are ultimately 
                         inconclusive.

                         A point which I'm confident you'll 
                         illustrate to the jury under cross- 
                         examination, so I'm sure you won't

                         There are literally dozens of toxins 
                         which are virtually undetectable, 
                         both in the human body and on a 
                         fabric. The nature of the acidosis 
                         is the compelling factor in this 
                         issue.

                         Commander, you testified that it 
                         takes lactic acidosis 20 to 30 minutes 
                         before it becomes lethal.

                         Yes.

                         Let me ask you, is it possible for a 
                         person to have an affliction, some 
                         sort of condition, which might, in 
                         the case of this person, actually 
                         speed up the process of acidosis 
                         dramatically?

               STONE says nothing for a moment.

                              (continuing)
                         Commander, is it possible?

                                     STONE
                         Certainly.

                         be?

                         If a person had a coronary disorder... 
                         or a cerebral disorder, the process 
                         would be more rapid.

                         Commander, if I had a coronary 
                         condition, and a perfectly clean rag 
                         was placed in my mouth, and the rag 
                         was accidentally pushed too far down, 
                         is it possible that my cells would 
                         continue burning sugar after the rag 
                         was taken out?

                         condition.

                         Is it possible to have a serious 
                         coronary condition, where the initial 
                         warning signals were so mild as to 
                         escape a physician during a routine

                         Santiago had a serious coronary 
                         condition, and it was that condition, 
                         and not some mysterious poison, that 
                         caused the accelerated chemical

                         physical examination every three 
                         months. And every three months Private

                         And that's why it had to be, poison,

                         Object. Move to strike.

                         Sustained. Strike it.

                         No more questions, judge.

               ROSS stands immediately.

                                     ROSS
                         Dr. Stone, you've held a license to 
                         practice medicine for 21 years, you 
                         are Board Certified in Internal 
                         Medicine, you are the Chief of 
                         Internal Medicine at a hospital which 
                         serves over 8000 men. In your 
                         professional opinion, was Willy 
                         Santiago poisoned?

               Jo stands.

                                     JO
                         Your Honor, we re-new our objection 
                         to Commander Stone's testimony, and 
                         ask that it be stricken from the 
                         record. And we further ask that the 
                         Court instruct the jury to lend no 
                         weight to this witness's testimony.

               KAFFEE and SAM are dying, but they're trying to keep their 
               poker-faces. RANDOLPH'S gonna try to be polite about this, 
               but he thought he made himself clear.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         The objection's overruled, counsel.

                                     JO
                         Sir, the defense strenuously objects 
                         and requests a meeting in chambers 
                         so that his honor might have an 
                         opportunity to hear discussion before 
                         ruling on the objection.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         The objection of the defense has 
                         been heard and overruled.

                                     JO
                         Exception.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Noted. The witness is an expert and 
                         the court will hear his opinion.

                                     ROSS
                         Doctor, in your expert, professional 
                         opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned?

                                     STONE
                         Yes.

                                     ROSS
                         Thank you, sir, I have no more 
                         questions.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Commander, you may step down.

                                     ROSS
                         Please the Court, while we reserve 
                         the right to call rebuttal witnesses 
                         if the need arises, the Government 
                         rests.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         We'll stand in recess until ten-
                         hundred hours this Monday, the l9th 
                         at which time the defense will call 
                         it's first witness.

               RANDOLPH raps his gavel.

                         Ten hut.

               And the courtroom begins clearing out. KAFFEE, JO and SAM 
               are packing up their various papers.

                                     SAM
                         I strenuously object? Is that how it 
                         works? Objection. Overruled. No, no, 
                         no, no, I strenuously object. Oh, 
                         well if you strenuously object, let 
                         me take a moment to reconsider.

                                     JO
                         I got it on the record.

                                     SAM
                         You also got it in the jury's head 
                         that we're afraid of the doctor. You 
                         object once so they can hear you say 
                         he's not a criminologist. You keep 
                         after it and it looks like this great 
                         cross we did was just a bunch of 
                         fancy lawyer tricks. It's the 
                         difference between paper law and 
                         trial --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sam --

                                     SAM
                         Christ, you even had the Judge saying 
                         Stone was an expert!

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sam, she made a mistake. Let's not 
                         relive it.

               There's an uncomfortable silence.

                                     SAM
                         I'm gonna go call my wife. I'll meet 
                         you tonight.

               Sam starts to leave. JO turns and says

                                     JO
                         Why do you hate them so much?

               Sam stops and turns around.

                                     SAM
                         They beat up on a weakling, and that's 
                         all they did. The rest is just 
                         smokefilled coffee-house crap. They 
                         tortured and tormented a weaker kid. 
                         They didn't like him. And they killed 
                         him. And why? Because he couldn't 
                         run very fast.

               A long silence. KAFFEE makes a decision.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Alright. Everybody take the night 
                         off.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         I apologize, I, --

                                     KAFFEE
                         It's alright. We've been working 20 
                         hour days for three and a half weeks 
                         straight. Take the night off. Go see 
                         your wife, see your daughter. Jo, do 
                         whatever it is you do when you're 
                         not here. What day is tomorrow?

                                     SAM
                         Saturday.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We'll start at ten.

               KAFFEE picks up his stuff and walks out.

               SAM and JO stand there uncomfortably for a moment. JO begins 
               packing up her things.

                                     SAM
                         Why do you like them so much?

                                     JO
                              (pause)
                         'Cause they stand on a wall.
                              (beat)
                         And they say "Nothing's gonna hurt 
                         you tonight. Not on my watch."

               Despite their differences, SAM likes this woman.

                                     SAM
                         Don't worry about the doctor. This 
                         trial starts Monday.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               A baseball game is on.

               KAFFEE's pacing slowly around, carrying his baseball bat. 
               He's looking at the blackboard as he walks around the room.

               He's studying it. Studying it hard. There's a knock on the 
               door. KAFFEE answers it. JO is standing in the doorway.

                                     JO
                         I'm sorry to bother you, I should've 
                         called first.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No, I was just watching a baseball 
                         game.

                                     JO
                         I was wondering if -- how you'd feel 
                         about my taking you to dinner tonight.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo, are you asking me out on a date?

                                     JO
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         It sounded like you were asking me 
                         out on a date.

                                     JO
                         I wasn't.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I've been asked out on dates before, 
                         and that's what it sounded like.

                                     JO
                         Do you like seafood? I know a good 
                         seafood place.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A SEAFOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               On the Virginia side of the Potomac. KAFFEE and JO are sitting 
               at a table, finishing up dinner.

                                     JO
                         My third case was a Drunk and 
                         Disorderly. The trial lasted nine 
                         weeks. I rounded up 31 people who 
                         were in the bar that night.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Nine weeks on a D and D? What was 
                         the prosecutor offering?

                                     JO
                         15 days.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         Well, you sure hustled the shit outta 
                         him.

                                     JO
                         After that, they moved me to internal 
                         affairs.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Tough to blame them.

                                     JO
                         Where I've earned two distinguished 
                         service medals and two letters of 
                         commendation.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why are you always giving me your 
                         resume?

                                     JO
                         Because I want you to think I'm good 
                         lawyer.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I do.

                                     JO
                         No you don't.
                              (beat)
                         I think you're an exceptional lawyer. 
                         I watch the jurors, they respond to 
                         you, they like you. I see you 
                         convincing them. I think Dawson and 
                         Downey are gonna end up owing their 
                         lives to you.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         Jo... I think you have to prepare 
                         yourself for the fact that we're 
                         gonna lose.
                              (beat)
                         Ross's opening speech, it was all 
                         true.
                              (beat)
                         I mean, let's pretend for a minute 
                         that it would actually matter to 
                         this jury that the guys were given 
                         an order. We can't prove it ever 
                         happened.
                              (beat)
                         We'll keep doing what we're doing, 
                         and we'll put on a show, but at the 
                         end of the day, all we have is the 
                         testimony of two people accused of 
                         murder.

                                     JO
                         We'll find Markinson.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo, we're gonna lose. And we're gonna 
                         lose huge.

               We HOLD on then for a moment, and in VOICE OVER hear

                                     HOWARD (V.O.)
                         Corporal Jeffrey Owen Howard, Marine 
                         Barracks Windward, Guantanamo Bay, 
                         Cuba.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CORPORAL HOWARD, the young marine who drove the lawyers around 
               Cuba, is on the stand.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Corporal Howard, name some reasons 
                         why a marine would get a code red?

                                     HOWARD
                         Being late for platoon or company 
                         meetings, keeping his barracks in 
                         disorder, falling back on a run...

                                     KAFFEE
                         Have you ever received a code red?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir. We were doing seven man 
                         assault drills, and my weapon slipped. 
                         It's just cause it was over a hundred 
                         degrees and my palms were sweaty and 
                         I'd forgot to use the resin like we 
                         were taught.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And what happened?

                                     HOWARD
                         That night the guys in my squad threw 
                         a blanket over me and took turns 
                         punching me in the arm for five 
                         minutes. Then they poured glue on my 
                         hands. And it worked, too, 'cause I 
                         ain't never dropped my weapon since.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Was Private Santiago ever late for 
                         platoon meetings?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Was his barracks ever in disorder?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did he ever fall back on a run?

                                     HOWARD
                         All the time, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did he ever, prior to the night of 
                         August 6th, receive a code red?

                                     HOWARD
                         No sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Never?

                                     HOWARD
                         No, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You got a code red 'cause your palms 
                         were sweaty. Why didn't Santiago, 
                         this burden to his unit, ever get 
                         one?

                                     HOWARD
                         Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Dawson wouldn't allow it.

                                     HOWARD
                         The guys talked tough about Santiago, 
                         but they wouldn't go near him. They 
                         were too afraid of Dawson, sir.

                                     ROSS
                         Object. The witness is characterizing.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll rephrase. Jeffrey, did you ever 
                         want to give Santiago a code red?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why didn't you?

                                     HOWARD
                         'Cause Dawson'd kick my butt, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Good enough. Lt. Ross is gonna ask 
                         you some questions now.

               ROSS takes three books out of his briefcase and puts them on 
               the table. He brings one to HOWARD.

                                     ROSS
                         Corporal Howard, I hold here The 
                         Marine Guide and General Information 
                         Handbook for New Recruits. Are you 
                         familiar with this book?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir.

                                     ROSS
                         Have you read it?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir.

                                     ROSS
                         Good.
                              (hands him the book)
                         Would you turn to the chapter that 
                         deals with code reds, please.

                                     HOWARD
                         Sir?

                                     ROSS
                         Just flip to the page in that book 
                         that discusses code reds.

                                     HOWARD
                         Sir, you see, Code Red is a term we 
                         use -- it's just used down at GITMO, 
                         sir. I don't know if it actually --

               ROSS has produced another book.

                                     ROSS
                         We're in luck, then. The Marine Corps 
                         Guide for Sentry Duty, NAVY BASE 
                         Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. I assume we'll 
                         find the term code red and its 
                         definition in this book, am I correct?

                                     HOWARD
                         No sir.

                                     ROSS
                         No? Corporal Howard, I'm a marine. 
                         Is their no book, no manual or 
                         pamphlet, no set of orders or 
                         regulations that let me know that, 
                         as a marine, one of my duties is to 
                         perform code reds?

                                     HOWARD
                              (pause)
                         No sir. No books, sir.

                                     ROSS
                         No further questions.

               ROSS sits. KAFFEE walks over to ROSS's table and picks up 
               one of the books. He brings it to HOWARD.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Corporal, would you turn to the page 
                         in this book that says where the 
                         enlisted men's mess hall is?

                                     HOWARD
                         Lt. Kaffee, that's not in the book, 
                         sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I don't understand, how did you know 
                         where the enlisted men's mess hall 
                         was if it's not in this book?

                                     HOWARD
                         I guess I just followed the crowd at 
                         chow time, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No more questions.

               KAFFEE chucks the book back on ROSS's desk.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Corporal Howard, you can step down.

                                     HOWARD
                              (greatly relieved)
                         Thank you, sir.

               KAFFEE gives HOWARD a subtle "You Did Good, Kid" look, and 
               we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DUSK

               It's the end of the day's session. KAFFEE walks down the 
               hall with SAM and JO.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Seven tonight, we'll do a final 
                         Kendrick review. I want to slam- 
                         dunk this guy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK STAND - NIGHT

               KAFFEE'S CAR

               as it drives along a street in the D.C. business district. 
               it's evening now and the windshield wipers are fighting 
               against a rain KAFFEE pulls over at his usual newsstand. He 
               hops out, leaving the lights flashing and the door open, and 
               runs to the stand.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Hey, Luther.

                         Admiral, how's the big case goin'?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Nose to the grindstone.

                         A rolling stone gathers no moss.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Ain't that the truth. Catch you 
                         tomorrow.

               He gets back in his car, tosses the newspaper on the passenger 
               seat, and turns on the ignition. And as soon as he does

               -- a hand is slapped over his mouth --

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's Matthew Markinson.

               -- and KAFFEE jumps out of his skin.

               Because sitting in the back seat, in civilian clothes, is 
               MARKINSON.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jesus fucking Christ!!--

                                     MARKINSON
                         You left the door unlocked.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Scared the shit outta me.

                                     MARKINSON
                         Drive.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Are you aware you're under subpoena?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Yes. I'm also aware that the lives 
                         of two marines are in your hands. If 
                         there was something I could do about 
                         that, I would, but since I can't, 
                         all I can do is help you. Why don't 
                         you drive, Lieutenant.

               KAFFEE begins driving down the street.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What do you know?

                                     MARKINSON
                         I know everything.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Was it a code red?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did Kendrick give the order?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did you witness it?

                                     MARKINSON
                         I didn't need to --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did you witness it?!

                                     MARKINSON
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Then how do you know?

                                     MARKINSON
                         I know.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You know shit.

                                     MARKINSON
                         He was never gonna be transferred 
                         off the base.

               And with this, KAFFEE screeches the car over to the side of 
               the road. He grabs the parking brake and pulls it up. He 
               turns to Markinson.

                                     MARKINSON
                              (continuing)
                         Jessep was going to keep him on the 
                         base. He said he wanted him trained.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We've got the transfer order. It's 
                         got your signature.

                                     MARKINSON
                         I know. I signed it the morning you 
                         arrived in Cuba. Six days after 
                         Santiago died.

               KAFFEE's wheels are spinning. He's pumped.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm gonna get you a deal. Some kind 
                         of immunity with the prosecutor. In 
                         about four days, you're gonna appear 
                         as a witness for the defense, and 
                         you're gonna tell the court exactly 
                         what you told me. Right now I'm gonna 
                         check you into a motel, and we're 
                         gonna start from the beginning.

                                     MARKINSON
                         I don't want a deal. And I don't 
                         want immunity.

               KAFFEE shakes his head and laughs.

                                     MARKINSON
                              (continuing)
                         I want you to know, I'm proud neither 
                         of what I've done nor what I'm doing.

               KAFFEE puts the car in gear and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Where KAFFEE has just finished telling his story to an amazed 
               SAM and JO.

               There's silence.

               Then JO has a total adrenaline rush.

                                     JO
                         Where is he?

                                     KAFFEE
                         The Route 23 Best Western.

               JO picks up the phone.

                                     JO
                         I want him guarded.

                                     KAFFEE
                         That's probably a good idea.

                                     JO
                              (into phone)
                         This is Lt. Commander Joanne Galloway. 
                         My clearance code is 411273.

               KAFFEE is impressed. He turns to SAM --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Clearance code?

                                     JO
                         Thank you.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to SAM)
                         I don't have a clearance code. Do 
                         you have a --

                                     JO
                              (into phone)
                         It's Jo Galloway. I need to secure a 
                         witness.

               Jo continues giving information to the person on the phone, 
               while Kaffee keeps talking to the both of them. Sam is writing 
               down notes as fast as he can.

                                     KAFFEE
                         He also said that Jessep's lying 
                         about the transportation off the 
                         base. Jessep said six the next morning 
                         was the first flight Santiago could've 
                         left on, Markinson says there was a 
                         plane that left seven hours earlier.

               JO hangs up the phone.

                                     JO
                         Damn.

                                     KAFFEE
                         That was impressive. Did you hear 
                         what I just said about the flight?

                                     JO
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sam, when a plane takes off from a 
                         base, there's gotta be some kind of 
                         record kept, right?

                                     SAM
                         We need the Tower Chief's Log for 
                         GITMO.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to SAM)
                         Get it.

                                     JO
                         We're gonna win.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo, don't get crazy about this. We 
                         don't know who Markinson is. We don't 
                         know what the log book's gonna say. 
                         You just concentrate on Downey. I'm 
                         gonna talk to Ross and tell him where 
                         we are.

                                     JO
                              (sing-song)
                         "Kaffee's got his case now, Kaffee's 
                         got his case now."

                                     KAFFEE
                         You are like seven of the strangest 
                         women I have ever met.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A WASHINGTON SALOON - NIGHT

               A WAITRESS sets two drinks down in front of KAFFEE and ROSS, 
               who are sitting across from each other in a booth in the 
               back.

                                     ROSS
                         That was nice work today. The redirect 
                         on Howard.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I have Markinson.

               ROSS only takes a moment digest this.

                                     ROSS
                         Where is he?

                                     KAFFEE
                         A motel room in Arlington with 14 
                         Federal Marshals outside his door.  
                         Take a sip of your drink.

                                     ROSS
                         Damn.

                                     KAFFEE
                         The transfer order that Parkinson 
                         signed is phoney. And Jessep's 
                         statement that the six a.m. flight 
                         was the first available is a lie, 
                         we're checking the tower chief's 
                         log. But in the meantime I'm gonna 
                         put the Apostle Jon Kendrick on the 
                         stand and see if we can't have a 
                         little fun.

               ROSS takes another sip of his drink, then lays it on the 
               line for Kaffee..

                                     ROSS
                         I have an obligation to tell you 
                         that if you accuse Kendrick or Jessep 
                         of any crime without proper evidence, 
                         you'll be subject to Court-Martial 
                         for professional misconduct. And 
                         that's something that'll be stapled 
                         to every job application you ever 
                         fill out. Markinson's not gonna hold 
                         up, he's a crazy man. I'm not saying 
                         this to intimidate you. I'm being 
                         your lawyer.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thanks, Jack. And I wanna tell you 
                         that I think the whole fuckin' bunch 
                         of you are certifiably insane. And 
                         this code of honor of yours makes me 
                         wanna beat the shit outta something.

                                     ROSS
                         Don't you dare lump me in with Jessep 
                         and Markinson and Kendrick because 
                         we wear the same uniform. I'm your 
                         friend, Danny, and I'm telling you, 
                         I don't think your clients belong in 
                         jail. But I don't get to make that 
                         decision. I represent the Government 
                         of the United States. Without passion 
                         or prejudice. And my client has a 
                         case.
                              (pause)
                         I want you to acknowledge that the 
                         judge advocate has made you aware of 
                         the possible consequences involved 
                         in accusing a marine officer of a 
                         felony without proper evidence.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I've been so advised.

               ROSS stands up and heaves a few dollars on the table.

                                     ROSS
                         You got bullied into that courtroom, 
                         Danny. By everyone. By Dawson, by 
                         Galloway, shit, I practically dared 
                         you. Not for a second have you 
                         believed you could win. You got 
                         bullied into that room by the memory 
                         of a dead lawyer.

                         You're a lousy softball player, Jack.

                                     ROSS
                         Your boys are going down. I can't 
                         stop it anymore.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

               People are filing in. KENDRICK is standing at the entrance 
               to the courtroom. KAFFEE glides past him...

                                     KAFFEE
                         Batter up, J.J.

               KENDRICK watches this impudent thing walk into the courtroom 
               as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

               KENDRICK's on the stand. What drives Kaffee's entire 
               examination of Kendrick is this: Kaffee's got him. He's gonna 
               win. At least this round. All he has to do is not let his 
               emotions take control of his professional skill.

               SAM will have files and documents ready to hand Kaffee as he 
               needs them.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Lt. Kendrick, in your opinion, was 
                         Private Santiago a good marine?

                         I'd say he was about average.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Lieutenant, you signed three fitness 
                         reports on Santiago. On all three 
                         reports you indicated a rating of 
                         Below Average.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes. Private Santiago was Below 
                         Average I didn't see the need in 
                         trampling on a man's grave.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We appreciate that, but you're under 
                         oath now, and I think unpleasant as 
                         it may be, we'd all just as soon 
                         hear the truth.

                                     KENDRICK
                         I'm aware of my oath.

                         Lieutenant, these are the last three 
                         fitness reports you signed for Lance 
                         Corporal Dawson and PFC Downey. Downey 
                         received three straight marks of 
                         Exceptional. Dawson received two 
                         marks of Exceptional, but on this 
                         most recent report, dated June 9th 
                         of this year, he received a rating 
                         of Below Average. It's this last 
                         report that I'd like to discuss for 
                         a moment.

                                     KENDRICK
                         That's fine.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Lance Corporal Dawson's ranking after 
                         Infantry Training School was perfect. 
                         Records indicate that over half that 
                         class has since been promoted to 
                         full corporal, while Dawson has 
                         remained a lance corporal. Was 
                         Dawson's promotion held up because 
                         of this last fitness report.

                                     KENDRICK
                         I'm sure it was.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Do you recall why Dawson was given 
                         such a poor grade on this report?

                                     KENDRICK
                         I'm sure I don't. I have many men in 
                         my charge, Lieutenant, I write many 
                         fitness reports.

                         Do you recall an incident involving 
                         a PFC Curtis Barnes who'd been found 
                         stealing liquor from the Officer's 
                         Club?

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did you report private Barnes to the 
                         proper authorities?

                                     KENDRICK
                         I have two books at my bedside, 
                         Lieutenant, the Marine Code of Conduct 
                         and the King James Bible. The only 
                         proper authorities I'm aware of are 
                         my Commanding Officer, Colonel Nathan

                         have the record reflect your lack of 
                         acknowledgment of this court as a 
                         proper authority.

                         Did you report Private Barnes to

                                     KENDRICK
                         I remember thinking very highly of 
                         Private Barnes, and not wanting to 
                         see his record tarnished by a formal 
                         charge.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You preferred it to be handled within 
                         the unit.

                                     KENDRICK
                         I most certainly did.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Lieutenant, do you know what a Code 
                         Red is?

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes I do.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Have you ever ordered a code red?

                                     KENDRICK
                         No, I have not.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Lieutenant, did you order Dawson and 
                         two other men to make sure that 
                         Private Barnes receive no food or 
                         drink except water for a period of 
                         seven days?

                                     KENDRICK
                         That's a distortion of the truth. 
                         Private Barnes was placed on barracks 
                         restriction. He was given water and 
                         vitamin supplements, and I assure 
                         you that at no time was his health 
                         in danger.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm sure it was lovely for Private 
                         Barnes, but you did order the barracks 
                         restriction, didn't you? And you did 
                         order the denial of food.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Wouldn't this form of discipline be 
                         considered a code red?

                                     KENDRICK

                         Guantanamo Bay to testify, would 
                         they consider it a Code Red?

                         possibly testify as to what 8000 
                         other men would say. We object to 
                         this entire line of questioning as

                         report because you learned held been

                         Corporal Dawson was found to be Below

                         Dawson brought a hungry guy some 
                         food. What crime did he commit?

                                     KENDRICK
                         He disobeyed an order.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And because he did, because he 
                         exercised his own set of values, 
                         because he made a decision about the 
                         welfare of a marine that was in 
                         conflict with an order of yours, he 
                         was punished, is that right?

                                     KENDRICK
                         Corporal Dawson disobeyed an order.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah, but it wasn't a order, was it? 
                         After all, it's peacetime. He wasn't 
                         being asked to secure a hill... or 
                         advance on a beachhead. I mean, surely 
                         a marine of Dawson's intelligence 
                         can be trusted to determine on his 
                         own, which are the really important 
                         orders, and which orders might, say, 
                         be morally questionable.

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               JO and KAFFEE. KAFFEE's pumped and shooting baskets as Sam 
               walks in with some bound papers under his arm.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What's the word?

                                     SAM
                         This is the tower chief's log for 
                         that night. Jessep was telling the 
                         truth. The six a.m. flight was the 
                         first plane out.

               KAFFEE lets the ball drop out of his hands.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Let me see that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A MOTEL - NIGHT

               A SEDAN, with U.S. MARSHALL stenciled on the door, sits in 
               front of one of the rooms, and the two FEDERAL AGENTS inside 
               the car are reading the newspaper as KAFFEE'S CAR pulls next 
               to them and KAFFEE jumps out.

               AGENT #1 sticks his head out the window and calls to KAFFEE --

                                     AGENT #1
                         Workin' late, lieutenant?

               KAFFEE pays no attention and bangs on MARKINSON's door. The 
               door opens and KAFFEE walks into

               INT. MOTEL ROOM

               HE tosses the log book on the table.

                                     KAFFEE
                         There was no flight out at eleven 
                         o'clock. What the fuck are you trying 
                         to pull?

                                     MARKINSON
                         The first flight stateside left 
                         Guantanamo Bay at eleven and arrived 
                         at Andrews Airforce Base, Maryland, 
                         at a few minutes past two.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Then why the hell isn't it listed in 
                         the Tower Chief's log?!

                                     MARKINSON
                         Why the hell did you think it would 
                         be?!!

               KAFFEE is silent. And now it begins to sink in.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What are you telling me?
                              (beat)
                         He fixed the log book?

               Setback. Big setback.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Well, maybe he can make it so a plane 
                         didn't take off, but I can sure as 
                         hall prove that one landed. I'll get 
                         the log book from Andrews.

               MARKINSON says nothing. But his face says that KAFFEE was 
               born yesterday.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing; beat)
                         He made an entire flight disappear?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Nathan Jessep is about to be named 
                         Director of Operations for the 
                         National Security Council. You don't 
                         get to that position without knowing 
                         how to side-step a few land mines.
                              (beat)
                         And putting me on the stand isn't 
                         gonna make him step on one.

               KAFFEE stares at him.

               Then shakes his head, sighs, and picks the log book up off 
               the table, and heads for the door.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You're taking the stand. Thursday.

               KAFFEE leaves.

               HOLD on MARKINSON.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KAFFEE'S APARTMENT later that night and SAM and J0 have just 
               heard the report him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         There's gotta be someone who can 
                         testify to the flight. A ground crew 
                         member. Someone.

                                     SAM
                         Do you have any idea how many planes 
                         take off and land every day? A kid 
                         from the ground crew isn't gonna 
                         remember a flight that landed four 
                         weeks ago.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Forget the flight. We'll put Markinson 
                         on the stand and we'll deal with 
                         Jessep's refusal to transfer Santiago 
                         and he'll testify to the forged 
                         transfer order. That'll be enough. 
                         That and Downey's testimony really 
                         oughta be enough.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Private Downey, why did you go into 
                         Santiago's room on the night of the 
                         6th?

                         To give Private Santiago a Code Red, 
                         ma'am.

                                     JO
                         And why did you give him a Code Red?

                                     DOWNEY
                         I was ordered to give him a Code Red 
                         by the Executive officer for Rifle

                         I was William's company commander.  
                         I knew your son vaguely, which is to 
                         say I knew his name...

               And while we continue to HEAR Markinson's voice writing the 
               letter, we begin a SERIES OF SHOTS: MARKINSON is getting 
               into his class A dress uniform, complete with medals, side 
               arm, and military dress sabre.

                                     MARKINSON (V.O.)
                         In a matter of time, the trial of 
                         the two man charged with your son's 
                         death will be concluded, and seven 
                         men and two women whom you've never 
                         met will try to offer you an 
                         explanation as to why William is 
                         dead. For my part, I've done as much 
                         as I can to bring the truth to light.

               MARKINSON is finished dressing. He stands in the middle of 
               the motel room.

                                     MARKINSON (V.O.)
                              (continuing)
                         And the truth is this: your son is 
                         dead for only one reason. I wasn't 
                         strong enough to stop it.

               MARKINSON takes a pistol out of his holster and cocks the 
               trigger.

                         the switch log has you down at Post

                         It's a ways, sir, it's a hike.

                                     ROSS
                         About how far by jeep?

                                     DOWNEY
                         About ten, fifteen minutes, sir.

                                     ROSS
                         Have you ever had to walk it?

                                     DOWNEY
                         Yes sir. That day, sir. Friday. The 
                         Pick-up Private -- sir, that's what 
                         we call the fella who drops us at 
                         our posts and picks us up... also, 
                         'cause he can get girls in New York 
                         City -- the Pick-up Private got a 
                         flat...

               At the defense table, KAFFEE, poker-faced, scribbles something 
               down on a piece of paper and slides it to JO. JO looks at 
               it:

               "Where's he going with this?" JO scribbles "?" And hands it 
               back to KAFFEE.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (continuing)
                         ...Right at 39. He pulled up and 
                         blam! ...A blowout-with no spare. 
                         The two of us had to double-time it 
                         back to the barracks.

                                     ROSS
                         And if it's ten or fifteen minutes 
                         by jeep, I'm guessing it must be a 
                         good hour by foot, am I right?

                                     DOWNEY
                         Pick-up and me did it in 45 flat, 
                         sir.

                                     ROSS
                         Not bad. Now you say your assault on 
                         Private Santiago was the result of 
                         an order that Lt. Kendrick gave in 
                         your barracks room at 16:20.

               KAFFEE knows what's coming. There's nothing he can do about 
               it. And he can't lose his cool in front of the jury.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Yes sir.

               JO. Helpless. Panicked.

                                     ROSS
                         But you just said that you didn't 
                         make it back to Windward Barracks 
                         until 16:45.

               DOWNEY's confused. These are questions he hasn't been asked 
               before.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Sir?

                                     ROSS
                         If you didn't make it back to your 
                         barracks until 16:45, then how could 
                         you be in your room at 16:20?

                                     DOWNEY
                              (pause)
                         You see sir, there was a flat tire.

                                     ROSS
                         Private, did you ever actually hear 
                         Lt. Kendrick order a Code Red?

               KAFFEE's world is falling down around him, and there's nothing 
               he can do about it. And he knows it.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (pause)
                         No, sir.

               Jo leaps to her feet.

                                     JO
                         Please the court, I'd like to request 
                         a recess in order to confer with my 
                         client.

                                     ROSS
                         Why did you go into Santiago's room?

                                     JO
                         The witness has rights.

                                     ROSS
                         The witness has been read his rights, 
                         commander.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (confused)
                         Hal?

                                     RANDOLPH
                         The question will be repeated.

                                     ROSS
                         Why did you go into Santiago's room?

                                     JO
                         Your honor --

                                     DOWNEY
                         Hal?

                                     ROSS
                         Did Corporal Dawson tell you to do 
                         it?

               Everyone is frozen.

                                     ROSS
                              (continuing)
                         He did, didn't he? Dawson told you 
                         to give Santiago a code red.

               DOWNEY looks at DAWSON.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Hal?

                                     ROSS
                         Don't look at him.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Hal?

                                     DAWSON
                         Private. Answer the Lieutenant's 
                         question.

               The room is still silent. DOWNEY does something we've never 
               seen him do before. He straightens himself up and says this 
               with the pride of a man who believes he's done the right 
               thing.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Yes, Lieutenant. I was given an order 
                         by my squad leader, Lance Corporal 
                         Harold W. Dawson of the U.S. Marine 
                         Corps. And I followed it.

               ROSS let's it hang. He looks over at KAFFEE. KAFFEE won't 
               meet his eyes.

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               JO and SAM are sitting in silence. It's dark outside.

                                     JO
                         Where do you think he is?

               SAM doesn't know. JO is beside herself, and trying to keep 
               it together.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         As far as Downey was concerned, it 
                         was an order from Kendrick. It didn't 
                         matter that he didn't hear it first 
                         hand. He doesn't distinguish between 
                         the two.

               SAM understands, but he doesn't say anything. The door opens 
               and KAFFEE walks in.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         Danny. I'm sorry.

               KAFFEE seems to be in an incredibly normal mood.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Don't worry about it.

                                     JO
                         Sam and I were just talking about 
                         how all we really have to do is call 
                         some witnesses who'll talk about 
                         implied orders... or maybe we put 
                         Downey back on the stand before we 
                         get to Dawson.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Maybe if we work at it we can get 
                         Dawson charged with the Kennedy 
                         assassination.

               JO studies KAFFEE for a moment.

                                     JO
                         Are you drunk?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (a simple answer)
                         Pretty much. Yeah.

                                     JO
                              (pause)
                         I'll make a pot of coffee. We have a 
                         long night's work ahead.

                                     KAFFEE
                         She's gonna make coffee. That's nice.
                              (beat)
                         He wasn't in his room.
                              (Kaffee's amazed)
                         He wasn't even there.
                              (beat)
                         That was an important piece of 
                         information, don't you think?

                                     JO
                              (pause)
                         Danny, it was just a setback. I'm 
                         sorry. But we'll fix it and then 
                         move on to Markinson.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Markinson's dead.

               JO and SAM are frozen.

               KAFFEE says this with no particular feeling one way or the 
               other.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         You really gotta hand it to those 
                         Federal Marshals, boy.
                              (he almost has to 
                              laugh)
                         It's not like he hanged himself by 
                         his shoelaces or slashed his wrists 
                         with a concealed butter knife. This 
                         guy got, into full dress uniform, 
                         stood in the middle of that room, 
                         drew a nickle plated pistol from his 
                         holster, and fired a bullet into his 
                         mouth.

               Jo and SAM don't say anything.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Anyway, since we seem to be out of 
                         witnesses, I thought I'd drink a 
                         little.

                                     JO
                         I still think we can win.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Then maybe you should drink a little.

                                     JO
                         Look, we'll go to Randolph in the 
                         morning and make a motion for a 
                         continuance. 24 hours.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Why would we want to do that?

                                     JO
                         To subpoena Colonel Jessep.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What?

                                     JO
                         Listen for a second --

                                     KAFFEE
                         No.

                                     JO
                         Just hear me out --

                                     KAFFEE
                         No. I won't listen to you and I won't 
                         hear you out. Your passion is 
                         comforting, Jo. It's also useless. 
                         Private Downey needed a trial lawyer 
                         today.

                                     JO
                              (pause)
                         You chicken-shit. You're gonna use 
                         what happened today as an excuse to 
                         give up.

                                     KAFFEE
                         It's over!

                                     JO
                         Why did you ask Jessep for the 
                         transfer order?

                                     KAFFEE
                         What are you --

                                     JO
                         In Cuba. Why did you ask Jessep for 
                         the transfer order?

                                     KAFFEE
                         What does it matter --

                                     JO
                         Why?!

                                     KAFFEE
                         I wanted the damn transfer order!

                                     JO
                         Bullshit! You could've gotten it by 
                         picking up the phone and calling any 
                         one of a dozen departments at the 
                         Pentagon. You didn't want the transfer 
                         order. You wanted to see Jessep's 
                         reaction when you asked for the 
                         transfer order. You had an instinct. 
                         And it was confirmed by Markinson. 
                         Now damnit, let's put Jessep on the 
                         stand and end this thing!

                                     KAFFEE
                         What possible good could come from 
                         putting Jessep on the stand?

                                     JO
                         He told Kendrick to order the Code 
                         Red.

                                     KAFFEE
                         He did?! Why didn't you say so!? 
                         That's qreat! And of course you have 
                         proof of that.

                                     JO
                         I --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Ah, I keep forgetting: You were sick 
                         the day they taught law at law school.

                                     JO
                         You put him on the stand and you get 
                         it from him!

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes. No problem. We get it from him.
                              (to SAM)
                         Colonel, isn't it true that you 
                         ordered the Code Red on Santiago?

                                     SAM
                         Look, we're all a little --

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm sorry, your time's run out. What 
                         do we have for the losers, Judge? 
                         Well, for our defendants it's a 
                         lifetime at exotic Fort Levenworth. 
                         And for defense counsel Kaffee? That's 
                         right -- it's -- a court -- martial. 
                         Yes, Johnny, after falsely accusing 
                         a marine officer of conspiracy, Lt.  
                         Kaffee will have a long and prosperous 
                         career teaching typewriter maintenance 
                         at the Rocco Columbo School for Women.  
                         Thank you for playing "Should We or 
                         Should-We-Not Follow the Advice of

               And with one motion, he knocks everything from his desk. A 
               ton of papers, books, files, etc., falls to the floor.

               There's dead silence. Maybe just the sound of KAFFEE breathing 
               after this exhausting outburst.

               Finally...

                                     JO
                         I'm sorry I lost you your set of 
                         steak knives.

               Jo picks up her purse and coat and walks out. The door slams 
               behind her.

               KAFFEE walks into the kitchen without a word.

               SAM gets down on the floor and begins picking up all the 
               stuff that Kaffee knocked off the desk.

               KAFFEE comes back in with a bottle of Jack Daniels.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Stop cleaning up.

               But Sam continues.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Sam. Stop cleaning up.

               SAM stops and sits in a chair. KAFFEE sits on the couch.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         You want a drink?

                                     SAM
                         Yeah.

               SAM takes a swig from the bottle.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Is your father proud of you?

                                     SAM
                         Don't do this to yourself.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll bet he is. I'll bet he bores 
                         the shit outta the neighbors and the 
                         relatives. "Sam, made Law Review.  
                         He's got a big case he's making -- 
                         He's arguing making an argument."
                              (pause)
                         I think my father would've enjoyed 
                         seeing me graduate from law school.
                              (beat)
                         I think he would've liked that... an 
                         awful lot.

                                     SAM
                         Did I ever tell you that I wrote a 
                         paper on your father in college?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah?

                                     SAM
                         He was one of the best trial lawyers 
                         ever.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes he was.

                                     SAM
                         And if I were Dawson and Downey and 
                         I had a choice between you or your 
                         father to represent me in this case, 
                         I'd take you any day of the week and 
                         twice on Sunday. You should have 
                         seen yourself thunder away at 
                         Kendrick.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Would you put Jessep on the stand?

                                     SAM
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You think my father would've?

                                     SAM
                         With the evidence we've got? Not in 
                         a million years. But here's the thing --
                         and there's really no way of getting 
                         around this -- neither Lionel Kaffee 
                         nor Sam Weinberg are lead counsel 
                         for the defense in the matter of 
                         U.S. versus Dawson and Downey. So 
                         there's only one question. What would 
                         you do?

               We HOLD on the two of them for a moment, then

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

               JO is walking through the night at a brisk pace. She's doing 
               her best not to fall apart.

               TWO HEADLIGHTS appear coming down the street, and KAFFEE's 
               CAR, with SAM driving and KAFFEE riding shotgun, slows down 
               alongside JO. KAFFEE rolls down his window.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Joanne.

               JO ignores them and keeps walking. The car crawls along with 
               her.

               JO starts walking faster.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Jo, we look ridiculous.
                              (to SAM)
                         Stop the car.

               KAFFEE hops out and calls --

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Joanne.

               JO keeps walking.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         I apologize. I was angry and... I'm 
                         sorry about what I said.

               But JO'S still walking.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing; calling)
                         I'm gonna put Jessep on the stand.

               She stops. She turns around.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - LATER - AFTERNOON

               A nerf ball bounces off the wall.

               KAFFEE, JO and SAM are sprawled out in the living room. For 
               hours now they've been trying to come up with an idea.  
               KAFFEE's mind seems to be on his basketball game.

                                     JO
                         I say we hit him with the phoney 
                         transfer order.

                                     SAM
                         What's the transfer order without a 
                         witness?

                                     KAFFEE
                         We have a witness.

                                     SAM
                         A dead witness.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And in the hands of a lesser attorney, 
                         that'd be a problem.

                                     SAM
                         Look at this. Last night he was 
                         swimming in his Jack Daniels, now he 
                         can leap tall buildings in a single 
                         bound.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm getting my second wind. Siddown. 
                         Both of you.

               He sees that SAM and JO were already sitting down.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Good.
                              (beat)
                         Jessep told Kendrick to order a code 
                         red. Kendrick did, and our clients 
                         followed the order. The cover-up 
                         isn't our case. To win, Jessep has 
                         to tell the jury that he ordered the 
                         code red.

                                     SAM
                         And you think you can got him to 
                         just say it?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I think he wants to say it. I think 
                         he's pissed off that he's gotta hide 
                         from us. I think he wants to say 
                         that he made a command decision and 
                         that's the end of it. He eats 
                         breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 
                         Cubans who are trained to kill him, 
                         and no one's gonna tell him how to 
                         run his base. Least of all the pushy 
                         broad, the smart Jew, and the Harvard 
                         clown. I need to shake him and put 
                         him on the defensive.

               SAM and JO are silent for a moment.

                                     SAM
                         That's it? That's the plan?

                                     KAFFEE
                         That's the plan.

                                     SAM
                         You're gonna trip Jessep and he's 
                         gonna confess.

                         I'm not gonna trip him. I'm gonna 
                         lead him right where he's dying to 
                         go.

                                     SAM
                         And how are you gonna do that?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I have no idea. I need my bat.

                                     JO
                         What?

                              (looking around)
                         I need my bat. I think better with 
                         my bat. Where's my bat?

                                     JO
                         I put it in the closet.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You put it in the closet.

               KAFFEE heads to the closet.

                                     JO
                         I was tripping over it.

                                     KAFFEE (O.S.)
                         Don't ever put a bat in a closet.

                                     JO
                         He thinks better with his bat?

               And we go to KAFFEE AT THE CLOSET.

               OFFSCREEN WE HEAR

                         I can understand that. I used to 
                         have stuffed panda named Mr. Boob. I 
                         could never do my home work without 
                         him.

               During this, KAFFEE's opened the closet door. He reaches in 
               to grab his bat when all of a sudden he notices something:

               His clothes.

               His uniforms and his civilian clothes. Hanging neatly along 
               the bar. He stares at this a moment, then suddenly heads 
               back through the living room towards the front door.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Stay here, I'm going to the office 
                         for a while.

               KAFFEE storms out.

                                     SAM
                         Boy, he does think better with that 
                         bat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KAFFEE is looking over the computer printout. From what we 
               can tell, it resembles a large, military coded phone bill.

               KAFFEE picks up the phone and dials.

                         had a meeting with your two senior

                         I'm implying simply that, at present, 
                         Captain Markinson is not alive.

                                     ROSS
                         Surely Colonel Jessep doesn't need 
                         to appear in this courtroom to confirm 
                         that information.

                         I just wasn't sure if the witness 
                         was aware that two days ago, Captain 
                         Markinson took his own life with a 
                         .45 caliber pistol.

               And from the back of the room, SAM enters. He's escorting 
               two young AIRMEN in Airforce dress uniforms. SAM shows the 
               AIRMEN to a seat near the front, and takes his place at the 
               defense table.

               Over this we HEAR --

                         The witness is aware, the Court is 
                         aware, and now the jury is aware. We

                         attention. Move on Lieutenant.

               SAM scribbles something on a piece of paper, KAFFEE walks 
               over, looks at the paper on which are wrttten two names: 
               Cecil O'Malley and Anthony Perez, then turns back to RANDOLPH.

                         Yes sir. Colonel, at the time of 
                         this meeting, you gave Lt. Kendrick 
                         an order, is that right?

                         I told Kendrick to tell his men that 
                         Santiago wasn't to be touched.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And did you give an order to Captain 
                         Markinson as well?

                                     JESSEP
                         I ordered Markinson to have Santiago 
                         transferred off the base immediately.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why?

                                     JESSEP
                         I felt that his life might be in 
                         danger once word of the letter got 
                         out.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Grave danger?

                                     JESSEP
                         Is there another kind?

               KAFFEE holds up a document from his table.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We have the transfer order that you 
                         and Markinson co-signed, ordering 
                         that Santiago be lifted on a flight 
                         leaving Guantanamo at six the next 
                         morning. Was that the first flight 
                         off the bass?

                                     JESSEP
                         The six a.m. flight was the first 
                         flight off the base.

               KAFFEE nods and decides to move on.

               JESSEP steals a quick glance at the two AIRMEN sitting out 
               in the courtroom.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel, you flew up to Washington 
                         early this morning, is that right?

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I notice you're wearing your Class A 
                         appearance in dress uniform for court 
                         today.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         As are you, Lieutenant.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did you wear that uniform on the 
                         plane?

                                     ROSS
                         Please the Court, is this dialogue 
                         relevant to anything in particular?

                                     KAFFEE
                         The defense didn't have an opportunity 
                         to depose this witness, your honor.  
                         I'd ask the Court for a little 
                         latitude.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         A very little latitude.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel?

                                     JESSEP
                         I wore fatigues on the plane.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And you brought your dress uniform 
                         with you.

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And a toothbrush? A shaving kit? 
                         Change of underwear?

                                     ROSS
                         Your honor.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to ROSS)
                         Is the Colonel's underwear a matter 
                         of national security?

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Gentlemen.
                              (to KAFFEE)
                         You better get somewhere fast with 
                         this, Lieutenant.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes sir. Colonel?

                                     JESSEP
                         I brought a change of clothes and 
                         some personal items.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thank you.

               KAFFEE gets a document from his table.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         After Dawson and Downey's arrest on 
                         the night of the sixth, Santiago's 
                         barracks room was sealed off and its 
                         contents inventoried.
                              (reading)
                         Pairs of camouflage pants, 6

                         1 pair of brown shoes, 1 pair of 
                         tennis shoes, 8 khaki tee-shirts, 2 
                         belts, 1 sweater --

                                     ROSS
                         Please the Court, is there a question 
                         anywhere in our future?

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Lt. Kaffee, I have to --

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm wondering why Santiago wasn't 
                         packed.

               That landed. On the JURY, RANDOLPH, ROSS...

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         I'll tell you what, we'll get back 
                         to that one in a minute.

               JO hands KAFFEE the computer printout.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         This is a record of all telephone 
                         calls made from your base in the 
                         past 24 hours. After being subpoenaed 
                         to Washington, you made three calls.

               Handing Jessep the printout --

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         I've highlighted those calls in 
                         yellow. Do you recognize those 
                         numbers?

                                     JESSEP
                         I called Colonel Fitzhuqhes in 
                         Quantico, Va. I wanted to let him 
                         know I'd be in town. The second call 
                         was to set up a meeting with 
                         Congressman Ramond of the House Armed 
                         Services Committee, and the third 
                         call was to my sister Elizabeth.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why did you make that call, sir?

                                     JESSEP
                         I thought she might like to have 
                         dinner tonight.

                                     ROSS
                         Judge --

                                     RANDOLPH
                         I'm gonna put a stop to this now.

               Jo's handed KAFFEE another printout and a stack of letters.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Your honor, these are the telephone 
                         records from GITMO for August 6th.  
                         And these are 14 letters that Santiago 
                         wrote in nine months requesting, in 
                         fact begging, for a transfer.
                              (to JESSEP)
                         Upon hearing the news that he was 
                         finally getting his transfer, Santiago 
                         was so excited, that do you know how 
                         many people he called? Zero. Nobody. 
                         Not one call to his parents saying 
                         he was coming home. Not one call to 
                         a friend saying can you pick me up 
                         at the airport. He was asleep in his 
                         bed at midnight, and according to 
                         you he was getting on a plane in six 
                         hours, yet everything he owned was 
                         hanging neatly in his closet and 
                         folded neatly in his footlocker. You 
                         were leaving for one day and you 
                         packed a bag and made three phone 
                         calls. Santiago was leaving for the 
                         rest of his life, and he hadn't called 
                         a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. 
                         Can you explain that? The fact is 
                         there was no transfer order. Santiago 
                         wasn't going anywhere, isn't that 
                         right, Colonel.

                                     ROSS
                         Object. Your Honor, it's obvious 
                         that Lt. Kaffee's intention this 
                         morning is to smear a high ranking 
                         marine officer in the desperate hope 
                         that the mere appearance of 
                         impropriety will win him points with 
                         the jury. It's my recommendation, 
                         sir, that Lt. Kaffee receive an 
                         official reprimand from the bench, 
                         and that the witness be excused with 
                         the Court's deepest apologies.

               RANDOLPH ponders this a moment.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (pause)
                         Overruled.

                                     ROSS
                         Your honor --

                                     RANDOLPH
                         The objection's noted.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Colonel?

               Jessep's smiling...

               ...and now he can't help but let out a short laugh.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Is this funny, sir?

                                     JESSEP
                         No. It's not. It's tragic.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Do you have an answer?

                                     JESSEP
                         Absolutely. My answer is I don't 
                         have the first damn clue. Maybe he 
                         was an early morning riser and he 
                         liked to pack in the nq. And maybe 
                         he didn't have any friends. I'm an 
                         educated man, but I'm afraid I can't 
                         speak intelligently about the travel 
                         habits of William Santiago.  What I 
                         do know is that he was set to leave 
                         the base at 0600. Now are these really 
                         the questions I was called here to 
                         answer? Phone calls and footlockers? 
                         Please tell me you've got something 
                         more, Lieutenant. Please tell me 
                         there's an ace up your sleeve. These 
                         two marines are on trial for their 
                         lives. Please tell me their lawyer 
                         hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone 
                         bill.
                              (beat)
                         Do you have any other questions for 
                         me, counselor?

               The courtroom is silenced. Jessep's slammed the door.

               KAFFEE looks around the room, sees that the world is waiting 
               for him to do something...

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Lt. Kaffee?

               KAFFEE says nothing. He glances over to AIRMEN O'MALLEY and 
               PEREZ.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (continuing)
                         Lieutenant, do you have anything 
                         further for this witness?

               KAFFEE doesn't respond. JESSEP gets up to leave.

                                     JESSEP
                              (standing)
                         Thanks, Danny. I love Washington.

               And JESSEP starts to leave, but he's stopped by --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Excuse me, I didn't dismiss you.

               JESSEP turns around.

                                     JESSEP
                         I beg your pardon.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm not through with my examination. 
                         Sit down.

                                     JESSEP
                         Colonel.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What's that?

                                     JESSEP
                              (to RANDOLPH)
                         I'd appreciate it if he addressed me 
                         as Colonel or Sir. I believe I've 
                         earned it.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Defense counsel will address the 
                         witness as Colonel or Sir.

                                     JESSEP
                              (to RANDOLPH)
                         I don't know what the hell kind of 
                         an outfit you're running here.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         And the witness will address this 
                         Court as Judge or Your Honor. I'm 
                         quite certain I've earned it. Take 
                         your seat, Colonel.

               Jessep goes back to the stand.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         What would you like to discuss now! 
                         My favorite color?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel, the six a.m. flight, was 
                         the first one off the base?

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         There wasn't a flight that left seven 
                         hours earlier and landed at Andrews 
                         Airforce Base at 2 a.m.?

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Lieutenant, I think we've covered 
                         this, haven't we?

               KAFFEE gets the two log books from his table as well as the 
               piece of paper that SAM scribbled on.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Your Honor, these are the Tower 
                         Chief's Logs for both Guantanamo Bay 
                         and Andrews Airforce Base. The 
                         Guantanamo log lists no flight that 
                         left at eleven p.m., and the Andrews 
                         log lists no flight that landed at 2 
                         a.m. I'd like to admit them as Defense 
                         Exhibits "A" and "B".

                                     RANDOLPH
                         I don't understand. You're admitting 
                         evidence of a flight that never 
                         existed?

                                     KAFFEE
                         We believe it did, sir.
                              (glancing at the paper, 
                              then motioning to 
                              the AIRMEN)
                         Defense'll be calling Airman Cecil 
                         O'Malley and Airman Anthony Perez. 
                         They were working the ground crew at 
                         Andrews at two a.m. on the seventh.

                                     ROSS
                         Your Honor, these men weren't on the 
                         list. Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor, 
                         called specifically to refute 
                         testimony offered under direct 
                         examination.

               If you looked closely at JESSEP, you could see a drop of 
               sweat.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         I'll allow the witnesses.

                                     JESSEP
                         This is ridiculous.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel, a moment ago --

                                     JESSEP
                         Check the Tower Logs for christ's 
                         sake.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We'll get to the airmen in just a 
                         minute, sir. A moment ago said that 
                         you ordered Kendrick to order his 
                         men not to touch Santiago.

                                     JESSEP
                         That's right.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And Kendrick was clear on what you 
                         wanted?

                                     JESSEP
                         Crystal.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Any chance Kendrick ignored the order?

                                     JESSEP
                         Ignored the order?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Any chance he just forgot about it?

                                     JESSEP
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Any chance Kendrick left your office 
                         and said, "The 'old man's wrong"?

                                     JESSEP
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         When Kendrick spoke to the platoon 
                         and ordered them not to touch 
                         Santiago, any chance they ignored 
                         him?

                                     JESSEP
                         Have you ever spent time in an 
                         infantry unit, son?

                                     KAFFEE
                         No sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Ever served in a forward area?

                                     KAFFEE
                         No sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Ever put your life in another man's 
                         hands, ask him to put his life in 
                         yours?

                                     KAFFEE
                         No sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         We follow orders, son. We follow 
                         orders or people die. It's that 
                         simple. Are we clear?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Are we clear?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Crystal.

               KAFFEE speaks with the quiet confidence that comes from 
               knowing you're about to drop your opponents

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing; beat)
                         Colonel, I have just one more question 
                         before I call Airman O'Malley and 
                         Airman Perez: If you gave an order 
                         that Santiago wasn't to be touched, 
                         and your orders are always followed, 
                         then why would he be in danger, why 
                         would it be necessary to transfer 
                         him off the base?

               And JESSEP has no answer.

               Nothing.

               He sits there, and for the first time, seems to be lost.

                                     JESSEP
                         Private Santiago was a sub-standard 
                         marine. He was being transferred off 
                         the base because --

                                     KAFFEE
                         But that's not what you said. You 
                         said he was being transferred because 
                         he was in grave danger.

                                     JESSEP
                              (pause)
                         Yes. That's correct, but --

                                     KAFFEE
                         You said, "He was in danger". I said, 
                         "Grave danger". You said --

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes, I recall what --

                                     KAFFEE
                         I can have the Court Reporter read 
                         back your --

                                     JESSEP
                         I know what I said. I don't need it 
                         read back to me like I'm a damn --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Then why the two orders?
                              (beat)
                         Colonel?
                              (beat)
                         Why did you --

                                     JESSEP
                         Sometimes men take matters into their 
                         own hands.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No sir. You made it clear just a 
                         moment ago that your men never take 
                         matters into their own hands. Your 
                         men follow orders or people die. So 
                         Santiago shouldn't have been in any 
                         danger at all, should he have, 
                         Colonel?

               Everyone's sweating now. Everyone but KAFFEE.

                         Your Honor, I have to ask for a recess 
                         to --

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'd like an answer to the question, 
                         Judge.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         The Court'll wait for answer.

                                     KAFFEE
                         If Kendrick told his men that Santiago 
                         wasn't to be touched, then why did 
                         he have to be transferred?

               Jessep is looking at O'MALLEY and PEREZ.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Colonel?

               JESSEP says nothing.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Kendrick ordered the code red, didn't 
                         he? Because that's what you told 
                         Kendrick to do.

                         You had Markinson sign a phony 
                         transfer order --

                                     ROSS

                         You doctored the log books.

                                     ROSS
                         Damnit Kaffee!!

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll ask for the forth time. You 
                         ordered --

                                     JESSEP
                         You want answers?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I think I'm entitled to them.

                                     JESSEP
                         You want answers?!

                                     KAFFEE
                         I want the truth.

                                     JESSEP
                         You can't handle the truth!

               And nobody moves.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         Son, we live in a world that has 
                         walls. And those walls have to be 
                         guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna 
                         do it? You? You, Lt. Weinberg? I 
                         have a greater responsibility than 
                         you can possibly fathom. You weep 
                         for Santiago and you curse the 
                         marines. You have that luxury. You 
                         have the luxury of not knowing what 
                         I know: That Santiago's death, while 
                         tragic, probably saved lives. And my 
                         existence, while grotesque and 
                         incomprehensible to you, saves lives.
                              (beat)
                         You don't want the truth. Because 
                         deep down, in places you don't talk 
                         about at parties, you want me on 
                         that wall. You need me there.
                              (boasting)
                         We use words like honor, code, 
                         loyalty... we use these words as the 
                         backbone to a life spent defending 
                         something. You use 'em as a punchline.
                              (beat)
                         I have neither the time nor the 
                         inclination to explain myself to a 
                         man who rises and sleeps under the 
                         blanket of the very freedom I provide, 
                         then questions the manner in which I 
                         provide it. I'd prefer you just said 
                         thank you and went on your way. 
                         Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a 
                         weapon and stand a post. Either way, 
                         I don't give a damn what you think 
                         you're entitled to.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (quietly)
                         Did you order the code red?

                                     JESSEP
                              (beat)
                         I did the job you sent me to do.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did you order the code red?

                                     JESSEP
                              (pause)
                         You're goddamn right I did.

               Silence. From everyone. RANDOLPH, ROSS, the M.P.'s, they're 
               all frozen. JO and SAM are likewise. JESSEP seems strangely, 
               quietly relieved. KAFFEE simply takes control of the room 
               now.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Please the court, I suggest the jury 
                         be dismissed so that we can move to 
                         an immediate Article 39a Session.  
                         The witness has rights.

               Silence.

               RANDOLPH looks to ROSS.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Lt. Ross?

               ROSS is frozen. He doesn't know what to do.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (as a friend)
                         Jack.

               ROSS looks at KAFFEE, then JESSEP, then nods his head "yes" 
               to RANDOLPH.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         The Sergeant at Arms will take the 
                         jury to an ante-room where you'll 
                         wait until further instruction.

               The SERGEANT AT ARMS begins leading the JURORS out of the 
               room.

                                     JESSEP
                         What the hell's going on?

               No one will say anything until the jurors are out of the 
               room.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing; to captain)
                         Captain, what the hell's going on? I 
                         did my job. I'd do it again. Now I'm 
                         getting on a plane and going back to 
                         my base.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         M.P.'s, guard the prisoner.

               The M.P.'s are tentative. They've never heard a marine colonel 
               referred to as "the prisoner" before. They sure as hell have 
               never been asked to guard one.

                                     ROSS
                         Guard the prisoner.

                                     JESSEP
                         What the hell --

                                     ROSS
                         Colonel Jessep, you have the right 
                         to remain silent. Any statement you 
                         do make can be used against you in a 
                         trial by court-martial or other 
                         judicial or administrative proceeding.  
                         You have the right...

               ROSS continues reading JESSEP his rights, over --

                                     JESSEP
                         I'm being charged with a crime? I'm -- 
                         that's what this is --
                              (to Ross)
                         Marine!
                              (Ross keeps going)
                         Marine!!
                              (Ross is doing his 
                              job.)
                         I'm being charged with a crime? I'm -- 
                         that's what's happening? This -- I'm --
                         this is funny, you know that, this 
                         is --

               And JESSEP lunges at KAFFEE, and KAFFEE would be dead but 
               for the three M.P.'s who've leapt in to restrain JESSEP.  
               SAM and JO have come to their feet and stand behind KAFFEE.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing; to Kaffee)
                         I'm gonna tear your eyes right outta 
                         your head and piss in your dead skull.  
                         You fucked with the wrong marine.

               ROSS is done reading JESSEP his rights.

                                     ROSS
                         Colonel Jessep, do you understand 
                         those rights as I have just read 
                         then to you?

                                     JESSEP
                         I saved lives. That boy was -- there 
                         was a weak link. I saved lives, you 
                         hear me?

               The courtroom is silent from Jessep's outburst. Jessep shakes 
               his head.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         You fuckin' people.
                              (beat)
                         You have no idea how to defend a 
                         nation.
                              (continuing; to KAFFEE)
                         All you did was weaken a country 
                         today, Kaffee. That's all you did. 
                         You put people in danger. Sweet 
                         dreams, son.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Don't call me son.
                              (beat)
                         I'm a lawyer, and an officer of the 
                         United States Navy. And you're under 
                         arrest you sonofabitch.

               KAFFEE stays on JESSEP a moment longer, then remembers --

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         The witness is excused.

               The M.P.'s start leading JESSEP out, and KAFFEE notices 
               DAWSON. And DOWNEY. And ROSS. who are watching a man in a 
               marine colonels uniform be led away in handcuffs... KAFFEE 
               takes a handkerchief from his pocket and wipes some sweat 
               from his hands. He takes a deep breath as we

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE COURTROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               There's low murmur in the room as the JURORS are being led 
               back into their box.

               Everyone's in place.

               RANDOLPH enters.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         Ten-hut.

               All rise. And sit when RANDOLPH sits.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Have the jurors reached a verdict?

                                     JURY FOREMAN
                         We have, sir.

               The SERGEANT AT ARMS takes all the slips of paper from the 
               FOREMAN and brings them to RANDOLPH.

               KAFFEE stands, and nods to DAWSON and DOWNEY that they should 
               do the same. SAM and JO stand as well.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (reading)
                         On the charge of Murder, the Members 
                         find the defendants Not Guilty.

               It's hard to resist the temptation to scream and shout, but 
               they do.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (continuing; reading)
                         On the charge of Conspiracy to Commit 
                         Murder, the Members find the 
                         defendants Not Guilty.

               RANDOLPH looks up. Then reads from the last slip of paper.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (continuing)
                         On the charge of Conduct Unbecoming 
                         a United States Marine, the members 
                         find the defendants Guilty as Charged.

               A little of the energy drains out of the room. RANDOLPH 
               continues reading.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (continuing; reading)
                         The defendants are hereby sentenced 
                         by this court to time already served, 
                         and are ordered...

               RANDOLPH clears his throat.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (continuing)
                         ...And are ordered to be dishonorably 
                         discharged from the marine corps.
                              (pause)
                         This Court-Martial is adjourned.

               RANDOLPH raps his gavel.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         Ten hut.

               All rise.

               RANDOLPH's gone.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                              (continuing)
                         Dismissed.

               The M.P.'s move to DAWSON and DOWNEY to unlock their 
               handcuffs. KAFFEE is packing up his things, just another day 
               at the office.

                                     DAWSON
                         Why?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Harold, I'm sorry.

                                     DAWSON
                         Why?!

                                     DOWNEY
                         I don't understand. Colonel Jessep 
                         said he ordered the Code Red.

                                     JO
                         I know, but --

                                     DOWNEY
                         Colonel Jessep said he ordered the 
                         Code Red, what did we do wrong?

                                     JO
                         It's not as simple as --

                                     DOWNEY
                         What did we do wrong?

                                     DAWSON
                         We did nothing wrong.

               SAM slaps his hands down on the table --

                                     SAM
                         Yes you did! A jury just said your 
                         conduct was unbecoming a marine. 
                         What does that mean?!

                                     DAWSON
                         You're the lawyer.

                                     SAM
                         You're the marine.

                                     DAWSON
                         Not anymore.

               SAM lets it hang. DAWSON is staring at SAM. His stare moves 
               slowly to the floor.

                                     DAWSON
                              (continuing)
                         I never meant to hurt Willy.

               DAWSON looks up at HIS PARENTS. The moment hangs there... 
               before

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         Kaffee, I've gotta take these guys 
                         over to personnel for some paper 
                         work.

               KAFFEE nods.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                              (continuing; to Dawson 
                              & Downey)
                         Gentleman?

               DAWSON looks to KAFFEE. There's gotta be more. This can't be 
               it.

               But KAFFEE has nothing to say.

               DAWSON and DOWNEY walk to the SERGEANT AT ARMS and begin to 
               follow him up the aisle and out of the courtroom. But before 
               they get to the door, KAFFEE turns around and calls

                                     KAFFEE
                         Harold!

               They stop and turn around.

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir!

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         You don't need to wear a patch on 
                         your arm to have honor.

               DAWSON stares at KAFFEE for a long moment.

                                     DAWSON
                         Ten-hut.

               DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention.

                                     DAWSON
                              (continuing)
                         There's an officer on deck.

               DAWSON snaps a salute and holds it.

               KAFFEE stares back. Then stands up straight and returns their 
               salute.

               With one last glance back at KAFFEE, DAWSON turns and walks 
               out the door, followed by DOWNEY.

               ROSS walks over to the defense table.

                                     ROSS
                         Airmen Cecil O'Malley and Anthony 
                         Perez? What exactly were these guys 
                         gonna testify to?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Unless I'm mistaken they were gonna 
                         testify, under oath, that they have 
                         absolutely no recollection of 
                         anything.

               ROSS smiles.

                                     ROSS
                         Strong witnesses.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And very handsome, too, don't you 
                         think?

                                     ROSS
                         I'll see you around the campus.  
                         I've gotta go arrest Kendrick.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Tell him I say "Hi".

                                     ROSS
                         Will do.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE - DUSK

               KAFFEE, JO and SAM are walking down the steps. The BAND is 
               practicing on the parade grounds.

                                     JO
                         What do you say we take the rest of 
                         the day off. Go out someplace. Sam? 
                         Champagne? Yoo-Hoo?

                                     SAM
                         Thanks, I can't. I'm gonna go home 
                         and talk to my daughter. I think 
                         she's gotta be bilingual by now.

               And SAM heads off toward his car.

                                     JO
                         So what's next for you?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Staff Sargeant Henry Williamson. He 
                         went to the movies on company time. 
                         What about you?

                                     JO
                         Me? Oh... you know... the usual.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Just pretty much generally annoying 
                         people?

                                     JO
                         Yeah.
                              (pause)
                         So what do you say? How 'bout a 
                         celebration?

                                     KAFFEE
                         No. How 'bout a date. A real date. 
                         Dinner. Attractive clothes. The works.

                                     JO
                         Sounds good.  Who do you think I 
                         should call?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll pick you up at seven.

                                     JO
                         What are you gonna do now?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm gonna get started on Henry 
                         Williamson.
                              (beat)
                         Stand my post for a while.

               JO holds out her hand. KAFFEE shakes it. JO kisses him.

                                     JO
                         Wear matching socks.

               Jo splits off toward her building and KAFFEE keeps walking 
               toward the bleachers as we PULL BACK TO INCLUDE the almost 
               empty parade grounds and PULL BACK as to show the Washington 
               Navy Yard and PULL BACK and back and back and

                                                                  FADE OUT.

                                         THE END
AGNES OF GOD

INT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT

SISTER MARGUERITE is locking up for the night, shutting doors,
turning off lights, finally walks off down the corridor. Suddenly a
terrified scream is heard, the voice of a young woman.

EXT - CONVENT - NIGHT

Lights in the windows flick on.

INT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The nuns    are running up the corridor in their night dresses and caps,
calling    urgently in French. They reach the door of Sister Agnes' room
and try    the door. It is blocked. Pushing harder they see the blood
stained    figure of SISTER AGNES. Much alarm and crying...

                                         MOTHER SUPERIOR
                          Agnes!... Agnes...

EXT - CONVENT - NIGHT

An ambulance comes tearing down the road, siren blaring. It cuts the
siren and stops outside the convent gates. The nuns open the gate and
the ambulance drives inside.

INT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Two PARAMEDICS urgently run the stretcher down the hall to the
unconscious figure of Sister Agnes. The Mother Superior desperately
wipes and kisses her face.

                                         PARAMEDIC
                         I'm just going to put something here to
                         stop the bleeding. Excuse me Sister.
                         She'll be fine.

They lift her on to the stretcher and run back down the hall.

The Mother Superior looks around worriedly and goes into...

INT - SISTER AGNES' ROOM - NIGHT

She kneels down by a waste paper basket full of bloodied sheets and
starts to pull them out. Then she freezes, makes the sign of the
cross and starts to weep.

DISSOLVE TO:

An aerial shot of the great cross of Montreal. Superimposed over this

"MONTREAL, QUEBEC".

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT - SUPREME COURT - DAY

A normal busy day. A car pulls up with a woman and a man driving. The
woman is MARTHA LIVINGSTON. She kisses the man (LARRY), gets out of
the car, runs across the road dodgingtraffic and goes up the steps of
the courthouse. There a group of REPORTERS there and a sudden bustle
of interest.

                                        REPORTER
                         Here they are now.

Martha watches intently as 3 nuns, the Mother Superior, Sister
Marguerite, and Sister Agnes (dressed in a white novices habit) and
their LAWYER come out of the court escorted by police. The reporters
leap on them, taking photographs, asking questions in English and
French. Suddenly Sister Agnes looks right at Martha, then she is
quickly bustled past. Martha goes on into the courthouse.

INT - JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - DAY

Inside EVE, LYON, and JUSTICE LEVEAU are sitting. Martha is standing
by the window smoking furiously.

                                        LEVEAU
                         Martha, it's you.

                                      MARTHA
                       What about Roger? He's free.

                                      EVE
                       They want a woman.

                                      LYON
                       All you have to do is meet with her
                       once or twice... then tell the court
                       she's insane.

                                      MARTHA
                       Are you dictating my position to me?
                       We're getting into some sticky legal
                       territories here.

                                      EVE
                       Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants
                       this to come to trial, not the Church, not
                       the Crown... least of all me.

                                      MARTHA
                       Eve, she strangled a baby!

                                      EVE
                       Nobody is interested in sending a nun
                       to prison.

                                      LEVEAU
                       We're not telling you what to decide
                       Martha. We're not even telling you to
                       take this.

                                      LYON
                       Is there any reason why you feel you
                       shouldn't take it?

       Martha pauses for a long moment at the window, then turns.

                                      MARTHA
                       Today's my birthday. I always make
                       bad decisions on my birthday.

The Judge, Eve and Lyon all chuckle. The Judge throws the file down
on his desk towards her.

                                         LEVEAU
                       Happy birthday.


15   INT - MARTHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Martha unlocks the door and comes in. She plays her
answerphone
and moves over to her cat.

                                         MARTHA

                       Hi, Kitty.

       The answerphone whirs...

                                      SECRETARY (V.O.)
                       Hi, it's Helen, calling to tell you
                       that Mrs Davenport phoned to confirm
                       her appointment at nine o'clock
                       tomorrow, okay? Bye bye.

       Some whirs and clicks.

                                         ROGER (V.O.)
                       Hi Martha,    it's Roger. Can you call
                       me at the    hospital. I'd like your opinion
                       on a case.    Oh, bye the way, happy
                       birthday.    Bye.

                                      SECRETARY (V.O.)
                       Hi, Marty it's Helen again. I cancelled
                       your Wednesday afternoon appointment
                       so you can visit with your mother. Bye bye.

        Martha picks up a news paper with a photo of Sister Agnes on
the front.


       DISSOLVE TO:

16   EXT - CONVENT - DAY

        Martha pulls up in her BMW outside the convent walls and gets
out, cigarette
        in hand. A sign tangled over with creeper reads "Les Petites
Soeurs de Marie Madeleine". Martha jangles a bell. After a wait she
presses a buzzer. A   peephole in the door slams open and Sister
Marguerite looks out.

                                      MARTHA
                       Bonjour, I'm Doctor Martha
                       Livingston, I...

        The peephole slams shut, but the door does open. Sister
Marguerite glares at her.

                                      MARTHA (Cont.)
                       Hello... I'm Doctor Martha
                       Living...ston... I...

        Martha realizes it is the cigarette that is causing the
trouble
and hastily     grinds it underfoot.

                                         MARTHA (Cont.)

                       Excuse me... I'm...

        Sister Marguerite eyes flick down at cigarette butt. Martha
awkwardly tries
        to kick it away.

                                      MARTHA (Cont.)
                       ...the court-appointed psychiatrist.

        Sister Marguerite gives a frosty imitation of a smile and
motions for her to    come in.

                                      MARTHA (Cont.)
                       Thank you. I um... I believe your
                       Mother Superior's expecting me.

       Martha and the Sister walk up the drive to the convent.


17   INT - WAITING ROOM - DAY

        Martha follows Sister Marguerite into a grilled waiting room.
Sister moves    off, leaving Martha looking around curiously. Then
the MOTHER MIRIAM arrives from behind the grilled door, sees
Martha, sighs exasperatedly and enters giving Martha a slight
start.

                                       MOTHER SUPERIOR
                               (beaming at her own
                                       little joke)
                       Doctor Livingston I presume? I'm
                       Mother Miriam Ruth. You needn't call
                       Mother if you don't wish.
                               (shaking hands)
                       Most people find it uncomfortable.

                                        MARTHA
                       Well... I...

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                               (carrying right on)
                       I'm afraid the word brings up the most
                       unpleasant connatations in this day and
                       age...

                                        MARTHA
                       Yes... I...

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       You can call me Sister.

                                        MARTHA
                       ... Thank you.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       You must have tons of questions. You
                       may smoke if you want to. Just don't
                       tell any of the Sisters.

       Martha sits;   Mother Miriam gets her a box of matches.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.)
                       They wouldn't understand, especially
                       Sister Marguerite. She'd scare the pants
                       off Queen Elizabeth.
                                (she lights Martha's cigarette)
                       Besides, I miss them.

                                      MARTHA
                       You were a smoker?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Two packs a day.

                                      MARTHA
                       I can beat that.

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Unfiltered.

        Martha inclines her head impressed. Mother Miriam sits down
next to her.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.)
                       Well, you have questions.
                               (checks her watch)
                       Fire away...

                                      MARTHA
                       Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                       No-one.

                                      MARTHA
                       How did she hide it from the other nuns?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       She undressed alone... she bathed alone.

                                         MARTHA
                       Is that normal?

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Yes.

                                      MARTHA
                       How did she hide it during the day?

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                               (indicating her habit)
                       She could have hidden a machine gun in
                       here if she had wanted to.

                                      MARTHA
                       Didn't she have any physical examinations

                       in this time?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy
                       fell in between the doctor's visits.

                                      MARTHA
                       Who was the father?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       I haven't a clue.

                                      MARTHA
                       What man had access to her?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       None as far as I know.

                                      MARTHA
                       Was there a priest?

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Yes, but I...

                                      MARTHA
                       What's his name?

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Father Martineau, but I don't see him
                       as a candidate.

                                      MARTHA
                       Could there have been anyone else?

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                               (a pause)
                       Obviously there was.

                                      MARTHA
                       And you didn't try to find out who?

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                               (standing)
                       Believe me, I've done everything possible
                       short of asking Agnes.

                                      MARTHA
                       Why haven't you asked her?

        Mother Miriam removes a tray from under a pot plant and
brings
it back to
        use as an ashtray.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                               (sitting again)
                       She can't even remember the birth. Do
                       you think she'd admit to the conception?

                                      MARTHA
                       Look, someone gave her the baby.

                                      MOTHER    MIRIAM
                       Yes, but that was some    ten months ago.
                       I fail to see that the    identity of that
                       somebody has anything    to do with this
                       trial.

                                      MARTHA
                       Why do you think that?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Don't ask me those questions dear,
                       I'm not the patient.

                                       MARTHA
                       Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's
                       going to decide what is, or is not
                       important here.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you
                       this politely, but I don't approve of you.
                       Not you personally...

                                      MARTHA
                       The science of psychiatry.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                               (standing)
                       Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes
                       as speedily and as easily as possible.
                       She won't hold up under any sort of cross
                       examination.

                                       MARTHA
                               (also standing)
                       I am not with the Inquisition.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       And I am not from the Middle Ages. I
                       know what you are! I don't want that
                       mind cut open.

       Then Mother Miriam walks out.


18   INT - WAITING ROOM - DAY

        A little later, Martha is sitting alone smoking. SISTER ANNE
enters and indicates that Martha should follow her. They exit out of
the grilled room
        and head up a steep flight of wooden stairs. Faintly the
voice
of a single
        young woman can be heard singing in Latin.

19     INT - TOP CORRIDOR - DAY

        Martha follows Sister Anne down the hall towards the singing.
They stop outside Agnes' room. Martha looks to see...


20     INT - AGNES' ROOM - DAY

        ... Agnes an almost childlike young woman singing happily,
looking out the
        window. Then Agnes hears a slight sound and stops abruptly.
She
turns to see
        Martha standing in the doorway.

                                        MARTHA
                         Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been
                         asked to talk to you. May I?

                                           AGNES
                         Yes.

        Martha moves further in the room. An ELDERLY NUN hovers
outside
the door.

                                        MARTHA
                         You have a lovely voice.

                                           AGNES
                         No I don't.

                                        MARTHA
                         I just heard you.

                                           AGNES
                         That wasn't me.

                                        MARTHA
                         Was it Sister Marguerite?

         Agnes laughs and Martha closes the door, shutting out the old
nun.

                                        MARTHA (Cont.)
                         You're very pretty Agnes.

                                           AGNES
                         No I'm not.

                                        MARTHA
                         Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?

                                        AGNES
                         Let's talk about something else.

                                MARTHA
                 What would you like to talk about.

                                  AGNES
                 I don't know.

                                MARTHA
                 Anything... may I sit down?

                                  AGNES
                 Yes.

They both sit.

                                MARTHA
                 First thing that comes to your mind?

                                  AGNES
                 God!    But there's nothing to say about
                 God.

                                MARTHA
                 Second thing that comes to your mind.

                                  AGNES
                 Love.

                                MARTHA
                 Have you ever loved anyone?

                                  AGNES
                 Yes.

                                  MARTHA
                 Who?

                                  AGNES
                 Everyone.

                                MARTHA
                 Well, who in particular?

                                  AGNES
                 Right now?

                                  MARTHA
                 Uh huh.

                                  AGNES
                 I love you.

                                 MARTHA
                         (a pause)
                 Agnes, have you ever loved another
                 man... other than, Jesus Christ?

                                  AGNES
                 Yes.

                                MARTHA
               Who?

                               AGNES
                       (chuckles)
               Oh, there are so many.

                              MARTHA
               Well do you love... do you love
               Father Martineau?

                                AGNES
               Oh, yes!

                              MARTHA
               Do you think he loves you?

                              AGNES
               Oh, I know he does.

                                MARTHA
               He's told you?

                              AGNES
               No. But... when I look into his eyes,
               I can tell.

                              MARTHA
               You've been alone together?

                                AGNES
               Yes.

                                MARTHA
               Often?

                              AGNES
               At least once a week.

                              MARTHA
               And you like that?

                                AGNES
               Oh, yes.

                              MARTHA
               Where do you meet?

                               AGNES
                       (obviously)
               In the confessional.

A slightly awkward pause.

                              MARTHA
               Agnes, do ever see Father Martineau
               outside the...

Agnes suddenly looks exasperated.

                              AGNES
               You want to talk about the baby
               don't you?

                              MARTHA
               Would you like to talk about it?

                              AGNES
               I never saw any baby... I think they
               made it up.

                              MARTHA
               Why should they?

                                 AGNES
               I don't know.

                              MARTHA
               Do you remember the night they said
               it came?

                                 AGNES
               No. I was sick.

                              MARTHA
               How were you sick?

                              AGNES
               Something I ate.

                                 MARTHA
               Did it hurt?

                                 AGNES
               Yes.

                                 MARTHA
               Where?

                                 AGNES
               Down... there.

                              MARTHA
               And what did you do?

                              AGNES
               I went to my room.

                              MARTHA
               And what happened?

                                 AGNES
               I got sicker.

                                 MARTHA

And then what?

                  AGNES
I fell asleep.

               MARTHA
In the middle of all the pain?

                  AGNES
Yes.

               MARTHA
Where did the baby come from?

                  AGNES
What baby?

               MARTHA
The baby they made up.

               AGNES
From their heads...

               MARTHA
Is that where they say it came
from... ?

               AGNES
No, they say it came from the waste
paper basket!

               MARTHA
Where'd it come from before that?

                  AGNES
From God.

               MARTHA
After God... before the waste-paper
basket.

               AGNES
I... I don't understand.

               MARTHA
Agnes, how are babies born?

                  AGNES
Don't you know?

                 MARTHA
Yes I do,    but I want you to...

                AGNES
        (very agitated)
I don't understand what you're
talking about... you want to talk
about the baby... everybody wants

                       to talk about    the baby but... I
                       never saw the    baby so I can't talk
                       about the baby    because... I don't
                       believe in the    baby.

                                      MARTHA
                       Then let's talk about something else...

                                       AGNES
                               (standing)
                       No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been
                       talking for weeks, nobody believes me
                       when I tell them anything... nobody
                       listens to me.

                                       MARTHA
                               (also standing)
                       Agnes...

                                       AGNES
                               (opens the door)
                       No... no, I don't want to answer any
                       more questions.

                                      MARTHA
                       Would you like to ask them?

                                       AGNES
                               (pausing in the doorway)
                       What do you mean?

                                      MARTHA
                       Just that... you ask and I'll answer.

                                         AGNES
                       Anything?

                                       MARTHA
                               (smiles)
                       Anything.


21   INT - NUN'S ROOM - DAY

        The elderly nun looks out the window into the courtyard where
Martha and Agnes are walking, then pulls the curtain across.


22   EXT - COURTYARD - DAY

       Martha and Agnes are walking together. Martha is smoking.

                                      AGNES
                       What's your real name?

                                      MARTHA
                       Martha Louise Livingston.

                                 AGNES
                  Are you married?

                                    MARTHA
                  No.

                                 AGNES
                  Would you like to be?

                                 MARTHA
                  Not at the moment, no.

                                 AGNES
                  Do you have any children?

                                    MARTHA
                  No.

                                 AGNES
                  Would you like some?

                                 MARTHA
                  I can't have them any more.

                                    AGNES
                  Why not?

                                  MARTHA
                          (a pause)
                  I've stopped menstruating

                                 AGNES
                  Why do you smoke?

                                 MARTHA
                  Does it bother you?

                                    AGNES
                  No questions.

                                    MARTHA
                  Smoking is an    obsession with me.
                  Maybe one day    I'll become obsessed
                  with something    else, then I'll stop
                  smoking... Do    you have any more
                  questions?

                                    AGNES
                  One.

                                    MARTHA
                  What?

They both halt.

                                 AGNES
                  Where do you think babies come from?

                                      MARTHA
                       From their mothers and fathers of
                       course. Before that, I... I don't
                       know.

                                      AGNES
                       Well I think they come from... angel
                       lights on their mothers chest and
                       whispers into her ear. That makes good
                       babies start to grow. And bad babies
                       come from when a fallen angel squeezes
                       in down there, and they start to grow,
                       grow, till they come out down there.
                       I don't know where good babies come out.
                       And you can't tell the difference...
                       except bad babies cry a lot... and they
                       make their fathers go away... and their
                       mothers get very ill... die sometimes.

       Agnes sits down on a bench and Martha follows her.

                                       AGNES (Cont.)
                       Mummy wasn't very happy when she died
                       ... and, I think she went to hell because
                       every time I see her she looks like she
                       just stepped out of a hot shower, and I...
                       I'm never sure if it's her, or the Lady who
                       tells me things! They fight over me all
                       the time.
                               (staring into space)
                       The Lady... I saw when I was ten. I was
                       lying on the grass, looking at the sun, and
                       the sun became a cloud, and the cloud
                       became, a Lady. And she told me she would
                       talk to me. And then... her feet began to
                       bleed and I saw there... there were holes
                       in her hands and in her side. And I tried to
                       catch the blood as it fell from the sky, but
                       I couldn't see any more because my eyes
                       hurt because there were big black spots in
                       front of them. And she tells me things like,
                       like... right now she's crying Marie! Marie!
                       ... but I don't know what that means.

        Martha stands up, disturbed. Agnes is slightly delirious with
happiness.

                                      AGNES (Cont.)
                       ... and... she uses me to sing, it's as
                       if she's throwing a big hook through
                       the air and it catches me under my ribs
                       and tries to pull me up, and I... I can't
                       move because Mommy's holding my feet
                       and all I can do is sing in her voice...
                       it's the Lady's voice, God loves you!

       And her cry echoes all around and the doves fly out of the
bell

tower.

                                       AGNES (Cont.)
                               (to Martha)
                       God loves you.

                                      MARTHA
                       Do you know a Marie?

                                         AGNES
                       No... do you?

                                         MARTHA
                       Why should I?

                                         AGNES
                       I don't know.


23   INT - MOTHER MIRIAM'S STUDY - DAY

        Mother Miriam is standing checking some papers when Martha
enters. Mother Miriam seems to have entirely regained her good
humour.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Well... what do you think? Is she
                       totally bananas or merely slightly
                       off centre... or maybe she's perfectly
                       sane and just a very good liar.

                                      MARTHA
                       What's your opinion?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       I believe Agnes is different.

                                       MARTHA
                       From other nuns...
                               (laughs)
                       Yes I... I've noticed.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                       From other people!
                               (moving across the room)
                       I believe she is not crazy, nor is she
                       lying.

                                      MARTHA
                       How could she have a baby and know
                       nothing of sex or birth?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Because she's an innocent. She's a slate
                       that's hasn't been touched except by God.

                                      MARTHA
                              (lights a cigarette)

                       That's ridiculous...

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                               (moves to her desk,
                                starts writing)
                       In her case it isn't. She's had very little
                       schooling. Her mother kept her home
                       almost all the time and when her mother
                       died Agnes came here, to us. She's never
                       been out there Doctor. She's never seen a
                       movie or a television show. She's never
                       even read a book.

                                      MARTHA
                       If she's so innocent, how come she
                       murdered a child?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       She didn't! This is manslaughter, not
                       murder. She didn't consciously kill that
                       baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was
                       unconscious by the time we got to her.

                                      MARTHA
                       So, someone else could have done it.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       No... not in the eyes of the police.

                                      MARTHA
                       And in your eyes?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       I've already told you what I thought.

                                      MARTHA
                       That she was unconscious, yes! So
                       someone easily could have come in
                       the room and killed the...

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       You don't really believe something like
                       that happened do you?

                                      MARTHA
                       It's possible isn't it?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Who?

                                      MARTHA
                       One of the other nuns found out about
                       the baby and... and wanted to avoid a
                       scandal.

        Mother Miriam removes the tray from under a pot plant and
bangs
it down in front of Martha to act as an ashtray.

                                           MOTHER MIRIAM
                          That's absurd!

                                         MARTHA
                          That possibility never occurred to
                          you?

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                          No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy.
                          No-one. Not even Agnes.


24   EXT - CONVENT - DAY

          Martha's car exits out of the convent and heads up the road.


25   INT - CAR - DAY

          The car radio is playing light band music...

                                          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                          You have been listening to Mostly Music
                          from Montreal. This is CBC Radio.
                                  (and again in French)

          Martha flicks the radio off and stops the car. She thinks for
a
moment
          then...


26   EXT - LONELY ROAD - DAY

        ... she turns the car around and heads back in the direction
she came.


27   EXT - PRESBYTERY - DAY

        Martha drives in through an entrance and pulls up outside the
presbytery.


28   INT - PRESBYTERY - DAY

          From inside the house, Martha can be seen knocking on the
glass
fronted
          door.     Presently a huge, fat HOUSEKEEPER answers.

                                         MARTHA
                          Is Father Martineau in please?

                                          HOUSEKEEPER
                                  (in French)
                                  ???

                                         MARTHA
                                 (answers in French)
                         ???

          The housekeeper indicates she should enter and walks back
inside.

                                         HOUSEKEEPER
                                 (halting briefly)
                         Wipe your feet.

        They move into the next room. The housekeeper goes further
calling...

                                         HOUSEKEEPER
                         Pere Martineau...
                                 (in French)
                         ???

        Martha stands uncertainly at the doorway. The sound of
thumping
is heard,
        and then the figure of a very old priest, FATHER MARTINEAU
appears walking
        with a stick.


29   INT - PRESBYTERY DINING ROOM - DAY

        Father Martineau and Martha are having tea. He pours a slug
of
whisky from a   flask into her cup and an even larger slug into his
own.

                                         FATHER MARTINEAU
                                 (French accent)
                         They arise at five in the morning... and
                         they're in bed by nine at night. Even if a
                         man could get to them, he would probably
                         find them praying. That's why I see that
                         the real question is not only how he got in,
                         but when.

                                        MARTHA
                         And you're the only man to see them?

                                                FATHER MARTINEAU
                         I promise you Doctor, even if I had the
                         inclination, how could I possibly catch
                         her? She would have to be a very slow
                         and patient nun.
                                 (they both laugh)
                         Ah no... they're a very special and rare
                         people those Sisters. Only a few of them
                         left in this modern world, consecrated to
                         the praise of God.

30   INT - NURSING HOME, LOUNGE - DAY

        An elderly WOMAN is sitting watching "Spiderman" on TV
cackling
with laughter. She is physically alright, but quite senile. Martha
enters, goes
        over to her and kisses her.

                                       MARTHA
                       Hello, Mama
                               (pulls up a chair)
                       ... brought you something.

                                      MAMA
                       Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.

                                      MARTHA
                       It's your favourite...

                                        MAMA
                       Who are you?

                                       MARTHA
                       It's Martha, Mama.
                               (hands over a tub
                                of icecream)
                       There you go.

                                      MAMA
                       Marie brings me icecream too you
                       know. Chocolate... my favourite.

                                      MARTHA
                       I thought cherry-vanilla was your
                       favourite.

                                      MAMA
                       Not any more... now I like chocolate.

                                       MARTHA
                               (stroking her hair)
                       Did you have a good week Mama. Are
                       they treating you all right?

                                      MAMA
                       You know Martha never comes to see me.
                       You watch it, she's going straight to
                       hell... after all the things she said to
                       me. Then she marries that son of a bitch
                       of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I
                       knew that one wouldn't work out. Not
                       like you Marie. You got married to God.

                                       MARTHA
                               (lighting up)
                       Marie's dead Mama.

                                       MAMA
                       I remember when you    was a little girl
                       Marie. You come back    from the movies
                       and you'd say - Mama    that ending was so
                       sad... and I'd tell    you they had all the
                       happy endings locked    away in a vault in
                       Hollywood.
                               (chuckles)
                       And you believed me.

                                      MARTHA
                       Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!

                                       MAMA
                               (a long pause)
                       Who are you?

                                      MARTHA
                       I... I'm Martha, Mama.


31   EXT - CONVENT, CHICKENYARD - DAY

        It is raining... distant thunder in the background. Martha is
standing under
        an umbrella talking to Sister Anne who is feeding the
chickens.

                                      SISTER ANNE
                       The convent was built for over fifty.
                       Not many of us left... just us and
                       the chickens.

                                                 MARTHA
                       How do you survive?

                                       SISTER ANNE
                       Oh, we own the land around here.
                       But we rent it out. We keep a few
                       acres for ourselves,
                               (indicating)
                       some wheat, corn, some vegetables.

                                      MARTHA
                       Well that's a lot of land. You must have
                       help. Do you have field hands that help
                       you?

                                      SISTER ANNE
                       No. We work the land alone. No-one but
                       Sister Marguerite and I are permitted
                       contact with the public.

                                      MARTHA
                       Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?

        Sister Anne points up to a window on the corner of the
convent.

                                         SISTER ANNE
                          Oh that one there, in the corner.

                                         MARTHA
                          The one up on the third floor?

                                         SISTER ANNE
                          Yes.

                                         MARTHA
                          Uh huh.


32   INT - AGNES' OLD ROOM - DAY

        Mother Miriam unlocks a padlock on the door, opens it for
Martha. They both      enter the room which is totally plain,
stripped
of everything.

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                          This convent is locked solid. The only
                          one that has a key is Sister Marguerite
                          and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.

                                         MARTHA
                          Well, it's been known to happen in the
                          day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.

                                          MOTHER MIRIAM
                          Oh come on, you've talked to her. She
                          doesn't even know how babies are born,
                          let alone made.

                                         MARTHA
                          When did you first learn about her...
                          innocence, the way she thinks?

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                          Shortly after she came to us.

                                         MARTHA
                          And you weren't shocked?

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                          I was appalled, just as you are now.

                                         MARTHA
                          And what happened?

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                          She stopped eating completely...


33   INT - CHAPEL - DAY

       In flashback:   Agnes, all in white is lying face down in the

sign of the
        cross in front of the altar. Mother Miriam enters.

                                      MARTHA (V.O.)
                       This was before her pregnancy?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.)
                       About two years before.

       Mother Miriam stops in front of Agnes.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Agnes, it has come to my attention
                       that you have stopped eating. Why
                       is this?
                                               AGNES
                               (not looking up)
                       I've been commanded by God.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                               (sighs)
                       He talked to you Himself?

                                      AGNES
                       No.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Through someone else?

                                      AGNES
                       Yes.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Who?

                                      AGNES
                       I can't say.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Why?

                                      AGNES
                       She'd punish me.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       One of the other Sisters?

                                      AGNES
                       No.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Who?

        Mother Miriam glances up at an older NUN who has been in the
chapel watching all along. She takes the hint and hobbles out.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.)
                       Why would she tell you to do this?

... Agnes look at me.

                AGNES
        (looking up)
Because I'm getting fat.

               MOTHER MIRIAM
Oh, for Heaven's sake.

               AGNES
I am, there's too much flesh on me.

               MOTHER MIRIAM
Agnes...

               AGNES
I'm a blimp.

               MOTHER MIRIAM
Why does it matter whether you're fat
or not...

               AGNES
Because...

               MOTHER MIRIAM
... You needn't worry about being
attractive here.

               AGNES
I do, I have to be attractive to God.

               MOTHER MIRIAM
He loves you the way you are.

               AGNES
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.

               MOTHER MIRIAM
Who told you this?

               AGNES
It's a sin to be fat.

               MOTHER MIRIAM
Why?

               AGNES
Look at the statues, they're thin.

               MOTHER MIRIAM
Agnes...

               AGNES
That's because they're suffering...
suffering is beautiful, I want to be
beautiful.

                              MOTHER MIRIAM
               Who tells you these things?

                              AGNES
               Christ said it in the Bible, he said -
               suffer the little children, I want to
               suffer like a little child.

                               MOTHER MIRIAM
                       (genuinely distressed)
               That's not what he meant.

                                 AGNES
               I...    I am a little child but my body
               keeps    getting bigger and soon I... I
               won't    be able to fit in, I... I won't be
               able    to squeeze into Heaven.

                              MOTHER MIRIAM
               Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...

Agnes gets to her knees and pushes up her breasts.

                              AGNES
               No... I mean... I mean look at these.
               I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.

                              MOTHER MIRIAM
               Oh my dear child.

                               AGNES
                       (standing)
               God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll
               blow me up, that's what she said...

                                 MOTHER MIRIAM
               Who?

                              AGNES
               Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every
               day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay
               little it won't happen.

                              MOTHER MIRIAM
               Your mother tells you this?... Agnes
               your mother is dead.

                              AGNES
               But she watches... she listens.

                              MOTHER MIRIAM
               Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I
               want you to eat.

                                 AGNES
               I'm not hungry.

                                 MOTHER MIRIAM

                       You've got to eat something Agnes.

                                      AGNES
                       No I don't... the host is enough.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       My dear, I don't think a communion wafer
                       has the recommended daily allowance of
                       anything.

                                       AGNES
                       Of God.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                               (smiles)
                       Yes, of God.

        Then Mother Miriam looks down and is shocked to see Agnes'
white habit is spotted with blood, and more blood is dripping onto
the floor. She pulls out   Agnes' hand from her habit and gasps with
shock; there is a bleeding hole in
        the middle of her palm.

                                      AGNES
                       I'm being punished.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Why?

                                       AGNES
                       I don't know.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Dear Jesus...

               She quickly leads Agnes out of the chapel.

                                       AGNES
                       It started this morning and I can't
                       get it to stop.


34   INT - AGNES' OLD ROOM - DAY

       Back in the present, as before...

                                      MARTHA
                       Why didn't you take her to a doctor?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       It was healed by the following morning
                       and she started eating again...

                                      MARTHA
                       She had a... a hole in the palm of her
                       hand! She could have bled to death.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM

                             But she didn't... did she. If anyone had
                             seen what I'd seen she'd be public
                             property... newspapermen, psychiatrists,
                             ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.

                                               MARTHA
                             She has it now.

                                            MOTHER MIRIAM
                             I know what you're thinking, she's a
                             hysteric pure and simple.

                                               MARTHA
                             Not simple, no.

                                            MOTHER MIRIAM
                             I saw it. Clean through the palm of
                             her hand. Do you think hysteria could
                             do that?

                                            MARTHA
                             It's being doing it for centuries. She's
                             not unique, she's just another victim.

                                            MOTHER MIRIAM
                             God's victim. That's her innocence.
                             She belongs to God.

                                            MARTHA
                             And I intend to take her away from Him.
                             That's what you're afraid of isn't it?

          Martha walks out. Mother Miriam yanks the padlock out of the
door.

                                               MOTHER MIRIAM
                             You bet I am.


35      INT - CHAPEL - DAY

        All the Sisters are present. Mother Miriam leads the chant in
Latin and the   rest of the nuns respond at intervals. Agnes is very
happy. Their singing continues over, until the end of scene 41.

                                        AGNES
                         Last Tuesday, I didn't eat all of my
                         lima beans... hid them under my
                         spoon.

                                  FATHER MARTINEAU

                                 (very loudly)

                        Would you tell me why the hell this
                        is taking so long.

                                               MARTHA
                        Look there are a lot of unanswered
                        questions here.

                                       LYON
                        Martha, your job is to diagnose, not to
                        heal and play detective. Who do you
                        think you are?

                        I know my job. Don't tell me my job Lyon.

                        Martha, you have to make a decision on
                        her sanity as quickly as possible and not
                        interfere with due process of law.

                                       MARTHA
                        No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as
                        I see fit.

                                       EVE
                        The longer you take to make a decision,
                        the more difficult it will be for us.

                        And the sooner she goes to prison, the
                        better off she'll be?

                       I don't believe this. I don't bloody
                       believe this.

                                      LYON
                       Well the bishop will be very upset
                       about this.

                                      MARTHA
                       I'm fighting for this woman's life, not
                       some bloody bishop.


43   EXT - CONVENT GRAVEYARD - DAY

        It is a strange place; all the crosses are identical and very
simple. Martha
        is standing. Agnes is kneeling in front of a cross marked
with
the name
        "Soeur Marie Paul" and the dates she was born, consecrated
and
died. Agnes
        places some winter flowers on the grave.

                                      MARTHA
                       You liked Sister Paul?

                                      AGNES
                       She was kind to me. She told me
                       I was beautiful.

                                       MARTHA
                               (crouching down)
                       What else did she tell you?

                                      AGNES
                       She said all of God's angels would
                       want to sleep beside me if they could.
                       I liked that.

        Agnes makes the sign of the cross, they both stand and start
to
move off.

                                      AGNES (Cont.)
                       She lived here for almost seventy
                       years. Every day she'd ring the bell,
                       wake us up, call us to God. She took
                       me to my secret place.

                                      MARTHA
                       Where's that?... I promise I won't tell,
                       would you take me?

       So Agnes takes her.


44   INT - BELL TOWER - DAY

        Martha and Agnes enter the bell-tower. Agnes leads the way up
the steep wooden steps. Martha becomes breathless almost
immediately.

                                              MARTHA
                       Sister Paul was in her eighties?   Did
                       she climb up here often?

                                      AGNES
                       No, only when she felt like it. She
                       brought me up here last winter and
                       the next day she died.

                                       MARTHA
                               (halting, out of breath)
                       No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes
                       how do you feel about babies?

                                      AGNES
                       Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll
                       drop them. They have a soft spot on
                       their heads and if you drop them so
                       they land on their heads they become
                       stupid. I was dropped on my head,
                       that's why I don't understand things.

                                      MARTHA
                       Like what?

                                       AGNES
                               (climbing again)
                       Numbers... you can spend your whole
                       life counting and never reach the end.

                                       MARTHA
                               (following her)
                       I don't understand them either. Do
                       you suppose I was dropped on my head?

                                      AGNES
                       I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be
                       dropped on your head.

                                      MARTHA
                       Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes
                       ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.


45   EXT - TOP OF BELLTOWER - DAY

       Agnes climbs up through the trapdoor to the bell platform.

                                      AGNES
                       She said you could see the whole
                       world from up here. But it looks
                       much better far away than it looks
                       close up.

       Martha arrives exhausted.

                                      MARTHA
                       Beautiful...

       Agnes lies down under the bell.

                                      AGNES
                       And sometimes I get under here...
                       it makes a wonderful sound.

        She starts to sing in a beautiful voice and the sound rings
in
the bell.

                                      MARTHA
                       What happens if the bell rings and
                       you're under there?

                                      AGNES
                       Oh, it's even more wonderful then.

       Agnes sings a little more.

                                      MARTHA
                       It's like hiding from my mother when
                       I was a little girl.

                                      AGNES
                       Where did you go?

                                      MARTHA
                       Oh, no place as wonderful as this.
                       Agnes... have you ever thought of
                       leaving the convent for something
                       else?

                                      AGNES
                       No. There is nothing else. Just being
                       here at night helps me sleep.

                                      MARTHA
                       You have trouble sleeping?

                                      AGNES
                       I get headaches. Mommy did too...
                       oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew
                       things that nobody else knew.

                                      MARTHA
                       What things?

                              AGNES
               She knew what was going to happen
               to me. That's why she hid me away.

                              MARTHA
               How did she know that?

                              AGNES
               Somebody told her.

                               MARTHA
               Who?

                               AGNES
               I don't know.

                               MARTHA
               Agnes...

                               AGNES
               You'll laugh.

                              MARTHA
               I promise I won't laugh. Who told
               her?

                              AGNES
               An angel, when she was having one
               of her headaches.

                              MARTHA
               Did your mother see angels often?

                               AGNES
               No.

                               MARTHA
               Do you?

                               AGNES
               No.

                              MARTHA
               Do you believe she really saw them?

                               AGNES
                       (sitting up)
               No, but I can never tell her that.

                               MARTHA
               Why not?
                       (no answer)
               Mmm?

                              AGNES
               She'd get angry.

Martha moves round close to Agnes.

               MARTHA
Agnes, did you love your mother?

               AGNES
Yes.

               MARTHA
Did you ever want to be a mother
yourself?

               AGNES
I could never be a mother.

               MARTHA
Why not?

               AGNES
Well I don't think I'm old enough and
besides I don't want to have a baby.

               MARTHA
Why not?

               AGNES
Because I don't want one.

               MARTHA
If you did want one, how'd you go
about getting one?

               AGNES
From someone who didn't want to
have a baby.

               MARTHA
Like you?

               AGNES

        (suddenly frustrated)
No, not like me!

               MARTHA
How would that person get one if
they didn't want one?

                AGNES
        (jumping to her feet)
A mistake...

               MARTHA
Agnes, how did your mother get you?

               AGNES
A mistake... it was a mistake...

               MARTHA

                       Is that what she said?

                                       AGNES
                               (very upset)
                       If you're trying to get me to say that
                       she was a bad woman and hated me and
                       didn't want me but that's not true, she
                       was a good woman, a saint...
                               (distorted)

                                      MARTHA
                       Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing
                       about sex...

                                      AGNES
                       I can't help it if I'm stupid.

                                      MARTHA
                       ... that you don't remember getting
                       pregnant...

                                         AGNES
                       Not my fault.

                                      MARTHA
                       ... and that you don't believe you
                       carried a child.

                                      AGNES
                       I was a mistake.

                                         MARTHA
                       What the child?

                                      AGNES
                       Everything... I don't have children.

                                         MARTHA
                       Agnes...

       Martha puts her arm out to Agnes who slaps it away.

                                      AGNES
                       Don't touch me like that! You don't
                       touch me like that, I know what you
                       want from me, you want to take God
                       away. You should be ashamed, they
                       should lock you up people like you.

        Agnes disappears down through the trapdoor. Martha throws her
cigarette away.


46   INT - CONVENT - DAY

        Mother Miriam is comforting a tearful Agnes. She sees Martha
coming across   the courtyard and pushes Agnes gently away.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       You hate us don't you?

                                         MARTHA
                       What?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Nuns... you hate nuns.

                                      MARTHA
                       I hate ignorance and stupidity.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       The Catholic Church...

                                      MARTHA
                       I haven't said anything against the
                       the Catholic Church.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Catholicism is not on trial here. I
                       want you to deal with Agnes without
                       any religious prejudice or you turn
                       this case over to someone else...

                                      MARTHA
                       How dare you tell me to run my affairs!

       Mother Miriam starts to walk away, Martha angrily follows
her.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       It's my affair too.

                                      MARTHA
                       How dare you think I'm in a position
                       to be pressured...


                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       I'm only interested...

                                         MARTHA
                       ...    or bullied or what ever you're doing.
                       Who    the hell do you think you are? You
                       go    around here expecting applause for
                       the    way you treated this child.

        Martha and Mother Miriam are climbing the stairs. They pause
briefly.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       She is not a child.

                                      MARTHA
                       And she has a right to know that there's
                       a world out there filled with people who
                       don't believe in God...

                       (Mother Miriams walks on)
               ... and aren't any worse off than you
               Mother. People who've gone through
               their entire lives without bending their
               knees once, to anybody. And people who
               fall in love and have babies and occas-
               sionally are very happy. She has a right to
               know that. But you and your... your order
               and your Church have kept her ignorant...

They reach Mother Miriam's study.

                                 MOTHER MIRIAM
               ???     (distorted)

               ... virginity, right Mother? Poverty,
               chastity and ignorance is what you
               live by.

                               MOTHER MIRIAM
               I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married
               for twenty three years, two daughters.
               I even have grandchildren... surprised?
               It might please you to know that I was a
               failure as a wife and mother. My children
               won't even see me any more, that's their
               revenge. I think they tell their friends
               that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm
               making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud.
                       (she sits)

                                 MARTHA
               Then help her.

                                 MOTHER MIRIAM
               I am...

                              MARTHA
               No, you're shielding her. Let her face
               the world.

                              MOTHER MIRIAM
               What good would it do. No matter what
               you decide it's either the... the prison
               or the nut house and the differences
               between them are pretty thin.

                              MARTHA
               There's another choice.

                                 MOTHER MIRIAM
               What?

                                 MARTHA
               Aquittal.

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                       How?

                                      MARTHA
                       Innocence. Legal innocence. I know
                       the judge would be happy for any
                       reason to throw this case out of court.

       A long pause. The tension between them dissolves.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       All right, what do you need.

                                         MARTHA
                       Answers.

47   INT - MOTHER MIRIAM'S STUDY - DAY

       Same place, but a little later. Martha is smoking.

                                      MARTHA
                       When would Agnes have conceived the
                       child?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Oh, some time in January.

                                      MARTHA
                       Do you remember anything unusual
                       happening at the time?

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Earthquakes?

                                      MARTHA
                       Visitors to the convent.

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Nothing.

                                      MARTHA
                       Do you have a... a diary or a day book?

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Yes.

                                      MARTHA
                       Take at look at it.

       Mother Miriam moves to her desk and opens the day book.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       There's nothing here.

                                         MARTHA

                       Was the child full term?

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                               (reads through the book)
                       Oh, Dear God...

                                         MARTHA
                       What is it?

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                       The sheets...

                                         MARTHA
                       What sheets?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...


48   INT - CONVENT DINING ROOM - NIGHT


        In flashback: the sisters are sitting around the table at
dinner. SISTER GENEVIEVE, the other novice is serving them. Mother
Miriam folds up a linen    towel.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.)
                       ... I should have suspected something.

       In flashback, Mother Miriam addresses Agnes.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Sister Marguerite says you have been
                       sleeping on a bare mattress Sister.
                       Is that true?

                                         AGNES
                       Yes Mother.

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Why?

                                      AGNES
                       In the medieval days the nuns and monks
                       would sleep in their own coffins.

        Sister Marguerite gives a snort of derision. Mother Miriam
glances sharply
        at her, then turns back to Agnes.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.

                                      AGNES
                       It made them holy.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       It made them uncomfortable. And if

                       they didn't sleep well I'm certain the
                       next day they were cranky as mules.
                       Sister where are your sheets?
                               (no answer)
                       Do you really believe that sleeping on
                       a bare mattress is the equivalent of
                       sleeping in a coffin?

                                       AGNES
                       No.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Then tell me. Where are your sheets?

                                       AGNES
                       I burnt them.

                                                MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Why?

                                       AGNES
                               (a long pause)
                       They were stained.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       How many times have I burned into
                       your thick skull and the thick skull
                       of your fellow novice, that
                       menstruation is a perfectly natural
                       process and nothing to be ashamed of.

                                       AGNES
                       Yes, Mother.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Say it!

                                      AGNES and GENEVIEVE
                       It is a perfectly natural process and
                       nothing to be ashamed of.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Mean it!

        The two girls start to repeat it but Agnes starts to cry and
Genevieve
        falters into silence. Mother Miriam goes on more kindly.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       A few years ago one of the Sisters came
                       to me in tears, asking for comfort,
                       comfort because she was too old to
                       have any children. Not that she wanted
                       to, but once a month she had been
                       reminded of that possibility.

                                      AGNES
                       It's not that... it's not that...

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       What do you mean?

                                      AGNES
                       It's not my time of month.

                                              MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Should you see a doctor?

                                       AGNES
                       I don't know. I don't know what
                       happened Mother, I woke up... there
                       was blood on the sheets, but I don't
                       know what happened.
                               (starts to weep)
                       I don't know what I did wrong, I don't
                       know and I should be punished.

                                        MOTHER MIRIAM
                       For what?

                                      AGNES
                       I don't know... I don't know...

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.)
                       That was the beginning, the night of
                       the conception. That's why she burnt
                       the sheets.


49   INT - SICKROOM - NIGHT

        Still in flashback, Mother Miriam enters the room where
SISTER
PAUL lies dying. Father Martineau is there and many of the other
nuns singing hymns.

                                        MARTHA (V.O.)
                       When was that?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.)
                       The twenty third of January. On that
                       night one of our elder nuns passed away.

                                        MARTHA (V.O.)
                       Sister Paul?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.)
                       Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was.
                       I was needed in the sick room.

        Father Martineau annoints the old woman. Then Agnes quietly
slips in   unobserved. Sister Paul rallies for a moment, tries to say
a single silent
        word to her. The smile slips from Agnes' face. Then Sister
Paul
lies back

       and dies.


50   INT - CATHEDRAL - DAY

        Martha and the MONSIGNOR are walking through the church
talking. He is quite young and has a rather abrasive manner.

                                      (beginning missed)

                                      MARTHA
                       No.

                                      MONSIGNOR
                       Well you're probably right about
                       that. It certainly can't help Sister
                       Agnes to have this investigation
                       continued for any length of time.

                                      MARTHA
                       Why do you call it an investigation?
                       I never have.

                                      MONSIGNOR
                       Your mother was a resident of Saint
                       Catherines home before you moved
                       her.

                                      MARTHA
                       What does this have to do with..?


                                      MONSIGNOR
                       And you had a sister who died in the
                       convent.

                                      MARTHA
                       Who told you this?

                                      MONSIGNOR
                       Do you still go to church?

                                      MARTHA
                       What business is it of yours..?

                                      MONSIGNOR
                       Oh, we just wonder if you can be very
                       objective about this case.

                                      MARTHA
                       Look, Father, ah... just because I
                       don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs
                       you subscribe to...

                                       MONSIGNOR
                               (halting)
                       But what you believe makes no difference
                       to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does

                           make all the difference to Agnes.

                                      MARTHA
                       I don't understand. Are you expecting me
                       to..?

                                      MONSIGNOR
                       Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor.
                       You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse
                       me.

       Martha stares at him as he walks away.


51   EXT - CONVENT - DAY

        A single shot of the back of the convent and the belltower.
The
bell is
ringing.


52   INT - BELLTOWER - DAY

        Mother Miriam is ringing the bell and it takes quite a
considerable effort.


53   EXT - CONVENT FARMYARD - DAY

        Agnes has a wheelbarrow full of straw and manure. She dumps
it
on a pile.


54   INT - COWSHED - DAY

       Martha is watching Agnes milking a cow.

                                      MARTHA
                       Agnes, I'm here because I want to help
                       you.

                                         AGNES
                       I'm not sick.

                                      MARTHA
                       But you're troubled... aren't you?

                                              AGNES
                       That's because you keep reminding me.
                       If you go away then I'll forget.

                                      MARTHA
                       And you're unhappy.

                                      AGNES
                       Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't

                       you?

                                         MARTHA
                       Agnes...

                                        AGNES
                       Answer me!    You never answer me.

                                         MARTHA
                       Sometimes, yes.

                                         AGNES
                       Only you think    you're lucky because
                       you didn't have    a mother who said things
                       to you and did    things to you that maybe
                       weren't always    nice but that was because
                       of me, because    I was bad, not her.

       Agnes carries the milk pail round to the churn.

                                      MARTHA
                       What did you do?

                                         AGNES
                       I'm always bad.

                                      MARTHA
                       What did you do?

                                         AGNES
                       I breathed!

        Agnes falls to her knees. Martha moves round and kneels in
front of her.

                                       MARTHA
                       Agnes. What did your mother do to
                       you?
                               (no answer)
                       If you can't answer me, just shake
                       your head yes or no. Did... did she
                       hit you?
                               (Anges shakes her head: no)
                       Did she make you do something you
                       didn't want to?
                               (yes)
                       Did it make you feel uncomfortable
                       to do it?
                               (yes)
                       Did it embarrass you?
                               (yes)
                       Did it... did it hurt you?
                               (yes)
                       What did she make you you do?

                                         AGNES
                       No...

               MARTHA
You can tell me.

                  AGNES
I can't.

               MARTHA
She's dead isn't she?

                  AGNES
Yes.

               MARTHA
She can't hurt you any more.

                  AGNES
She can.

                  MARTHA
How?

               AGNES
She watches... she listens.

               MARTHA
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me.
I'll protect you from her.

                  AGNES
She...

                  MARTHA
Yes?

                  AGNES
... makes me...

                  MARTHA
Yes?

               AGNES
... take off my clothes and then...
she makes fun of me.

               MARTHA
She tells you you're ugly?

                  AGNES
Yes.

               MARTHA
And that you're stupid?

                  AGNES
Yes.

               MARTHA
That you're a mistake?

               AGNES
She says my whole body's a mistake.

                 MARTHA
Why?

               AGNES
Because she says if I don't watch out
I'll have a baby.

               MARTHA
How does she know that?

                 AGNES
Her headaches.

                 MARTHA
Oh, yes.

                 AGNES
And then...

                 MARTHA
What?

                AGNES
She touches me down there with a
cigarette.
        (Martha gasps)
Please Mommy, don't touch me like that
any more. I'll be good, I won't be a baby
any more.

               MARTHA
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do
something. I want you to pretend that
I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time
I want you to tell me what you're feeling,
alright?

                 AGNES
I'm afraid.

                 MARTHA
Please!    I want to help you. Let me help
you.

                 AGNES
Alright.

               MARTHA
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!...
what do you say?

                 AGNES
No I'm not.

                                         MARTHA
                       Are you pretty?

                                         AGNES
                       Yes.

                                      MARTHA
                       Agnes, you're stupid.

                                         AGNES
                       No I'm not.

                                      MARTHA
                       Are you intelligent?

                                       AGNES
                               (more forcefully)
                       Yes I am.

                                      MARTHA
                       You're a mistake.

                                       AGNES
                               (shouting)
                       I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I.
                       How can I be a mistake if I'm really
                       here. God doesn't make mistakes,
                       you're a mistake...

       Agnes is half shouting , half crying. Martha holds on to her.

                                      MARTHA
                       Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's
                       alright, it's alright, it's alright,
                       I love you.

                                      AGNES
                       Do you really love me or are you just
                       saying that?

                                      MARTHA
                       I really love you.

                                      AGNES
                       As much as Mother Miriam does?

                                      MARTHA
                       As much as God loves you.


55   INT - AGNES' OLD ROOM - DAY

        Martha is in there by herself smoking. The elderly nun
appears
at the door.

                                         ELDERLY NUN

                       I've been watching. We were fine 'till
                       she came. She brought the devil here.
                               (makes the sign
                               of the cross)
                       There was blood on her hand that night.

                                         MARTHA
                       Agnes?
                                  (the nun shakes
                                  her head)
                       Who?     Mother Superior?

                                         ELDERLY NUN
                       (in French)
                       ???

                                         MARTHA
                       What?

                                      ELDERLY NUN
                       Look into the convent records.

                                         MARTHA
                       Sister...

       But the nun has gone, walking quickly away down the corridor.


56   INT - RECORD ROOM - DAY

       Sister (?) enters to find Martha going through a cabinet.

                                       MARTHA
                               (slightly guiltily)
                       Oh, Good afternoon Sister, I... I'm
                       looking for some biographical data
                       on Sister Agnes, and Mother said I
                       might find it here.

        The Sister smiles, goes to another cabinet, extracts a file
and
hands it to
        her.

                                         MARTHA
                       Thank you.

        The Sister nods and without a word leaves the room. Martha
waits until she has gone, then opens the cabinet and pulls out
another file. Glancing at the    door, she compares the two files.
They both have the same surname Burchetti. The the door opens and
Mother Miriam is standing there.


                                         MARTHA
                       You lied to me

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM

                       About what?

                                       MARTHA
                               (brandishing the files)
                       Your niece!

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       I didn't tell you because I didn't
                       think it was important.

                                       MARTHA
                       No, it just makes you doubly
               responsible doesn't it?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       I never saw Agnes until she set foot
                       in this convent. My sister ran away
                       from home. We lost touch with her.
                       And when my husband died and I came
                       here, she wrote to me and asked me if
                       I would take care of Agnes in case
                       anything happened.

                                      MARTHA
                       And Agnes' father?

       Mother Miriam turns out of the room. Martha goes after her.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       It could have been any one of a dozen
                       men from what my sister told me.


57   INT - CORRIDOR - DAY

       Continuing, just outside the record room.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.)
                       She was afraid that Agnes would
                       follow in her footsteps. She did
                       everything she could to prevent it.

                                      MARTHA
                       Like keeping her home from school?

                                               MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Yes.

                                      MARTHA
                       Listening to angels?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       She drank too much. That's what killed
                       her.

                                      MARTHA
                       Do you know what she did to her?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       I don't think I care to know.

                                      MARTHA
                       She molested her!

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Oh, dear God.

                                      MARTHA
                       There is more here than meets the eye
                       isn't there? Lots of dirty little secrets.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                               (crying)
                       Oh God, if only I'd known.

                                      MARTHA
                       Why didn't you? You knew she was
                       keeping her home from school. You
                       knew she was an alcoholic.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       I knew that after the fact.

                                      MARTHA
                       Why didn't you do anything to stop her?

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Because I didn't know...
                               (she leaves)

                                       MARTHA
                       Oh, God.


       DISSOLVE TO:

58   INT - POLICE STATION, LARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

        Larry is interviewing a young PROSTITUTE in French. Martha
appears at the door.

                                       MARTHA
                       Larry...

                                      LARRY
                       Marty, what are you doing here?

                                      MARTHA
                       Larry there's got to be something
                       missing.

                                      LARRY
                       I gave you the pictures Marty, what
                       else do you want?

                                       MARTHA

                       Something they... that they overlooked.

                                     LARRY
                       What? You think that the girl is
                       innocent?

                                        MARTHA
                       I don't know.

                                      LARRY
                       You got to be crazy.

        Larry pulls out a pack of cigarettes, gives one to Martha and
to the
prostitute.

                                        MARTHA
                       Larry...

                                      LARRY
                       What's the matter with you, you've
                       seen the reports. It's a cut and dried
                       case.

                                      MARTHA
                       Maybe there's something that's not
                       in the report that should be.

                                       LARRY
                       You're too involved Marty.
                               (lights her cigarette)
                       Jesus look at you. Why don't you
                       turn this case over to someone else?

       Larry lights his own cigarette and comes over to Martha.

                                      LARRY (Cont.)
                       I'll ask around, see what I come up
                       with. In the meantime you go home
                       and get some sleep.

                                        MARTHA
                       Thanks.
                                 (she leaves)

                                       LARRY
                               (calling after her)
                       If I find anything I'll call you.


59   INT - MARTHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Martha takes off her coat, moves across the room turning on
lights. She
        flicks the answerphone on. Her cat meows.

                                      SECRETARY (V.O.)
                       Hi Marty, it's Helen. Mrs Davenport

                        called and was very upset that you'd
                        missed her appointment. She wants
                        you to call her at home, oh and a couple
                        of reporters have been trying to get a
                        hold of you about Sister Agnes. They
                        seem persistent and they may try to
                        reach you at home. I didn't give them
                        number.

       Some whirs and beeps. Martha goes into the bathroom.

                                        REPORTER (V.O.)
                                (French accent)
                        Hallo, Doctor Livingston. My name is
                        (?). I'm doing a Sunday article on
                        Sister Agnes for the Gazette. I would
                        appreciate it if you would give me a
                        phone call on 942-2424.

               More beeps and whirs. Martha starts to undress.

                                        LARRY (V.O.)
                        Hi Marty, it's me. Listen I just
                        talked with Detective Crawley who
                        was at the convent. She said that
                        there was one thing that bothered her
                        that didn't make it into the report.
                        The waste paper basket. The one in
                        Agnes' room.
                                (Martha freezes in the
                                middle of lighting up)
                        None of the other nuns had one. Bye.

       Martha rushes over to the answerphone and rewinds it.

                                       LARRY (V.O.)
                        ... her that didn't make it into the
                        report. The waste paper basket. The
                        one in Agnes' room. None of the other
                        nuns had one. Bye.

       Martha looks thoughtful and flicks off the desk lamp.


60   INT - CONVENT CHAPEL - DAY

        Father Martineau is saying Mass. All the sisters are there
singing together.      Father Martineau places the host in the
sconce,
incences it and raises it
        up. Close on individual nuns at prayer including Agnes.


       DISSOLVE TO:

61   INT - BARN - DAY

       Mother Miriam is kneeling in the doorway of the barn, praying

when Martha    enters. Mother Miriam pauses.

                                      MARTHA
                       I've gotten the court's permission
                       to hypnotise her.

       Mother Miriam makes the sign of the cross and stands up.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       And my permission?

                                                 MARTHA
                       I'd like yours too.

        Mother Miriam grabs a bucket and moves across the barn.
Martha
follows her.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       We'll see about that.

                                        MARTHA
                       Don't deny it!

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       I haven't decided yet.

                                      MARTHA
                       The woman's health is at stake.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Her spiritual health.

                                      MARTHA
                       I don't give a damn about her spiritual
                       health.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       I know you don't.

       Mother Miriam starts shovelling grain into the bucket.

                                      MARTHA
                       Sentence her and be done with it, that's
                       what you're saying and I...

                                        MOTHER MIRIAM

                       I am saying (distorted) a beautifully
                       simple woman...

                                      MARTHA
                       An unhappy woman...

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       She's happy with us and she could go
                       on being happy if she was left alone.

                                      MARTHA
                       Then why did you call the police in the
                       first place Mother, huh?

                                      MARTHA (cont.)
                       Why didn't you just throw the baby into
                       the incinerator and be done with it.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Because I am a moral person.

                                      MARTHA
                       Bullshit!

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Bullshit yourself!

                                      MARTHA
                       Catholic Church doesn't have a corner
                       on morality...

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Who said anything about the Catholic
                       Church...

                                      MARTHA
                       You just said...

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       What the hell has the Catholic Church
                       got to do with you?

                                      MARTHA
                       Nothing...

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       What have we done to hurt you? And
                       don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic
                       a mile away. What did we do? Burn a
                       few heretics, sell some indulgences?
                       That was in the days when the Church
                       was a ruling body. We let governments
                       do those things today. So what did we
                       do to you eh? You wanted to neck in the
                       back seat of a car when you were fifteen
                       and you couldn't because it was a sin?

        This time it is Martha who walks away and Mother Miriam who
follows her.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.)
                       So instead of questioning that one rule...

                                       MARTHA
                               (halting)
                       It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but
                       it wasn't sex. You know when I was in
                       the first grade my best friend was run

                          over on the way to school, you know what
                          the nun said? She died because she hadn't
                          said her morning prayers.

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                          Stupid woman... and that's all?

                                         MARTHA
                          That's all? That's enough!   She was a
                          beautiful little girl.

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                          And what has that to do with it?

                                         MARTHA
                          I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one.
                          She died, why not me? I never said my
                          morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was
                          scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all
                          over my face, do you know what the nun
                          called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me
                          Polkadot Livingston.

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                          So you left the Church because you had
                          freckles?

                                         MARTHA
                          No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the
                          Church cause I had freckles.

       They both cannot help laughing at this absurdity.


62   EXT - COURTYARD - DAY

        A couple of nuns walk across the courtyard. Another is
meditating alone. On
        a bench a nun kisses a dove and lets it fly away.


63   EXT - GAZEBO - DAY

        It is out the back of the convent near the belltower. Mother
Miriam and
Martha are sitting there talking. Martha is smoking.

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                          When I was a child I used to hear my
                          guardian angel. She sang to me 'till I
                          was six years old. That's when I stopped
                          listening. But I remember the voice. A
                          few years ago I looked at myself and saw
                          nothing but a nun who was certain of nothing.
                          Not even of Heaven. Not even of God. And
                          then one evening I saw Agnes standing by

                          her window, singing. And all my doubts about

                       myself and God were gone, in that one moment.
                       I recognized the voice. Please don't take it
                       away from me again Doctor Livingston. Those
                       years after six were very bleak.

                                       MARTHA
                       My sister died in a convent. And it's her
                       voice I hear.
                               (a long pause)
                       Does my smoking bother you?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       No, it reminds me.

                                      MARTHA
                       Would you like one? Huh?

                                        MOTHER MIRIAM
                       I'd love one.

        Martha hands her a cigarette and lights it for her. Mother
Miriam coughs a
        lot. Martha pats her on the back.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                       I'm out of prac...
                               (cough)
                       ... practice.
                               (cough)

                                        MARTHA
                       All right?

                                                 MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Fine thanks...

                                      MARTHA
                       Do you suppose the saints would have
                       smoked if tobacco had been popular
                       back then?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course
                       but, well Saint Thomas More...

                                       MARTHA
                               (chuckles)
                       Long, thin and filtered.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and
                       stub them out on the soles of his bare
                       feet.
                               (they roar with laughter)
                       And of course (distorted)

                                        MARTHA
                       Hand rolled.

                              MOTHER MIRIAM
               Even Christ would partake socially.

                                 MARTHA
               Saint Peter?

                                 MOTHER MIRIAM
               Pipe!

                                 MARTHA
               Right...

                                 MOTHER MIRIAM
               Mary Magdelen?

                               MARTHA
                       (imitating)
               Oh, you've come a long way baby.

                              MOTHER MIRIAM
               And Saint John would chew tobacco.

More laughter, then the moment because more serious.

                                 MARTHA
               Right.
                       (a pause)
               What do you suppose today's saints
               are smoking?

                              MOTHER MIRIAM
               There are no saints today. Good people
               yes, but extraordinarily good people...
               those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.

                              MARTHA
               Do you think they ever existed?

                                 MOTHER MIRIAM
               Yes I do.

                              MARTHA
               Do you want to become one?

                                 MOTHER MIRIAM
               Become?     One is born a saint.

                              MARTHA
               Well you can try, can't you, to be good?

                               MOTHER MIRIAM
               Yes, but goodness has very little to do
               with it. Not all the saints were good,
               in fact some of them were a little crazy.
               But... they were still attached to God.
               Agnes has that birth.
                       (she stands)

                         No more... we're born, we live, we die.
                         No room for miracles.
                                 (Martha gets up too)
                         Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.

       They start walking back to the convent.

                                        MARTHA
                         Do you think Agnes is still attached to
                         God?

                                        MOTHER MIRIAM
                         Listen to her singing.

                                         MARTHA
                                 (a pause)
                         I'd like to begin.

                                        MOTHER MIRIAM
                         Begin what?

                                        MARTHA
                         The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?

                                        MOTHER MIRIAM
                         Would it stop you if I did?

                                        MARTHA
                         No.

       They both halt.

                                        MOTHER MIRIAM
                         May I be present?

                                        MARTHA
                         Of course.

                                        MOTHER MIRIAM
                         Then let's begin.


64   INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY

        The room is painted white and completely empty with a steeply
sloping    ceiling. Agnes is sitting on a chair with her eyes closed,
already under   hypnosis. Martha and Mother Miriam are facing her.

                                        MARTHA
                         You're listening to a chorus of angels.
                         The music surrounds you like a...
                         warm and, comfortable pool of water.
                         And while you're sleeping, you're
                         going to be able to recall, all the things
                         that we want you to remember. And
                         when I count to three and clap my hands,
                         you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you
                         hear me.

                                           AGNES
                         Yes.

                                           MARTHA
                         Who am I?

                                        AGNES
                         Doctor Livingston.

                                        MARTHA
                         And why am I here?

                                           AGNES
                         To help me.

                                        MARTHA
                         Good. Would you like to tell me why
                         you're here?

                                        AGNES
                         Because I'm in trouble.

                                         MARTHA
                         What kind of trouble?
                                 (no answer)
                         What kind of trouble Agnes?

          Martha starts to walk around behind Agnes.

                                           AGNES
                         I'm frightened.

                                           MARTHA
                         Of what?

                                           AGNES
                         Of telling you.

                                        MARTHA
                         But it's easy. It's just a breath with
                         sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?

                                         AGNES
                                 (a pause)
                         I had a baby.

          Both Martha and Mother Miriam react with some degree of
relief.

                                        MARTHA
                         How did you have a baby?

                                        AGNES
                         It came out of me.

                                        MARTHA
                         Did you know what was going to come

out?

                  AGNES
Yes.

               MARTHA
Did you want it to come out?

                  AGNES
No.

                  MARTHA
Why?

               AGNES
Because I was afraid.

               MARTHA
Why were you afraid?

               AGNES
Because I wasn't worthy.

                  MARTHA
To be a mother?

                  AGNES
Yes.

                  MARTHA
Why?

               AGNES
May I open my eyes now?

               MARTHA
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not
yet. How did the baby get into you?

                  AGNES
It grew.

               MARTHA
What made it grow? Do you know?

                  AGNES
Yes.

               MARTHA
Would you like to tell me?

                  AGNES
No.

               MARTHA
Did anyone else know about the baby?

                  AGNES

               I can't tell you that.

                              MARTHA
               Will she be angry?

                              AGNES
               She made me promise not to.

                                  MARTHA
               Who?     Who made you promise?
                          (no answer)
               It's    alright Agnes. It's alright.
                          (a pause)
               Let's    go to your room. It's the night
               about    six weeks ago when you were
               very    sick.

                                 AGNES
               I'm afraid.

                              MARTHA
               Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright.
               I want you to tell me what you did
               before you went to bed.

                                 AGNES
               I ate.

                              MARTHA
               Hm hmm. What did you have for
               dinner?

                                 AGNES
               Fish...
                       (distastefully)
               ... brussel sprouts.

                              MARTHA
               You don't like brussel sprouts?

                                 AGNES
               I hate them.

Martha and Mother Miriam can't help smiling.

                              MARTHA
               And then what happened?

                              AGNES
               We went to chapel for vespers.

                                 MARTHA
               Hm hmm.

                              AGNES
               I left early because I wasn't feeling
               very well.

Suddenly Agnes leaps up from her chair.

                              MARTHA
               What is it?

                              AGNES
               Someone's following me.

                              MARTHA
               Who?

                              AGNES
               Sister Marguerite I think.

                               MARTHA
               Was it Sister Marguerite who knew
               about the baby?
                       (no answer)
               Alright Agnes, I want you to see your
               room as you saw it on that night.

                               MARTHA (Cont.)
               Open your eyes.
                       (she opens them)
               What do you see?

                              AGNES
               My bed.

                              MARTHA
               What else?

                              AGNES
               A crucifix.

                              MARTHA
               Above the bed? Any... anything else?
               What do you you see, something
               different? What is it?

                               AGNES
                       (puzzled)
               A wastepaper basket.

                              MARTHA
               Do you know who put it there?

                              AGNES
               No.

                              MARTHA
               What do you think it's there for?

                              AGNES
               For me to get sick in.

                              MARTHA
               Are you ill?

                                         AGNES
                       Yes.

                                      MARTHA
                       What do you feel?

                                      AGNES
                       I feel as if I've eaten glass.

                                         MARTHA
                       What do you do?

                                      AGNES
                       I have to throw up...

       And she falls to her knees, retching horribly.

                                      AGNES (Cont.)
                       I can't... glass... one of the sisters
                       has fed me glass.

                                         MARTHA
                       Which one?

                                      AGNES
                       I don't know which one (distorted)

                                         MARTHA
                       Of what?

                                       AGNES
                       Of me. Oh... God! My God...
                               (assumes the birth
                               position and looks
                               between her legs)
                       Water... it's all water...

                                      MARTHA
                       Why isn't anyone coming?

                                       AGNES
                               (trying to wipe up
                               the water)
                       They can't hear me that's why.
                               (in terrible pain)
                       Oh God... I don't wanna...

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                               (to Martha)
                       Stop her!

        Then Agnes tries to crawl away as though terrified of
something.

                                         MARTHA
                       What is it?

               AGNES

Please get away from me...

               MARTHA
Who?

               AGNES
Go away, I don't want you here.

               MARTHA
Is someone in the room with you?

               AGNES
No... don't hit me please...

                MOTHER MIRIAM
Stop this, she'll hurt herself
        (stepping forward)
I'm not going to allow this.

                MARTHA
        (hauling her away)
NO... no... I said leave her alone.

               AGNES
       (still screaming)

You're trying to take my baby... trying
to take my baby... no...
        (then quietly)
It wasn't my fault Mommy... it was a
mistake Mommy.

                MARTHA
Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two
three...
        (claps her hands;
        Agnes comes to)
It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston,
it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes,
thankyou. How do you feel?

               AGNES
Frightened.

               MARTHA
Do you remember what just happened?

               AGNES
       (a long pause)
Yes.

               MARTHA
That's good. Do you feel well enough
to stand?

               AGNES

                          Yes.

          Martha helps her to her feet. Agnes clings to her.

                                         MARTHA
                          There you go. It's alright, it's alright,
                          it's all over. It's alright Agnes, that's
                          right, that's right.


65      EXT - LAND REGISTRY - DAY

          Martha approaches the building and enters it.


66      INT - RECORD ROOM - DAY

          The camera tracks through shelves of ancient records and
maps.

                                          MARTHA (off)
                          Ah excuse me. Hallo. I'm looking
                          for some ah... ground plans for the
                          ah... Saint Marie Madeleine Convent
                          in (distorted).

                                            MAN (off)
                                    (answers in French)

               Martha and a middle aged official come into view. He
stops
at a long set of        drawers and starts looking through it.

                                            MAN
                                    (in French)


                                            MARTHA
                                    (replies in French)

                                         MAN
                  Oh... very interesting I guess...
                                 (he pulls out a
                                 folder of plans)
                  Excuse me...

        He sets the folder down on a table and starts going through
it.
They both
look at the plans.

                                          MAN (Cont.)
                          Ah viola! This has everything. Even
                          the secret entrance. They all had
                          that. Usually to get from building to
                          building in the snow...
                                  (he indicates on
                                  the plan)

                          ... like that one.

                                          MARTHA
                                  (murmurs)
                          That's how he got in... or she got
                          out.

                                         MAN
                          Oh excuse me, what did you say?

                                         MARTHA
                          Nothing. May I take some notes?

                                         MAN
                          Oh yes, (distorted)

       Martha starts drawing a rough plan.


67   INT - CRYPT - DAY

        The crypt is deserted but candles are burning in front of a
statue of Saint Michael. Martha walks over to it,lights a candle and
goes behind it and
        finds a stairway there leading underground. She goes down
into...


68   INT - TUNNEL - DAY

        Martha walks through the dimly lit passage. She stops for a
moment to look
        at a cross carved on the stone floor, then continues. Finally
she reaches
        more steps and goes up into the...


69   INT - BARN - DAY

        Martha emerges through a trapdoor in to the barn which is
full
of doves. It    begins to make sense for her.


70   EXT - CITY - DAY

        Various closeups of famous statues. A bell is tolling. Two
nuns
come out of
        a building, down streets, across the road as though traffic
did
not exist
        and into another building.


71   INT - LIFT - DAY

       The nuns are Sister Anne and Mother Miriam. In the lift an

OFFICE GIRL
        checks her lipstick in the reflective metal walls. The lift
stops and the
        Sisters get off.


72   INT - CORRIDOR - DAY

       They walk down the modern carpeted corridor into...


73   INT - MARTHA'S OFFICE - DAY

       Mother Miriam addresses the secretary, HELEN.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Is the Doctor in her office?

                                      HELEN
                       Ah, who shall I say is calling?

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                               (grimly)
                       General MacArthur.

       She heads onto Martha's office. Helen jumps up after her.

                                      HELEN
                       Just a minute please, you can't go in
                       there.

       Mother Miriam pushes the door open to reveal Martha.

                                              MARTHA
                               (standing)
                       It's... it's alright Helen, just close
                       the door.

        Mother Miriam walks in and throws some papers down onto
Martha's desk.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       I've just met with the bishop. We're
                       taking you off the case.

                                       MARTHA
                               (picking up the papers)
                       You're what?

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                       If we want to hire a psychiatrist for
                       Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you.
                               (starts to leave)

                                      MARTHA
                       One that will ask the questions you
                       want asked.

                MOTHER MIRIAM
        (halting)
One that will approach this matter
with some objectivity and respect.

                  MARTHA
For the Church?

                  MOTHER MIRIAM
For Agnes.

               MARTHA
You think she's a saint?

               MOTHER MIRIAM
She's been touched by God, yes.

               MARTHA
How? How? She hallucinates, stops
eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is
that supposed to convince me she
shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.

                  MOTHER MIRIAM
The father!

                  MARTHA
Who is he?

               MOTHER MIRIAM
Why must he be anybody?

                MARTHA
        (laughs and sits down)
My God, you're as crazy as...

               MOTHER MIRIAM
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth,
I'm saying...

               MARTHA
How (distorted) ?

               MOTHER MIRIAM
Don't be ridiculous.

               MARTHA
Well give me a reasonable explanation

               MOTHER MIRIAM
A miracle is an event without an
explanation. If she's capable of putting
a hole in her hand without benefit of a
nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her
womb?

                  MARTHA
This is insane.

               MOTHER MIRIAM
There as no man in the convent on that
night and no way for any man to get in
or out.

               MARTHA
You're saying God did it?

                  MOTHER MIRIAM

No, that's as much as saying Father
Martineau did it. I'm saying God
permitted it.

               MARTHA
But how did it happen?

               MOTHER MIRIAM
You'll never find the answer for
everything God did.

               MARTHA
I thought you didn't believe in miracles
today Mother?

               MOTHER MIRIAM
But I want the opportunity to believe.
I want the choice to believe.

                  MARTHA
But what    you are choosing to believe
is a lie    because you won't face the fact
that she    was raped... or seduced...
or that    she did the seducing.

               MOTHER MIRIAM
She is an innocent.

               MARTHA
But she is not an enigma Mother.
Everything that Agnes has done is
explainable from modern psychiatry.
One, two, three, right down the line.

               MOTHER MIRIAM
That's what you believe she is?     The
sum of her psychological parts?

               MARTHA
That's what I have to believe...

                MOTHER MIRIAM
Then why are you so obsessed with her?
You're losing sleep over her?
        (Martha gets up disturbed)
You're thinking about her all the time.
You're bent on saving her. Why?

       Martha has no answer.

                                        MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.)
                                (calmer)
                        I'm not accusing. I'm recognizing.

                                       MARTHA
                        There's a tunnel out of the crypt into
                        the barn. Did you know about that?
                        There's an answer Mother. That's how
                        she got out.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                        That's crazy. How could she find out
                        about it?

                                       MARTHA
                        Somebody told her.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                        Who? That tun... that tunnel hasn't
                        been used in fifty years.

                                       MARTHA
                        Oh, would you stop lying Mother!

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                        Why would I lie?

                                       MARTHA
                        Because it's murder we're talking about.
                        Aren't you concerned about what she told
                        us about the other person in her room.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                        I'm concerned about her health.

                                       MARTHA
                        Who was that person Mother?    Was it
                        you?

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                        If you believe this is murder, it is the
                        Crown attorney you have to talk to, not
                        me. And definitely not Agnes.

       She goes out and slams the door.


74   EXT - POND - DAY

        After a couple of establishing shots of the convent, the nuns
are shown ice   skating on the frozen pond. They are quite
uninhibited, like little
        children. Their singing (off) from the chapel continues until
the end of
        scene 78.

75   INT - CHAPEL - DAY

        Sister Genevieve, the other novice is being consecrated. She
approaches the altar all dressed in white, carrying a single candle
and kneels down.


76   INT - LAW COURTS - DAY

        Martha and Justice Leveau come up the steps and into the
corridor.

                                         MARTHA
                          All I want is one more week.

                                          LEVEAU
                          Why?
                                    (continues in French,
                                          then...)
                           You've done nothing to show any progress.

                                         MARTHA
                          Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.

                                         LEVEAU
                          You're getting to all of us Martha, let's
                          face it.

                                         MARTHA
                          I'll have a decision by next week.

                                         LEVEAU
                          It's gone on long enough. You're out.

                                         MARTHA
                          Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.

                                          LEVEAU
                                  (halting)
                          You have proof?

                                          MARTHA
                          I'll have it.

                                                   LEVEAU
                          When?

                                          MARTHA
                          Next week.


                                          LEVEAU
                                  (walking on)
                          No, no, no...

                                          MARTHA

                          I can get you new evidence next week.

                                            LEVEAU
                          No!

                                         MARTHA
                          Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by
                          tomorrow. I will.

       They reach the door of Leveau's office. He thinks...

                                            LEVEAU
                          Yes, demain (?)


77   INT - CHAPEL - DAY

        The scene consists of a number of shots dissolving into one
another. Sister Genevieve lying face down in front of the bishop,
Genevieve praying on her   knees, her family (4) watching from
behind the grilled gate. Genevieve's
        hair being cut, her joy at the habit being fitted to her,
running out to
        join her family, a jolly old singalong on the piano, this
time
the nuns
        singing along from    behind the gate.


78   EXT - CONVENT - DAY

        Martha drives up in her car and walks across the now snow
covered grounds to    the convent.


79   INT - MOTHER MIRIAM'S OFFICE - DAY

        Mother Miriam is working away at her desk when a nun
interrupts. Singing   from the party can faintly be heard.

                                                 NUN (off)
                          Excuse me Mother, Doctor Livingston
                          is here.

        Mother Miriam nods tiredly and goes to meet Martha at he
door.
Martha hands    her a court order. Mother Miriam reads it briefly
and hands it back.

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                          This is permission to take her apart.

                                            MARTHA
                          Where is she?

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM
                          Hasn't she had enough?

                              MARTHA
               I have a few more questions to ask her.

                              MOTHER MIRIAM
               My God, but you're determined.

They move back into the room.

                              MARTHA
               Who knew she was pregnant?

                              MOTHER MIRIAM
               Why do you insist upon pressing...

                                 MARTHA
               Was it you?

                              MOTHER MIRIAM
               Is it because she's a nun?

                              MARTHA
               Did you know she was pregnant?

                                 MOTHER MIRIAM
               Yes.

                              MARTHA
               And you didn't send her to a doctor.

                              MOTHER MIRIAM
               I didn't guess until it was too late.

                                 MARTHA
               For what?     An abortion?

                              MOTHER MIRIAM
               Oh, don't be ridiculous.

                              MARTHA
               Too late for what?

                              MOTHER MIRIAM
               I don't know... too late to stop it.

                                 MARTHA
               The baby?

                                 MOTHER MIRIAM
               The scandal...

                              MARTHA
               You went to the room to help with
               the birth.

                              MOTHER MIRIAM
               She didn't want any help.

                                 MARTHA

                       You wanted that child out of the way.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                       That's a lie.

                                      MARTHA
                       You hid the wastepaper basket in her
                       room.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       I didn't hide it. I put it there for the
                       blood and the dirty sheets.

                                       MARTHA
                       And the baby.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM
                       No!

                                      MARTHA
                       You tied the cord around its neck.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       I wanted her to have it when no-one else
                       was around, they would have taken the
                       baby to a hospital and left it with them,
                       but it was such a difficult birth, there
                       was so much blood and I panicked.

                                      MARTHA
                       Before or after you killed the child?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       I left it with her and I went for help.

                                      MARTHA
                       I doubt that's what she'd say.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM
                       Then she's a liar.


80   INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY

        It is the same as before, except that this time Martha and
Mother Miriam are      standing.

                                      MARTHA
                       Agnes, can you hear me?

                                       AGNES
                       Yes.

                                      MARTHA
                       I want you to remember if you can a
                       night last January. The night Sister
                       Paul died. Do you remember.

        There is a flash cut to Sister Paul being annointed. Agnes
stirs slightly.

                                      MARTHA (Cont.)
                       What's the matter?

        There is another flash cut, this time of Sister Paul saying
that mysterious word that we could not previously understand.

                                      AGNES
                       She said Michael.

                                      MARTHA
                       What did she mean?

        There is a third flash cut of the shrine of Saint Michael in
the crypt.

                                       AGNES
                       The statue. She had shown it to me
                       the day before.

                                      MARTHA
                       And the passage to the barn?

                                      AGNES
                       Yes.

                                      MARTHA
                       Why?

                                      AGNES
                       So I could go to him.

                                      MARTHA
                       Who?

                                      AGNES
                       Him.

                                      MARTHA
                       How did she know about him?

                                      AGNES
                       She'd seen him too.

                                      MARTHA
                       Where?

                                      AGNES
                       From the belltower the day she before
                       she died.

                                      MARTHA
                       So she sent you?

                                      AGNES
                       Yes.

81   INT - TUNNEL - NIGHT

        In flashback:    Agnes is walking alone through the tunnel
carrying an oil
        lamp.

                                           MARTHA (V.O.)
                          What happened?

       Agnes keeps walking and finally goes up the steps into...


82   INT - BARN - NIGHT

        Still in flashback, Agnes emerges into the barn. The doves
flap
about as
        Agnes    moves nervously through the barn.

                                           AGNES (V.O.)
                          He's here.


83   INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY

       Back to the present:

                                         MARTHA
                          Are you frightened?

                                           AGNES
               Yes.


84   INT - BARN - NIGHT

        In flashback: the doves continue to make flapping and
bumping
sounds as
        they fly around the barn.

                                           AGNES
                          Hallo...


85   INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY

       In the present:

                                         AGNES
                          ... where are you?


86   INT - BARN - NIGHT

       In flashback:

                                         AGNES
                          Is it you?


        Then she seems to be talking to someone although we can see
nothing except the doves.

                                         AGNES (Cont.)
                          I... I'm afraid... yes, yes I do...
                          why me?... wait, I want to see you.


                                         MARTHA (V.O.)
                          What do you see?


87   INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY

       In the present:

                                         AGNES
                          Halos...


88   INT - BARN - NIGHT

        In flashback: Agnes is still in the barn but now she is
lying
on her back.
        Still all we can see are doves flashing in the light.

                                         AGNES (V.O.)
                          ... dividing and dividing feathers and
                          starts, falling, falling into the iris of
                          God's eye. Oh... oh!... it's... it's so
                          lovely... it's so... blue... yellow...
                          blood wings, brown, blood...

       And she lifts up her hands.


89   INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY

        In the present: as she lifts up her hands, Agnes is
horrified
to see two
        holes in her palms weeping blood.

                                         AGNES
                          His blood... my God...

       Martha and Mother Miriam are equally shocked.

                                         MARTHA
                          Oh Agnes...

       Agnes runs terrified over to the walls blood pouring over her

white habit.    Mother Miriam rushes after her.

                                       AGNES
                       It's bleeding... I'm bleeding...
                       my God it won't stop, I can't get it
                       to stop.
                               (to Mother Miriam)
                       Let go of me, I wish you were dead.

                                       MARTHA
                               (trying to hold her)
                       Agnes... Agnes...

        Agnes breaks free and runs over to another wall smearing it
too
with blood.     Martha follows her.

                                      AGNES
                       Stay away from me...

                                      MARTHA
                       Agnes it had nothing to do with the
                       hand of God. He did a terrible thing
                       to you, do you understand?

                                         AGNES
                       No...

                                         MARTHA
                       He    frightened you and he hurt you. It's
                       not    your fault. It's his fault. Tell us
                       who    he is so we can find him. Stop
                       him    from doing this to other women.

                                      AGNES
                       Not your fault...

                                      MARTHA
                       Agnes who did you see?

                                         AGNES
                       I hate him...

                                              MARTHA
                       Of course you do. Who was it?

                                      AGNES
                       I hate him for what he did to me.

                                         MARTHA
                       Yes.

                                      AGNES
                       For what he made me go through.

                                         MARTHA
                       Who?

                                        AGNES
                       I hate him.

                                      MARTHA
                       Agnes, who did this to you?

       Agnes flings her arms back against the wall.

                                       AGNES
                       God!  It was God.
                               (sinks to her knees)
                       And now I'll burn in hell because I
                       hate him.

                                      MARTHA
                       Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's
                       alright to hate him.

                       It was dead.

                       It was alive wasn't it?

                                      AGNES
                       I don't remember.

                               (screaming)
                       Oh, don't do this!

                       YES!

        Somehow this declaration seems to calm them down somewhat.
Mother Miriam   is looking utterly resigned.

                                      MARTHA
                       Mother Miriam was with you wasn't

                        Yes.

                        She took the baby in her arms?

                                       AGNES
                        Yes.

                        And then... what did she do?
                                (no answer)
                        Agnes what did she do?

                                       AGNES
                        She... left me alone with that little
                        thing, and I looked at it, and I thought
                        this is a mistake. But it's my mistake,
                        not Mommy's. God's mistake.

                                        AGNES (cont.)
                        I thought I... I can save her.
                                (she raises her hands)
                        I can give her back to God.

                                       MARTHA
                        What did you do?

                                       AGNES
                        I put her to sleep.

                                       MARTHA
                        H... how?

                                       AGNES
                        I tied the cord around her neck...
                        wrapped her in the bloody sheets...
                        and stuffed her in the trash can.

        Mother Miriam gives a shuddering sigh, makes the sign of the
cross and
prays. Martha claps her hands lightly together once.

91   INT - COURT ROOM - DAY

       All the main characters are present: Eve, Lyon, Martha,

Agnes,
Sister   Marguerite and Mother Miriam. Justice Leveau is summing
up.

                                       LEVEAU
                        In view of the situation as it now
                        stands, and the testimony given here
                        this morning, it seems quite clear
                        that the defendant was in no manner
                        responsible for her actions. It is
                        therefore the judgement of this court
                        that she be returned to the convent of
                        Marie Madeleine where she will be cared
                        for under proper medical supervision by
                        a visiting physician.

        Both Martha and Mother Miriam show relief at this. Justice
Leveau continues
        to sum up in French when suddenly Agnes stands up.


                                               LEVEAU (Cont.)
                                (surprised)
                        Oui. Do you have something to say?

                                        AGNES
                                (a long pause)
                        I stood in the window of my room
                        every night for a week. And one night
                        I heard the most beautiful voice
                        imaginable. And when I looked I saw
                        the moon shining down on him. For six
                        nights he sang to me, songs I'd never
                        heard. And on the seventh night he
                        opened his wings and lay on top of me.
                        All the while he sang -
                                (sings)
                        Charlie Sweet... Charlie Sweet...
                        Charlie's a...

                                       LEVEAU
                        Please, remove her from the court.

         Martha and Mother Miriam step forward uncertainly.

                                        LEVEAU
                        Would someone please remove the
                        defendant from the courtroom.
                                (continues in French)

         The nuns lead Agnes, still singing past Martha and out of the
court.

92   EXT - CONVENT - DAY

        It is full winter; many shots of the convent and surroundings
dissolving
        into one another.

                                      MARTHA (V.O.)
                       I don't know the meaning behind the
                       song she sang. Perhaps it was a song
                       of seduction. And the father was a
                       fieldhand. Perhaps the song was simply
                       a lullaby that she remembered from many
                       years ago. And the father was hope and...
                       and love and desire. And a belief in
                        miracles.

        The nuns are seen walking together through the snow back to
the
convent over    which Agnes' singing can be heard.

                                      MARTHA (V.O.)
                       I want to believe that she was blessed.
                       And I do miss her, and I hope that she's
                       left something, some little part of
                       herself with me. That would be miracle
                       enough wouldn't it?

          INT      PAPAL APARTMENT      DAY
          
          CLOSE ON an ornate ring.     It's intricately carved with a seal, an
          image of St. Peter casting a net.     The ring is carried on a satin
          pillow through a darkened, regal apartment.     In the distance,
          BELLS ARE TOLLING   -- the slow, solemn tones that announce a death.
          
          A dozen men in scarlet cassocks, ROMAN CATHOLIC CARDINALS, bend
          down to inspect the ring, nodding in affirmation, part of an
          ancient ritual.
          
          A younger man (the CAMERLENGO) in a black cassock takes a silver
          knife and scratches the ring's seal twice, once horizontally and
          once vertically, in the sign of the cross.
          
          Now the ring is placed on a lead block.    The Camerlengo raises a
          silver mallet and SMASHES it down, shattering the ring into a
          thousand tiny pieces.
          
          As the Cardinals confirm to their satisfaction that the ring has
          been destroyed, the HUSHED VOICE of a NEWS REPORTER comes over the
          image.

          the Cardinals file out in a solemn procession. Behind them, the
          Camerlengo closes and locks the doors to the apartment entrance,
          helped by an AIDE who stretches red silk across the doors in the
          form of an X.

          of hot wax, then raises a seal and BURNS it into the wax with a
          hot SIZZLE.    TWO SWISS GUARDSMEN, traditionally attired, step in

          brilliant red robes, seated near the altar.

          he's got someone to beat.    His strokes echo off vacant bleachers
          in an oldish college natatorium.

          his right hand. Langdon, curious, makes his way back to him.
          Takes the paper ---
          
          --- and, it is safe to say, feels the earth give way beneath his
          feet.     He looks up, eyes wide, and mutters a single word:

          Incredible.    Either someone just
          figured out how to make this, or they
          found it.    Recently.    Which would
          mean the llluminati have returned.

          It's worse than just that.    Four
          cardinals were kidnapped from their
          quarters inside the Vatican some time
          between three and five a.m. this
          morning. Shortly afterward, the Office
          of the Swiss Guard received that
          document, along with the threat that
          the Cardinals will be publicly
          executed, one per hour, starting at
          seven p.m. tonight, in Rome.

                            Initially, they were physicists,
                            mathematicians, astronomers.      Their
                            name means "the Enlightened Ones." In
                            the 1500s, they started meeting
                            secretly to share their concerns about
                            the church's inaccurate teachings.
                            They were dedicated to the quest for
                            scientific truth.     And for that, the

                            them down and killed them.      Drove

          The helicopter SWOOPS over St. Peter's Square, filled with more
          tourists than usual, due to the impending start of Conclave.
          
          We drift toward a structure on the far side of the Square, closer
          to its huge, ornate windows.    As we approach, large swaths of

          --- it's the Sistine Chapel.   As the last window is blackened,
          the room is bathed in a profound darkness lit only by candles.
          
          ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-ONE MEN in red robes are gathered inside the
          Chapel, the College of Cardinals.    They talk in a polyglot of
          languages, milling about the place, conferring, catching up on old
          friendships.
          
          Cardinal Mortati, the Dean of the College who led the Pope's elegy
          mass, is the type of man one crosses a room to see, not the other

          They turn a corner and approach a squat stone building labeled
          "Offizia della Guarda Suiza."
          
          TWO SWISS GUARDSMEN are standing outside the entrance to the
          building.    They're somewhat comically dressed in puffy tunics
          vertically striped in brilliant blue and gold, with matching
          pantaloons and spats, topped by a black beret.
          
          Langdon can't completely hide a smile.    Olivetti notices.    The
          Guards raise their eight-foot swords, allowing the three of them
          to enter the building.

          The interior of the Swiss Guard offices is ornate and filled with
          artwork, like every other Vatican building.    As they walk,
          Langdon studies the row of statues of male nudes that lines both
          sides of the hallway, all wearing fig leaves.

                           inspire lust, so he got a hammer and
                           chisel and unmanned two hundred
                           statues.    These plaster fig leaves

          Olivetti stops abruptly, outside a heavy steel door with a
          security keyguard beside it.

                           The Swiss Guard is a calling, not a
                           profession, and it encourages a certain
                           -- zealotry.   Commander Rocher, the
                           head of the Guard, is a deeply
                           spiritual man, and he was close to the
                           late Pope.    Understood?

          The headquarters of the Swiss Guard is in a lushly adorned
          Renaissance library crammed with sophisticated communications and
          surveillance equipment.    It's crowded, Swiss Guard (in suits and
          ties, the pantaloons are more for show), uniformed Carbinieri, and
          Vatican Police crammed around different stations, some working
          together, others arguing, mostly in Italian.

          He crosses the room to a tall, fair-haired man around sixty,
          weathered like steel -- maybe "tempered" is the better word.
          
          While they confer, Langdon notices a woman to his left.    We
          recognize Vittoria Vetra, the physicist we saw at CERN.
          
          She catches Langdon's eye, forces a grim smile, recognizes they're
          both strangers here.    Olivetti comes back with COMMANDER ROCHER,
          the tall man, very much in charge.    He speaks with a French/Swiss

                           That's right. Rocher looks him up and
                           down, so, you're Langdon.
          
                                         ROCHER
                           Thank God, the symbologist is here.
                           Ms. Vetra, this way, please.
          
          He leads Vittoria across the room, to a surveillance monitor.
          Langdon, puzzled by the cold shoulder, looks at Olivetti, who
          leans in.
          
                                         OLIVETTI
                           There's been a development.    We
                           received another threat from the

          Across the room, they hear Vittoria GASP.   Olivetti goes to join
          them, nodding to Langdon to follow.
          
          AT THE MONITOR,
          
          Langdon and Olivetti join Rocher and Vittoria and stare at the
          image on a video monitor -- it's a familiar-looking canister, in
          which a metallic drop of liquid shimmers in the middle, suspended.
          The acronym CERN is stenciled up its side.     On its base is an
          LED display, counting down from about six hours.
          
          At the top of the monitor flashes superimposed text -- LIVE FEED,

                           Don't you guys read your own history?
                           1668.     The church kidnapped four
                           llluminati scientists and branded
                           their chests with the symbol of the
                           cross.     To "purge their sins."
                           Murdered them and left their bodies in
                           the street as a warning to others to
                           stop questioning church rulings on
                           scientific matters.     It was after La
                           Purga that a darker, more violent
                           llluminati emerged.     This sounds
                           like retribution.
                                 (to Rocher)
                           Is there any more?
          
          Rocher hits play again.
          
                                         VOICE (O.S.)
                           .... and then bring your church down
                           upon you.    Vatican City will be
                           consumed by light...
          
          While listening this time, Langdon notices a darkened video
          monitor, inlaid at an angle on Rocher's desk.    It faces away
          from the outer office, and instead of an on/off switch, there is
          an oddly-shaped keyhole.
          
                                         VOICE (O.S.) (cont'd)
                           A shining star at the end of the Path
                           of Illumination.
          
          Langdon looks up sharply.
          
                                       20.
          
          
          
                                         LANGDON
                           The Path of Illumination?
          
          Rocher stops the video.
          
                                         LANGDON (cont'd)
                           I need to get into the Vatican
                           Archives.
          
          Rocher shakes his head, looks at Olivetti harshly, is embarrassed.
          
                                         OLIVETTI
                           Professor, this is not the appropriate
                           moment to-
          
                                         ROCHER
                           Your petition has been denied seven
                           times, Mr. Langdon.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           This has nothing to do with that,
                                (FAST)
                           The Path of Illumination is an ancient
                           trail through Rome that leads to the
                           Church of the Illumination, a secret
                           place where llluminati members could
                           meet in safety.    If I can find the
                           Segno, the sign that marks the start
                           of the Path, I'm willing to bet the
                           four churches along it are where he
                           intends to murder your cardinals. If
                           we can get to one of them before he
                           does, we can stop it.    But to find
                           the start of the path, I need to get
                           into the Archives.

                           Even if I wanted to help you, access
                           is only by written decree of the

                           Yes.    But as you've no doubt heard,
                           the Holy Father is-

                           What about Il Camerlengo?   Let me
                           talk to him.

                                         ROCHER
                           The Camerlengo? He's just a priest
                           here, the former Pope's Chamberlain.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           Doesn't the power of the Holy See rest
                           with him during tempe sede vacante?
          
          They just stare at him. Shit, this guy's good. Langdon checks his
          watch, getting irritated.

                           Hey, fellas --- you called me.
          
                                                                     CUT TO:
          
          
          
          INT     PAPAL OFFICES      DAY
          
          A spectacular view of St. Peter's Square, through the windows of
          the Papal offices.    Moving down, we find a figure dressed in a
          simple black cassock, his back to us, staring out at the crowd.
          FATHER SEBASTIAN GUTTIEREZ, the Camerlengo, speaks with a soft
          Spanish accent.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           His Holiness once told me that a Pope
                           is a man torn between two worlds...
                           the real world and the divine.
          
          Assembled in the grand office are Langdon, Rocher, Olivetti, and
          Vittoria.    The Camerlengo's back is still turned.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO (cont'd)
                           He warned that any church that ignored
                           reality would not survive to enjoy the
                           divine.
          
          He turns around.    He's younger than we thought, in his mid-
          thirties, deep, dark eyes.    The kind of priest who often
          inspires, before the years of dogma catch up with him.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO (cont'd)
                           It seems the real world is upon us
                           tonight.
                                (to Langdon)
                           I'm familiar with llluminati lore, and
                           the legend of the brandings.    La
                           Purga is a dark stain on the church's
                           history; I'm not surprised this ghost
                           has come back to haunt us.
          
                                          22.
          
          
          
          He sits behind the massive desk, and if he seemed young before, he
          seems like a child now, overcome by the position he's in.    But
          when he speaks to Rocher, he's in command.

                            Of course, but it could be anywhere,
                            and the safety of the cardinals is my
                            primary concern at the moment.

                            your security concerns are at a

                            we make a naked-eye search of all of

                            Commander.    Though I am not His
                            Holiness, when you address me, you are
                            addressing this office.    Do you
                            understand?
          
                                                ROCHER
                            Yes, Padre,
          
                                           CAMERLENGO
                            Good.    Now -- you said the image on
                            screen was illuminated by artificial
                            light.    May I suggest methodically
                            cutting the power to various sections
                            of the City.     When the image on your
                            screen goes dark, you'll have a more
                            specific idea of the device's
                            location.
          
          Rocher looks at Olivetti -- gotta admit, that's a pretty damn good
          idea.

                            Ms. Vetra.    Besides yourself and
                            your research partner, who knew about
                            your antimatter project?

                            Leonardo kept detailed journals; if he
                            told anyone else about what we were
                            doing, he would have made a note of
                            it.

                                 (PAUSE)
                            Do you have these journals?

          He pauses, thinking, then turns the phone on his desk to face her.
          While she picks it up to dial, the Camerlengo comes around his
          desk to speak privately to Langdon.
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            Mr. Langdon.    You're correct that I
                            may grant you access to the Archives.
          
                                          LANGDON
                            Thank you, Padre.
          
                                           CAMERLENGO
                            I said you're correct that I may, not
                            that I will.     Christianity's most
                            sacred codices are in that archive.
                            Given your recent entanglement with
                            the church -- I need to ask you a
                            question first.
          
          Langdon looks at him -- fire away.

                            I didn't ask if you believe what man
                            says about God, I asked if you believe
                            in God.

                            I'm an academic. My mind tells me I
                            will never understand God.

                            Tells me I'm not meant to.
          
          The Camerlengo looks at him -- that's not quite good enough.
          
                                          LANGDON (cont'd)
                            I believe that faith is a gift, which
                            I have not been fortunate enough to
                            receive.
          
          The Camerlengo looks at him for a long moment. Pretty damn good
          answer.    He puts a hand on Langdon's shoulder and leans in.
          
                                          CAMERLENGO

          The back doors of the Apostolic Palace BANG open and Langdon is
          ushered out (fast) by Olivetti, the head of the Vatican Police.
          
                                          OLIVETTI
                            The archives are this way.
          
          They turn down a narrow passageway. A VOICE calls from behind
          them.

                            If this path really leads to the
                            Church of Illumination, that may be
                            where they've hidden the antimatter.

                            If we find this bomb, can you

                           No, but I can change its battery, as
                           long as it has more than five minutes
                           of life.    That would give us another
                           twenty-four hours to get it back to
                           CERN.
          
          Olivetti nods to her, come on along. They walk again, holds a hand
          out to Langdon.

                           A little book written by Galileo.

                           Galileo was llluminati?
          
                                          LANGDON
                           And a devout Catholic.     He thought
                           science and religion weren't enemies,
                           but two different languages telling
                           the same story.     He wanted like
                           minds to be able to find the Church of
                           Illumination, but he couldn't exactly
                           advertise its location, so he created
                           a coded path.     An unknown llluminati
                           master sculpted four statues, each a
                           tribute to one of the four fundamental
                           elements -- earth, air, fire, water --
                           and put them out in public, in
                           churches throughout Rome.     Each
                           statue held a clue, pointing to the
                           next. And at the end of the trail was
                           the Church of Illumination.
          
                                         26.
          
          
          
          Vicenzo, leading them, turns up Via Sentinel and starts up the
          hill toward the Archives. They follow, quickly.
          
                                         OLIVETTI
                           What makes you think he's going to
                           murder the cardinals in the churches?
          
                                         LANGDON
                           The llluminati called those four
                           churches by a special name -- L'Altare
                           di scienza.    The altars of science.

                           "Sacrifice them on the altars of
                           science," he said.
          
          Langdon stops in his tracks.
          
                                               LANGDON
                           Oh.   Oh, wow.
          
          He's staring up at the impressive facade of the Vatican Archives.
          He takes a deep breath, then steps forward to enter.    But
          Vincenzo doesn't follow.    Langdon looks at him.
          
                                         LANGDON (cont'd)
                           We go in alone?
          
                                         OLIVETTI
                           Vatican Police aren't allowed access
                           to the archives, only Swiss Guard. Lt.
                           Chartrand will meet you inside. I'll
                           be here when you're done.
          
          Langdon turns back to the Archives with a look of deep contentment
          -- he's wanted in here for a long, long time.
          
          And steps through the double doors.
          
                                                                     CUT TO:

          The Camerlengo walks briskly through the hallways of the Apostolic
          Palace, deep in thought.    He reaches the top of the Royal
          Staircase, and can hear the RUMBLING of activity in the Sistine
          Chapel below.
          
          Looking down the stairs, he sees the doorway open, and the
          gathering of cardinals inside.    As he reaches the base of the
          stairs, Cardinal Mortati, who has been summoned, steps outside to
          meet him, flanked by his aide, Father Simeon.
          
                                       27.
          
          
          
          Vincenzo, leading them, turns up Via Sentinel and starts up the
          hill toward the Archives.    They follow, quickly.
          
          They speak in English, their common language.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           You've been informed of the new

                           May God's mercy be upon us.

                           And the other cardinals?
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Await your word.
          
          The Camerlengo thinks, feels the weight of this decision on his
          young shoulders.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           May I ask your guidance, Padre?
          
                                         MORTATI
                           My belief is we should proceed with
                           the sealing of conclave.
          
                                             CAMERLENGO
                           At this hour?        That would be highly
                           unorthodox.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           And yet within church law.    It's in
                           my power, I've been chosen Great
                           Elector.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           The cruelest honor in Christendom.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           The only ambitions I have are for my
                           church.    St. Peter's church, which
                           is under attack at its most vulnerable
                           moment.    This is not a coincidence.
                           Is it possible our enemies hope to
                           distract us from our sacred task?
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           The church will not fall in a day. We
                           may be wise to consider evacuation.
          
                                        28.
          
          
          
                                         MORTATI
                           That is exactly what they want,
                           publicity and panic.    We must not
                           give them oxygen for the media fire.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           What of the safety of the cardinals?
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Surely there is not an elector present
                           who values his physical being more
                           than the unbroken leadership of the
                           Holy See.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           And the people in St. Peter's Square?
          
                                         MORTATI
                           They care as deeply about their church
                           as we do.    Their faith will sustain
                           them.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           But if their faith does not protect
                           them from an explosion?
          
                                         MORTATI
                           We're all bound for heaven eventually,
                           are we not?
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           Spoken like one who has enjoyed the
                           blessings of a long and full life.
          
          Mortati bristles at the thinly-veiled insult.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Signore, do not confuse the power of
                           the office you temporarily hold with
                           your true place here in the Vatican.
                           You were a favorite of His Holiness,
                           but His Holiness is with his Father
                           now.
          
                                              CAMERLENGO
                           Mea culpa.
          
          Satisfied, Mortati looks back over his shoulder, at the anxious
          faces in the Chapel.    Then turns back to the Camerlengo.

          With a heavy THUD, the huge doors close and bolts SLAM into place.
          An ancient key GRINDS in an ornate lock, two heavy chains RATTLE

          -- two huge, modern glass doors WHOOSH open, revealing what looks
          like a 23rd century library.     It's a massive underground space,
          like a darkened airplane hangar, with a dozen glass boxes evenly
          spaced throughout.     They're lit up from within, each containing
          row upon row of bookshelves, neatly filled with books, papers, and
          arcana.
          
          LT. CHARTRAND, a twenty-five year old member of the Swiss Guard
          (in a suit and earpiece, not the traditional garb), leads Langdon
          and Vittoria toward the glass enclosures.

                            The chambers are hermetic vaults,
                            oxygen is kept at lowest possible
                            levels.    It's a partial vacuum
                            inside. More than ten minutes in the
                            vault is not recommended without
                            breathing apparatus.
          
          He stops at one particular chamber and gestures to the sign on its
          door -- "Il Processo Galileano."

          Langdon starts toward the entrance to the vault, but Chartrand
          puts a hand on his chest, stopping him.

          Langdon looks at him.    He's not popular around here.

          The electronic revolving door spins and admits Langdon to the
          interior of the vault. He takes a deep breath, holds it, and lets
          it out.
          
          Vittoria follows shortly behind him, and she's unprepared -- the
          lack of oxygen hits her hard, she dizzies.
          
                                        30.

          INT     A DARK SPACE       DAY
          
          In a dark space, a tea bag bobs delicately up and down in a cup of
          hot water.    An elegant man in his forties, dressed in a casual
          suit, no tie, HUMS softly to himself as he steeps his tea.    No
          idea of his name, but his suit is gray, so how about MR. GRAY.
          
          The tea is on an old wooden table, being heated by a small can of
          sterno.    While Mr. Gray bobs the tea bag, he stares at something
          to his right.
          
          Money.    A lot of it, in a number of different denominations,
          neatly segmented in a briefcase.    And three passports, all
          different colors (and nationalities), neatly placed on top of it.
          
          Satisfied, Mr. Gray CLICKS the briefcase shut and slides it under
          the table, tucking it up against the wall.    He removes the cup
          from the heat, still bobbing the tea bag.
          
          He walks, lit by candlelight that throws harsh shadows on strange
          walls.    He heads down a very dark hallway, past a row of
          stonewalled cells, and within each is the dimly lit figure of the
          older men we saw on the videotape earlier -- the kidnapped
          cardinals.
          
          He stops at the last cell, where the man, CARDINAL LAMASSE, looks
          up at him from the wooden bench he's sitting on.
          
                                         MR. GRAY
                           You have no idea what you're missing.

                            cup.

                            -- but with what I'm about to do.
          
          
          
          A MOMENT LATER,
          
          Mr. Gray's hand takes the burning tin of sterno and tosses it into
          a fireplace, where the liquid fire consumes a pile of dry
          kindling.    He picks up something else and places it in the heart
          of the flames.
          
          A long-handled iron rod.
          
                                                                         CUT TO:

          Inside the archive, Vittoria is searching the lower shelves while

                            death.     I've been petitioning to see
                            it for almost ten years.     Ever since

                            The number 503.    I kept seeing it over
                            and over in llluminati letters, scribbled
                            in the margins, or sometimes just signed
                            that way, "503."      It's a numerical
                            clue, but to what?     Five, of course, is
                            the sacred llluminati number -- the
                            pentagram, Pythagoras, a dozen other
                            examples in science -- but why three?

                            the earth revolving around the sun,
                            and the church forced him to recant.

                            to write.    Smuggled out of Rome and

                            was considered polluted.    Too free-

          Before Langdon can do anything to stop her, she RIPS the page from
          the text and shoves it in her pocket.
          
          Langdon's jaw drops.    He shoots a look over his shoulder at Lt.
          Chartrand, but the man's back is turned.

          EXT    PANTHEON - TWO MINUTES LATER
          
          CLOSE ON a pair of hands, linked.    Vittoria and Langdon, holding
          hands like lovers, walk slowly toward the entrance to the
          Pantheon. A COUPLE DOZEN TOURISTS, blissfully unaware, mill about
          the square while up on the rooftops, SNIPERS have them in view.
          
          Langdon looks around, this wasn't what he had in mind.          Vittoria
          glances at him, amused.

          And with that they step through the entrance and into --
          
          INT     PANTHEON       DAY
          
          -- the Pantheon, a massive, circular room with a 141-foot
          unsupported span even larger than the cupola of St. Peter's. There
          are a DOZEN TOURISTS scattered around, and a TOUR GROUP on one
          side hearing a lecture from a MUSEUM DOCENT.
          
          Langdon looks up at the hole in the ceiling through which a bright
          shaft of light is shining.

                             "demon's hole" in the poem.
          
          Looking around, Vittoria sees several sarcophagi scattered around
          the room, all pointing obliquely in a certain direction. As they
          move stealthily through the crowd, they speak in low tones:

          He starts to the left, she goes to the right, walking in the
          shadowy recesses behind the pillars at the edges of the room.
          
          Langdon walks slowly, checking out faces.       Tourists.   Couples.
          Teenagers.    More tourists.
          
          Around every column, there are shadows, and in those shadows --
          
          --- nothing.
          
          He looks at his watch.    Five minutes to eight.       And then --
          
          --- a SHRIEK from the other side of the room.      He whirls, sees
          Vittoria backing away from something.

          He races across the room, reaches her at the far side. Her face is
          ashen.    She's pointing at something, aghast.

                           He was moved here, in 1759. A century

                           could it possibly... Santi 's tomb...
          
          His eyes flit around the room, from one ornate sarcophagus to
          another.    And then it hits him:
          
                                         LANGDON (cont'd)
                           Damn it!    "Santi's tomb" must mean
                           one of the chapels he built!    He's
                           not buried in it, he designed it! Rich
                           people commissioned burial chapels in
                           churches all over Rome in his day!

                           And the "demon's hole," it isn't the
                           oculus, it's an undercroft, a crypt,
                           common sixteenth century term!
          
          At that very moment, the tour group is passing them, and the
          elderly Docent asks his group the perfunctory wrap-up:

          Langdon busts in on the group.
          
                                        43.

                           angel figure commissioned by the
                           Catholic Church?!
          
          The Docent blinks.    Wasn't expecting quite so esoteric a
          question.

          out of him.

          He turns and walks away, glaring at Olivetti.

          Olivetti's car SCREECHES to a halt in the Piazza del Popolo at
          sunset.    Langdon, Vittoria, Olivetti, and Vincenzo, the Vatican
          cop who first came to see Langdon, all climb out, start scanning
          the square.

          He points to an obelisk in the center of the square.

                           The Illuminati were infiltrators.

                           convergence upward, with the eye of
                           illumination above it, and beneath it

                            FDR's vice-president was a high-

                            the words in Latin actually meant "New

          A church bell begins to TOLL.
          
                                                OLIVETTI
                            Eight o'clock!
          
          Langdon takes off running, toward and eleventh-century church at
          the southwest corner of the plaza, covered in scaffolding.
          
          At the front door of the church,
          
          Langdon hops over the sawhorses blocking the entrance and tries
          the door.    Locked.    A sign says the place is under
          construction.
          
          At a side door,
          
          Olivetti races alongside the church, followed by the others.
          He reaches a door with a large, heavy ring, and pulls it toward
          him. But the door won t budge.    He pushes, throws his shoulder
          into it.    Locked.
          
                                          LANGDON

                            No, no, it's an annulus!
          
          But Olivetti just races onward, looking for another door, followed
          by Vincenzo.    As they disappear around the back of the church,
          Langdon steps up to the large ring, gives it an almighty twist --
          
          INT       SANTA MARIA DEL POPOLO            DUSK
          
          -- and the heavy door CLUNKS open.
          
          The interior of the church is an obstacle course of torn-up
          flooring, brick pallets, mounds of dirt.    Silt drifts in the
          dying sunlight that shines through the broken windows and walls.
          
          Nothing moves.    Dead silence.    Langdon and Vittoria walk
          slowly to the middle of the floor, at one end of the chapel.
          There are eight recesses, four on either side of a central aisle,
          all covered with large sheets of plastic, to protect them during
          construction.
          
                                         46.

                            The chapel is in one of those apses.
          
          The plastic RUSTLES ominously.       Anything could be behind any one
          of them.
          
          Vittoria pulls the gun from her waistband and holds it in front of
          her.    Langdon notices, it makes him uncomfortable.
          
                                          LANGDON (cont'd)
                            You have to give that back.
          
          She looks at him --- what are you, nuts? Something rushes at them
          from the side, she whirls --
          
          --- and nearly blows Olivetti to kingdom come as he and Vincenzo
          barrel in through the side door.
          
          Langdon gestures --- everybody quiet. Olivetti points to the left
          gestures to Langdon and Vittoria to go to the right.
          
          They separate, to either side of the main aisle.
          
          AT THE FIRST CHAPEL,
          
          Langdon pulls the plastic aside, eyes scan the chapel.      Nothing.
          ON THE OTHER SIDE,
          
          Olivetti does the same, at another chapel.      Nothing.
          
          AT THE THIRD CHAPEL,
          
          Vittoria pushes the plastic aside, gun in front of her.      There's
          a sudden movement to her left, she whirls --
          
          --- and a rat scurries away.
          
          AT THE FOURTH CHAPEL,
          
          Langdon pushes the plastic aside, steps inside --
          
          -- and GASPS.
          
          Moving behind him, we see a Christian chapel like no other we've
          ever seen.    Finished entirely in chestnut marble, overhead it
          has a domed cupola with a field of illuminated stars and the seven
          planets (as known in Galileo's day).
          
          Further down the wall, there are tributes to earth's four seasons
          but most incredible of all are the two huge structures that
          dominate the room from either side.
          
                                          47.
          
          
          
          Pyramids.    Ten feet high.
          
          Vittoria steps in behind him.
          
                                            LANGDON
                            Pyramids.      In a Catholic church.
                            This is it.
          
          Behind them, the plastic rustles, as if drawn by a wind, and as
          Langdon turns, he hears, faintly, a DOOR CLOSING far away.
          
          He turns back, eyes drawn to the floor.    There is a large oval
          medallion there, with a skeleton carved into it.    It's slightly
          off center, raised.    As if it's been opened recently, and
          hurriedly replaced.
          
                                          LANGDON (cont'd)
                            The demon's hole.
          
          IN THE DEMON'S HOLE,
          
          we're looking up now as the medallion GRINDS to the side.     Faces
          peer down at us -- Langdon, Vittoria, Olivetti, and Vincenzo. They
          recoil from a stench.
          
          UP TOP,
          
          Langdon squints, trying to see inside.
          
                                          LANGDON
                            Anybody got a flashlight?
          
          Vincenzo hands him one.    Langdon shines it down into the crypt.
          There are shapes, but thirty feet down and hard to make out.
          
          There's one in particular, in the darkness, seems too short to be
          a person, but it's moving slightly.
          
                                          OLIVETTI
                            Can you tell what it is?
          
                                          LANGDON
                            Not from up here.
          
          He reaches down, rattles the ladder that leans against the wall of
          the crypt.    Takes a deep breath, looks at the others.
          
                                                LANGDON (cont'd)
                            Those guns.          Keep 'em handy?
          
                                       48.
          
          
          
          IN THE DEMON'S HOLE,
          
          Langdon reaches the bottom, still shining the light at the figure
          in the distance.    It's brighter here, he can see it's flesh-
          colored, but still indistinct.    He takes a step toward it --
          
          -- and something CRUNCHES under his feet.
          
          He shines the light down.    He's standing on a pile of human skulls
          
                                          OLIVETTI
                                 (calling down)
                            You okay?
          
                                             LANGDON
                            More or less.
          
          He takes two more steps, closer to the swaying figure on the other
          side of the crypt.    He can now clearly see a man's naked back.
          
                                          LANGDON (cont'd)
                            He's here!    I think he's -- sitting.
                                 (moves closer)
                            Hello?
                                 (closer still)
                            Are you all right?
          
          It's a human figure.     As Langdon draws close, he sees the source
          of the movement --- rats, gnawing at the dead body.
          
          They scurry away as Langdon comes around the front, and we pull
          back to see what he sees.
          
          It's Cardinal Lamasse.
          
          He's been buried in the earthen floor of the crypt up to his waist
          his jaw broken, his mouth crammed full of dirt.
          
          But that's not the worst of it.    Langdon GAGS as he sees the
          blackened word that has been branded into the red flesh of the
          Cardinal's chest.    It's an ambigram, like we've seen before, but
          this time it says --
          
                                         EARTH.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          
          
          INT     SISTINE CHAPEL      DAY
          
          Cardinal Mortati sits regally at the main altar at the front of
          the Sistine Chapel as the electors, one by one, cast their votes
          in the traditional manner.
          
                                        49.
          
          
          
          An AFRICAN CARDINAL at the front of the line kneels before him.
          
                                          AFRICAN CARDINAL
                                 (SUBTITLED)
                            I call as my witness Christ the Lord,
                            who will be my judge that my vote is
                            given to the one who before God I
                            think should be elected.
          
          The African Cardinal stands, holds his ballot over his head, t
          lowers the ballot to the altar, where a plate sits atop a large
          chalice.
          
          He places the ballot on the plate, then picks up the plate and
          uses it to drop the ballot in the chalice.    He then replaces the
          plate over the chalice, bows to the cross, and heads for his seat.
          
          The next cardinal steps up to repeat the process.
          
          A SHORT TIME LATER, A DISSOLVE,
          
          and the line is gone.    Mortati holds the chalice with all the
          votes.    He shakes it, chooses one---
          
                                          MORTATI
                            Eligo in summum pontificem --
          
          -- and reads an unfamiliar name.
          
          He makes a note in a ledger, then raises a threaded needle and
          pierces the ballot through the word "Eligo," sliding the ballot on
          the thread.
          
          A SHORT TIME LATER,   ANOTHER DISSOLVE,
          
          and there are a hundred and sixty-one ballots on the thread,
          Mortati looks up from his ledger and speaks to the room.
          
                                          MORTATI
                            The first ballot has failed.
          
          He takes He thread carrying all the ballots and ties the ends
          together to create a ring.
          
          He lays the ring of ballots on a silver tray.     Dusts the tray
          heavily with a yellowish powder.
          
          A DOOR OPENS
          
          on a small incinerator. The ring of ballots is hurled inside and
          bursts immediately into flame.
          
                                         50.
          
          
          
          A dark, brackish smoke billows up from the burning ballots, and we
          follow the smoke up, up, into the chimney --
          
          EXT     ST.   PETER'S SQUARE         DUSK
          
          --- and to the roof of the Sistine Chapel, where the black iUPke
          puffs out into the early evening sky.
          
          Below, a CROWD OF THOUSANDS GROANS in disappointment as the
          message is sent --- no new pope yet.
          
          But while they are all watching the smoke, we turn our attention?
          to the opposite direction, to the east, across Rome, to where ---
          
                                                                        CUT TO:
          
          EXT     PIAZZA DEL POPOLO        DUSK
          
          --- those black Alfa Romeos, four this time, glide silently to a
          halt outside the church where Langdon just found the corpse. Swiss
          Guard in black suits pour out of the vehicles and hurry into the
          church, trying to attract as little attention as possible.
          
          INT     SANTA MARIA DEL POPOLO          DUSK
          
          The inside of the church is being sealed off as a crime scene.
          Rocher, just arriving, takes charge as the plastic is RIPPED off
          the Chigi Chapel.

          Swiss Guardsmen drop into the demon's hole to remove the body.

                            one knows.     Understood?
          
          Langdon, lost in thought, drifts through the small chapel, studying
          the intricate carvings and other artwork.
          
                                          LANGDON

          Rocher passes through his field of vision, livid:
          
                                          ROCHER

          It was more a rhetorical question, but Langdon answers honestly,
          still lost in thought, his voice soft.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           I made a mistake.
          
          He drifts toward a statue, of the highest quality white marble,
          resting in a niche on the far side, out of the way of the mayhem.
          
          Vittoria joins him.

          He steps closer to the statue.    It's of two life-size human
          figures, intertwined, one a regal, bearded man, the other a
          cherub, floating overhead.

          His eyes move slowly over the statue, and ours do too, from the
          angel's innocent face, down his arm, and to his right hand, which
          is outstretched, one finger extended --

          Langdon dashes down the stairs outside the church and into the
          middle of the piazza.    It's getting dark now, shadows streaking
          the square.

          He gets his bearings, looks to the southwest, sees nothing but
          buildings in the way.
          
          He runs back up the church steps, where Vittoria and Rocher are
          just coming outside.    Langdon's mind is racing.

          Rocher just stares at him, studying him.

                            I could use it now.
          
          Rocher starts down the steps toward his car.

          He looks around, sees the rickety scaffolding outside the church,
          and ---
          
                                           53.
          
          
          
          A MOMENT LATER,

          --- the roof of the old church, also undergoing renovation. The
          view of Rome is spectacular from up here, and Langdon rushes to
          the western wall, looking intently off in that direction.
          
          He sees something that makes him suck in his breath, hears a voice
          from behind him ---

          him.
          
          A compass.    He catches it, holds it steady, and walks toward the
          edge of the roof as the compass needle swivels and settles on SW.
          
          Langdon looks up, following the line of the needle, up over the
          rooftops of Rome, to a massive structure in the distance, exactly
          in line with the compass needle.
          
          A huge dome on the horizon blots out the setting sun.

          pen and is drawing a line on the map, through --

                             the line until it comes to an end,
                             right in the middle of St. Peter's
                             Square.
          
          Night has fallen, and the four Alfa Romeos are now speeding across
          Rome.    No sirens, but lots of speed.    Olivetti drives, Rocher

          She looks down, to two television screens mounted into the backs
          of the front seats.    Both are tuned to coverage of the papal
          selection process, REPORTERS doing stand-ups from the middle of
          crowded St. Peter's Square.
          
          We move in on one of the images, then into the image, coming out -

          JAPANESE WOMAN, is giving a stand-up report on the progress so
          far, gesturing to the chimney over the Sistine Chapel.
          
          The crowd has grown, now four thousand, maybe five. FLASHBULBS
          POP.    A few PROTESTERS CHANT.
          
          Almost silently, behind them all, half a dozen black Alfa Romeos
          race in, too fast, and come to an abrupt halt.
          
          IN ROCHER'S CAR,
          
          they all get out, trying to avoid causing a panic.
          
          Langdon walks into the square, eyes focused on an object in the
          middle.

          He looks up, at row after row of statues that ring the square from
          atop the oval colonnades.
          
          SHARPSHOOTERS scurry among the statuary, setting themselves up.

          In the crowd, Rocher MUTTERS into his radio and to undercover
          SWISS GUARD scattered throughout.    The crowd is unaware of them.
          
          Langdon keeps walking, turning in circles, looking above him, to
          the tops of the colonnades that border the square.

                           There must be a hundred statues up

          And indeed there are.    Langdon looks at his watch.      Two
          minutes to nine.
          
          And then he freezes.    Staring down, not up.
          
          He takes a step back. There is a fresco carved into the square
          beneath his feet, or more accurately --
          
                                               LANGDON (cont'd)
                           Bas relief!
          
          He takes a step back, to look at the carving, as does Vittoria.
          
                                          LANGDON (cont'd)
                           The other half of sculpture is bas
                           relief.

                           Look for more!     Something having to
                           do with air!
          
          They move through the crowd, pushing people aside, causing a bit
          of a ruckus as they try to uncover the elaborate carvings in the
          stone of the square.
          
          (IF WE ARE EAGLE-EYED, at this point we will see TWO ROBED MEN,
          one helping the other, who carries a cross, as they pass through
          the crowd behind Langdon.)
          
          Remembering something, Langdon rushes forward, toward the center
          of the square, uncharacteristically brusque with the crowd,
          shoving his way through now.
          
          He draws close to one carving in particular, slows to a stop, and
          stares down at it, eyes wide.
          
          It's a carving of an angel's face, cheeks billowing outward as it
          blows a gust of wind, symbolized by five vertical streaks.    Its
          title is ---
          
                                         56.
          
          
          
                                            LANGDON (cont'd)
                              "West Ponente."    The West Wind.    An
                              angel's face and five streaks.   Air!
          
          So this is it, but now what?    They look around frantically,
          scanning the crowd.    So does Rocher, so does Olivetti.    The
          BELLS of St. Peter's start to TOLL the hour.
          
          NEARBY,
          
          a LITTLE GIRL dances with a doll.      Happily unaware of what's
          going on.
          
          ELSEWHERE,
          
          some PROTESTERS tangle.      Some believe one thing, others don't.
          
          Swiss Guard and Vatican Police race in to break it up. But there's
          no bloodshed.
          
          CLOSE TO THAT,
          
          a ROBED MAN carrying a small wooden cross falls to the ground.
          Somebody near him SCREAMS.
          
          NEARBY,
          
          the Little Girl is jostled by a HOMELESS MAN, drops her doll.
          
          THE ROBED MAN
          
          is helped to his feet by the Police.      He's fine.   He wanders
          away, holding his cross high.
          
          And as he passes us, we catch just a glimpse of his face ---
          
          --and recognize Mr. Gray.
          
          THE LITTLE GIRL
          
          bends down, picks up her doll, and sees --
          
          -- IT'S COVERED IN BLOOD.
          
          She looks down at the ground, sees a trail of blood, follows it
          with her eyes to where ---
          
          -- the Homeless Man, dressed in torn rags, leans against a
          fountain, gasping for breath.
          
          ACROSS THE CROWD,
          
                                        57.
          
          
          
          Vittoria and Langdon hear the SCREAMS.    They're closest, and
          they're at the fountain in just a few seconds.
          
          Langdon drops to his knees, turns the Homeless Man over.
          Through the man's torn shirt, he can see a black and red brand
          burned into his chest.
          
          Three letters, ornate script, reading the same front to back:
          
                                          AIR.
          
          Vittoria grabs his arm,   feels for a pulse.
          
                                           VITTORIA
                             He's still alive!
          
          But the dying Cardinal is gasping for breath, his mouth opening
          and closing like a fish on a dock.
          
          She bends down, arches his neck, closes her mouth over his, and
          blows air into his lungs.
          
          Immediately, a fog of red mist BILLOWS from two puncture holes in
          the man's chest, covering Langdon in blood --- his face, his
          clothes.
          
                                           VITTORIA (cont'd)
                             His chest! They punctured his lungs!
          
          Langdon recoils in horror, overcome, completely out of his depth.
          
          Rocher arrives, as does Olivetti, as do a DOZEN MORE SWISS GUARD
          and VATICAN POLICE.    Rocher looks around, defeated and enraged,
          as the Cardinal expires and the Crowd panics, fleeing in all
          directions.
          
          He presses his radio to his lips and keys the mic.
          
                                           ROCHER
                             Clear the square.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          INT     BATHROOM      NIGHT
          
          Blood and water swirl down a drain. Langdon looks up from the
          sink, water rushing from his face. He dries himself, looks in the
          mirror.    He holds up his hands. They're shaking.
          
          He's standing in a lavish marble bathroom, now cleaned up and
          changed into black pants and a black long-sleeved shirt.    No
          Roman collar, they don't just give you those, but clearly the
          clothes of a priest.    He steps out of the bathroom and into ---
          
                                       58.
          
          
          
          
          INT     PAPAL OFFICE     NIGHT
          
          -- the papal office, where the Camerlengo, Rocher, Olivetti, and
          Vittoria are gathered again, as are HALF A DOZEN other security
          officers.     It's crowded, busy, little knots of jurisdictional
          arguments and competing theories around the room.
          
          The Camerlengo, at his desk, is stunned, speaking to Olivetti.
          Langdon edges close enough to hear, but not too close.
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            When did this call come in?
          
                                          OLIVETTI
                            Three, four minutes ago.    The same
                            voice as on the tape.    We're
                            analyzing the accent now, Alsatian is
                            our best guess at the moment.
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            And he actually claimed responsibility
                            for the death of His Holiness?
          
                                          OLIVETTI
                            Not personally, but he said it was the
                            Illuminati.    He said they murdered
                            him.
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            That's ridiculous, the Holy Father
                            died of a stroke.    Did he say how
                            they claim to have done it?
          
                                          OLIVETTI
                            The Pope's own medication.     A drug
                            known as Heparin?
          
          There is silence for a moment.      Rocher looks up.    Looks away.
          
                                          VITTORIA
                            The Pope took Heparin?
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            He had thrombophlebitis.    He took an
                            injection once a day.    But no one
                            knew that.
          
                                             OLIVETTI
                            Someone knew.
          
                                        59.
          
          
          
                                         ROCHER
                           His Holiness had health concerns; he
                           was subject to seizures as well. But
                           he took steps to make sure he was --
                           watched.    For safety.    That's all
                           he wished to be made public, and
                           that's all we should discuss.
          
                                         VITTORIA
                                (ignoring him)
                           Heparin is lethal in the wrong dosage.
                           An overdose would cause massive
                           internal bleeding and brain
                           hemorrhages.    At first it might look
                           like a stroke, but in a few days his
                           body would show signs, we could easily-
          
          Rocher spins on her, livid.
          
                                         ROCHER
                           Ms. Vetra, in case you're unaware,
                           papal autopsies are prohibited by
                           Vatican Law.    We are not about to
                           defile His Holiness's body just
                           because his enemies claim to-
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           Of course we're not.    We'll make a
                           public announcement refuting this
                           absurd claim.
          
          Father Simeon, Cardinal Mortati's aide, steps forward.
          
                                         FR. SIMEON
                           I'm afraid that's out of the question.
                           Cardinal Mortati has insisted this
                           entire matter be kept internal.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           Cardinal Mortati shouldn't even be
                           aware of this, he's locked in
                           conclave.
          
                                         FR. SIMEON
                           His final instructions before sealing
                           the doors were very clear -- no outside
                           communications unless absolutely
                           necessary.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           Cardinal Mortati will remember that he
                           is Dean of the College of Cardinals,
                           not His Holiness himself.
          
                                       60.
          
          
          
                                         FR. SIMEON
                           As you say. Yet, technically, now that
                           Conclave has begun, it is his
                           privilege and duty to control public
                           announcements. I've drafted a short
                           release about the incident in the
                           square, but any other statements are
                           specifically prohibited. For that, the
                           Cardinal has asked me to remind you --
                           we have a chimney.
          
          The Camerlengo just stares at him, a power struggle. Which he is
          going to lose.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           As you say.
                                (turns away)
                           Commander Rocher, the search for the
                           device?
          
                                         ROCHER
                           We've turned the power off and on to
                           about twenty percent of Vatican City.
                           Nothing on the video yet.

                           Mr. Langdon, you've been right so far,
                           if belatedly, about the Path. It's now
                           nine fifteen, how quickly can you find
                           the next church?
          
          Langdon refers to a map spread out on the desk.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           The line of the breath in the carving
                           points due east, directly away from
                           Vatican City, but there are five
                           lines, so there's room for error.
          
          While he talks, an AIDE in a business suit is ushered quietly in
          the door by a Swiss Guardsman.    He's carrying a satchel.
          Vittoria recognizes him, and he goes to her.
          
                                         LANGDON (cont'd)
                           There are about twenty churches that
                           intersect it.    None of their names
                           invoke "fire," but there must be a
                           Bernini sculpture inside one of them
                           that does.    I'm going to need to get
                           back into the Archives to find it.
          
                                         61.

                            Escort him.
          
          Langdon looks to Vittoria -- you coming? She looks up from a table,
          where she's opened the satchel brought in by the Aide. She holds
          two leather-bound books in her hand.
          
                                          VITTORIA
                            The journals I asked for.    I'd like
                            to stay here and study them.    If
                            Leonardo told anyone else about our
                            project, that could be the killer.
          
                                               CAMERLENGO
                            Fine.
          
          The group starts to break up, half of them headed for the doors.
          As Langdon rolls up the map on the desk, the Camerlengo notices
          his black clothes for the first time.

                            Professor, would it surprise you to
                            find those clothes suit you?
          
          Langdon manages a sliver of a smile, starting to like this guy.

          Langdon and Lt. Chartrand, the young Swiss Guardsman, walk quickly
          down the row of hermetically sealed vaults in the Vatican
          Archives.
          
          Langdon's leading, looking at the names on the outsides of each of
          the individual vaults.

          He stops, pointing up at a sign on the end of one of the vaults --
          BANCO VATICANO.

                            But it's also a bank.
          
          He takes one last breath of oxygen-rich air, pushes through the
          revolving door --

          moment later, Chartrand follows him through the door.     Langdon
          looks at him --- you're coming in too?

          MOVING FAST ALONG THE LEATHER-BOUND VOLUMES, Langdon searches the
          place as fast as he can.
          
          BAM!
          
          A book drops onto a table, pages flip by, Langdon studies it,
          SLAMS it shut.
          
                                          64.
          
          
          
          BAM! BAM! Two more books, flipped open, compared, pages rifled,
          nothing.
          
          BACK IN THE STACKS,
          
          his hand finds a five-inch thick ledger marked "Bernini."
          
          ON A TABLE,
          
          it SMACKS down and opens to the first page. Langdon sits, begins
          turning the pages, one by one.
          
          LOOKING AT THE PAGE,
          
          his vision momentarily blurs.         He rubs his eyes, it clears
          again.
          
          He looks up, at a vent over the doorway. Thin ribbons flutter in
          the breeze of the minimal oxygen that's being pumped in.
          
          He goes back to work.   Chartrand watches him.
          
                                                                          CUT TO:

          Looking out the window of the papal office, we see the barricades
          removed from the edges of St. Peter's Square.    The crowds
          return.
          
          Pulling back, we see the Camerlengo looking out at them, thinking,
          troubled.    There are still half a dozen Security Officials in
          the papal office, but the Camerlengo turns and looks at Vittoria,
          working alone at a desk on the far side of the office.
          
          AT THE DESK,
          
          Vittoria pores over the journals sent from Geneva.    Sensing
          something, she looks up.    The Camerlengo is standing over her.
          He speaks quietly.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO

                           I'm sorry?
          
          The Camerlengo looks over his shoulder, to make sure their
          conversation is private.

                            week after his death.
          
          He looks around the room once more.          Then back to her?

                            I understand.
          
          He thinks for a long moment, then --

          --- turns and leaves the room.         She makes sure no one's looking,
          then follows him out.
          
          She leaves the journals behind.
          
                                                                           CUT TO:

          through.    He tiyrns a page, scans the list of items written
          there, then moves on to the next.
          
          He blinks, his vision blurring again. He looks over at Chartrand,
          who's suffering even worse, panting for air, hands on his knees.

          Chartrand half-stumbles into a chair on the opposite side of the
          table.    Langdon goes back to what he was doing, flipping a page--
          
          --- and then immediately flipping it back.
          
          There is a hand-written notation alongside one of the entries.

          Chartrand leans over the ledger, squinting hard, trying to focus.

          Chartrand, really suffering for air, can't follow it.

                            I don't know.
          
          Langdon flips the page back, to a photograph of the sculpture in
          question.
          
          THE STATUE
          
          is of a woman, seemingly in the throes of ecstasy, while an angel
          hovering over her holds a spear aloft.
          
          Langdon raises an eyebrow.
          
          The word "Seraphim" jumps up from the page, words in quotes after
          it -- "Seraphim, meaning 'the fiery one...'"

                            Fire.
          
          And now three things happen in quick succession:
          
          -- Langdon SLAMS the ledger shut,
          
          -- the ribbons on the air vent fall as the oxygen into the vault is
          cut off, and
          
          -- one by one, ALL THE LIGHTS IN THE ARCHIVES GO OUT.
          
          Total silence for a moment.
          
          Langdon and Chartrand look at each other in the darkness.
          
                                                 LANGDON (cont'd)
                            The door -- ?
          
                                                 CHARTRAND
                            Electronic.
          
                                          LANGDON
                            That's too bad.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          INT     ST.   PETER'S BASILICA          NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo, flanked by two Swiss Guardsmen, escorts Vittoria
          rapidly across the deserted floor of St. Peter's Basilica.
          
                                          VITTORIA
                            Where are we going?
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            To see my father.
          
                                          VITTORIA
                            I don't understand.
          
          They circle past a pillar and she sees an orange glow up ahead,
          seeming to emanate from beneath the floor in the center of the
          basilica.
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            I was orphaned when I was nine years
                            old.    A bombing in Madrid -- Basque
                            separatists protesting the visit of a
                            Catholic archbishop.
          
          As they draw closer, she sees it's the entrance to a sumptuous
          underground chamber, surrounded by scores of glowing oil lamps.
          
                                         68.
          
          
          
                                            CAMERLENGO (cont'd)
                              The archbishop felt responsible, and
                              he adopted me the following day.    I
                              was raised by him, and by the church.
          
          The Camerlengo starts down a winding stairway, rimmed by the
          lamps,
          
          ON THE STAIRCASE,
          
          they descend, lit by the spectral glow of the oil lamps.
          
                                            CAMERLENGO (cont'd)
                              He was the wisest man I ever met, even
                              with my youthful foolishness. He
                              always saw the middle way.    I wanted
                              to be ordained, but I also refused to
                              be excused from military service.
                              So he suggested I fly rescue missions,
                              helicopters bringing the wounded to
                              hospital.
          
          He stops at the bottom of the stairs and looks up at her.
          
                                            CAMERLENGO (cont'd)
                              He was a great man.

                              Fourteen days ago.
          
          Vittoria, stunned, realizes who he's talking about.
          
                                                                       CUT TO:
          
          INT     VATICAN ARCHIVES       NIGHT
          
          KA-CHUNG! Emergency lights switch on in the Vatican Archives,
          casting a weird, reddish glow over everything.
          
          But the ribbons at the oxygen panel remain limp.
          
          Below, Langdon pushes, again and again, on the deadened exit
          button, trying to activate the doors.    Nothing doing.
          
          He's weak, weaving, barely on his feet.
          
          Chartrand's already slumped against a wall, his radio in hand,
          keying it over and over again, but getting only static.
          
                                         69.
          
          
          
                                               LANGDON
                            Anything?
          
          Chartrand gestures weakly around the room.
          
                                          CHARTRAND
                            Walls... lead-lined... no signal.
          
          Langdon blinks, his vision becoming seriously impaired. He holds
          his eyes closed for a moment, opens them, it's not much better.
          
          Langdon looks at the glass wall on the far side of the vault. Then
          at the row of bookcases.    Gets an idea.
          
          He goes to the last bookcase, which is about six feet from the
          glass wall. He hoists himself up on the shelf of the bookcase
          opposite it, wedges himself in.
          
          And pushes with one leg.      The giant bookcase teeters, but just
          barely.
          
          Langdon hoists himself further up, gets both legs up against the
          bookshelf.
          
          Pushes again -- more movement this time.
          
          Now he puts everything he has into it, straining like hell.    The
          bookcase starts to tip, goes just past the point of no return,
          starts to fall, gloriously headed straight for the glass wall,
          which it SLAMS into with enormous power and --
          
          --- stops.
          
          Leaning against the wall.     Forget cracks, there's not even a
          scratch.
          
          Langdon CURSES under his breath, looks around for another idea.
          
          He hears a soft THUD from the other side of the room, sees
          Chartrand has slumped over, unconscious.
          
          But his jacket has fallen open, revealing the sidearm he carries
          in a shoulder holster.
          
          LANGDON'S HAND
          
          slips the gun out of the holster and hefts it.     Safe bet he's
          never held one of these before.
          
          He staggers over toward the glass wall, raises the gun, and pulls
          the trigger.    Nothing happens.    Trigger doesn't even move.
          
                                       70.
          
          
          
          After a moment of oxygen-poor thinking, he figures out how to
          CLICK off the safety.    Tries again.
          
          (Pow.)
          
          The sound of the shot is barely audible to Langdon.     His brain's
          going fast.
          
          If he was hoping to bring the whole wall down, he failed, but
          there's a faint HISSING sound coming from the bullethole, and he
          goes to it and takes a deep breath of air from the outside.
          
          He stands back, his brain clearing momentarily.
          
          Seized by an idea, he looks up at the wall, at its four corners,
          and at the tiny web of cracks radiating out from the hole he just
          made in the center.
          
          He raises the gun again and fires off FOUR SHOTS in quick
          succession.    They're in an odd pattern-- upper left corner, upper
          right, not quite as high, lower middle-left, and the very lower
          right corner.
          
          Now there are four new holes, each HISSING slightly, and the first
          hole, in the center.
          
          Shaking his head once more to clear it, Langdon steps forward to
          the glass wall, but instead of barreling against it or throwing a
          chair, he simply raises one hand, places it flat over the first
          hole he made, the one in the center of the glass wall ---
          
           -- and presses gently.
          
          Almost immediately, a SHARP SOUND comes from the hole beneath his
          hand and a jagged crack leaps out from the first hole, shooting up
          to connect with the hole in the upper left corner.
          
          He presses just a touch harder and a SECOND CRACK starts,
          shooting down to the lower right.    Then a third, and a fourth,
          the glass is cracking like ice in springtime, all four extremities
          connecting with the central hole, and with a huge GROANING SOUND -
          -
          
          -- the entire glass wall falls to pieces at his feet.
          
          Air RUSHES into the vault.
          
          And, wouldn't you know it, the power comes back on in the Archives.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:

          INT     VATICAN GROTTOES      NIGHT
          
          Vittoria, the Camerlengo, and the two Swiss Guard reach the
          entrance to the Holy Vatican Grottoes just as --
          
          -- their power goes out.
          
          Two flashlights CLICK on, and the Guardsmen lead the way in.   On
          both sides, hollow niches line the walls.    Recessed in the
          alcoves, as far as the flashlights let them see, the hulking
          shadows of sarcophagi loom.
          
          On top of each tomb are life-sized marble carvings of each Pope,
          shown in death and wearing full papal vestments, arms folded
          across their chests.

                           If the Holy Father was murdered, the
                           implications are profound.    Vatican
                           security is impenetrable, no one from
                           the outside could have gotten anywhere
                           near him.

                           Meaning it was someone on the inside.

                           We can trust no one
          
          He steps up his pace, taking the lead, knows exactly where he's
          going.    The others fall behind, as everyone slowly realizes what
          he intends to do.    And they're not at all sure they're up for
          it.
          
          AT THE LATE POPE'S SARCOPHAGUS,
          
          the Camerlengo closes the last few feet alone. He knees down in
          front of the bright marble carving, a likeness of the late Pope.
          He WHISPERS.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           Father... Holy Father... You told me
                           when I was young that the voice in my
                           heart was that of God.    You told me
                           I must follow it no matter what
                           painful places it leads.    I hear it
                           now, asking me the impossible.    Give
                           me strength.    Forgive me.    What I
                           do, I do in the name of everything you
                           believe.
          
          BEHIND HIM,
          
                                         72.
          
          
          
          the others watch as he finishes his private prayer, stands, and
          turns to them.

                              Remove the covering.
          
          Nobody moves.      Just stares at him.

                              Signore, by law we are at your
                              command.    But we are also bound by-
          
                                            CAMERLENGO
                              I ask your forgiveness for putting you
                              in this position.    Vatican laws are
                              established to protect the church. But
                              it is in that very spirit that I
                              command you to break them now.
          
          A moment of silence, and then --
          
          -- they step forward.    Set their flashlights on the floor.
          And step to the tomb.    Bracing their hands against the marble
          covering near the head of the tomb, they plant their feet and
          push.
          
          It doesn't move.
          
          They push harder.
          
          Vittoria and the Camerlengo join them.
          
          With an almost primal GROWL of stone on stone, the lid slides,
          rotating off the top of the casket and coming to rest at an angle.
          
          The Camerlengo picks up a flashlight and shines it in the crypt.
          
          Vittoria leans forward.
          
          The light creeps up the Pope's body, over his burial vestments,
          past his folded hands, and finally to his face.
          
          His cheeks have collapsed, the Pope's mouth gapes wide      --
          
          -- and his tongue is black as death.
          
                                                                           CUT TO:

          The face of Langdon's Mickey Mouse watch is smeared with blood
          from a cut on his hand, but we can still read the time.
          
          It's 9:41.
          
          Langdon and Chartrand stagger down the front steps of the Vatican
          Archives, where they're immediately met by three Vatican Police
          cars.    Olivetti leaps out of one and meets them at the base of
          the steps, holding his hands up in defense almost before Langdon
          can lay into him.

                           Then get in the car!
          
          Langdon jumps in the back seat of the car with Olivetti, and they
          SQUEAL away from the Archives.
          
          IN THE CAR,
          
          they continue as the DRIVER tears through the streets of Rome.

                           You heard me ask permission!    You
                           assigned me an escort!    Don't try to
                           tell me you didn't know I was in

                           Of course I knew, but we had no idea
                           that portions of our white zones are

                           Commander Rocher was extending the
                           search, if he'd known the Archives
                           were on that grid, he never would have
                           killed the power.
          
          Langdon looks at him evenly, sees in Olivetti's eyes that they may
          be thinking the same thing.

                           Or there is the other possibility.
          
          Olivetti doesn't answer.     But he's thinking about it.

          Vittoria, escorted by the two Swiss Guardsmen from the grottoes,
          returns to the papal office.
          
          She goes to the desk where she was sitting earlier, to resume her
          examination of the journals.
          
          But the desk is bare.

          The Camerlengo, in deep meditation, slowly descends the stairs
          that lead to the Sistine Chapel.
          
          At the bottom, Four Swiss Guard (in traditional garb) guard the
          locked doors.
          
          The Camerlengo reaches them.    Hesitates.      Looks heavenward for
          one last word of encouragement, and then --
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           Unseal the doors.
          
          INT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT
          
          There is an audible GASP from the assembled cardinals as the heavy
          locks CLUNK open, the chains RATTLE away, and the main doors of
          the Sistine Chapel sweep open.
          
          The Camerlengo walks in, a stark presence in his black cassock
          amid the sea of red robes. Cardinal Mortati steps from behind the
          altar to meet him.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Signore, do you realize that for the
                           first time in Vatican history, a
                           Camerlengo has just crossed the sacred
                           threshold of conclave after sealing
                           the doors?

          Olivetti's Alfa Romeo races through the streets of Rome, trailed
          by three other cars.
          
          INT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo has just passed on the shocking news, and the
          whispered word "murder" can be heard in several languages.
          
          Even Mortati is shaken.   The Camerlengo speaks to the Cardinals.

          He strides quickly up the steps of the altar to address the group
          -- again, to the shock and surprise of this most conservative and
          rule-bound group.
          
          But no one stops him.

          windshield.
          
          On the horizon, he sees a faint orange glow.

                           Since the days of Galileo, the church
                           has tried to slow the relentless march
                           of science, sometimes with misguided
                           means, but always with benevolent
                           intention.    Still, they call us

          flames, where --

          INT      BURNING CHURCH     NIGHT
          
           -- the third cardinal, still alive, is suspended over the searing
          flames.
          
          A word is branded into the center of his bared chest:
          
                                           FIRE.
          
                                          79.
          
          
          
          Vatican Police, led by Olivetti and Vincenzo, race into the
          building and draw their weapons.    Olivetti SHOUTS to them in
          Italian, looking for a way to cut down the agonized cardinal.
          
          Langdon races toward the pyre, but is repelled by a wall of heat
          ten feet away.
          
          The Cardinal SCREAMS, and Langdon looks to the sides, following
          the cables that reach to the walls.
          
          One of the Vatican Cops ducks
          
          INTO THE LEFT SIDE AISLE,
          
          which is lit only by the wild orange flames.    He creeps forward,
          gun in front of him, toward a fire extinguisher mounted on the
          wall.
          
          He reaches for it --
          
          -- but a HAND reaches for him from behind, he's pulled off his
          feet and --
          
          IN THE MAIN AISLE,
          
          Olivetti and Vincenzo whirl as TWO GUNSHOTS come from the darkened
          side aisle.    They race toward it.
          
          AT THE BONFIRE,
          
          Langdon SHOUTS to two more Vatican Cops, pointing upward.
          
                                          LANGDON
                            The cleat, on the wall!   Get
                            something to stand on!
          
          He's pointing at a cleat, maybe ten feet up on the wall, where the
          right guide wire is attached.
          
          Vatican Cops 2 & 3 drag a half-burned pew out of the fire and pull
          it underneath, leaning it against the wall for greater height,
          
          Langdon starts to climb it, to uncleat the wire.
          
          IN THE DARKENED LEFT AISLE
          
          Olivetti creeps forward, gun at the ready, Vincenzo close behind
          him.
          
          They see a form on the floor in front of them and Olivetti bends
          down -- it's the first Vatican Policeman.
          
          Dead in a pool of his own blood.
          
                                           80.
          
          
          
          Vincenzo, standing behind Olivetti, looks down, horrified, and in
          that moment of distraction, a figure creeps up behind him --
          
          -- and twists his head 180 degrees with one smooth motion.
          
          Olivetti whirls, but his gun comes around a split-second slower
          than he does and in that split-second a shadow falls over him,
          something SLASHES through the air and --
          
          IN THE MAIN AISLE,
          
          Langdon struggles to climb the pew that's leaned against the wall
          as Vatican Cop 4 finds a long-handled candle snuffer and races
          toward the edge of the fire with it.
          
          Blinking back the intense heat, he manages to hook the Cardinals
          manacled foot with it, he turns to Langdon--
          
           -- who, stretched as far as he possibly can, just manages to
          loose the wire from its cleat, holding tightly to it so as not to
          let the Cardinal go into free-fall.
          
          But the pew on which he's balanced starts to wobble, then- --
          
          -- BLAM!    BLAM!
          
          Two gunshots THUD into the chests of Vatican Cops 2 & 3, who were
          supporting the pew.    They fall, the pew tips --
          
          -- and Langdon,   falling   --
          
          -- loses his grip on the chain.
          
          The Cardinal falls toward the flames. Vatican Cop 4 tries to pull
          him to safety, but doesn't have enough of WHIRRS through the
          pulley until it reaches its the Cardinal to an abrupt stop, six
          feet lower
          
          -- and directly in the middle of the bonfire.
          
          His SHRIEK of agony echoes through the burning church.
          
          Langdon SLAMS to the floor just at the edge of the burning church
          pews, maybe CRACKING a rib on the hard floor of the church.
          
          A FIGURE steps out of the shadows, looming over him, Langdon looks
          up, expecting a gunshot, but instead --
          
           -- sees the bleeding figure of Olivetti, staggering toward him,
          clutching his slit throat in his last moments of life.
          
          NEARBY,
          
                                          81.
          
          
          
          Vatican Cop 4 is desperately trying to pull the Cardinal from the
          flames, the end of the candle-snuffer is now hooked around the
          Cardinal's foot, he pulls him closer, reaches out, can almost grab
          his ankle --
          
           -- until he is SHOT in the back.    He falls to the floor,
          drawing and dropping his gun in the process, losing his grip on
          the long-handled pole as well.
          
          On the ground, bleeding, he sees his gun, just a foot away from
          his hand.
          
          He reaches for it.
          
          And a foot steps on his wrist, BREAKING it.
          
          Mr. Gray stands over him,     implacable.
          
          FROM A DISTANCE,
          
          we see Mr. Gray fire two shots into the ground where Cop 4 is
          lying.
          
          Then he turns toward us.
          
          NEARBY,
          
          Langdon, still on the ground, looks up at the sound of the shots.
          Through the burning church pews he can see Mr. Gray, starting
          toward him.
          
          Langdon crawls, on all fours, through the outskirts of the
          bonfire, toward a recessed part of the wall ten or fifteen feet
          away.
          
          Mr. Gray steps up behind him, raises his gun           --
          
                                                VOICE   (O.S.)
                             Polizia!
          
           -- and turns.    TWO MORE COPS, Roman Carbinieri, have run into
          the burning church and are making their way down the center aisle,
          straight toward him.
          
          Mr. Gray raises his left (non-gun holding) hand, displaying a
          leather billfold with a badge in it.
          
                                           MR. GRAY
                                  (good Italian accent)
                             Gendarmeria Vaticano!
          
          Recognizing the ID, the two Cops glance away for a second, to
          search the rest of the church --
          
                                         82.
          
          
          
          -- and Mr. Gray BLASTS two shots into each of them.
          
          They drop, dead, but one of them squeezes off a single round
          before falling.
          
          Mr. Gray looks down, at his right shoulder, where a dark red stain
          is spreading on his suit.    He touches it, more annoyed than
          anything.
          
          UNDERNEATH THE BURNING PEWS,
          
          Langdon has crawled as close as he dares to the raging fire, and
          the sleeve of his shirt is ablaze.    He rolls out the other side
          of the embers, stamping out the flames, gets to his feet, and
          takes off running.
          
          Mr. Gray pursues, only slowing his gait slightly to DOUBLE TAP two
          shots into the head of a dying Vatican Cop.
          
          ACROSS THE CHURCH,
          
          Langdon hurls himself over a balustrade and into a chapel on the
          far side of the church.    Bullets SHATTER the glass of an
          elevated crypt, three feet off the floor.    (Inside is a superbly
          detailed wax statue of a saint in death.)
          
          Langdon dives under it and crawls backwards, staring in horror at
          Mr. Gray's feet as they approach the chapel from across the
          church.
          
          Langdon's back THUDS into a wall.
          
          Dead end.
          
          But there's an old wooden grating in the wall.   He turns, KICKS
          it with both feet.
          
          The grating CRUNCHES into pieces, revealing a narrow crawlspace
          
          IN THE CRAWL SPACE,
          
          Langdon army-crawls through it.
          
          Mr. Gray's face appears in the entry to the crypt.    He pauses to
          change clips on his handgun --
          
          -- the floor beneath Langdon abruptly runs out   --
          
          -- Mr. Gray raises his gun     --
          
           -- and Langdon disappears. The gunshots THUD into cement wall
          where he was, not where he is.
          
                                         83.
          
          
          
          UNDERGROUND,
          
          Langdon CRUNCHES to a hard landing on a subterranean stone floor,
          rolls over, and sees Mr. Gray above him, now pointing down.
          
          But there's another crawl space, and Langdon scurries into it.
          
          IN THE SECOND CRAWL SPACE,
          
          it's hopelessly dark, an even tighter space than the last one,
          filled with cobwebs that Langdon blindly claws his way through.
          
          He hits another hole in the floor, falls a second time ---
          
          INTO THE CATACOMB,
          
           -- and lands on top of a pile of long-decayed skeletons in the
          nearly-black bottom of the church's underground warren of hiding
          places.
          
          He looks up.    He's ten feet from the nearest handhold, only a
          fool would follow him down here
          
          BACK UP IN THE BURNING CHURCH,
          
           -- and Mr. Gray is no fool.      He steps back over the balustrade
          and leaves the chapel.
          
          The waxen face of the carving in the sarcophagus melts in the
          intense heat of the out-of-control fire.
          
                                                                       CUT TO:
          
          INT      SISTINE CHAPEL - SALON        NIGHT
          
          In the salon outside the Sistine Chapel, the Camerlengo waits
          alone.    From inside can be heard the sound of VOICES in debate.
          
          Finally, the big doors open and Cardinal Mortati emerges, goes to
          him.
          
                                          MORTATI
                            My son... God answers all prayers.
          
          He puts a hand on the Camerlengo's shoulder.
          
                                          MORTATI (cont'd)
                            But sometimes the answer is no.
          
          The Camerlengo closes his eyes    -- this is a terrible, terrible
          mistake.
          
                                       84.

                           We can't hide this anymore.        The

                                         MORTATI
                           A despicable act of terrorism.
                           Father Simeon will make a suitable
                           announcement lamenting the loss of
                           life.      May I suggest you direct
                           your energies to helping the Swiss
                           Guard confront the possibility of this
                           explosive device, and leave church
                           leadership --
          
          He gestures to the open doors to the Sistine Chapel, and the
          assembled cardinals within.
          
                                         MORTATI       (cont'd)
                            -- to its leaders.
          
          The Camerlengo looks at him for a long moment, then turns and
          wa1ks away.
          
          Father Simeon, who had been lurking in the open doorway to the
          chapel, now glides up beside him and touches Mortati's arm.

                           Eminence.    There is a growing fear
                           that without the four prefiriti, a two-
                           thirds majority for any candidate may
                           be impossible.    Unless --
          
          He trails off, gestures vaguely.
          
                                             MORTATI
                           Speak plainly.
          
                                         FR. SIMEON
                           It is the recommendation of many that
                           you ask to be removed from your post
                           as Great Elector --
          
          Mortati raises an eyebrow, seeing where this is going.
          
                                         FR. SIMEON (cont'd)
                            -- thereby making yourself eligible
                           to wear the Ring of the Fisherman.
          
                                       85.
          
          
          
          Mortati looks at him for a moment, then looks back, over his
          shoulder, where a small knot of Cardinals, who have clearly
          discussed this, are looking at him in confirmation.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           If it is God's will, may His will be

                                                                        CUT TO:
          
          INT     OFFICE OF THE SWISS GUARD       NIGHT
          
          CLOSE ON a handwritten page, half-filled with mathematical
          computations; the other half with a scratchy handwritten prose.
          
          (IF WE'RE EAGLE-EYED, we'll notice the phrase we move past just as
          we cut into the scene is "may His will be done," the same phrase
          we just heard Mortati utter.)
          
          Commandante Rocher is at his desk, Vittoria's leather-bound
          journals on the desk in front of him.    He's studying them
          carefully, and seems troubled by what he reads.
          
          Through the glass walls of his office, we can see a commotion in
          the still-chaotic Swiss Guard headquarters.    Someone is walking
          toward us, briskly, a WOMAN'S VOICE complaining loudly in Italian.
          
          Rocher calmly places the journals on top of the screen of the
          video monitor inlaid in his desk, the one we saw earlier, with a
          keyhole where a power switch should be.
          
          He pushes a button and the monitor rotates shut, into an inlaid
          panel in the desk's surface.    It closes just after --
          
                                         VITTORIA (O.S.)

                           country, with its own laws, and when
                           those journals crossed our border they
                           became our property.     You will get

          She looks at him, then down at the desk, where the outline of the
          hidden panel is visible in the veneer of the wood.

          He stresses her title, as if it offends
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          EXT     SANTA MARIA DELLA VITTORIA        NIGHT
          
          The burning church, now mostly extinguished.    But a LARGE CROWD
          has gathered, along with a dozen police and fire vehicles.
          
          INT     SANTA MARIA DELLA VITTORIA        NIGHT
          
          As FIREMEN put out the last of the flames (not using water, but
          Halon gas, which creates no steam), a metallic TAPPING sound comes
          from somewhere.
          
          One of the Firemen approaches another, gets his attention   -- stop
          what you're doing and listen.
          
          They shut down a hose and stop, listening.
          
          There it is again.    They SHOUT in Italian to the others, now
          everybody shuts down their hoses and listens.
          
          The metallic TAPPING echoes in the smoldering church.
          
          They walk toward it -- it's coming from an oval plate in the
          floor, like a manhole cover, heavy and carved.   We've seen one
          of these before, it leads to a Demon's Hole.
          
          The TAPPING is louder now, rhythmic.    Somebody's down there.
          Crowbars are produced, the cover of the Demon's Hole is pried off
          and shoved aside, revealing --
          
                                        87.
          
          
          
           -- Robert Langdon, wedged into the top of the opening, holding a
          rock in one hand as he clings precariously to the walls he has
          climbed.
          
          Strong hands reach down, haul him to his feet      --
          
          AT THE FRONT OF THE CHURCH,
          
           -- and those same feet hurry to the front of the smoldering
          church, coming to a stop in front of --
          
          -- Bernini's Ecstasy of St. Teresa.
          
          The statue he came here to find.    Now, as the Italian-speaking
          police and firemen work around him, Langdon moves, as if in his
          own world.    He looks to the statue, repeating fragments of the
          poem he has by now memorized:
          
                                         LANGDON
                           Let angels guide you on your lofty
                           quest...
          
          Directly over the recumbent saint, against a backdrop of gilded
          flame, hovers Bernini's angel.    The angel's hand clutches a
          pointed spear of fire.

                           unfold...
          
          Langdon's eyes follow the direction of the shaft, arcing toward
          the right side of the church.
          
                                              VOICE (O.S.)
                           Professor?
          
          A ROMAN POLICEMAN, a member of the Carbinieri, comes up to
          Langdon, discussing him in Italian with TWO OTHER COPS as he
          approaches.
          
                                         ROMAN COP
                           Langdon, is it?
          
          Langdon ignores him, pointing at the wall instead.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           What direction is that?

                           Langdon, we've confirmed with the
                           Vatican that they invited you into
                           this investigation, but what I-
          
                                         88.

                              Map.
          
          A MOMENT LATER,
          
          as if by command, a map CRINKLES out on the floor of the church.
          It's detailed, a fire department map, and Langdon drops down on
          all fours, studying it.
          
                                            LANGDON
                              We're here... Piazza Barberini...
          
          Langdon whips a glance over at the angel, gets bearings, and
          rotates the map to match.
          
          His finger travels over the map and      --
          
          CLOSE ON THE MAP,
          
          we watch as his finger crosses church after church after church,
          tiny black boxes with crosses in them.    There must be two dozen.
          
                                               LANGDON
                              Damn it.
          
          He sits back for a moment.
          
          The Roman Cop bends down next to him.          Treats him like a crazy
          person.
          
                                            ROMAN COP
                              Professor, I need to know what you saw
                              here.
          
                                            LANGDON

                                   (the Cop doesn't
                                    UNDERSTAND)
                              The Church, it was the first altar of
                              science.
          
          The Cop points to a spot at the top center of the map.

          The Cop points to a spot at the bottom center.
          
          Langdon's eyes widen, he grabs the Cop by the lapels       --
          
          -- and pulls a pen from the man's pocket.
          
                                       89.
          
          
          
          He turns back to the map and draws a straight line, from north to
          south, connecting the two churches the Cop just pointed to.
          
                                         LANGDON (cont'd)
                           And we're over here --
          
          He puts the pen on a point on the eastern side of the map.

                            -- and west is --
          
          He draws a line straight across the map, to the west, sucking in
          his breath as he realizes something.
          
                                             LANGDON   (cont'd)
                           'Cross Rome...
          
          Now he stands, slowly, and as he stands, we rise up, to get a
          birds-eye view of the map on the floor.
          
          On which he has drawn a perfect cross.
          
                                         LANGDON (cont'd)
                           It's a cross.    The poem meant it
                           literally.    The four altars of
                           science form a perfect cross.
          
          The Cop, who has no clue what he's talking about, gets a call on
          his radio and turns away to take it.

                           should be right about --
          
          He drops to his knees again, and traces the horizontal line to
          where it stops on the western side of the city, exactly as far
          from the center line as was the church on the eastern side.

                           the Vatican immediately.    Commander
                           Rocher has asked to see you.

          As Langdon peers down, we see the line on the map comes to a stop
          in the center of a place called Piazza Navona, and as we go in
          closer on the map, an odd-shaped object in the middle of the
          Piazza starts to move, to ripple, right there on the map, and we
          hear the sound of running water as it slowly dissolves to --
          
                                                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          
          EXT      PIAZZA NAVONA        NIGHT
          
           -- Bernini's spectacular Fountain of the Four Rivers in the
          Piazza Navona.
          
          There is a black van parked beside the fountain, and we drift over
          toward it.    Passing through the passenger window, we go inside
          to find --
          
           -- Mr. Gray, facing the rear of the van, his jacket off and his
          shirt open, engaged in battlefield surgery on his injured right
          shoulder.    Using a long-handled tweezers, he digs into his own
          flesh, gets a hold of the bullet that pierced him, and tosses it
          onto the metal floor of the van with a TING.
          
          It lands beside a lumpy tarp, and as metal hits metal, the tarp
          jumps.
          
          There's a human being in there.       Mr. Gray speaks to the lump.
          
                                         MR. GRAY
                           Were it up to me, it would not be this
                           way.    It is a sin to kill with pain.

                           But I am a sinner.
          
          We pan off him quickly and look out the driver's window, up at a
          clock tower on the far side of the plaza.
          
          It's sixteen minutes to eleven.
          
                                                                        CUT TO:

          Langdon hurries down the steps of the still-smoldering church,
          followed closely by the Roman Cop and TWO OTHER COPS.

          He realizes he spoke too loudly, and there is quite a crowd
          assembled outside the smoking church.    Langdon lowers his voice

                            Now you can either do what they tell
                            you and force me to go to the Vatican,
                            where we can all mourn his death
                            together, or you can show them how
                            real cops act and take me to the

                            to stop it.
          
          The Cop looks at him, thinking, confers with another Cop in rapid
          Italian.    Langdon checks his watch.

          In the papal office, the Camerlengo sits, alone, in front of the
          fireplace, staring into the flames, thinking.
          
          Behind him, a small knot of Swiss Guard debate their next move in
          Italian.    He speaks softly to them, in Italian, subtitled.

                           cardinals.    But with dignity, let
                           them exit into St. Peter's Square,
                           with their heads held high.    I don't

                           understand?
          
          The Guardsmen are uncomfortable with that idea.

          They get out.    He stares into the flames.
          
                                                                       CUT TO:
          
          
          
          EXT      PIAZZA NAVONA      NIGHT
          
          Piazza Navona is lightly peopled on this soft summer night with so
          much attention directed toward the Vatican.
          
          The hood of a car glides into view, nearly silent, on the far side
          of the fountain.    Langdon and the two Roman Cops step out and
          survey the area.
          
          Langdon looks to the fountain.    Its central core is twenty feet
          tall, a rugged mountain of marble with caves and grottoes through
          which water churns.    Atop it stands an obelisk that climbs
          another forty feet.

          But there's no angel anywhere.      He turns to the first Roman Cop.

                           The marker's no good without an angel,
                           pointing to the final-
          
                                         ROMAN COP
                           Blame Mussolini.    He wanted it for
                           his summer-
          
          But the Cop stops mid-sentence as he notices the black van parked
          on the far side of the fountain.
          
          Silently, the Cops gesture to each other to go opposite ways
          around the fountain, and to Langdon to stay where he is.
          
          Langdon, frustrated but no action hero, watches them as they
          slowly encircle the van.
          
          AT THE DRIVER'S SIDE,
          
          the First Cop approaches the Driver's Window, sees Mr. Gray
          sitting implacably behind the wheel.    He taps lightly with a
          knuckle, his drawn gun at his side, just out of view.
          
                                           94.
          
          
          
          Mr. Gray opens the window.
          
                                                 MR. GRAY
                             Si?
          
          The Roman Cop looks down, ever so briefly, at a small spreading
          bloodstain on Mr. Gray's shirt.    When he looks back up --
          
          -- there is a silenced pistol pointing directly at him.
          
          PHOOM.
          
          He takes a bullet in the forehead, slumps forward against the
          window, and --
          
          FROM A DISTANCE,
          
          we see his body pulled rapidly into the van through the driver's
          window.    Whole thing took about three seconds.    DINERS at an
          outdoor cafe don't even notice.
          
          FROM LANGDON'S POINT OF VIEW,
          
          on the other side of the fountain, the van rocks slightly, but he
          can't see anything out of the ordinary.
          
          He turns, looks to the Second Cop, who is just now approaching
          from the rear of the van.
          
          WITH THE SECOND COP,
          
          this one's got his gun in front of him, he's ready for anything.
          We creep around the back of the van with him, and just as he comes
          around to where he can see the driver's side --
          
           -- the barrel of the silencer presses into his forehead.   A
          quick exchange in Italian:
          
                                                 SECOND COP
                             Per favore?
          
                                                 MR. GRAY
                             Non posso.
          
          PHOOM.
          
          Another bullet, another slumping Cop, and
          
          FROM LANGDON'S POINT OF VIEW,
          
          the van rocks again, but he can't see anything more detailed than
          that.    All he knows is the two cops aren't coming out from the
          other side of the van, something is going on --
          
                                        95.
          
          
          
          -- and the bell in the clock tower starts to BONG.
          
          EVEN UNARMED,   LANGDON STARTS TO MOVE FORWARD,   JUST AS   --
          
          -- the sliding door on the fountain side of the van SLAMS open
          
           -- revealing the figure of the FOURTH CARDINAL, wrapped in chains
          and with manacled hands and feet.    He thrashes against the iron
          links, but the chains are too heavy.    One of the links bisects
          his mouth like a horse's bit, stifling his cries for help.    Mr.
          Gray hovers over him.
          
          Langdon GASPS   --
          
          -- and Mr. Gray shoves the bound figure roughly out of the van.
          
          The Cardinal rolls, falling into the fountain with an enormous
          SPLASH.    His weighted body sinks immediately to the bottom.
          
          There is a moment, frozen in time, in which Langdon locks eyes
          with Mr. Gray, still hunched in the back of the van as the clock
          tower continues to BONG, the only sound we can hear.
          
          Langdon looks at him, then down at the body in the fountain, then
          back up at Mr. Gray--
          
          -- who salutes him ---
          
          -- the van door SLAMS shut, and the van tears ass out of there.
          
          Langdon looks from its receding taillights to the idling police
          car, its door hanging open, he could jump in and give chase, but
          then his eyes go back to the fountain, where the drowning cardinal
          must not have much time left, and it's really no decision at all.
          
          Langdon covers the distance to the fountain in two quick strides
          and leaps in.
          
          IN THE FOUNTAIN,
          
          the water is waist deep and like ice.    Steady streams of bubbles
          rise up from the bottom, churning it.
          
          Langdon reaches the body of the Cardinal, plunges in   --
          
          UNDERWATER,
          
          -- and struggles to get both arms underneath the drowning man.
          
          Through the watery haze, we can see the man's bare chest, branded
          with the final ambigram:
          
                                         WATER.
          
                                       96.
          
          
          
          Langdon struggles to lift him, but the weight is too much, he can
          barely get him a few inches off the bottom of the fountain, much
          less all the way to the surface.
          
          Langdon, running out of air, bursts to the surface and   -- ON THE
          SURFACE,
          
          -- takes a deep breath, then plunges back   --
          
          UNDERWATER,
          
          -- but he still can't move the Cardinal.
          
          He makes eye contact with the dying man, who seems to be accepting
          his fate, maybe even welcoming it.
          
          Langdon changes his grip, strains like hell, and actually gets him
          a few inches higher this time, but nowhere close to the air
          supply.
          
          But with the new position, his eyes fall on something behind the
          cardinal -- a plastic tube, six inches across, streaming bubbles
          into the fountain.
          
          He goes back   --
          
          ABOVE THE SURFACE
          
           -- takes another breathy and sees the fountain of bubbles rising
          up to the surface just above the tube.    Air!
          
          Several PASSERS-BY notice the commotion in the fountain as Langdon
          dives back under the water.
          
          UNDERWATER,
          
          Langdon drags the body of the Cardinal a few feet across the
          bottom of the fountain and RIPS the tube free from its mooring,
          pulling it to the Cardinal's mouth.
          
          He clamps it down over the man's lips, and the Cardinal sucks a
          few greedy breaths from it.    Enough to keep him alive.
          
          Langdon takes the tube and draws a couple breaths of his own, then
          digs his hands back underneath the Cardinal to lift him, but this
          time --
          
          -- SIX MORE HANDS come in from all sides.
          
          Several Passers-by have jumped into the fountain to help, and as
          they all strain together --
          
                                         97.
          
          
          
          ON THE SURFACE,
          
           -- the Cardinal's bound body breaks the surface and he GULPS deep
          lungfuls of air.
          
          He is saved.    Langdon sags against the side of the fountain,
          exhausted and freezing, as the others pull the Cardinal's body to
          safety.
          
          In the distance, SIRENS.
          
          Langdon, gathering himself, goes to the Cardinal, speaks in rapid
          Spanish, subtitled.

                            where you were being held, isn't it?
          
          Guidera nods weakly as, around them, it seems like everybody
          arrives at the fountain -- Carbinieri, Swiss Guard, Vatican
          Police, paramedics -- car after car after car.

                            Where is it?!
          
                                          CARDINAL GUIDERA
                            Castel... Sant'Angelo...
          
                                                                     CUT TO:

          CLOSE ON a row of weapons in a cabinet in the Office of the Swiss
          Commander Rocher selects a pistol and slips it into a harness.
          
          While his back is turned to the room, Lt. Chartrand, the young
          Swiss Guardsman who escorted Langdon to the Archives, hurries up
          behind him.
          
                                          CHARTRAND
                            Langdon says Cardinal Guidera will be
                            killed in Piazza Navona.    He's on
                            his way there with two Carbinieri.
          
                                       98.

                           Send everyone we can spare.
          
          He closes and locks the cabinet, heads for the door.     Alone.
          
                                             CHARTRAND
                           You?

                           Staying here to continue the search
                           for the explosive.
          
          He leaves.    Chartrand looks back at the weapons cabinet.     Sees
          the space from which the pistol was taken.
          
                                                                       CUT TO:
          
          EXT     CASTEL SANT'ANGELO         NIGHT
          
          We fly over a bridge, flanked by a dozen angel statues standing
          sentinel on either side, leading directly toward--
          
           -- the Castel Sant'Angelo, Castle of the Angels, its ancient
          stone ramparts lit by floodlights.    Soaring swiftly up its
          facade, we close in on a mammoth bronze angel standing atop the
          citadel.
          
          It points the way, all right, its sword aimed directly downward,
          at the castle itself, as if to say you've found it.
          
          DOWN ON THE GROUND,
          
          several Police Cars come to a stop in front of the castle at the
          same time.
          
          Langdon climbs out the back of one just as Vittoria gets out of a
          car driven by a SWISS GUARDSMAN.
          
          Langdon grabs her, thrilled to see her.
          
                                         LANGDON

                           Cold and wet but alive.       Where's
                           Rocher?

                           I don't know. He took the journals,
                           he's hiding something.
          
                                       99.
          
          
          
          More Cops arrive, and a SECURITY GUARD is pressed into service
          behind them, opening the massive front doors to the Castle,
          
                                          LANGDON
                            This is it.    The Church of
                            Illumination is somewhere in the
                            castle.
          
          Cops pour into the courtyard of the castle.       Langdon and
          Vittoria follow.
          
          
          
          EXT     CASTEL SANT'ANGELO - COURTYARD          NIGHT
          
          They dash around the outer bulwark of the Castle.       The courtyard
          beneath them looks like a museum of ancient warfare     -- catapults,
          stacks of marble cannonballs, fearful contraptions.
          
          As the Cops quickly and silently search every nook, Langdon and
          Vittoria follow closely.
          
                                          LANGDON
                            The Vatican used this place for
                            centuries as a hideout, a prison for
                            enemies of the church -- there are
                            passages and catacombs everywhere. It
                            makes sense, the Illuminati
                            infiltrated the Church's own
                            stronghold.    Bernini was chief
                            architect here, he left clues
                            everywhere, it's even surrounded by a
                            pentagonal park!
          
          They reach the central core of the castle.
          
          Another angel statue, similar to the one atop the citadel, stands
          in front of them, its sword held in the same position, pointing
          downward at an angle.
          
          Langdon studies it, follows the line of the angel's sword       -- and
          sees a gated drive that cuts across the courtyard itself.
          
                                             LANGDON   (cont'd)
                            There.
          
          A MOMENT LATER,
          
          he and Vittoria are down in the courtyard, at the mouth of the
          gated drive. The gate is open and leads to a tunnel, a gaping
          entry in the central core.
          
                                        100.
          
          
          
                                            LANGDON
                              A traforo.    Commanders on horseback
                              used them to ride directly into a
                              castle from the outside.
          
          He gestures to the nearby Cops, who are already on it, and they
          all head into the darkened tunnel.
          
          INT   TUNNEL       NIGHT
          
          Police flashlights switch on and their beams bounce crazily off
          the walls of the tunnel.
          
          Footsteps CRUNCH as they all press in, Langdon and Vittoria
          content to let men with guns lead the way.
          
          It gets darker as they descend, and then, by the echo of their
          footfalls, they can tell they've entered --
          
          A LARGE CHAMBER.
          
          More lights are switched on, illuminating the space, which
          terminates in three stone walls.
          
                                            LANGDON
                              It's a dead end.
          
          But the Police attention is focused on the black van parked in the
          center of the room.
          
          Roman Police snap into action, flashlight beams bounce everywhere,
          guns point in every possible window of the van, SHOUTS for
          whoever's inside to get the hell out now, now, now.
          
          The doors are flung open.
          
          The van is empty.
          
          Except for the two dead policemen from the Piazza Navona.
          
          The police frenzy reaches an even higher level, URGENT MESSAGES
          passed along on radios, half the Cops turning and heading back out
          of the tunnel.

          Vittoria listens to the orders being given in Italian.

                           No... no, it has to be here!
          
          But there's no stopping the Cops, and the only two that remain are
          posted outside the van, guarding their fallen colleagues.

                           Robert, it's a dead end.
          
          Langdon walks forward, to the stone wall at the end of the tunnel,
          and feels his way along it.
          
          It joins smoothly with the wall on the right side.
          
                                                VITTORIA   (cont'd)
                           Robert...
          
          But he waves her off, this has to be it.    He feels all along the
          wall toward the other corner, and as he looks down at the ground,
          his eyes widen.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           Bring a flashlight.
          
          Vittoria borrows a flashlight from one of the two remaining Cops,
          who now get a CRACKLY MESSAGE on their walkie-talkies and race out
          of the tunnel, toward the top, leaving Langdon and Vittoria alone
          in the dead end.
          
          She brings the light to Langdon, who shines its beam down at the
          floor.    There, in the corner, is a granite block.
          
                                         LANGDON (cont'd)
                           None of the other blocks are granite.
                           And they're all square.
          
          He bends down, looks closer.
          
                                         LANGDON (cont'd)
                           This one's a pentagram.   It points --
          
          Sure enough, the block is carved in the shape of a pentagram, with
          the tip pointing into the corner.
          
                                         LANGDON           (cont'd)
                            -- at nothing.
          
          But as he shines the light, there's something off about the shadow
          it casts in the corner of the room.    It creates an odd, dark
          slit.
          
          Langdon crouches in the corner and slides his hand along the back
          wall of the chamber.    When he reaches the point at which it
          should intersect the side wall --
          
                                        102.
          
          
          
          -- his hand disappears.

                              The walls overlap.
          
          He flattens himself against the back wall, shining the light
          straight at what should be the intersection of the walls.    Half
          the flashlight's beam falls on the side wall, and the other half --
          
          INT     SECRET PASSAGE         NIGHT
          
          -- shines through into the secret passage behind the wall.
          
          Langdon draws in his breath and forces himself through the tiny
          slit, just wide enough for a determined person to squeeze through.
          
          Vittoria follows.
          
          They look ahead, shining the light. They're in an extremely narrow
          passageway.
          
          They start carefully down it, flashlight in front of them.   They
          whisper.
          
                                            LANGDON

          She pulls the gun from her waistband.
          
                                               VITTORIA   (cont'd)
                              I ignored you.

                              Ignore me any time you like.
          
          To their right, they pass half a dozen tiny jail cells, the iron
          bars on most eroded away.    Several of the larger cells are
          intact, and on the floor of one they see black robes and red
          sashes.
          
          They approach an iron doorway in the wall. The door is ajar and
          beyond it there is some sort of passage. Langdon squints at two
          words above it -- II Passetto.
          
          Vittoria gestures    -- that way?
          
          Langdon shakes his head no.
          
                                       103.

                           An ancient escape route.
          
          They round a corner, where the tunnel takes a ninety degree turn
          to the right.    At the corner, Langdon notices another
          pentagrammal block in the floor.
          
          He bends, studies the direction it's pointing,         feels the wall    --

                           Another overlap.
          
           -- and finds another overlapping angle, this one even smaller
          than the last.    The wall is actually joined at the floor, seems
          to open out at the middle (in roughly the shape of a human form

          HE TAKES A DEEP BREATH,   SLIPS THROUGH THE GAP        --
          
          -- and finds himself at the base of a set of steep spiral stairs.
          
          Langdon looks up, to the top of the stairs.            There is an
          archway, adorned with a tiny carved angel.
          
          Vittoria slips through the gap, sees the carving too.

          Langdon, sensing they're close, starts up the stairs.

          Apostolic Palace.    He passes two Swiss Guardsmen with radios.

          Rocher keeps walking.

          Langdon and Vittoria creep into the Church of Illumination, and we
          get our first good look at it.
          
          The embellishments, though faded, are replete with familiar
          symbology.    Pentagram tiles.    Planet frescoes.    Pyramids.

                            find the cannister.
          
          Langdon nods, but he's fascinated by the place.
          
          In the center of the room, there is an open fireplace, its embers
          still smoking.    The four Illuminati brands, their faces wiped
          clean, have been placed back in a molded velvet case.
          
          Langdon, fascinated, spots an empty slot in the very center of the
          case, surrounded by the four used brands.
          
          But this one's missing.
          
          Vittoria arrives over his shoulder, having completed a quick
          search of the place.

          They freeze. Vittoria looks at Langdon, who nods     -- you'd better
          do it.    She does.

          They turn and face Mr. Gray.    He looks quite dapper, and not too
          much the worse for wear.    There is a briefcase on the ground
          beside him, and he's changed into a fresh shirt.

          She does.    He picks it up, ejects the clip and the round in the
          chamber, pockets them, and tosses the gun into the smoldering
          fire.

                           for?
          
          As if to answer his own question, he picks up the briefcase from
          the floor beside him.    Then studies Langdon for a moment.
          
                                       106.

                            Neither are you. I was expecting a
                            fanatic.

                            call me -- it is so important to
                            them that I know what they ask is
                            the Lord's will.    Or Allah's, or
                            Yahweh's.    And I suppose they're
                            right.    Because if He were not
                            vengeful, I would not exist, would
                            I?
          
          He picks up his briefcase.
          
                                              MR. GRAY (cont'd)
                            Be careful.        These are men of God.
          
          He turns to go.    Langdon can't help himself:

          Vittoria looks at Langdon like he's nuts.        Mr. Gray turns back,
          seems puzzled by the very thought.
          
                                          MR. GRAY
                            Because no one asked me to.
          
          He leaves.
          
          Langdon and Vittoria pause for a moment, look at each other     --

          But up ahead, there's light.      They race for it.

          comes out into the open for a hundred yards or so as it leaves the
          Castel Sant'Angelo.
          
          Ahead, they see a rope ladder over the side.        They look down.
          
          Directly below them, Mr. Gray is getting into an Alfa Romeo parked
          discretely at the end of a dead end street, making his escape.

          Langdon and Vittoria are running toward the Vatican again when the
          EXPLOSION rips through the still night.

          an enormous fireball.

          looms ahead, blocking their way.
          
          But as they draw closer, they find the ancient lock hanging open,
          and the gate swings freely.    This tunnel has been used, and
          recently.

          from behind the closed door.    Lt. Chartrand approaches
          nervously.
          
          He and the Guards look at each other, don't know what to do. From
          the other direction, Father Simeon, Cardinal Mortati's Aide,
          strides toward them.
          
                                          FR. SIMEON
                            I demand to speak to the Camerlengo.
          
          AN ANGRY SHOUT from behind the door draws their attention --what
          the hell is going on in there?
          
                                                                         CUT TO:
          
          INT      IL PASSETTO      NIGHT
          
          Langdon and Vittoria hit another gate, this one heavier, but it
          too is unlocked.    The sound of St. Peter's Square fades behind
          them now.
          
          UP AHEAD,
          
          they turn a corner and, without warning --- the tunnel ends.
          
          There is only a thick iron door, and as Langdon searches it with
          his flashlight, he finds no handle, no knob, no keyhole, no
          hinges.
          
                                          LANGDON
                            Senza chiave!    A one-way portal, the
                            only access is from the other side!
          
          With a ROAR of anger, he starts to POUND on the door.      Vittoria
          joins in.
          
          INT      OFFICES OF THE POPE - HALLWAY        NIGHT
          
          CLOSE ON a watch -- 11:40.     Outside the door to the Pope's
          office, Lt. Chartrand is desperate.
          
          While Father Simeon attempts to argue with him in Italian,
          Chartrand turns, hearing the POUNDING coming from down the hall.
          
          He heads toward it, rounds a corner   --
          
          INT      POPE'S PRIVATE LIBRARY       NIGHT
          
           -- and steps into the Pope's private library, where the POUNDING
          is louder.
          
                                      110.
          
          
          
          He steps to a heavy door in the wall, looks unused for a century,
          but it's clearly the source of the sounds.    He looks down, sees
          three keyholes in the door, and an ancient key in each of them.
          
          Chartrand puts his ear to the door, hears VOICES    --
          
          INT     IL PASSETTO      NIGHT
          
           -- and, on the other side, Langdon and Vittoria squint at the
          light as the heavy door is hauled open before them.
          
          Chartrand looks at them in amazement    -- how'd you get here?
          
                                         LANGDON
                           The Camerlengo is in danger!
          
          INT     PAPAL OFFICES - HALLWAY         NIGHT
          
          Chartrand, Langdon, and Vittoria round the corner and race down
          the hallway toward the Pope's office, just as --
          
           -- a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM comes from behind the closed doors. The
          Swiss Guard move fast, throwing open the door.
          
          INT      POPE'S OFFICE      NIGHT
          
          Langdon and the others race into the pope's office and find a
          truly bizarre scene.
          
          Rocher is near the fireplace, brandishing his sidearm, aimed at
          the Camerlengo, who lays on the floor, writhing in agony.
          
          His cassock is torn open, and his bare chest is seared black.     A
          large, square brand is on the floor at Rocher's feet.
          
          Two of the Swiss Guard act without hesitation    -- they open fire.
          
          Two bullets SLAM into Rocher's chest and he crumples.
          
          Father Simeon bursts into the room, and as he does the Camerlengo
          rolls over onto one side, points his index finger at Simeon, and
          cries out a single word:
          
                                             CAMERLENGO
                           ILLUMINATUS!
          
                                             FR. SIMEON
                           You bastard!        You sanctimonious-
          
          He rushes at the Camerlengo and Chartrand reacts on instinct,
          putting three bullets in Father Simeon's back.
          
                                         111.
          
          
          
          He falls to the floor, dead.
          
          Chartrand and the Guards dash to the Camerlengo, who clutches his
          chest, convulsing in pain.
          
          Langdon walks toward him, stunned, as the Guards pull the
          Camerlengo's hands away from his wound, revealing the fifth brand.
          
          The crossed keys, seared into the flesh of his chest.
          
          Langdon looks at Rocher in utter disbelief. Rocher's still alive,
          trying to say something, holding out a hand.
          
          Everyone else in the room is focused on the Camerlengo, so Langdon
          bends down, takes the dying man's hand.
          
          Rocher looks up at him, desperation in his eyes, trying to
          communicate something but too weak to say more than:
          
                                                ROCHER
                           For safety.
          
          And his eyes close.
          
          Langdon withdraws his hand from Rocher's, and finds the dying man
          has pressed something into his palm.
          
          A key.
          
          Langdon looks at it, and it gives him a thought. He turns, looks
          at the Camerlengo, whose chest is exposed.
          
          The crossed keys are indeed branded there      -- but they're upside
          down.
          
          Langdon slips the key in his pocket and approaches the Camerlengo
          as Chartrand gets to his feet, on his radio.
          
                                         CHARTRAND
                           I need a Medevac to St. Peter's
                           Square, right now!
          
          The Camerlengo struggles to a sitting position.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           Order the evacuation.    We only have
                           nineteen minutes.

                           this be any different?
          
          He looks at Rocher, dead on the floor.        Back at the branded
          keys.

                           church so much they were willing to

          Chartrand called SWOOPS in low overhead as Vatican Police

          They race down the center aisle, to the candlelit balustrade which
          surrounds the winding staircase into the grottoes.

          The Camerlengo drops to his knees and opens an iron grate in the
          marble floor.
          
                                                                       CUT TO:

          Vittoria, Langdon, the Camerlengo, and Chartrand drop down through
          an open hole and into an underground city of ancient, winding
          streets.    Part museum, part ruin, they run past ancient
          structures, some hundreds, some thousands of years old.
          
          The rectangular tombs are similar to little houses, complete with
          doorways, thresholds, windows, and terraces.
          
          AROUND A CORNER,
          
          the Camerlengo seems to know exactly where he's going; he leads
          them down a narrow stone passageway.
          
          AROUND ANOTHER CORNER,
          
          they hurry up a small hill.    At the top of the grade, there is a
          stone grotto, toward which the Camerlengo is racing.
          
          He reaches the grotto, searches, but finds nothing.
          
          Langdon and Vittoria come to a stop behind him, breathing hard.

                             It must be here!    It must be!
          
          He rips aside some protective tarps, finds that underneath the
          actual burial site is an underground area, part of a dig in
          progress.
          
          He climbs down into it, we see just the top of his head as   --
          
          -- a soft glow seems to emanate from beneath him.
          
          The Camerlengo's head is wreathed in light for a moment, and then,
          as he climbs out, we see that he's holding in his hands --
          
          -- the glowing canister of anti-matter.
          
          ON THE GROUND NEARBY,
          
          Vittoria drops to her knees, a tiny silver pellet in one hand, two
          wires leading from opposite ends of it.

          the timer.

          She leans down, reaching for the canister's baseplate.
          
          As she does, a drop of sweat rolls to the tip of her nose She
          freezes.
          
          Wipes the sweat away, thinking about it

                            It's hot down here.   Isn't it?

                            What's wrong?
          
                                          VITTORIA
                            Heat decreases battery life.      We may
                            have less than five minutes.
          
                                                 CAMERLENGO
                            So?

                            If I pull the power with less than
                            five minutes, the residual charge
                            won't hold suspension. We should leave
                            it and get clear if we can. At least
                            if it goes off down here the damage
                            will be-
          
                                                 CAMERLENGO
                            NO.
          
          And with that, he snatches up the canister and takes off running,
          back the way they came.

                            Father, please!
          
          But he's already gone, around a darkened corner.
          
          EXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE           NIGHT
          
          In St. Peter's Square, the helicopter that was brought in for the
          Camerlengo waits, propellers spinning.
          
          The Crowd seems even bigger now, and a REPORTER tells us why:
          
                                          REPORTER
                             -- in St. Peter's Square where,
                            despite a bomb threat and order of
                            evacuation, the crowd is actually
                            growing in size as we await --
          
                                          116.
          
          
          
          INT      ST.   PETER'S BASILICA           NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo emerges from the spiral staircase, accidentally
          kicks over one of the oil lamps, spilling its burning oil on the
          floor of the Basilica.
          
          He ignores it, racing for the front doors.
          
          INT     THE NECROPOLIS          NIGHT
          
          Langdon and Vittoria come around a corner in the Necropolis,
          having taken slightly longer to find their way.
          
          Langdon spots the circular entry by which they first came in.
          
                                                 LANGDON
                            There it is!
          
          They race toward it and climb up.
          
          
          
          INT      ST.   PETER'S BASILICA           NIGHT
          
          They hurry across the floor of St. Peter's Basilica and burst out
          the huge doors that open onto St. Peter's Square, just as --
          
          EXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE           NIGHT
          
          -- the helicopter lifts off.
          
          The Crowd watches in amazement, and the PILOT stands in the
          square, talking animatedly to two Swiss Guard, gesturing toward
          the helicopter.    But if he's not flying it...
          
          Langdon looks up at the helicopter as it climbs, straight upward.
          
                                                 LANGDON
                            Oh my God...
          
          INT     HELICOPTER       NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo is indeed at the controls of the helicopter,
          piloting it upwards and away from the crowd below.    The canister
          is beside him on the passenger seat.
          
          EXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE           NIGHT
          
          The crowd falls silent, all eyes turning upward, watching the
          helicopter recede into the clouds.
          
                                          117.
          
          
          
          INT     HELICOPTER       NIGHT
          
          The canister BEEPS on the seat beside the Camerlengo -- still a
          few minutes left on its timer, but the urgently flashing red power
          light can't be considered a good sign.
          
          The Camerlengo looks at it.
          
          Crosses himself.
          
          Raises the crucifix from around his neck and brushes it against
          his lips.
          
          EXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE          NIGHT
          
          All eyes are upturned, all voices have fallen still, watching as
          the helicopter's anti-collision lights disappear into the clouded
          night sky.
          
          EXT     IN THE SKY       NIGHT
          
          High above the square, the helicopter still climbs, rotating in
          circles.
          
          INT     HELICOPTER       NIGHT
          
          CLOSE ON the canister as the red light flashes even faster, and a
          shrill BEEPING fills the cockpit.
          
          EXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE          NIGHT
          
          In the crowd, faces turn, PEOPLE point.        There's something in
          the sky above them.
          
          Langdon and Vittoria see it too -- a faint white speck, far up in
          the sky.    This is the explosion?
          
          EXT     IN THE SKY       NIGHT
          
          No, the faint white speck is a billowing parachute    -- and the
          
          Camerlengo dangles at the end of it.
          
          ABOVE HIM,
          
          the helicopter continues to climb, far up into the night.
          
          INT     HELICOPTER       NIGHT
          
          And in the canister, the BEEPING sound becomes continuous and the
          light winks out altogether.
          
                                          118.
          
          
          
          The shimmering bead of anti-matter falls out of suspension and
          drops, slowly, toward the bottom of the canister, it barely
          touches the surface --
          
          EXT     IN THE SKY         NIGHT
          
           -- and the helicopter explodes in a blinding pinpoint of white
          light.
          
          EXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE          NIGHT
          
          Up in the sky over St. Peter's Square, the pinpoint of light is
          tiny at first, then it shoots out to either side in a searing
          white line, then the white line balloons out on either side,
          expanding into a gigantic ball of hot white light.
          
          And then the sound hits.
          
          THIS is the explosion, and it is so much more ferocious than we
          could have imagined.
          
          The entire image is bleached white, with only the faint outlines
          of people visible within it.
          
          And then concussive force of the blast hits, like heat waves,
          rippling everything in its way.    SCREAMING and panic.
          
          EXT     IN THE SKY         NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo, clinging to the parachute, is buffeted wildly,
          spun over and over, tangling him in his cords, which makes him
          fall faster.
          
          EXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE          NIGHT
          
          The second wave of the blast comes, and this one's ten times as
          powerful as the first.
          
          Everything standing is flattened -- PEOPLE, camera trucks, the
          fountain in the middle of the square collapses in a shower of
          marble and water.
          
          INT      ST.   PETER'S BASILICA         NIGHT
          
          Ceiling tiles fall and SMASH on the floor inside St. Peter's,
          statues topple.
          
          EXT     IN THE SKY         NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo falls, unconscious now, tumbling over and over,
          dropping too fast. He SLAMS off an angled rooftop, headed for the
          ground.
          
                                           119.
          
          
          
          EXT       ST.   PETER'S SQUARE           NIGHT
          
          In the square, Langdon and Vittoria dodge falling debris.
          Vittoria loses her footing as a chunk of plaster CRUNCHES off a
          building, plummeting toward her.
          
          Langdon pulls her to safety as the plaster PULVERIZES itself in
          the square.
          
          EXT      IN THE SKY       NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo CRUNCHES off the side of another building and
          drifts downward, fast, toward the crowd in St. Peter's.
          
          His unconscious form SMASHES through a dozen people before SLAMMING
          to the ground at one edge of the square.
          
          AND IN THE SKY ABOVE,
          
          the blast suddenly turns inward on itself, the heat and light and
          sound all seeming to suck back up into a perfect horizontal line,
          which then collapses in from the sides, until once again it is
          just a speck of white hot light --
          
           -- that disappears into the night.
          
          EXT      ST.    PETER'S SQUARE          NIGHT
          
          The only sound that remains in the square is a soft night wind.
          
          The wounded pick themselves up off the ground.
          
          The crowd, realizing the blast is over, turns its attention to the
          body of the Camerlengo, on the far side of the square.
          
          Langdon and Vittoria try to make their way toward him, but the
          crowd surges past them, and we soar over the heads of the crowd,
          wanting to get there first, wanting to be the first ones to see
          
          --- his eyes open. He's alive.
          
          WIDE ON THE SQUARE AS
          
          a great CHEER rises up from the crowd.
          
                                                                     CUT TO:

          The CHEERS from outside are clearly audible in the Sistine Chapel,
          where the doors have been thrown open and they have gotten the
          news.    Jubilation reigns.
          
          A SWISS GUARDSMAN runs in, finds Cardinal Mortati.
          
                                          120.

                            Praise God.
          
          But he looks around him -- the Cardinals have split into small
          groups, they're discussing something with great animation amongst
          themselves.
          
          Mortati watches, doesn't like what he's seeing.
          
                                                                                 CUT TO:

          Langdon and Vittoria, on a bench in the office of the Swiss Guard,
          are having superficial wounds treated.    The buzz in the office is
          intense, just as excited as in the square and the Sistine Chapel.
          
          Langdon looks over at Vittoria.

          She looks back at him, nods. Smiles. He reaches over, interlaces
          his fingers with hers, and takes her hand.

          She smiles, turns his hand, noticing the glass on his wristwatch
          is broken.    He notices, seems distressed.

          comes from outside and we see --
          
          EXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE           NIGHT
          
           -- the crowd in St. Peter's Square, in rapture. There is SINGING,
          there's CHANTING of the Camerlengo's name.    It's exactly
          midnight.

          In the Sistine Chapel, Cardinal Mortati is in hushed, urgent
          conversation with a group of seven or eight Cardinals.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Signores... you are no doubt aware
                           that by Holy Law the man is ineligible
                           for election to the papacy.    He is
                           not a cardinal, he is a priest, a
                           chamberlain.    And there is the
                           matter of his inadequate age.    I'm
                           sorry, the protocols of conclave are
                           not subject to modification.    I will
                           not call a ballot on this matter.
          
          The African Cardinal who cast his vote earlier speaks up.
          
                                         AFRICAN CARDINAL
                           But Signore, you would not call the
                           ballot.    Surely you remember -- you
                           gave up your post as Great Elector.
          
          Mortati looks at him.    Boxed into a corner.
          
          Outside, the crowd in St. Peter's can be heard, singing joyously.
          
          A SECOND CARDINAL steps forward.
          
                                         SECOND CARDINAL
                           They are singing in St. Peter's
                           Square!   What happened here tonight
                           transcends our laws!
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Does it?    Is it God's will that we
                           abandon reason and give ourselves over
                           to frenzy?   Discard the rules of the
                           church?
          
          A THIRD CARDINAL now, a peacemaker:
          
                                         THIRD CARDINAL
                           Perhaps they need not be discarded.
          
          They all look at him.
          
                                         THIRD CARDINAL   (cont'd)
                           I am thinking now of Romano Pontifici
                           Eligendo, Numero 63.
          
          Most of the Cardinals look puzzled -- but Mortati's face darkens.
          
                                      122.
          
          
          
                                         THIRD CARDINAL (cont'd)
                           Balloting is not the only method by
                           which a Pope can be elected.    There
                           is another, more divine method.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           "Acclimation by Adoration."
          
                                             THIRD CARDINAL
                           Si, signore!
          
          The Second Cardinal sparks to this idea.
          
                                         SECOND CARDINAL
                           Of course!
                                (answering those around
                                 him who look confused)
                           Election by Adoration occurs when
                           all the cardinals, as if by
                           inspiration of the Holy Spirit,
                           freely and spontaneously,
                           unanimously and aloud, proclaim one
                           individual's name.
          
                                         THIRD CARDINAL
                           And the law states that Adoration
                           supersedes all other eligibility
                           requirements.    The candidate need
                           only be an ordained member of the
                           clergy.
                                (DRAMATICALLY)
                           BUT!
                                (they listen)
                           He must be present in the Sistine
                           Chapel at the moment of election.
          
          Many cries now of "Bring the Camerlengo to us!"
          
          Mortati looks deeply troubled.
          
                                                                     CUT TO:
          
          
          
          INT     ROCHER'S OFFICE      NIGHT
          
          Bandaged now, Langdon and Vittoria are ushered into Rocher's
          office by a Swiss Guardsman.
          
                                         SWISS GUARDSMAN
                           Please wait here while we arrange your
                           transportation.    May I get you
                           anything?
          
                                        123.
          
          
          
          They shake their heads, no thanks.        Settle into chairs to the
          side of Rocher's desk.
          
          They look uncomfortable   -- it's weird to be in a dead man's
          office.
          
          Vittoria looks at his desk.     Thinks of something.
          
          She gets up and goes to it, running her hand lightly over it.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           What are you doing?
          
                                         VITTORIA
                           Leonardo's journals.          I want them
                           back.
          
          She feels in the surface of the desk and finds the square outline
          of the inlaid panel where Rocher hid the journals.    She tries
          prying it open, but that doesn't work, she tries pushing down on
          the front of it --
          
           -- and the panel slowly rotates open.    The journals, which were
          laid on top of the television monitor, slide out and onto the
          desk.
          
          Vittoria scoops them up and is about to close the panel again
          when --
          
                                               LANGDON
                           Wait a minute.
          
          He looks down at the monitor.        Thinking.
          
          At its odd, key-shaped on/off switch.
          
          He pulls something from his pocket      -- the key Rocher gave him,
          just as he died.
          
          IN LANGDON'S MIND,
          
          he sees Rocher's face, looking up at him, dying:
          
                                               ROCHER
                           For safety.
          
          BACK IN THE OFFICE,
          
          Langdon looks at the key, and its odd shape.    Looks down at the
          monitor, the same odd shape where its switch should be.
          
                                       124.
          
          
          
          IN LANGDON'S MIND,
          
          they're back in the Pope's office, but Rocher is alive, and saying
          words he said earlier:
          
                                          ROCHER
                            The Holy Father was subject to
                            seizures... but he took steps.
          
          BACK IN THE OFFICE,
          
          Rocher's voice continues over, but Langdon mouths the words as he
          remembers them:
          
                                          ROCHER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                            "MADE SURE HE WAS WATCHED."
          
          IN LANGDON'S MIND,
          
          Rocher is back in the office again, finishing his sentence:
          
                                              ROCHER
                            For safety.
          
          IN ROCHER'S OFFICE,
          
          Langdon holds the key up, repeating those last words:
          
                                              LANGDON
                            For safety.
          
          He lowers the key to the monitor, extending it toward the keyhole
          
          -- and it's a perfect fit.      He twists it.
          
          And with a ZZZZT of power, the monitor winks to life.   An image
          comes into focus.
          
                                              VITTORIA
                            Where's that?
          
                                          LANGDON
                            That...is the papal office.
          
          On the monitor,
          
          they are indeed looking at an image of the Pope's office.    There
          are two dead bodies on the floor, covered with sheets, and VATICAN
          POLICE are photographing everything.    Must be live.
          
          IN ROCHER'S OFFICE,
          
          Langdon's figuring it out.
          
                                      125.
          
          
          
                                          LANGDON
                            The Pope spent a lot of time in
                            contemplation, alone.    If he was
                            worried about seizures, he must have
                            asked Rocher to install a camera
                            without telling anyone.    To keep an
                            eye on him.    For safety.    And
                            maybe --
          
          He reaches down to the screen, toward a touch panel at the bottom.
          
          You don't have to be a symbologist to understand these symbols-
          play, pause, fast forward.
          
          And rewind.   Langdon touches it.
          
          ON THE MONITOR,
          
          the image ZIPS backwards, rapidly, to the shooting, and the all
          the way back to when Rocher and the Camerlengo were alone
          together. Rocher stands just behind him, the Camerlengo still
          kneels before the fireplace.
          
          As the image starts to play forward, in real time, we go in close
          on the monitor and come out --
          
          INT     POPE'S OFFICE       NIGHT
          
          -- in the papal office, to watch the scene in person.
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            The scientist kept journals?      So?
          
                                          ROCHER
                            You figure prominently in them.
          
          The Camerlengo turns his eyes back to the flames, stirring the
          embers with a poker.
          
                                             CAMERLENGO
                            Really.
          
                                          ROCHER
                            Leonardo wasn't just a physicist, he
                            was a Catholic priest.    Deeply
                            conflicted about the implications of
                            his work and in need of spiritual
                            guidance.    About a month ago, he
                            requested an audience with the Pope.
                            But you'd know that, because you
                            granted the audience, and were present
                            during it.
          
          The Camerlengo twists the poker in the fire.     Speaks softly.
          
                                      126.
          
          
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           The fool thought he had duplicated the
                           moment of creation.
          
                                         ROCHER
                           And the Holy Father urged him to go
                           public.    His Holiness thought the
                           discovery might actually prove the
                           existence of a divine power -- begin
                           to bridge the gap between religion and
                           science.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           Science.    The new God.    Ignore the
                           weapons and chaos and madness.
          
          The Camerlengo looks up at him, and his expression is different
          than we've ever seen it.    Contemptuous.    Angry.    Violent.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO (cont'd)
                           His work was not religious, it was
                           sacrilegious!
          
                                         ROCHER
                           But you saw the Pope's position as a
                           softening of church law.    An old
                           man's weakness.    Your father's
                           weakness.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           He raised me to protect the church.
                           Even from within.
          
                                         ROCHER
                           So you brought an old enemy back from
                           the dead to frighten people.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           Nothing unites hearts like the
                           presence of evil.
          
                                         ROCHER
                           It didn't work, Father.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           It isn't finished.
          
                                         ROCHER
                           I've informed Father Simeon of what I
                           learned and he'll get word to the
                           Cardinals the moment conclave opens.
          
          The Camerlengo looks at him calmly for a moment   --
          
                                      127.
          
          
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            I was planning on doing this alone.
          
           -- and then removes the poker from the fire. But it isn't a
          poker, it's a long-handled brand, with a cross of some kind at the
          end.
          
          Rocher pulls his gun, holds it at his side.
          
                                             ROCHER
                            Put that down.
          
          The Camerlengo rips open his cassock with his free hand.
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            But perhaps it's better that you're
                            here.
          
                                          ROCHER
                                 (raising the gun)
                            Put it down!
          
          But the Camerlengo RAMS the red-hot brand into the exposed flesh
          of his bare chest.    His skin SIZZLES and smokes, Rocher SHOUTS,
          the Camerlengo SCREAMS in agony, and we know the rest --
          
           -- the door bursts open, Swiss Guard pour in, Rocher is shot,
          Father Simeon races toward the Camerlengo --
          
                                             FR. SIMEON
                            You bastard!       You sanctimonious-
          
           -- and the Camerlengo rolls over, pointing one long finger at
          Father Simeon and CRYING OUT:
          
                                             CAMERLENGO
                            ILLUMINATUS!
          
          As we saw before, Lt. Chartrand FIRES THREE TIMES, killing Father
          Simeon in his tracks, we pull back, the image turns to --
          
          INT      ROCHER'S OFFICE      NIGHT
          
           -- video again, and as we complete the move out from the monitor,
          we see it isn't Langdon and Vittoria watching the image this time --
          
          --- but Cardinal Mortati, flanked by two other red-robed Cardinals
          and a half-dozen Swiss Guardsman.
          
          Langdon and Vittoria stand to one side as Mortati turns and looks
          at them.    Suddenly, he seems very, very old.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:

          INT     GRAND STAIRCASE       NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo, escorted by two Swiss Guardsman, descends the
          Royal Staircase that leads to the Sistine Chapel.
          
          Though he is injured and limping, he radiates confidence, even
          benevolence, a man certain this is the greatest day of his life.
          
          He approaches the chapel doors, speaks to the Swiss Guard posted
          there as he approaches.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           I have been summoned by the College of
                           Cardinals.
          
          Oh, they know all about it.    They lift their swords, the doors
          sweep open, the Camerlengo strides boldly across the threshold --
          
          INT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT
          
           -- and stops, right there, the look of imminent ascendancy frozen
          on his face.
          
          The Cardinals are looking at him, all right, but not in joy, not
          in wonder, not for leadership.    One hundred sixty-one faces are
          turned toward his, with an expression of ---
          
          -- utter condemnation.
          
          He stands there for a moment, searching their faces, trying to
          figure out what could possibly have happened.
          
          But it doesn't matter.
          
          They know.   And he knows they know.
          
          He takes two steps backwards, almost involuntarily.
          
          Starts to teeter, balances himself in the doorway.
          
          Then straightens himself, smoothes his cassock.
          
          And turns and walks away, back up the staircase.
          
          Two Swiss Guard move to go after him, quickly, but Cardinal
          Mortati gestures to them.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Gently.    But within our walls.
          
          The Swiss Guard follow the Camerlengo up the staircase.
          
                                                                        CUT TO:
          
                                       129.
          
          
          
          INT      ST.   PETER'S BASILICA      NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo comes out of a doorway and into St. Peter's
          Basilica.    He heads for the main doors --
          
           -- just as HALF A DOZEN SWISS GUARD step in from outside,
          blocking his way.    Some MURMUR softly into their radios.
          
          He stops, turns around to come back the way he came ---
          
           -- but TWO SWISS GUARD appear in that doorway, also with radios.
          
          He turns again, no way to go but toward the front of the Basilica.
          
          He sees the candlelit balustrade near the front, the one that
          leads to the grottoes and the Necropolis.    He picks up his pace.
          
          The Swiss Guard follow, at a slight distance.
          
          The Camerlengo reaches the spiral staircase and stops, looking
          down, seeing the oil lamp he kicked over earlier.
          
          He thinks.     He picks up a fresh lamp, holds it to his face    --
          
           -- and blows out its flame with a soft PUFF.
          
          ACROSS THE BASILICA,
          
          we're with the Swiss Guard as they walk slowly toward him.
          
          But they hear a CRY from ahead, he's gone down the stairs a short
          distance, and they can hear the sound of liquid SLOSHING.
          
          They break into a run as they realize what he's about to do,
          they're twenty feet away, then ten, then just close enough to see
          the Camerlengo as he --
          
           -- SMASHES a burning oil lamp at his feet.     The flames leap
          onto his oil-soaked clothes and --
          
           -- HE IGNITES IN A PILLAR OF WHITE FLAME.
          
                                                                       CUT TO:

          CLOSE ON a bundle of one hundred sixty-one slips of paper, pierced
          by a needle and strung together.
          
          They're tossed into the fireplace in the Sistine Chapel, where
          they too burst into flame.
          
          We rise up again, ahead of the smoke this time, all the way up to      --

          still gathered, waiting for some word as the sun rises on the
          horizon. And this time, the smoke that billows from the chimney    --
          
          -- is white.
          
          There is a new pope.    The crowd ROARS its approval, BELLS begin

          INT     PAPAL APARTMENT DAY
          
          Inside the papal apartments, Robert Langdon sits stiffly on a
          straight-backed chair in a hallway.    Couldn't look more
          uncomfortable if he tried.
          
          A Swiss Guardsman stands on either side of him.
          
          The door to his right suddenly opens, another Guardsman nods to
          him, and Langdon gets to his feet, straightening his jacket.
          
          INT     OFFICE OF THE POPE DAY
          
          Langdon is shown into the office, where a robed figure is being
          dressed by two VATICAN ATTENDANTS -- the clothes he dons are
          unmistakably papal vestments.    The figure, his back to us,
          gestures to a nearby table.
          
          One of the Swiss Guardsmen goes to the table and picks up an
          envelope, hands it to Langdon.
          
                                         SWISS GUARDSMAN
                           A token of thanks from His Holiness.
          
          Langdon, puzzled, opens the envelope and lets the contents fall
          into his hand.
          
          It's a thin volume, but a familiar one -- the only surviving copy
          of Galileo's Diagramma.    Langdon nearly GASPS.
          
          The figure in the papal robes turn around.       It is, of course,
          Cardinal Mortati.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           This should help you complete your
                           scholarly work, Professor.
          
          Langdon is too stunned to speak,
          
                                         MORTATI   (cont'd)
                           I ask only that in your last will and
                           testament you ensure it finds its way
                           home.
          
                                           LANGDON
                           I   -- yes, I   -- of course.
          
                                       132.
          
          
          
          Mortati takes a few steps forward, studying Langdon,
          
                                         MORTATI
                           When you write of us -- and you will
                           write of us -- may I ask one thing?
          
          Langdon looks at him questioningly.
          
                                              MORTATI   (cont'd)
                           Do so gently?
          
                                              LANGDON
                           I'll try.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Religion is flawed, Mr. Langdon, but
                           only because man is flawed.
                           Including this one.
          
          He touches his chest lightly.
          
          The Aides now pick up the miter, the spade-shaped papal hat.   He
          stands still while they place it on his head, completing his
          attire.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           I hear you've chosen the name Luke.
                           There have been Marks and Johns, but
                           never a Luke.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           It's said he was a doctor.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           Is that a message?    Science and
                           faith all in one?
          
                                         MORTATI
                           The world is in need of both.
                           Science can heal, or science can kill.
                           It depends on the soul of the man
                           using the science.
          
          Langdon looks at him.   Likes the sound of that.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           You'll lead wisely.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           I'm an old man.    I'll lead briefly,
          
          Mortati comes closer to Langdon, raises his right hand, and makes
          a gentle sign of the cross over him, murmuring softly.
          
                                      133.
          
          
          
                                         MORTATI (cont'd)
                           Thanks be to God, for sending someone
                           to protect His church.
          
                                        LANGDON
                           I -- don't believe He sent me,
                           Father.
          
                                             MORTATI
                           Oh, my son...
          
          He smiles.
          
                                         MORTATI (cont'd)
                           Of course He did.
          
          He turns, and his Aides part the billowing silk curtains that lead
          to the papal balcony.
          
          We move forward with him as he steps out over St. Peter's Square
          and a great ROAR rises up from below.
          
          Cardinal Mortati, Pope Luke I, holds his arms out to his sides, an
          embrace to take in the world --
          
           -- and behind him, hidden in the shadows of the papal apartment,
          just behind the billowing curtains, Robert Langdon folds his hand
          in front of him --
          
          -- and bows his head.
          
          
                                                                   
                                          THE END

          EXT. FERRY LANDING - NEW ENGLAND SHORE - DAY
          The sparkling waters. The chirping spring day. We are on an isolated
          stretch of country shore , and a quiet, sheltered island is visible
          distantly across the Sound. There is asense of anticipation,
          excitement. VOICES can be heard. THE CAMERA is the POV of a VIDEO
          CAMERA, and a group of college kids wait just o.s. On-screen, however,
          for the moment, a proper, sweet-faced young COED faces the camera and
          -- reluctantly, under the urging of her friend behind the video lens -
          - sets the scene.
                         
                         SWEET COED
                         (SHYLY)
          Hi... My name is Mary O'Reilly O'Toole O'Shea and...over there is the
          island my friend Muffy owns... It's spring break... and she's invited
          us over for the weekend, and we're waiting for the ferry now to take
          us there...
           (blushing, mortified to cameraman)
          I don't know what else to say!
                         
          CAMERAMAN (CHAZ'S VOICE)
          Tell us something about yourself.
                         
                         SWEET COED
          Something about myself? Oh, Gee...
          (composing herself, earnestly)
          Well, I want to work with handicapped children... My parents are my
          best Friends... Next semester I start convent school, and I... fuck on
          the first date.
                         
          O.S. her friends explode with LAUGHTER. Brassy former deb NIKKI
          BRASHEARS gives us a big, wet wink, dropping the act.
                         
          SWEET COED/NIKKI
          April Fool...

          Whoo! Outrageous woman! Nikki, you are my kind o' gal!
                         
          He PANS THE CAMERA over to KIT-- a pretty, unaffected, natural beauty,
          bright and very much aware.
                         
                         CHAZ'S VOICE
          C'mon, Kit, how about you?
                         
          Kit waves him off, laughing in spite of herself. She's got nothing to
          say.
                         KIT
          Pass.
                         
                         CHAZ'S VOICE
          C'mon , Arch? Skip?
                         
          He PANS over to the other two college boys on the dock here - ARCH, a
          big, good-natured, easygoing WASP jock (rugby and crew); and SKIP, Mr.
          Preppy, the perfect image of the lazy spoiled, indulged, and reckless
          upper-crust kid. Skip also happens to be Muffy's cousin.
                         
                         ARCH
          (ponders it with due consideration)
          Yeah, sure... I fuck on the first date...
                         
          Skip cracks up. Arch's laughter follows.
                         
          NIKKI (O.S.)
          Where's Rob?
                         
          Chaz QUICK-PANS the camera back to Kit, following the action.
                         
                         CHAZ'S VOICE
          (teasing, with innuendo)
          Yeah, Kit, where is he?
                         
          ARCH (O.S.)
                         (MORE TEASING)
          Oh, Kit...
                         
          Concerned, Kit keeps her humor anyway, waving the lens away again.
                         
                         KIT
          Oh, c'mon, Chaz, give me some room, will you?
                         
          He does, finally shutting down the videopak. The image reverts to FILM
          again.
                         
                         NIKKI
          (looks at her, persisting)
          Well?
          INT. VOLVO WAGON IN MOTION - MAIN HIGHWAY - DAY
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          The driver -- a still great-looking, turned-out Fairfield County-type
          SUBURBAN LADY -- and the passenger, ROB FERRIS a cleancut,
          goodlooking, 20 year old public school grad ­sit in uncomfortable
          silence on opposite ends of the front seat.
                         
                         ROB
          (gestures, awkwardly)
          Here'll be fine, thanks...
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY INTERSECTION - DAY
                         
          The Volvo wagon pulls over. Rob drags out his daypack, too.
                         
                         ROB
                         (ABASHED)
          Thanks... for the lift, I mean...
                         
                         SUBURBAN LADY
          (smiles, no reason for disappointment)
          It was a real lift for me, too, hon.
                         
          A late model Detroit sedan slows at the intersection, turning off the
          highway to take the junction in the direction Rob is going. A road
          sign indicates: "BAR HARBOR MOUNT DESERT" in another direction.
                         
          Rob hefts his gear, hurrying to flag the sedan.
                         
          The Volvo wagon continues on, braking for the next undergraduate
          male hitchhiking down the road.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - ST. JOHN HOUSE- DAY
          CLOSE ON a wall calendar. A HAND reaches INTO FRAME, tearing off
          "MARCH" to begin "APRIL".
                         
          WIDEN TO REVEAL CLARA, the middle-aged housekeeper and offseason
          caretaker for the house. With her overcoat and purse on one arm, she
          drops the "MARCH" calendar page in a wastebasket, then crosses to the
          pantry where a door and wooden steps lead down to the basement.
                         
                         CLARA
                         (CALLING)
          The rooms are all in order, double- and triple-checked, and I'm on my
          way...
                         
          She hears a CLATTER from down below.
          INT. BASEMENT - DAY
                         
          MUFFY ST. JOHN drags a woman's body across the floor. The arm comes
          off in her hand.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Shit.
                         
                         CLARA'S VOICE
          Need any help down there?
                         
          Clara comes clopping down the steps. Muffy turns, the mannequin's arm
          still in her hand. Old workclothes and a head kerchief take the place
          of Muffy's normally impeccable prep Seven Sisters outfit (including
          the regulation penny loafers) in all this dust. Early 20's, pretty in
          an off-beat sort of way, Muffy is every inch a blue-blood.
                         
                         MUFFY
          (puffing with the effort)
          No, Clara, thanks. Just trying some last minute straightening down
          here... god, I don't think I've ever worked so hard in my life...!
                         
                         CLARA
          Sure you don't want me to stay? There's nobody gonna be around
          here to help till first ferry back Monday, y'know...
                         
                         MUFFY
          (continuing with her work)
          Nope, you're a peach, Clara. But this one's mine. I told my father I'd
          do it, and I will. My way. I don't want him to have any excuses.
                         
                         CLARA
          (dubiously , turning to go)
          All right, then. Have a nice party.
                         
                         MUFFY
          (a buoyant laugh)
          Nice? It has to be better than nice... it's gotta be bloody
          unforgettable!
                         
          Clara climbs the stairs.
                         
                         CLARA
          Good luck.
                         
                         MUFFY (CONT)
          Bye, Clara. See you Monday.
                         
          Soon there's the upstairs SOUND of the kitchen door closing behind
          Clara.
          Muffy finally props the mannequin, clearing away the remaining
          clutter. She goes to open a basement window for ventilation. It is a
          ground-level transom, hinged at the top. Through it Clara is visible
          departing the grounds.
                         
          Then Muffy hears a DRIPPING. She turns, hesitating, and follows the
          sounds.
                         
          INT. UTILITY ROOM
                         
          Part of the basement, an old washroom and more, with tub, slop sink
          and large incinerator. Muffy enters, pulling the chain on the bare,
          overhead bulb. It illuminates the room, and the tub underneath --
          slightly rusty at the drain, but otherwise spotless -- and the slowly
          dripping faucet.
                         
          EXT. FERRY LANDING - MAINLAND - DAY
                         
          CHAZ, the videocameraman and the only member of the group we haven't
          seen till now, is the first to spot the ferry approaching.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Here she comes...
                         
          He's a real hi-tech freak and Ivy League wiseass, a free spirit in
          neo-punk neck curl and button-down shirt. He shoulders his lightweight
          videopak again, taping it. Arch and Skip watch with him from the end
          of the pier. But Kit and Nikki, waiting nearer the office, are
          distracted by the SOUND of an arriving car.
                         
          ANGLE - PARKING LOT
                         
          It's not Rob, though. It's NAN, another newcomer. She pulls her car
          next to the others in the gravel lot behind the landing office and -
          gets out quickly, dragging a hefty suitcase out of the back seat. She
          is an unfamiliar face to Kit and Nikki --a shy, earnest, small-town
          girl, overdressed for the occasion.
                         
                         NAN
                         (HURRIED)
          Hi... is this the ferry to the St. John house?
                         
                         NIKKI I
          Any second now.
                         
                         NAN
          Oh, thank goodness ! I didn't know if I was on the right road...
                         
          Kit smiles welcome, lending a hand as Nan struggles the bag up the
          ramp.
                         KIT
          Hi. Kit Graham... Nikki Brashears.
                         
                         NAN
          Nan Youngblood.
                         
                         NIKKI
          (needling, about the suitcase)
          Planning on staying a while?
                         
                         NAN
          (flushes, embarrassed)
          Oh, no... just some work for finals, when we get back... you don't
          know how far behind I am...
                         
          Arch outhustles Chaz for her bag. Her simple attractiveness exerts an
          appeal.
                         
                         ARCH
          Hi. Arch Cummings . I've seen you around. Jewett Hall, right?
                         
                         CHAZ
          Chaz Vyshinsky. You got great legs.
                         
                         NIKKI
          (pointed1y, reminds him)
          Chaz, Arch already has her bag.
                         
          Meaning, Chaz is Nikki's man, especially for this weekend.
                         
                         NAN
          (volunteering, happily)
          Well, I only met Muffy this term in Drama Society . I volunteered to
          do their costumes... I like to sew... Did you see her in Ghosts? She's
          so talented. She was wonderful!

          (to Nan, approvingly; in greeting)
          Congratulations, on finding your way.
                         
          The landing BUMPS, the ferry touches down. They look up.

          Stand clear!
                         
          The large, raw-boned FERRYMAN holds open the wooden stile for the one
          and only passenger from the island ­ Clara -- to disembark. Clara
          passes them , giving first Skip and then the others a look, shaking
          her head in sad appraisal.

                         (GROWLS)
          Ok, let's go.
                         
          It's not the friendliest greeting in the world. The ferryman keeps the
          stile open for them to board singly. There is also a younger assistant
          on board -- BUCK, a pleasant, openfaced townie in his 20s.

                         (IN MOCK-TERROR)
          This is it? No going back? Trapped for days on an island where
          men are men, and women oughta know better?

          You could tie me in chains...
                         
          Chaz boards, passing Buck, the assistant.
                         
                         CHAZ
          (a low whisper)
          Your fly's open, and your Hostess Twinkie's hanging out...
                         
          The assistant gapes, falling for it, groping his fly. Which is closed,
          of course. He looks up, grinning. Chaz kisses him on the cheek, winks
          and moves on.
                         
                         BUCK
          Sh -i-i-t...
                         
          Kit is hanging back on the dock.
                         
                         FERRYMAN
          Come on if you're coming.

                         FERRYMAN
                         (GRUFFLY)
          It's Friday. My last run of the week. I don't get paid overtime.
                         KIT
          But you've got to wait. They said it's the only way over.
          If he misses this...
                         
          Arch WHISTLES loudly, seeing and alerting them.
                         
          PARKING LOT - THEIR POV
          A late model Detroit sedan (the one we saw earlier turning off the
          highway) pulls to a fast stop in the lot. Rob hurries out; a CHEER
          comes up from the group on the ferry. Kit closes her eyes in relief.
          Rob comes hurrying up the ramp.
                         
                         ANGLE ­ LANDING
          ...followed closely by HARVEY 'HAL' EDISON, JR.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Wait up!
                         
          Harvey is the driver of the sedan, and after he carefully locks up, he
          comes running with his bag, too. He is a rangy, straight-arrow Ivy
          League farmboy from the Border South, and he's the last of Muffy's
          invited guests. He also, somewhat incongruously, sports a Bruce
          Springsteen badge.
                         
                         ROB
          (to Kit, kissing her)
          Sorry... Nik, Chaz...
          (to Skip and Nan whom he doesn't know)
          Rob Ferris...
                         
          They return greetings.
                         
                         HARVEY
                         (RIGHT BEHIND )
          Hi! Harvey 'Hal' Edison, Jr., but please call me Hal. Only my folks
          call me Harve... and I can't stand it. Boy, this sure is a pretty
          spot.
                         
          Stylistically, he's a Martian. Chaz stares at him.
                         
                         CHAZ
          You're friends with... Muffy St. John?
                         
                         HARVEY
                         (PROUDLY)
          Sure am. We sit together in Econ 345. I let her copy my marginal
          utility curves.
                         
                         NIKKI
          I get it. That's a joke.
          Preppy Skip adds his greeting.
                         
                         SKIP
          (an ironical nod)
          Harve.
                         
                         HARVEY
          (correcting him, blithely)
          Hal...
          (noticing interest his badge)
          Springsteen, he's still the Boss!
                         
                         FERRYMAN
                         (IMPATIENTLY)
          Ok, c'mon, I don't have all day.
                         
          He slams the stile down after Harvey, the last to board, and gets busy
          with the stubborn motor. His assistant helps. Chaz tapes.
                         
                         HARVEY
          (enthusiastically, putting down his fear)
          YOU all buddies?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Except for Skip and Nan. Them we just met.

                         (MEANING SKIP)
          Watch what you say around him, though. He's Muffy's cousin.
                         
                         HARVEY

                         SKIP
          Distant. Over the horizon.
          Otherwise, I wouldn't be invited...
          (frowns, tellingly)
          Old money never mixes family with friends.
                         
                         NIKKI
          This is true. For as long as I've known her.

                         (UNSMILING)
          To keep her friends.
                         
          He turns to Arch, holds up his hand, and CLICK, a switchblade opens
          into the lens.
                         
          SKIP (cont.)
          Choose your weapons, big guy.
                         
                         ARCH
          (nervously, a laugh)
          Hey, what's this...?
                         
                         SKIP
          You up for a game of stretch?
                         
                         CHAZ
          (still taping, to Skip)

          Eat it.

                         (SHRUGS)
          Ok, so don't believe me.
                         
          He keeps the tape rolling. Rob discreetly looks down. His fly is
          open. Kit looks at him dubiously. Rob zips. Chaz beams, getting it all
          for posterity. The engine finally engages. The ferry lurches.
                         
                         ROB
          (smiles weakly to Kit)
          We're off!

          A CLOSER ANGLE. The sturdy, barge like ship craft makes progress. The
          Ferryman and Buck remain at the stern.

          As Skip's knife flies INTO FRAME, it bites into the boards and holds.
          SKIP AND ARCH
                         
          at their game. Arch stretches, can't reach the knife, and topples
          over.
                         
          Skip hoots triumphantly.
                         
                         SKIP

                         HARVEY
          Y'know what I find amazin'? Muffy's her real name. I mean,
          I'm Harvey, but they call me Hal, so I thought, 'Muffy', it must
          stand for something... Muffin?
                         
                         NIKKI

          Actually, she's three months older than I am.
                         
                         HARVEY
          You know what I mean.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Harvey... are you planning a career in politics when you grow up?
                         
                         HARVEY
          I've given it some thought. Why?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Oh, just a hunch.
                         
                         HARVEY
          First, though, I'm hopin' to interview with her daddy's
          company, Southern Regional Sales, next year before graduation...
          Y'know, he's worth more'n 50 mill over the counter!
                         
          She just stares at him.

          you're gonna have kids ­ and someday that kid's gonna come up
          to me and say, 'God, Dad, porn's really a major part of our
          lives. You were there, how'd it get started?' I wanna be
          able to answer their questions.

          Kit...
                         
          Arch's voice interrupts.
                         
                         ARCH'S VOICE
          (annoyed, loudly, overriding the other conversations)
          Hey, I'm really not interested anymore --
                         
                         SKIP
          C'mon, just one more
                         
          The others look up at the interruption.
                         
                         ANGLE
                         
          Arch pushes the knife back into Skip's hand, tired of playing knife-
          toss.
                         
                         ARCH
          I said, enough's enough--
                         
                         SKIP
          One more try, double or nothing.
                         
          He flips the knife to Arch, handle first.
                         
                         ARCH
                         (PISSED OFF)
          C'mon, give it a fuckin' rest!
                         
          He flips it back hard. Something happens. Skip looks up stunned.
          Arch's voice catches in his throat in horror.
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
                         
          Skip stares back, disbelieving, looking down and pulling his hand away
          from his chest, where the blood begins to seep and the jackknife
          sticks out, buried hilt-deep between his ribs.
                         
                         SKIP
                         (PALE)
          Oh, fuck.
                         
                         SKIP
          Nan screams. Skip stumbles, teetering there at the edge of the ferry.
          Rob and Chaz leap to their feet. The ferrymen both look up in
          disbelief. Arch steps forward to help. But Skip, weaving, topples and
          splashes overboard. He goes under.
                         
                         ARCH
          (panicked, hurrying to the side)
          I'll get him, I'll get him!
                         
          But he stops just at the edge of the ferry, immobilized by fear.
                         
          Rob rushes forward, with Chaz in reserve, pulling Arch out of ·the
          way. But Buck, the assistant ferryman, pre-empts them all, diving in.
                         
          Arch, frozen, watches from the deck with the others.
                         
          Buck resurfaces, but without any sign of Skip. Rob doesn't wait any
          longer. He pulls off his shoes and dives in. Chaz gets ready to follow
          suit. The panic mounts. Suddenly:
                         
                         SKIP'S VOICE
          Hi, this what you're looking for?
                         
                         THEY TURN;
                         
                         ANGLE CHANGE
                         
          Skip pulls himself up, dripping, on the other side of the ferry. He
          holds up the knife -- and the padded sash beneath his shirt he used to
          imbed the knife -- and grins from ear to ear. The others stare,
          totally freaked.
                         
          Arch lets go, jumping in the air. Rob and Buck surface, to see as
          well.
                         
                         ARCH
          We got 'em! Whoo-ee, did we nail 'em!
                         CHAZ
          (as it dawns, to Skip)
          April Fools... you crazy jerks. You crazy motherfuckin' jerks...
          somebody could've gotten hurt out there!
                         
          Relief descends. Rob isn't laughing. But nobody's more impressed than
          assistant Buck, still treading water.
                         
                         BUCK
                         (GRINNING)

          You maniacs... you almost gave us a heart attack!
                         
          Kit glowers at them and gives Rob a hand to get out.
                         
                         ARCH
                         (TO CHAZ)
          Well, at least we don't go in for this your-shoelace­is-untied crap!
                         
                         ROB
          (dripping, to Arch and Skip)
          I owe you one.
                         
                         SKIP
          (smiles, to Buck in the water)
          How's it goin' out there?
                         
                         BUCK
          That was great!
                         
                         SKIP
          I was really counting on these other turkeys to save
          my ass.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Oh, too bad.
                         
          Skip extends a hand to Buck to help him out.
                         
                         SKIP
          Sorry about that.
                         
          But Buck's in no hurry. The ferryman steps forward.
                         
                         FERRYMAN
          (unamused, to Buck)
          Ok, c'mon, get out.
                         
          They are approaching the landing dock on the island.
          FERRYMAN (CONT.)
          (to Buck, gruffly)
          C'mon I'm gonna need some help here.
                         
          Buck obeys, but his way, enjoying it, ducking under the craft to swim
          to the other side to help.
                         
                         FERRYMAN (CONT)
          And watch out for the wire!
                         
          Too late. There's a sickening THUMP I The young assistant suddenly
          breaks the surface qf the water, panicked and stunned, gasping for
          air.
                         
          It happens too fast for any of them to do anything. Buck thrashes,
          dazed, off-balance, falling back into the path of the ferry as it
          glides toward the landing.
                         
                         FERRYMAN
          Buck, look out--
                         
                         ROB
                         (IN DREAD)
          Oh, shit...
                         
          The ferryman grabs the controls, but it can't help.
                         
          The ferry, unstoppable, plows into Buck, pinning him against one of
          the piers. Buck screams.
                         
                         FERRYMAN
          Buck!
                         
          The ferryman rushes forward to help.
                         
          For a moment the others are spared the horror of it as the
          Ferryman's back blocks their view.
                         
          But then Buck, thrashing in the water, tears himself, loose, screaming
          and bobbing. up, his head and torso covered in blood, the side of his
          face and his shoulder hideously deformed.
                         
          It is awful. It is ghastly. And it is unforgettable.
                         
                         KIT
                         (IN HORROR)
          Oh, god!
          EXT. DOCK - ISLAND - DAY
                         
          SAM POTTER, the middle-aged township constable, hears the cries and
          the screams. He drops what he's doing in his outboard and comes
          running.
                         
          EXT. LANDING - ISLAND - DAY
                         
          The ferryman jumps into the shallow water, pulling Buck onto shore.
          Rob, Chaz and Arch jump after to help, but the ferryman pushes them
          angrily away.
                         
                         FERRYMAN
          Get away from him!
                         
          Buck is hysterical. The gashes of torn flesh seem to drip from his
          skull. Seeing Rob and the others, he screams, lunging vainly at· them
          in agony.
                         
                         BUCK
          They did it... them!
                         
                         FERRYMAN
                         (RESTRAINING HIM)
          Easy Buck... it's OK... OK... There's time for
          Later... easy...
                         
          But it's hard for him to restrain his own rage.
                         
          Constable Potter arrives, throwing the ferryman a towel to use. The
          ferryman catches it, pressing it against Buck's torn face. One
          maddened, glaring eye still stares out hideously at the group.
                         
                         CONSTABLE POTTER
                         (TO ·FERRYMAN)
          Get him to the hospital, Cal! Take my boat!
                         
          He helps the ferryman lift Buck. But the powerful ferryman needs no
          further help, carrying Buck to the Constable's motorboat moored
          nearby, laying Buck in, untying the line and pulling the motor to
          life. Buck continues to shriek, terrifyingly.
                         
          The ferryman cast one last glance back.
                         
          EXT. THE LANDING
                         
          The SOUND of the motorboat fades away. Potter turns back to the
          stunned group, eyeing them.
                         
                         CONSTABLE POTTER
          All right... Let's have it.
          INT. MUFFY'S PASSENGER VAN - DAY
                         
          Muffy drives up. She slows, seeing, through the windshield the somber
          scene at the pier... her friends in troubled conversation with
          Constable Potter.
                         
          EXT. LANDING - DAY
                         
          Muffy gets out, parking the new van beside an old island pick-up which
          is kept at the dock. She's clean, and dressed in her more usual preppy
          garb. She approaches.
                         
                         MUFFY
          What's going on? Sam... what's wrong?
                         
                         CONSTABLE POTTER
                         (IN DISGUST)
          Tricks. Pranks. Better ask your friends... Buck's been hurt. 'Cal just
          took him on over to the mainland. Just lucky I was here...
                         
          She returns his stare in dread silence. He boards the ferry.
                         
          CONSTABLE POTTER (CONT.)
          I came over to check on a report of some unauthorized
          activity in the area... Your dad around?
                         
          She startles, the question 50 unanticipated.
                         
                         MUFFY
          No, he's in Sutton Place. Why?
                         
                         CONSTABLE POTTER
          No word from him, or anybody else?
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (STILL PUZZLED)
          No...
                         
          He tries the engine. Nothing.
                         
                         CONSTABLE POTTER
          Just like I thought. . Burned out. Worthless...
                         
          He steps back onto the shore.
                         
          CONSTABLE POTTER (CONT.)
          I'll have to borrow your outboard to get back to shore.
                         
                         MUFFY
          We keep all the keys on the board in the kitchen, but I
          think there's an extra one underneath the cushion there.
          She points to the boat seat. Potter is much obliged.

          I'm glad you're stuck here, all o' you. If there's anvthin' else, or
          anything happens to Buck... I want to know where to find you.
                         
          The van moves slowly along a narrow road through the forest. From what
          we can see of its occupants, the mood is pretty grim. Behind it, the
          old island pick-up truck follows.
                         
          INT. PICK-UP
                         
          Rob drives with Kit and Skip beside him in the cab. Nobody says
          anything . Skip is off somewhere in his own private hell. Finally he
          reaches over to roll down his window, but the handle rotates uselessly
          in his grip.

          These goddamn windows!
                         
          He starts banging violently on the door, on the window.
                         
                         SKIP
          They've never been fixed...

          Look, Skip, it wasn't your fault. It was an accident. You didn't know.

          Sure.
                         
          He leaves off his banging. Pause.

          It is a truly grand affair, two stories at least, rambling and
          picture-perfect with extensive tended grounds, garage, and
          outbuildings. Muffy gets out first, hopping around to the back to open
          the rear van gate for the bags. Nan beholds the house for the first
          time.

          She quickly shuts off the water and just stands for a moment,
          dripping. trying to control her anger. Like, enough with Muffy's,
          jokes already.
                         
          She comes out of the bathroom with a towel, drying her face, and walks
          to the dresser. She strips off her shirt, pulls open the top dresser
          drawers and sees... an eyeless black rubber bondage hood and other

          crying. As it grows gradually louder we realize that it is crying -- a
          baby crying.
                         
          Nan appears suddenly in the bathroom doorway. A towel is wrapped
          around her. She listens.
                         
          The crying is louder now, but muffled -- a baby crying for its mother.
          It seems to come from a large mahogany wardrobe on the other side of
          the room.
                         
          Nan tenses, slowly approaohing, then flinging open the wardrobe door.
                         
                         CLOSE ANGLE
                         
          A small cassette recorder plays. The tape runs out. The baby's cries
          stop.
          Nan rips out the cassette, and sinks back onto the bed, burying her
          head in her hands.
                         
          INT. ROB and KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Rob and Kit are standing together staring INTO CAMERA. REVERSE to see
          the object of their attention. Hanging on the wall in front of them is
          a large oil portrait with the eyes out out. Something is moving behind
          the canvas ­watching them.
                         
          Rob steps forward and lifts the painting off the wall. Behind it is an
          inset bookcase. Sitting on one of the shelves, at the proper height to
          have lined up with the holes in the portrait, is a child's Felix-the-
          cat nursery clock. The eyes of the plastic cat move back and forth,
          like a pendulum marking seconds.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Rob sets the painting on the floor outside their bedroom door, leaning
          it up against the wall.
                         
          CAMERA DOLLIES IN for a CLOSE UP of the portrait. It looks much
          creepier with the now vacant eye sockets.
                         
          INT. ROB AND KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          They are undressing on opposite sides of the bed. The silence between
          them is thick enough to be cut with a knife. Kit sits down slowly on
          the edge of the bed and quietly slips under the covers. Rob gets in on
          his side.
                         
          They sit in silence for a moment, making no move to join each other in
          the middle of the bed.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob?
                         
          No answer.
                         
                         KIT
          You still angry with me? About dinner?
                         
                         ROB
          No. I'm sorry. I'm not angry with you. I'm just angry.
                         
          He leans over, turns off the bedside lamp... and the light in the
          bathroom comes on. Beat.
                         
          He gets out of bed and crosses to the bathroom, reaches in
          and turns off the light...
          ...and the overhead light comes on. Kit starts to laugh and quickly
          covers her mouth. Rob walks to the door, turns off the overhead
          light...
                         
          ...and the bedside lamp comes on again. Kit laughs harder, but still
          tries to stifle it.
                         
          Rob shoots her a look, then goes and sits on the edge of the bed. He
          reaches to turn off the bedside lamp again, then thinks better of it
          and starts to unscrew the bulb instead.
                         
                         ROB
          (burning his fingers)
          Ouch! Jesus!
                         
          Kit can't stop herself any longer. She laughs out loud. Rob
          perseveres, finally unscrewing the bulb enough to plunge the room into
          darkness.
                         
          Silence.
                         
                         ROB
          Very funny.
                         
          Kit breaks up laughing again. To her it is funny. And soon Rob is
          laughing too. He swings his legs up under the covers beside her.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Muffy turns off the last of the lights downstairs, leaving the porch
          light on for Skip.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
                         
          Muffy moves through the quiet to her room. Arch grabs her. She jumps.
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (COLLECTS HERSELF)
          Arch do you know what time it is?
                         
                         ARCH
          Um-hmm.
                         
                         MUFFY
          (turning down his collar)
          Goodnight, Arch.
                         
          Gently but firmly, she extricates herself, closing the bedroom door
          behind her.
                         ARCH
                         
          Undaunted, he scuttles down the hall to Rob and Kit's closed door to
          listen in. He frowns, the slides farther down to Nikki's room, knocks
          once softly, and enters.
                         
                         HIS POV
                         
          Nikki is already occupied, however, with Chaz. She catches Arch's
          stare, signalling him to get the hell out.
                         
                         REVERSE
                         
          Arch valorously steps back, closing the door and returning to try Nan.
                         
          The light underneath her door flicks off, however. The door is also
          locked.
                         
          Arch curses, returning to his large but empty room. He slams the door
          for everybody's benefit.
                         
          INT. MUFFY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Muffy, undressing, hears, and smiles.
                         
          INT. ARCH'S ROOM - NIGHT
          Arch is pacing the bedroom, horny and alone. He gets an idea, goes and
          rummages through Chaz' stuff and comes up with a video cassette of a
          porno movie.
                         
          Carrying -the cassette he crosses to the door and turns the handle.
          The doorknob comes off in his hand.
                         
          He throws it down in disgust, goes and sits in a chair and broods. The
          chair collapses beneath him.
                         
          EXT. BACK PATH - NIGHT
                         
          Skip makes his way boldly, carelessly, drunkenly along. Overgrown
          weeds and tall spring grass choke the path, shadowing his way. He
          takes one last drink, killing the bottle, and hurls it out into the
          night.
                         
          After a long pause there is the distant sound O.S. of the bottle
          landing in water with a splash.
                         
          EXT. OLD , BOATHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Skip emerges from the overgrowth. The abandoned old structure and its
          dock squat ahead at water's edge. Beneath the boathouse, floating in
          the water, is a grungy old skiff covered by a tarp.
          Skip turns away from the dock, and flicks his lighter among the weeds,
          finding marijuana growing there. He CACKLES with triumph.
                         
          Something MOVES nearby. He doesn't pay attention, taking out his knife
          to cull the dried leaves. He cups them in his hand against the wind,
          douses his lighter, and hurries out onto the dock to the boathouse
          entrance to prepare his joint.
                         
          INT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          as Skip enters. It is pitch black in here, and aside from the gentle
          lapping sounds of water against the pilings down below O.S., all is
          still.
                         
          Skip flips a lightswitch in the darkness and nothing happens. He edges
          slowly along a wall away from the door. Then he becomes aware of
          another living presence in the boathouse. It is a slow breathing
          sound--completely inhuman.
                         
                         SKIP
          Hello?
                         
          There is no answer, but the breathing continues. Then a sharp rapping
          sound very near, like a foot striking the wood flooring.
                         
                         SKIP
          Who's there?
                         
          Pause. No answer. We hear in the darkness the sound of his switchblade
          clicking open. And then he waits, straining his ears to hear.
                         
          Finally, Skip reaches into his pocket, puils out his lighter
          and flicks it on.
                         
          Something snags him from behind.
                         
          Skip gasps, helpless, as a thick rope controlled by powerful, shadowed
          hands tightens around his neck.
                         
          His knife, dried leaves and lighter cascade to the floor.
                         
          EXT. ST. JOHN HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER
                         
          Only the porch light remains glowing. The house is dark.
                         
          INT. ROB AND KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Rob wakes, hearing the CRY from Muff's room. Kit, naked against him,
          wakes too. They hear the muffled cry again. It is not from lovemaking.
          Rob throws off the covers.
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Rob wraps himself with a towel, stepping quickly out to Muffy's door.
          Everything else is dark and quiet.
                         
                         ROB
          (hushed, at door)
          Muffy?
                         
          No answer. He tries her door, but it's locked tight.
                         
          A beat. Then:
                         
                         
          ROB (cont.)
                         (CONCERNED)
          Muffy?
                         
                         
                         MUFFY'S VOICE
                         (UNCERTAINLY)
          Yes?
                         
                         ROB
          You OK?
                         
                         
                         MUFFY'S VOICE
                         (DISTANTLY)
          Yes... Thank you...
                         
          He pulls back from the door.
                         
                         ROB
          (reluctantly, puzzled)
          OK... well, goodnight...
                         
          No response. He turns back for his room, catching sight of Chaz, who
          has come out of Nikki's room, to investigate, too.
                         
          EXT. HOUSE - MORNING
                         
                         
          Harvey is out on the second floor balcony exercising vigorously. No
          one else is in evidence until a bedroom window flies open and Nikki,
          naked from the waist up and believing herself unwatched, leans out and
          stretches, breathing in the sweet morning air.
                         
          Then she sees Harvey grinning at her. She quickly covers herself and
          pulls back inside.
          INT. KITCHEN ­ DAY
                         
          Rob and Kit are the first ones down. They enter from the dining room,
          surprising Muffy at the stove.
                         
                         KIT
                         (BRISKLY)
          Good morning!
                         
          Muffy turns abruptly, startled. Rob and Kit stop abruptly, too.
                         
                         ANGLE
                         
          Muffy is barefooted, dressed in an old, worn chenille robe.
          Her hair, normally carefully groomed, is unkempt, wild and stringy
          about her pale face. Talk about unguarded moments. Her present
          appearance, is the last way one would ever expect to find Muffy St.
          John.
                         
                         RETURN ANGLE
                         
          She shrinks back from them with a frightened, apologetic smile.
          Scrambled eggs bubble in the skillet on the burner.
                         
                         MUFFY
          I... I was hungry...
                         
          She bumps against the stove, backing away. She self-consciously runs a
          hand through her hair.
                         
          MUFFY (cont.)
          I... I must look a mess...
                         
          She scuttles out the door to the utility room and the back stairs
          beyond, leaving the eggs to burn.
                         
          INT. BACK STAIRS ­ DAY
                         
          Arch encounters her, too, as he comes bounding down in his workout
          shorts.
                         
                         ARCH
          Morning!
          She backs away from him, scurrying up the stairs.
                         
                         MUFFY
          I... forgot to get dressed...
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          Arch enters, joining his wonderment to Rob and Kit's.
                         ARCH
          Who made her night?
                         
          EXT. BACK PORCH - DAY - LATER
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Arch, Chaz, Harvey and Nikki burst out the door in old clothes,
          sweats, shorts, whatever -- an unlikely foursome for some informal
          soccer scrimmaging.
                         
                         ARCH
          (always in search of more players)
          Where's Skip?
                         
                         CHAZ
          That depends on what he's on.
                         
          Rob and Kit cross their path, heading down to the water in their
          swimsuits and overshirts.
                         
                         NIKKI
          You gotta be kidding...
                         
                         ARCH
          (teasingly, an invitation)
          Nan? What about it?
                         
          Nan watches from the porch, book in hand.
                         
                         NAN
          Oh, no, thanks.
                         (FALSELY)
          Besides, I thought I'd wait and see what Muffy wanted to do...
                         
          Arch shrugs and the soccer free-for-all begins in earnest, with
          special attention given to the interplay between Harvey and Nikki.
                         
          Up on the porch, Nan finally sees Muffy emerging from the distant tool
          shed. Muffy is dressed plainly, oddly conventional, with a perceptible
          sense of disorder about her. She keeps to herself, turning toward the
          woods beyond, with cutting blade and mushroom basket in hand.
                         
          Nan puts down her book, hurrying off the porch. But by the timeshe
          looks up again, Muffy is gone...
          EXT. DOCK - DAY
                         
          Rob and Kit are standing together on the dock. He is dripping wet and
          covered with goose flesh. She has not been in yet. And while he is
          vigorously toweling off his arms and chest, trying to get the blood
          circulating again, she stands behind him with another towel and
          gently, lovingly dries his back. She finishes and he steps away from
          her and gazes out across the sound.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob? What's wrong?
                         
          Pause.
                         
                         ROB
          I swear it wasn't this cold yesterday .
                         
          This isn't what she meant, and he knows it.
                         
                         KIT
          Are you giving up?
                         
                         ROB
          (turning to her; gently)
          What about you? What about your future? You're the one with the four
          point.
                          (DEJECTED)
          ...maybe it's crazy--you investing so much energy in me.
                         
                         KIT
                         (QUIETLY)
          I don't know. I'm scared. I don't know if I want what Mom and
          everybody else expects of me. I don't want to go to law school.
                         
                         ROB
                         (PROTESTING)
          You've got a great mind
                         
                         KIT
          ...only it's not made up.
                         
          Smiling sadly, he crosses to her, puts his arms around her.
                         
                         ROB
          Great... Do you realize how perfectly unmatched we are?
                         
                         KIT
          It's made up about one thing though.
                         
                         ROB
          Yeah? What's that?
          She looks up and kisses him softly.
                         
                         ROB
          Will you feel the same about me a year from now? Two years, five years
          from now?
                         
          She takes his hand and leads him down the pier and into the boathouse.
                         
                         
          INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY
          As they come inside. Kit closes the door, and immediately they are in
          each other's arms.
                         
          The surging waves swirl beneath them, visible through the shrunken
          floorboards. Rob and Kit stretch out. All the passion, all the
          tenderness, all the intensity makes them oblivious to the fact that
          something is moving on the water below...
                         
          And when Kit finally opens her eyes to it, Skip's face bulges
          gruesomely up at her through the slatted floor!
                         
          Kit screams and scrambles to her feet--Rob completely uncomprehending
          until he sees it too: Skip's body, pale and bloodied, draped within
          the grungy skiff passing beneath them on the waves.
                         
          EXT. DOCK - DAY
                         
          By the time he pulls on his swimsuit and comes rushing out
          with Kit, however, Rob's shock has turned to rage.
                         
                         ROB
          Skip! You sonofabitch!
                         
          But there's no response, Skip's body unmoving on the self-powered
          skiff which continues bobbing out to sea.
                         
                         ROB
                         
          starts to wonder whether it really is a joke. He hurries forward,
          plunging 'into the water to reach the boat.
                         
                         ROB
          Skip... Skip!
                         
          But it's too far and getting farther, and the waves are too strong.
                         
          EXT. ST. JOHN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Rob and Kit come struggling up the path. Chaz trains his videopak on
          them from the porch . He, Arch, Harvey and Nikki unwind with beer and
          sandwiches after their sweaty workout.
                         CHAZ
          (commentary while he tapes)
          Respectable young Quaker couple returning after quiet afternoon of
          nonviolent sex.
                         
                         ARCH
                         (CALLING )
          Well, how was it?
                         
                         ROB
          Where's Skip? Anybody seen him?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Who wants to know?
                         
                         ROB
          Goddammit, can't you give me a straight answer!
                         
          They sit up with the force. Nan comes out on the porch, hearing .
                         
                         KIT
                         (FRANTICALLY)
          We saw him... on a boat... drifting by the pier. He wasn't movinq. He
          looked dead... unless he was joking...!
                         
                         CHAZ
          Well, if it was Skip...
                         
                         KIT
          I saw his face!
                         
                         ROB
                         (DEMANDINGLY)
          Has anybody seen him since last night?
                         
          They all realize they haven't.
                         
          ROB (cont .)
          Jesus Christ...
                         
          Rob turns, rushing into the house.
                         
          INT. ENTRY HALL - DAY
                         
          Rob stops as he notices, near the foot of the stairs where he'd parked
          it upon first entering the house yesterday afternoon, Skip's overnight
          bag.
                         
          He turns and bounds up the stairs.
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
                         
          Rob runs down to Skip's door and flings it open. A cheap rubber
          hobgoblin drops suddenly in front of him, suspended from the ceiling
          on frail, metal springs.
                         
          Rob jumps back with a startled cry, then angrily tears the thing out
          of his way and throws it down.
                         
          This is the last of Muffy's little April Fool's gags, and as with the
          overnight bag, it signifies that Skip has been nowhere near this room.
                         
          But Rob steps inside and looks around just to make sure.
                         
          The room is untouched, the bed unslept in.
                         
          EXT . PORCH - DAY
                         
          Rob hurries out, as Muffy finally appears, emerging from the wooded
          grounds, basketful of mushrooms in hand. She approaches.
                         
                         MUFFY
          (noticing their distress )
          Something wrong?
                         
          Rob rushes by her.
                         
                         ARCH
          Wait! I'll go with you!
                         
                         CHAZ
          Me too!
                         
          EXT. DOCK - DAY
                         
          As Rob, Arch and Chaz come running down to the water. They stop and
          look around, seeing nothing.
                         
          No answer.
                         
                         ARCH
          (aloud: for Skip)
          Hey, asshole!
                         
                         CHAZ
          Wait a minute! Look at this!
                         
          He has found on the little pebbled beach beside the dock, Skip's
          switchblade. It is in pieces. There's blood on the broken blade.
                         
                         CHAZ
          This was Skip's.
                         ARCH
          What do you think? That guy on the ferry?
                         
                         ROB
          I don't know. I don't know what to think.
                         
                         ARCH
          I say we go looking for him, him or Skip. One of them's bound to still
          be around... somewhere.
                         
                         CHAZ
          You mean split up?
                         
                         ROB
          Let's not take any chances. He was... He was pretty big.
                         
                         ARCH
          No sucker's taken me yet.
                         
          He rips a loose board off the dock for a club.
                         
          EXT. UTILITY ROOM - HOUSE ­ DAY
                         
          In the gathering twilight, Muffy puts the basket of mushrooms away on
          a shelf. Someone grabs her wrist. She gasps. It's Nan. Nan steps from
          the shadows.
                         
                         NAN
          I know why you're avoiding me...
                         (DISTRAUGHT)
          I guess it's your idea of a joke... that's why you invited me. How'd
          you find out? From one of his preppy 'friends'? Who else have you
          told?... Who else knows, except the father!
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (ASTONISHED)
          I... don't know what you're talking about.
                         
                         NAN
          Oh? The tape just got there? You know very well... my abortion!
                         
          She comes apart, in tears. Muffy stares, uncomprehending.
                         
          NAN (cont.)
          I thought you wanted to be friends... you think you can play with
          people's feelings just because you're rich and can do what you want.
          Well, you can't...!
                         
          She rushes out the rear door. Muffy tries to recover, confused.
                         
          She continues on to the back entrance to the kitchen.
          INT. KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          Swinging open the door, she almost runs into Harvey.
                         
                         HARVEY
                         (SHEEPISHLY)
          Sorry... I was just checkin' to make sure everybody was all right.
                         
          He beats a hasty retreat the other way, passing Nikki on her way in
          Nikki raises an eyebrow at Muffy, misinterpreting the tension in the
          air.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Harvey? No kidding'?
                         
          Maybe that explains your clothes.
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (NERVOUSLY)
          What d'you, mean?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Oh, c'mon.
                         
          Muffy exits hurriedly, upset.
                         
          EXT. WOODS - DAY
                         
          The path is narrow and tortuous . Arch uses his club to clear the way,
          trying to follow its twists and turns. He also tries to make vocal
          contact.
                         
                         ARCH
          Hey, shithead! chickendick!... yeah, you! Skip!
                         
          He moves deeper and deeper into the forest.
                         
                         LOW ANGLE
                         
          Up ahead on the pathway a thick, black viper slithers out of the
          undergrowth, stops, sensing Arch's presence, and coils itself against
          his approach.
                         
                         WIDER
                         
          as Arch stalks forward, not looking at the ground.
                         
                         LOW ANGLE
                         ARCH
                         (THUNDERING )
          Skip!
                         
          Arch steps right over the snake and continues on.
                         
                         WIDER
                         
          as Arch hears a noise. He stops. SOMEONE ELSE is here with him, very
          nearby.
                         
                         ARCH
          Skip?
                         
          He turns and moves back along the trail, peering into the dense
          foliage on either side.
                         
                         LOW ANGLE
                         
          as he steps over the snake again going back the other way.
                         
                         WIDER
                         
          He stops again, looks all around him, then turns once more and starts
          to move very slowly with short little steps back in the other
          direction.
                         
                         ARCH
          Skip?
                         
                         LOW ANGLE
                         
          He is edging closer and closer to the snake. He is bound to step on it
          this time.
                         
          The snake coils itself to strike.
                         
          Arch's foot comes down just missing it, less than six inches away,
          when suddenly the ground seems to move. A noose springs up, tightens
          around his ankle, and Arch is lifted into the air upside down,
          swinging wildly, dropping his club.
                         
          Now the viper strikes, and Arch sees it. He is shrieking with horror
          as he tries to bat the creature away from him. But he keeps swinging
          into it, and the snake keeps striking at him, trying to find an
          opening.
                         
          Suddenly a long, gleaming blade ENTERS FRAME and chops the snake in
          two.
                         
          Arch looks up, his face white and frozen into a mask of sheer terror,
          no longer able even to scream
          EXT. BACK YARD - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          Kit, Nikki and Harvey are waiting on the back porch when Rob emerges
          from the woods nearby.
                         
                         KIT
          (calling to him)
          No Skip?
                         
          Chaz now comes out of the woods on the other side of the yard.
                         
                         CHAZ
          No luck.
                         
                         ROB
                         (TO CHAZ)
          Where's Arch?
                         
                         CHAZ
          He isn't with you?
                         
                         NIKKI
          I don't like this... I definitely don't think I like this...
                         
                         KIT
          I think it's about time we called the police.
                         
          The screen door BANGS again. They look up. It's Muffy. She returns
          their stares stiffly, without expression . She holds flowers cut with
          hand shears.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Eight-two-four-eight. Constable Potter has an office at his home.
                         
                         KIT
                         (TO ROB)
          I don't think we should wait any longer...
                         
          Rob moves into the house past Muffy. Kit follows him.
                         
          MUFFY (to be played like Muffy)
          Who wants some tea?
                         (BEAT)
          It'll calm our nerves...
                         
          She exits toward the kitchen . Nikki. perplexed by her behavior, looks
          strangely after her.
                         
          EXT . GROUNDS OF HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
          Nan sits alone on a stone bench beside a small Buddha statue in a
          secluded corner of the garden behind the house. She has been weeping.
          Her face tells the story.
                         
          Now a gentle wind springs up rustling the leaves of the thick bushes
          surrounding her. She looks up.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM ­ SUNSET
                         
          Rob is on the phone trying to reach the Constable. He hangs up the
          receiver, then lifts it and starts to· dial again. Kit, standing
          beside him. now wanders silently off into the dining room .
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - SUNSET
                         
          As Kit enters, Muffy comes in from the pantry, breathless and
          apologetic, her hands full of tea boxes.
                         
                         MUFFY
          I didn't know what kind anybody would like so I just... got them
          all...
                         
                         KIT
          Let me help.
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (CAREFULLY)
          Has he reached the Constable?
                         
                         KIT
          Rob? No, we haven 't been able to get through to the mainland yet.
                         
          Muffy eases. Kit turns the tap to fill the kettle. The pipes begin to
          BANG. The tap sputters and coughs out a spurt of brown water before
          running dry.
                         
                         L1UFFY
          Oh... ·the main... it's probably broken.
                         
                         KIT
                         (STUNNED)
          No water?
                         
          Nikki and Harvey enter, having heard the pipes banging.
                         
                         NIKKI
          What's happening.
                         
                         KIT
          No water.
                         NIKKI
          What!
                         
                         MUFFY
          It happens sometime... But there's still the well all the island homes
          have some kind of pump... or well... for emergencies.
                         
          Nikki reaches for a large flashlight beam.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Jesus. I'll go. Just point me in the right direction.
                         
                         HARVEY
                         (GALLANTLY)
          Not without me.
                         
          Harvey accompanies Nikki out the back door, leaving Kit and Muffy
          alone again.
                         
                         MUFFY
          (bearing up under Kit's stare)
          I'm not worried. I'm sure those two... Skip and Art... they're just up
          to some kind of stupid trick . . .
                         
          Kit moves out of the kitchen uneasily.
                         
          EXT. WELL - DUSK
          Nikki milkes ghost sound8, following Harvey out through the dark. It
          makes him nervous.
                         
                         HARVEY
                         (UNCOMFORTABLY)
          I don't think you should really do that.
                         
                         NIKKI
                          (SEEING)
          Is that it?
                         
          The well is the old-fashioned kind.
                         
          NIKKI (cont.)
          Boy, when she said `well,' she really meant 'well'. who dug this
          thing? Pocahontas?
                         
          She reaches for the wooden bucket attached by metal nook to the thick
          rope. Harvey pre-empts.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Here, let me do it. I've probably had more experience than you.
                         
                         NIKKI
          You mean, back home on the farm?
                         HARVEY
          I know you think I'm a hick, but I'd like to change your mind about
          that, if you'd only give me the chance.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Why?
                         
                         HARVEY
          Because, I'd really like to plow your field.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (SMILES" IMPRESSED)
          Draw me some water.
                         
          He's glad to oblige, opening the hinged wood well cover and lowering
          the bucket slowly. The dark hole seems to go on forever. Suddenly,
          there's a muffled CLATTER deep within the well.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Aw, crap...
                         
                         NIKKI
          What happened?
                         
                         HARVEY
          I lost the bucket.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Harve.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Hal. The rope was rotten, any fool coulda seen that.
                         
                         NIKKI
          You didn't.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Here, shine your light down so I can get a fix on it.
                         
          She rises on her toes, flashing the powerful beam down the dank hole.
          Harvey bends over to look. A rotted piece of the well cover breaks off
          in his hand. He lurches forward.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Oh... oh, Jesus!
                         
          He slams back in ashen horror.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (STARTLED}
          ...what...
                         HARVEY
          Stay back! Don't look!
                         
                         NIKKI
          I'm a big girl now. I think I ·can handle a few spiders and
                         FROGS ---
                         
          She shines the beam down again, bending in for a look.
                         
                         HARVEY
                         NIKKI --
                         
          She should've listened to him.
                         
                         HER POV
                         
          Nan's body lies twisted and jammed among the slime. Her dress is torn,
          revealing a white breast with veins of blood streaming across it and
          into the water. Next to her, Arch's severed head gapes up in a rictus
          grin, joined in its leer by Skip's decapitated head.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         
          It's like the very guts have been torn out of her. She screams,
          stumbling back.
                         
          EXT. WELL ­ DUSK
                         
          as Rob runs up, everyone else is already there.
                         
                         ROB
                         (BREATHLESS)
          What is it?
                         
                         KIT
                         (ASHEN)
          You don't want to know.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (STILL PANICKED)
          In the well ! Oh, God, the well!
                         
          Rob grabs the flashlight from Chaz's hands and leaps up to take a
          look.
                         
          After a long, horrifying glimpse he has to step back to control his
          overwhelming nausea. He shudders violently.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (COLD FEAR)
          We have to leave, all of us, we have to get away.
                         ROB
          (closing the well cover)
          We can't get away. Everyone back into the house . Now.
                         (JUMPING DOWN)
          Let's go!
                         
          EXT. BACK OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Looking in through the windows we can see Rob alone in the living room
          still trying the phone.
                         
          PANNING ACROSS to the dining room windows, we see Nikki seated at the
          table with Kit and Chaz on either side of her. Harvey stands behind
          them against the wall.
                         
          EXT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Kit is trying to comfort Nikki who is still in shock.
                         
                         KIT
          It's okay, Nikki. With the others... they were outdoors. But we're
          inside now, and we're safe.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (QUIETLY)
          It's all because of what happened on the ferry, isn't it?
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (HIMSELF UNNERVED)
          It was an accident. Don't they know that?
                         
          Muffy enters from the kitchen with a glass of water. Harvey pulls her
          quietly aside.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Muffy, where do you keep your guns?
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (BLANKLY)
          Guns? We don't keep guns in this house.
                         
          The others turn and look back at them. There is an uncomfortable
          pause.
                         
                         MUFFY
          (handing Nikki the glass)
          Here.
                         
          NIKKI ,
          Oh, God! Not the water!
                         MUFFY
          It's all right. It's Perrier.
                         
          Suddenly the phone rings O. S. They all look toward the living room.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOH - NIGHT
                         
          ...as Rob snatches up the receiver.
                         
                         ROB
                         (DESPERATELY)
          Hello!
                         
          He listens for a moment, then almost collapses with relief.
                         
          ROB (cont.)
          Constable Potter... Thank God it's you...
                         
          The others stand and start drifting in from the dining room.
                         
          INT. MAINLAND HOSPITAL - NIGHT
                         
          Constable Potter is calling from a pay phone near the reception desk.
          He listens for a moment, then ...
                         
                         POTTER
          What are you talking about?
                         (LISTENS)
          That ain't possible .
                         (LISTENS)
          And I'm telling you, I'm here at the hospital now visiting Buck. He
          came out of surgery last night--It might interest you to know he'll be
          all right-- and Cal's been here too, the whole time.
                         
          ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the ferryman Cal standing anxiously beside him.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM ­ NIGHT
                         
          Rob looks like he's just been clubbed on the back of the head.
                         
                         ROB
                         (PLEADING )
          Constable?...
                         (LISTENS)
          Here. She's all right.
                         (LISTENS)
          With Muffy? What do you mean?
                         
          He looks up at the others who have gathered around him expectantly.
                         ROB
                         (FINALLY)
          Yes, all right... Please... Please hurry.
                         
          He hangs up. Pause.
                         
                         ROB
          (anything, but jubilant)
          He's on his way. We're supposed to wait here... to stay together...
                         
                         CHAZ
          What about the ferryman?
                         
                         ROB
          It isn't him. They've been together all day.
                         
                         CHAZ
          What?
                         
                         KIT
          I don't understand.
                         
          They look at each other ominously.
                         
                         ROB
                         (STANDING)
          I don't either.
                         (BEAT)
          He's going to send up a flare as he's nearing the dock. Then
          we're to go down as a group to meet him there.
                         (MOVING AWAY)
          In the meantime... we just wait.
                         
          He goes out of the living room.
                         
          INT. FRONT ENTRY - NIGHT
                         
          Rob bolts and double-locks the front door. He also fastens the chain
          just for good measure.
                         
          INT. LIVING & DINING ROOMS - NIGHT
                         
          Chaz and Nikki secure all the doors and windows to the outside.
                         
          INT. STUDY - NIGHT
                         
          Kit enters, checks and locks the windows. She turns on the lamp. On
          the desk -- prominently displayed and catching her eye -- a FRAMED
          PHOTOGRAPH.
          CLOSE - THE PHOTOGRAPH
                         
          It is a black-and-white picture, probably Muffy as a child. But
          what's confusing is there's another little girl next to her in the
          picture, who looks just like Muffy, too...
                         
                         KIT
                         
          ...doesn't understand. She glances at the walls for more pictures.
                         
          Muffy enters suddenly, interrupting her. Kit startles, turning. They
          face each other.
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (UNNATURALLY COMPOSED)
          It's my father's study.
                         
                         KIT
                         (NERVOUSLY)
          I just came in to make sure everything was secure
          to lock the windows.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Good idea. Sometimes... with the tides... it can take someone all
          night to get here from the mainland... and even then, sometimes they
          don't make it...
                         
          INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Harvey is unlocking his suitcase which is back up on the bed. He
          reaches in and pulls out a small revolver. He drops the cylinder,
          checking to see that it's loaded, then snaps it back in place. He
          tucks the weapon into the waistband at the small of his back, then
          slips on his navy blazer.
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - .NIGHT
                         
          No one is around and no one has been down here since earlier in the
          day when Muffy apparently brought down the painting with the vacant
          eye-holes from outsid~ Rob and Kit's bedroom.
                         
          CAMERA PANS off the painting, now hung on a blank wall, to the
          transcan window which is still propped open to the outside.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOH ­ NIGHT
                         
          Chaz, Nikki, Kit and Harvey are here, trying to wait it out.
                         
                         HARVEY
          (peering out the window)
          What's taking him so long?
                         KIT
          (quietly; without conviction)
          It could be the tides.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Wait a minute. Aren't we supposed to be staying together? Where're
          Muffy and Rob?
                         
                         KIT
          Rob's checking the back of the house.
                         
                         CHAZ
          And Muffy?
                         
                         NIKKI
          She's been acting less than normal anyway.
                         
                         KIT
          (picking up on it)
          What do you mean?
                         
                         NIKKI
          You mean all day and you haven't noticed?
                         
                         HARVEY
          Well, who isn't?
                         
                         NIKKI
          ...and those nurse's shoes.
                         
                         CHAZ
          What nurse's shoes?
                         
                         NIKKI
          The clodhoppers she's been wearing today... crepe soles...
                         
          It's as though some common nerve of suspicion has been touched. They
          all stir.
                         
                         HARVEY
          She was arguing with Nan in the hall, before you and Rob... before you
          came back alone.
                         
          They turn full attention on him.
                         
                         HARVEY
          About something Nan found in her room.
                         
                         CHAZ
          What?
                         HARVEY
                         (EMBARRASSED)
          Something about an abortion.
                         
          They all pause.
                         
                         NIKKI
          I found somethin"g in my room, too
                         
          She reaches into her bag and pulls out the black rubber bondage hood.
                         
                         NIKKI
          ...only I don't think it was intended for me .

                         HARVEY
          (to Chaz; defending Nikki)
          And What did you find?
                         
                         CHAZ
          I didn't find anything.
                         
                         HARVEY
          We're supposed to believe that?
                         
                         CHAZ
          That's right.
                         (TRUMPING HIM)
          I spent the night with Nikki.
                         (BEAT)
          What about you?
                         
                         HARVEY
          What about me?
                         
                         CHAZ
          What's your little secret?
                         
                         HARVEY
                         (EVASIVELY)
          I don't know What you're talking about.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Oh, come on, sport. I walked in on you last night , and you were
          acting like your ass was on fire...
                         
                         HARVEY
          It wasn't anything... Just some clippings... of some car accidents.
                         CHAZ
                         (INSINUATING)
          Nothing personal in that, I suppose?
                         
                         HARVEY
          No! Who hasn't been in a car accident? It's a common thing.
                         
                         CHAZ
          I haven't.
                         
          There is a slight pause. Rob comes into the living room, holding a
          flashlight and stands just inside the doorway.
                         
          The others shift uncomfortably.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (QUIETLY)
          What I'd like to know is, how did Muffy find out about these
          things and why -- ?
                         
                         KIT
          Stop it! Just stop it all of you!
                         (BEAT)
          What is wrong with us? Nhat happened to all our talk about friendship,
          and undying loyalty?
          (looking from one to the other)
          Do you know what we're saying? That we're actually sitting here
          discussing the possibility that Muffy, a generous friend, has invited
          us all here to --
                         
          She stops suddenly, freezing in mid-sentence, and they all turn,
          following the direction of her look, to see Muffy standing in the
          entryway behind Rob.
                         
                         MUFFY
          I'm going upstairs.
                         
                         ROB
          Muffy? We should all stay together.
                         
                         MUFFY
          This is my house.

          I'll be in my room.
                         
          She turns and heads up the stairs.
                         
          Pause.
                         NIKKI

          She's got a point.
                         (STANDING)
          We're starting to get on each other's nerves.
                         
                         HARVEY
          As long as we all stay within shouting distance of each other...
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (TO CHAZ)
          You coming?
                         
          He joins her, and they quietly head for the stairs.
                         
                         ROB
          I'm goinq to find the way up to the attic.
                         
                         KIT
          Why?
                         
                         ROB
          I'm sure we can watch for the Constable better from up there.
                         
          Kit hesitates.
                         
                         HARVEY
          It's all right. I can keep watch on the stairs.
                         
          Rob ho1ds out his hand to her. She takes it and they walk together
          toward the stairs.
                         
          INT. MUFFY' S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Muffy enters, closes the door quietly and locks it behind her. She
          crosses to her bed, slowly sits down and loses herself in troubled
          thought about everything that is going on.
                         
          INT. MAIN STAIRWAY ­ NIGHT
                         
          Harvey steps up to the halfway landing and sits down. He looks above,
          looks below, then opens a magazine and begins thumbing through it.
                         
          INT. NIKKI'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Nikki's suitcase is open on the bed, and she is moving nervously about
          the room, gathering her things and cramming them into it.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Nikki, come on...
                         NIKKI
          What do you mean, Nikki, come on? Don't give me any of this Nikki,
          come on.
                         
                         CHAZ
          What are you doing?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Look, stay if you like. Lock your door. Dig a trench. Hang out. But
          once I leave this place, I'm never coming back.
                         
          She walks out the door, and Chaz follows her to...
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - SAME
                         
          They cross the hall.
                         
                         CHAZ
          (catching up to her)
          We're all supposed to stay together here.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Yeah, that's been real effective...
                         
          She goes into...
                         
          INT. BATHROOM - SAME
                         
          ...and starts to collect all her stuff from in here. Chaz comes in
          behind her.
                         
                         CHAZ
          So what are you going to do? Just waltz on down to the pier. By
          yourself. Check your bag with the porter. Then wait for an ocean liner
          to happen by and pick you up. Is that it?
                         
          NIKKI,
          (pushing past him)
          I can't stay here any longer.
                         
          She goes back out into the hallway. Chaz follows.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - SAME
                         
          as they cross back to Nikki's bedroom.
                         
                         CHAZ
          What if the Constable never even comes?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Then I'll swim all the way back to the mainland... I can be strong if
          I have to.
          INT. NIKKI'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          as they re-enter.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Look, just relax--
                         
                         NIKKI
          Three people are dead and you're telling me to relax?
                         CHAZ
          Nikki, now just hold on a minute, and look at me. Look at me.
                         
          She stops and looks at him.
                         
          CHAZ (CONT.)
          Now, am I nervous? Yes. Maybe even a little bit scared? Yes.
          Am I running around like a chicken with its head cut off?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Nice image.
                         
                         CHAZ
          No.
                         (BEAT)
          I mean, come on, babe. Lighten up a little, huh?
                         
          He quickly slips the S&M mask over his head, clowning around.
                         
          CHAZ (CONT.)
                         (MUFFLED)
          Look at this. What, me worry?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Very funny, Chaz.
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (MUFFLED)
          You've got to look on the bright side of things. Everything'll be all
          right... Huh? Huh?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Don't be a jerk.
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (MUFFLED)
          Oh. Now I'm turning you on. Right?
                         
          NIKKI,
          Take that thing off.
                         CHAZ
                         (MUFFLED)
          Why? I kind of like it in here.
          (moving blindly toward her)
          Kiss me, you savage she-devil.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Get out of here.
                         
          She pushes him and he falls backward across the bed.
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (MUFFLED)
          Ooooh, stop it some more. I love it when you're rough.
                         
          She turns and goes out of the room again. Chaz remains lying across
          the bed.
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (MUFFLED)
          Course it would help a little if I could breathe in here. For when
          things start to get really passionate.
                         (BEAT)
          Nikki?
                         
          CAMERA FRAMES the open bedroom window for a beat. The curtains luff
          slightly in response to a gentle breeze wafting in.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Nikki comes down the hall with some more clothes on her arm. She
          arrives at her door, opens it (she had not closed it the last time she
          went out), and goes inside.
                         
          INT. NIKKI'S ROOM - SAME
          Chaz is still lying across the bed as last seen, except that now his
          hands cover his crotch.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (NOTICING)
          Real subtle, Chaz.
                         
          She continues packing, moving around the room.
                         
          NIKKI (CONT.)
          Now I'm supposed to throw off my clothes and jump on you? Just wind
          her up and watch her go? You've got a lot to learn, buddy.
                         
          No response. Chaz lies perfectly still. Not even his chest appears to
          be moving.
                         NIKKI
          (looking at his crotch again)
          What is this? Show and tell?
                         (BEAT)
          I'll show you mine if you show me yours?
                         (BEAT)
          Well, forget it... You may as well just stick it back in your pants.
                         (BEAT)
          Chaz?... Chaz?
                         (NO ANSWER)
          Say something, goddammit!
                         
          She swats his hands away from his crotch. Beneath them, on his pants,
          is a slowly growing blood stain.
                         
          Nikki gasps, her mouth contorting into a scream that will not come.
          She turns suddenly in response to .a NOISE O.S., and sees a DARK
          FIGURE stepping out from behind the slowly closing bedroom door.
                         
          INT . ATTIC STAIRS - NIGHT
                         
          It is almost pitch black. O.S. there is the sound of a lightswitch
          being flicked on and off.
                         
          ROB (O.S.)
          No lights.
                         
          Suddenly a flashlight beam pierces the darkness, and Rob and Kit can
          now be seen ascending the stairs to the attic.
                         
          INT. ATTIC - NIGHT
                         
          ...as they arrive at the top. Rob sweeps the one large room with her
          flashlight. Piles of old furniture are stacked here and there, covered
          with grimy sheets.
                         
                         KIT
          No one's been up here in years.
                         
          Rob crosses to the garret windows overlooking the sound.
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                         KIT
          Can you see him?
                         
                         ROB
          NO. There must not be a light on the boat.
                         
                         KIT
          Or... he's chosen not to use it.
                         ROB
          Kit? He said something else on the phone, about Muffy.
                         
                         KIT
          What?
                         
                         ROB
          He said not to trust anybody. That's why we were to stay together. No
          one was to be left alone with anyone else... Then he said, especially
          not with Muffy.
                         
                         KIT
          So that's why you let her go upstairs?
                         
                         ROB
          That's why I let her go.
                         
                         KIT
                         (BEAT)
          What did he mean by that?
                         
                         ROB
          I don't know. He wouldn't explain it.
                         
                         KIT
          But that's ridiculous...
                         
                         ROB
          Is it? He's known her longer than we have.
                         
          He sweeps the flashlight back toward the stairs.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob, wait a minute. What's that?
                         
                         ROB
          Where?
                         
          She takes the flashlight from him and aims it on something near the
          door--the Barbie and Ken dolls from the previous night's dinner.
                         
                         ROB
          It's just the dolls.
                         
                         KIT
          She's been up here.
                         
                         ROB
          So?
          She moves toward them while Rob stays by the windows looking out. As
          she gets closer to the dolls, however, Kit realizes that they have not
          just been stuck there haphazardly.
                         
                         KIT
                         (ALARMED)
          Rob?
                         
          Rob comes over to join her as we CUT TO:
                         
                         HER POV
                         
          of the dolls as the flashlight moves across them, slowly revealing
          them one by one. The last to be seen are a Barbie and the heads of two
          Kens stuck in a bowl of water.
                         
          ROB AND KlT
                         
          staring at them, frightened and astonished.
                         
                         ROB
          Jesus...
                         
                         KIT
                         (LOSING IT)
          Rob? . . .
                         
                         ROB
          It's Arch and Skip and Nan.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob??...
                         
                         ROB
          Wait...
                         
          He takes the flashlight from her and reveals two more: a Barbie and a
          Ken lying next to each other with no clothes on, both of them
          splattered with bright red nail polish.
                         
                         ROB
          What are these other two?
                         
          Suddenly the room is flooded with light. Rob turns sharply and sees
          outside the window the Constable's flare hanging in the night sky.
                         
                         ROB
          He's here!
                         
          O.S. there is a PISTOL SHOT from downstairs. Kit screams.
                         ROB
          Come on!
                         
          He jumps to his feet, grabs hold of her hand and pulls her with him
          out of the attic.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
                         
          as they come racing down from the attic. Rob heads for the
          main staircase...
                         
                         ROB
          Hal!
                         
          ...while Kit runs down the hall to Nikki's room and flings
          open the door.

          Nikki?
                         
          She isn't there.
                         
          Kit backs into the hallway. Downstairs O.S. she can hear Rob moving
          about, calling for Harvey, but up here all is quiet and threatening.
                         
          She hurries silently down to Chaz' room, opens the door and steps
          inside.
                         
          INT. CHAZ' ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          It is dark again in here, but the video camera is still operating. Kit
          closes the door behind her and leans forward, barely whispering...
                         
                         KIT
          Chaz?... Nikki?...
                         
          She turns on the light and sees the bed, both beds: they are drenched
          in blood.
                         
          Kit reaches for the doorknob. It comes off in her hand.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob!!!
                         
          She's frantically pounding on the door and trying to jam the doorknob
          back in, to get it to work.
                         
          There's a NOISE outside the window. She turns aghast. Suddenly the
          door flies open.
                         ROB
                         (ENTERING)
          I can't find Hal--
                         
          He stops in mid-sentence as he sees the beds. Kit is already through
          the door. Rob follows her out.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL . - NIGHT
                         
          Rob is running with her toward the stairs.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob, what about Muffy?
                         
                         ROB
          Forget her!
                         
                         KIT
                         (STOPPING HIM)
          She's my friend!
                         
          She breaks away from him and dashes down to Muffy's door. Rob has no
          choice but to follow her.
                         
                         KIT
                         (KNOCKING)
          Muffy! Muffy!!
                         
          She tries the door, but it's locked.
                         
                         ROB
          (pulling her away)
          Let's go.
                         
          Rounding the corner to the shadowy back stairs, Rob suddenly bumps
          into something, someone there. He screams aloud, dropping his
          flashlight.
                         
          It is Harvey. His body dangles from the rafters high above the top of
          the rear stairs, a thick rope around his neck.
                         
          Now Rob has become unnerved, and it is Kit's turn to take the lead.
                         
                         KIT
          This way!
                         
          And they head back toward the main staircase.
          EXT DOCK. -- NIGHT
                         
          The flarelight wanes. Constable Potter looks up anxiously. Soon he
          will be waiting in darkness . (Unlike the previous night's scene, now
          there are no outdoor lights on here.)
                         
          EXT. BACK OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Rob and Kit burst out of the dining room as if the house were on fire.
          Kit stops to pull the doors shut behind them.
                         
                         ROB
          (yanking her away)
          Forget the doors!
                         
          Within moments they have crossed the back yard and disappeared into
          the brush leading down to the water.
                         
          EXT. PATHWAYS - NIGHT
                         
          The night is a landscape of terror. As Rob and Kit race through the
          darkness, the forest seems to fold in on top of them, completely
          enclosing them within itself.
                         
          EXT. DOCK - NIGHT
                         
          They arrive at the water's edge and slow down abruptly. Though they
          can see Potter's boat rocking gently in the water, moored to the dock,
          they cannot make out any sign of the Constable.
                         
                         ROB
          (in guarded approach)
          Constable... Mr. Potter?
                         
          No answer. The silence is chilling. They proceed out onto the dock.
          They come to the boat.
                         
                         ROB
                         (WHISPERING)
          If there's another flare, we can signal him.
                         
                         KIT
          Maybe he went on to the house.
                         
          Rob unlashes the mooring, grabbing hold of the line to pull the boat
          in. It won't budge, the line snagged in the water where it dips in.
          Rob tugs harder, freeing something to the surface.
                         
                         CLOSE ANGLE
                         
          It is Constable Potter, his body turning once before sinking again
          under its tethered weights.
          An animal cries out behind them. Rob wastes no more time, pulling the
          rope and the boat quickly toward them. They jump in.
                         
          There is a flashlight in the toolbox. Rob grabs it, shining it onto
          the controls. But there's no key in the ignition, and no other way to
          start it.
                         
                         ROB
          Shit... no key!
                         
          Kit, meanwhile, picks up the LETTER that's lying on the bottom of the
          boat.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob!
                         
          He turns.
                         
          KIT (cont.)
          Look!
                         
          She presses it into his hands. He shines the flashlight.
                         
                         CLOSER ANGLE
                         
          Its waterstained, but still legible... The letterhead reads, 'STATE
          HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE,' and it is dated 'MARCH 31,'
          addressed to Potter, and reads:
                         
                         RETURN ANGLE
                         
                         ROB
          "...Pursuant to our previous communication, please be advised that the
          patient under discussion has still not been found and returned to
          custody, and it now believed to be attempting to return to her home in
          your jurisdiction. If encountered, exercise extreme caution and notify
          us immediately, as Miss St. John has ·been a patient here for three
          years and is still considered incorrigibly unstable and extremely
          dangerous..."
                         
          Kit looks up, frantic.
                         
                         KIT
          Miss .St. John? What's it talking about? Muffy hasn't been in any
          state mental institution for the last three years -- she's been at
          Vassar!
                         
                         ROB
          I don't know... but we've gotta get this boat started.
                         KIT
          How?
                         
                         ROB
          The house. Didn't Muffy say there was another key back in the kitchen?
                         
                         KIT
                         (IN DREAD)
          Oh, no...
                         
                         ROB
          We've got no choice.
                         
                         KIT
          I know.
                         
                         ROB
          Shit.
                         
                         PAUSE

          Rob?
                         
                         ROB
          Huh?
                         
                         KIT
          Rob, I really don't want to go back there.
                         
                         ROB
          I know.
                         
                         KIT
          Shit.
                         
          Another pause. Neither one is making the move to go.
                         
                         ROB
          I'd have you stay here, but--
                         
                         KIT
          No.
                         
                         ROB
                         (BEAT)
          Listen, Kit, we'll get out of here, I promise you. We've been through
          so much together...
                         
          She has started to cry softly.
          ROB (cont.)
          ...it isn't going to end here.
                         
                         KIT
                         (BEING BRAVE)
          Okay.
                         
          He kisses her. Pause.
                         
                         ROB
          Well...
                         
                         KIT
          Yeah...
                         
                         ROB
          Let's go.
                         
                         KIT
          Let's go.
                         
                         ROB
          Let's go.
                         
          Brief pause, then he turns to go.
                         
                         ROB
          Shit...
                         
          They move slowly off the dock.
                         
          EXT. GROUNDS OF HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Rob and Kit move up to the shrubbery skirting the back lawn and gaze
          across at the house. It is completely dark within and remains wrapped
          in silence as before.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob, look! The doors. They've been closed.
                         
          Sure enough, the doors they come out by minutes ago, the ones they
          didn't stop to close, are now shut tight.
                         
                         ROB
          Come on.
                         
          They move stealthily through the bushes around to the side of the
          house. They stop.
                         
                         ROB
          There.
          He is pointing toward the open basement window across a thirty foot
          space of clear lawn.
                         
                         ROB
          That's how we're going in.
                         
          Kit swallows hard.
                         
          She nods.
                         
                         ROB
          Are you with me?
                         
          They break from their cover and run, keeping low, to the side of the
          house. Rob peers through the window into the darkness inside , pushes
          the transom all the way open, and then drags himself through on his
          belly.
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
                         
          He drops to the floor, turning to give Kit a hand. She enters the
          same, dusting herself off next to him. Rob turns on the flashlight,
          using it cautiously.
                         
                         ROB
          (moving through darkness)
          The stairs... Where are the stairs?...
                         
                         KIT
          What's that?
                         
          They pause, hearing
                         
          DRIPPING SOUNDS in the darkness , comi ng from the depths of the
          utility room.
                         
          Rob leads the way, cautiously, toward the sound.
                         
          INT . UTILITY ROOM
                         
          The flashlight cuts through the dark, revealing the tap DRIPPING in
          the tub.
                         
          Before, the tub was clean. NOW, however, stubborn crimson STAINS smear
          the basin, like blood that has refused to be washed away. Other stains
          darken the floor.
                         
                         REVERSE ANGLE
                         
          Kit's eyes widen in growing horrow. Rob turns the beam toward the
          stains that track across the floor, following them.
                         KIT
                         (FEARFULLY)

          INT. BASEMENT
                         
          The trail leads out of the utility room to the large, cast-iron
          incinerator. Rob steps forward, slowly opening its door, angling the
          beam inside.
                         
          THEIR POV - INCINERATOR
                         
          Inside, Muffy's characteristic attire -- the clothes we saw her
          wearing yesterday after their arrival -- lie stuffed inside, bloodied
          and charred.

                         (PUZZLED)
          I don't get it.
                         
          The beam momentarily sweeps the wall next to Kit. She sees something.
                         
                         KIT
          (an urgent whisper)
          Rob!
                         
          She gets him to turn the beam back to the wall where she is. She helps
          train it on what she saw.
                         
          POV - THE WALL
                         
          It is a growth ·chart that has been marked in ink faded over the
          years. There are growth measurements for 'MUFFY'... and for ·a child
          named 'BUFFY"... with similar heights on similar dates.
                         
          RETURN ON KIT
                         
          She gasps, finally connecting it.
                         
                         KIT
          Oh, god... oh no!...
                         
          He doesn't yet understand.
                         
                         KIT
          ...the picture of the girls in the study... the letter... what the
          Constable was trying to tell you... It's not Muffy it's her twin
          sister, Buffy! She has a twin sister!
          Rob's eyes have a glazed look. They are fixed somewhere else.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob, don't you see?

          Rob?
                         
          She follows his look and sees, on the wall near the growth chart, that
          he has trained his flashlight beam on the eyeless portrait from the
          night before. Only now, there are REAL EYES BEHIND THE PAINTING,
          STARING OUT AT THEM.
                         
                         KIT
                         (HUSHED)
          Rob!
                         
          He casts about for a weapon, coming up with a length of lead pipe.
                         
                         ROB
          Pull it away...
                         
                         KIT
          (too frightened to move)
          Rob?
                         
                         ROB
          Pull it away!
                         
          They advance together on the painting, Rob keeping his flashlight on
          the eyes the entire time. Kit slowly reaces out, lifts the painting
          from the wall and drops it, jumping back... just as MUFFY'S HEAD rolls
          forward from a shelf behind the painting, right into Kit's lap!
                         
          Kit screams as she bobbles the head in her hands like a hot potato,
          trying to get rid of it.
                         
          Suddenly a loud NOISE slams at the basement window. Rob grabs Kit,
          covering her mouth and snapping off .the flashlight. The head falls to
          the. floor at their feet. They turn...
                         
                         THEIR POV
                         
          ...just in time to see the window they entered being nailed shut from
          the outside. All else they can make out are Buffy's hands and her
          tell-tale nurse shoes. Then these two move of sight around the outside
          of the house.
                         
                         BASEMENT
                         
          Rob clicks on the beam in the direction they went and sees the stairs.
          They race to them, up them, the door to the pantry is not locked. It
          gives way under Rob's pressure.
                         
          INT. PANTRY ­ NIGHT
                         
          Kit scrambles up behind him. They can hear Buffy outside in the yard
          APPROACHING the kitchen door.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Rob and Kit hurry in. Rob searches frantically for the key board.
                         
                         ROB
          The boat key... it's gotta be here...
                         
          His flashlight sweeps the walls of shelves. Suddenly, Buffy is at the
          kitchen door. Though the door in locked, there's no bolt or chain to
          fully secure it. The knob RATTLES furiously under Buffy's grip, the
          door SHUDDERS.
                         
          Rob spots a walk-in cupboard. He hurries to it. Kit gropes along the
          shelves, searching the objects hanging along the distant wall.
                         
                         KITCHEN DOOR
                         
          A long, ugly-looking knife blade slips in through the crack in the
          door. Buffy is using it to try to pry open the door.
                         
                         CUPBOARD
                         
          Rob opens the door. Success. His beam falls on the key board on the
          inner wall.
                         
                         ROB
          Kit... I
                         
          He steps in, following his beam into the darkness. The cupboard door
          SLAMS shut behind him. He turns, trapped.
                         
          CLOSE ANGLE - KITCHEN DOOR

          Kit spins, crying out as she sees:
                         
                         HER POV
                         
          The shadowed figure of BUFFY, barefooted, disheveled, in a smock,
          dagger in hand. She advances, breathing heavily.
                         KIT
                         
          stumbles back desperately.
                         
                         KIT
          No...
                         
          INT. CUPBOARD
          Rob is desperately trying to break out, but the door won't open.
                         
                         ROB
          Kit! Let me out! Let me out of here! Kit!!
                         
          He is kicking the door, hurling himself at the door, but all to no
          effect. He barely has room to maneuver.
                         
          KIT (O.S.)
          Rob!!!
                         
          INT. KITCHEN
          Kit turns to Rob's voice, takes a step toward the cupboard, but
          suddenly Buffy is there, cutting her off.
                         
          Kit backes away, into the dining room.

          INT. DINING ROOM
                         
          Kit reels back under Buffy's steady advance. Kit can't see her clearly
          in the dim light, but she can make out, beneath Buffy's wild, stringy,
          dangling hair, the madness, the likeness of Muffy -- the familiar face
          somehow twisted by hate and madness into a stiff, hideous, unnatural
          deformation.
                         
          Buffy closes in, readying the long, greedy knife.
                         
          INT. CUPBOARD
                         
          Rob, still struggling, knows Kit is about to die.
                         
                         ROB
          Kit! I love you!
                         
          INT . DINING R.OOM
                         
          Cornered, helpless, Kit stumbles back toward the closed double doors
          that lead to the living room.
                         KIT
          Buffy?... please, we didn't mean any harm... we're leaving... we just
          want to go home... please... please...
                         
          Buffy raises the dagger in hand.
                         
          INT. CUPBOARD
                         
          No longer trying to escape. It's hopeless.
                         
                         ROB
          (for all he's worth)
          Kit! I love you! I love you, Kit!
                         
          A man's HAND reaches out from the side, lightly touching Rob's
          shoulder. Rob jumps, turning.
                         
                         ANGLE
                         
          It is Buck, standing practically right beside him, staring at Rob. His
          face is the same bloody, hideous mess it was the day before, after the
          accident.
                         
          Rob screams.
                         
                         BUCK
          I love you too, babe.
                         
          Rob swings at him, but only succeeds in smashing his knuckles against
          the door.
                         
          Buck grabs him and violently plants a kiss on his cheek.
                         
          INT. DINING ROOM
                         
          Kit slams back against the double doors, nowhere to go.
                         
                         KIT
          No... Oh, God...
                         
          and Buffy strikes. The knife jabs into the door, close to Kit's head.
          Kit gasps, momentarily spared. She pushes apart the double doors and
          stumbles back into...
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM
                         
          All the lights are on, and when Kit takes her eyes off Buffy long
          enough to find out why, she discovers everyone is here -- Skip, Chaz,
          Nikki, Arch, Harvey, Nan, even the Constable and the ferryman. They
          sit or casually stand, quietly talking or reading magazines, taking no
          notice of her whatsoever.
          INT. CUPBOARD
                         
          Rob is screaming uncontrollably. Buck calmly peels all the blood and
          gore right off his face and slaps in onto Rob. Rob keeps screaming.
          Then Buck reaches out and unlatches the door. It was right there the
          whole time.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM
                         
          Kit is totally bewildered...
                         
                         KIT
                         (LOOKING AROUND)
          What.... ?
                         
          Then she looks back at Buffy who steps into the living room, and
          smiling, holds up the knife and plunges it into her own hand. The
          blade is retractable.
                         
                         KIT
          (wrought with emotion)
          Oh, fuck you!! Fuck you, you guys!!
                         
          Suddenly everyone in the room comes to life, roaring with laughter.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN
                         
          Rob stumbles out of the cupboard, Buck's gory make-up still stuck to
          his face.
                         
                         ROB
          Kit! !
                         
          Still frightened and confused, Rob hasn't put it together yet. He runs
          out of the kitchen...
                         
          INT LIVING ROOM
                         
          ...through the dining room and into the living room where he stops
          dead cold upon seeing everybody.
                         
                         
                         ROB
          Ki--!
                         
          The group laughs louder at the sight of him. Buck walks up behind Rob
          and claps him on the shoulder. Rob jumps and screams involuntarily.
          The group laughs louder still...
          INT. LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Muffy is wiping off the last of her "Buffy" make-up.
                         
                         MUFFY
          You guys are really terrific. I love you all. And I thank you from
          the bottom of my heart for being such good sports.
                         
                         ROB
                         (STILL SHAKEN)
          Oh, sure. Quite welcome. Any time.
                         
          He sits, or rather lands, on the sofa next to Kit.
                         
          Laughter.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Rob, you and Kit, you two were the best. You figured it all
          out. The clues really worked.
                         
                         ROB
          What clues?
                         
                         KIT
          What's this all about? And don't anyone say "April Fool's" or I'll
          smack them in the teeth.
                         
                         MUFFY
          How about if I told you it was the script for a weekend special
          that's going to help me keep this house...
                         
          Rob and Kit stare, mystified.
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (SMILING)
          Look, next month I get the house as part of my inheritance, it's true,
          but only if I can show my father that it can carry itself... what with
          taxes and expenses. Otherwise, he'll just sell it out of the family.
          So, I'm planning on turning it into a country inn. Not just another
          stuffy old run-of-the-mill country inn, but one that specializes in
          offering once-in-a lifetime Whodunit Weekends. I needed a rehearsal. I
          had to try out the idea on somebody.
                         
                         ROB
                         (TO OTHERS)
          And you guys played along?
                         
                         ARCH
          Don't look at me!
                         
                         NIKKI
          We all got sucked in just as bad as you!
                         MUFFY
          Once they were killed off, yes. Everybody had to cooperate. Otherwise,
          none of it would have worked!
                         
                         ROB
          So I guess there's no crazy twin sister Buffy?
                         
                         MUFFY
          Oh, there's a crazy twin all right, but his name isn't Buffy.
                         
                         NIKKI
          His name?
                         
          Muffy smiles, directing attention toward "cousin" Skip.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Skip?!
                         
                         KIT
          He's your brother?!
                         
                         ARCH
          You bastard, you were in on the whole deal, too.
                         
                         SKIP
                         (PROTESTING)
          Only the set-up. Muffy told me to say I was her cousin and to pull
          that prank on the ferry. I had no idea what was going to happen with
          Buck.
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (INTRODUCING)
          Buck Williams. make-up artist par excellence, from Hollywood.
                         
          Buck reaches down and tosses Arch's decapitated head to him.
                         
                         BUCK
          Here, catch.
                         
          Arch bobbles the head nervously. The others laugh.
                         
                         BUCK
          Just some old props I redressed with the help of photographs Muffy
          sent me.
                         
                         NIKKI
          It sure fooled me.
                         
                         ARCH
                         (TO SKIP)
          So what castle are you going to inherit?
                         CONSTABLE POTTER
                         (CRITICALLY)
          Well, first he's got to prove he can manage his own allowance.
                         
                         KIT
          (to the Constable)
          Which means, I guess, that you're no constable either.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Kit Graham, meet my Uncle Frank St. John of St. John et Freres, Wall
          Street.
                         
          Uncle Frank smiles and waves at Kit, but Harvey steps right over to
          him and starts pumping his hand.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Hi! Harvey "Hal" Edison, Jr. Pleased to meet you, sir.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Usually we don't even see Uncle Frank in the summer, he's so busy.
          But this time he made an exception.
                         UNCLE FRANK
          I haven't had this much fun since my Hasty pudding Show sophomore year
          at Harvard. God, lowe you kids!
                         
                         FERRYMAN CAL
                         (EAGERLY)
          How'd I do? I never did no acting before. Boy, was I shaking!
                         
                         MUFFY
          Cal's our regular ferryman between the mainland and the islands around
          here... but I thought he was up to the dramatic challenge.
                         (BEAT: SMILING)
          Well, that's it. Now you know it all.
                         
                         NIKKI
          We have been had.
                         
                         ROB
          You're lucky you didn't get yourself killed.
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (LAUGHING)
          I almost did with Harvey. And who could know there would be a snake
          out in the woods with Arch? But with the paying guests, they'll know
          what they're in for: and the scenario won't be nearly so extreme.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          Otherwise, even Lloyd's of London won't cover you.
                         MUFFY
          ...And I regret that, well, some of those fake clues I planted in the
          bedrooms I guess were taken too seriously. I'm sorry about
          that.
                         
          She avoids looking at Nan so as not to draw attention to her.
                         
          MUFFY (cont.)
          But we had fun, didn't we? I mean, come on.
                         
          She starts passing .out chilled champagne bottles to the men
          to open, and setting up glasses on a sideboard.
                         
          MUFFY (cont.)
          I know I'll never forget this weekend for as long as I live.
                         
                         ARCH
          You're telling me. Man, when I was swinging around out there in the
          woods, I nearly crapped my pants.
                         
                         CAL
          What do you mean, nearly? I was there, remember?
                         
          Silence. Arch turns red.
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (QUIETLY)
          Arch? You browned your trousers?
                         
                         ARCH
                         (BEAT; STAMMERING)
          Well... I...
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
                         (GOOD-NATUREDLY)
          It's all right, Arch. They'll be out of the dryer soon.
                         
          Suddenly everyone roars with laughter. Champagne corks start popping,
          and before you know it, the scene is resembling the locker room of the
          winning team of a championship series.
                         
          INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING
                         
          Breakfast. Spirits are high. Friendships rekindled, and the spread is
          incredible. Muffy enters with a fresh basket of piping hot biscuits.
          Only Nikki, Harvey, and Cal are not present.
                         
                         ARCH
          Great ham.
                         
                         BUCK
          Great eggs.
                         CHAZ
                         (TEASING)
          Just what we need. Another country inn.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          Well, if the food's any indication, it's already half-way there.
                         
                         SKIP
          Pass the toxic wastes, please.
                         
          Uncle Frank frowns at Skip as Cal enters.
                         
                         CAL
                         (PLEASANTLY)
          The St. John Island Bar Harbor ferry leaves in thirty minutes. No
          stragglers, please.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
                         
          Rob and Kit are the first ones in, busing their dishes.
                         
                         ROB
          Boy, what a difference being alive makes.
                         
                         KIT
                         (TURNS; SOFTLY)
          I don't care what Columbia says about you.
                         
                         ROB
          I do.
                         
                         KIT
                         (BEAT)
          Is this the road to med school?
                         
                         ROB
          I think it is. I'm going to try.
                         
          He takes her by the hand and gazes at her.
                         
                         ROB
          But if I make it or not, no matter what happens, we'll be together?
          You and me?
                         
                         KIT
                         (QUIETLY)
          If that's what you want.
                         
                         ROB
                         (HUGGING HER)
          That's what I want.
          Muffy enters with a stack of dishes, followed by Nan who quietly sets
          her plate on the counter and leaves.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Where's Nikki?
                         
                         KIT
          I don't know. Too much champagne?
                         
          o.s. they hear a muffled cry.
                         
          INT. NIKKI'S ROOM - MORNING
                         
          ...as Harvey finishes plowing her field. They lie still for a moment.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (STILL GASPING)
          God... don't tell me that was something you learned on the farm!
                         
          EXT. BACK PORCH - MORNING
                         
          Uncle Frank is hugging Muffy. (nothing seedy). They are alone out
          here.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          I'll make a full and glowing report to your father tomorrow so he can
          draw up the deed along with the other trust papers for Wednesday's
          signing. I'm so proud of you.
                         (BEAT)
          I wish I could say the same about your brother.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Oh, Uncle Frank, he's been a great help this weekend, really. Let me
          get him out here so you can--
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          I've already spoken with him.
                         
          The screen door opens, and Rob steps out onto the porch. He comes over
          to them, but does not butt into their conversation, and Uncle Frank
          just keeps going as if Rob weren't even there.
                         
          UNCLE FRANK (cont.)
          His conduct and his academic performance remain inexcusable. He knows
          your father can't be expected to entrust him with anything until he
          shows some signs of responsibility and initiative.
                         
                         ROB
          (embarrassed to be overhearing)
          Excuse me.
          He turns and walks back into the house.
                         
          O.S. a horn honking.
                         
          EXT. HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          The van and the old pickup are idling out front. Uncle Frank is
          honking on the van horn.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          Come on! Let's go!
                         
          Cal is alone behind the wheel of the pickup.
                         
          Skip walks casually up to the van, then pointedly turns away and heads
          over to the pickup instead. Uncle Frank scowls.
                         
          ANGLE - FRONT DOOR
                         
          Rob and Kit come out the door and stop beside Muffy.
                         
          More honking.
                         
                         KIT
          Well, I hate to say it -- I still ought to kill you -- but thanks.
                         (THEY HUG)
          See you back there.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          Come on. If time is money, we're losing a fortune.
                         
          Nikki now runs out followed closely by Harvey. They say their quick
          farewells and move along to the waiting vehicles.
                         
          Harvey discreetly opts to ride in the pickup, while Nikki climbs
          aboard the van, passing Chaz who just glares at her. He knows. Finally
          Nan comes out of the house. With a curt nod to Muffy, she heads on
          toward the van when...
                         
                         MUFFY
          Nan!
                         
          She hurries to catch up with her.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Let me say again how sorry I am. It wasn't intended.
                         NAN
          And now all is forgiven. I played along, didn't I? What's done is
          done.
                         (BEAT)
          I've learned a lot, Muffy, I really have. I suppose I should say thank
          you, but I don't think I would be able to without it sounding false.
          So I'll just say goodbye.
          (beat; an afterthought)
          Thanks for showing me your house.
                         
          She turns and crosses to the van and climbs aboard. The others callout
          their last goodbyes. Muffy waves, and then they are gone and Muffy
          turns and walks forlornly back into her house.
                         
          EXT. FERRY LANDING - MORNING
                         
          Cal and Uncle Frank are the first ones onto the ferry.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          Cal, I want to thank you personally. You've been a real sport about
          this.
                         
                         CAL
          Aw, it was fun.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          I know you've had your eye on that p1ace ever since we were kids.
          And I'm sure we could make a deal with you. I know you haven't been
          spending your money on anything else all these years... But... this
          time it just isn't in the cards.

          It's still in the family.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          Yes, that's the way.
                         
          He moves on. Others are passing them now. Chaz stops and wags his
          finger at Cal.
                         
                         CHAZ
          This time, no funny business.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
                         
          Muffy stand, overlooking the mess. Not knowing exactly where to
          begin, she starts emptying ashtrays into each other, then just stops.
                         
          She walks out of the living room and through the entry hall and slowly
          climbs the stairs.
          EXT. SOUND ­ DAY
                         
          From far away the ferry can be seen chugging away, slowly returning to
          the mainland.
                         
          EXT. FERRY - DAY
                         
          closer now we can see what's happening on board... Rob and Skip lean
          against the rail and talk quietly. Kit and Arch and Buck sit together
          and chat... Chaz sits alone, and Nikki sits apart from him, also
          alone.
                         
          Nan is up front, gazing out over the bow, while Harvey stands beside
          her trying to make conversation. Finally, he gives up and strolls to
          the back of the craft, pointedly passing Nikki.
                         
          He alights next to Uncle Frank, who has his briefcase open on his lap.
                         
          Now Nikki stands and goes and sits down next to Chaz.

          budding filmmaker who was going to turn pornography into high art.

          much idea as where he's going as... as...

                         NIKKI
          I'll tell you what I've learned from all this. I'm tired of having one
          fling after another. I don't want any more of that. I want a
          boyfriend.

          Chaz? Will you be my boyfriend?
                         
          He looks at her, slowly softening. Yes, he will.
                         
          Rob turns away from Skip now, steps over and surveys the quiet group.

          hurt because of Skip's prank, and when things started happening and we
          thought maybe some of us were getting killed, how we all just kind of
          naturally accepted the fact that it was 'oh , yeah, sure, because of
          the prank.'

          Nikki steps. Leeks up, hearing herself. Skip returns the stare.

          Arch goes to his car and drives away.
                         
          At some distance, Harvey is ·chasing down Uncle Frank as the latter
          closes in on his Mercedes sedan.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Well, can I look you up in a couple of months? Maybe you could arrange
          a job interview for me.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          Sure, sure .
          (reaches into his pocket)
          Here's my card.
                         
                         HARVEY
                         (TAKING IT)
          Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot. I sure appreciate it, and it's been a
          real pleasure meeting you.
                         
          But Uncle Frank is already in the car and starting it up. Harvey looks
          down at the card.
                         
          CLOSE UP - UNCLE FRANK'S BUSINESS CARD
                         
          It reads simply: Franklin St. John, St. John et Freres.
                         
          BACK TO SCENE
                         
                         HARVEY
          Hey, wait a minute! There's no phone number here! No address! No
          nothing!
          Too late. Uncle Frank is driving away. He speeds past Skip who is
          walking down the road further along. He doesn't even stop for his own
          nephew.
                         
          Harvey kicks the dirt angrily. O.S. behind him a horn toots. Harvey
          turns and scowls at Nan, who would like to get past. He steps aside,
          and she peels away but she stops for Skip.
                         
          They exchange a few words. Then he climbs into the front seat beside
          her, and she drives off.
                         
          Now Harvey is alone. He looks around for a beat, then tosses the card
          away and moves toward his car.
                         
          EXT. SHORELINE - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          Rob and Chaz are trudging along.
                         
                         CHAZ
          What the fuck was he talking about anyway? We might find something
          around after we dock?
                         
          They walk out onto a private peer and eye the boats moored there.
                         
                         ROB
          What the fuck do you think he was talking about?
                         
                         CHAZ
          Oh.
                         
          VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey! What are you two doing down there?!
                         
          Rob and Chaz look o.s. in response to the voice.

                         CHAZ
          Well, now we've been identified.
                         
                         ROB
          Swell.
                         
                         CHAZ
          It's getting late.
                         
                         ROB
          What a great idea this was.
                         
          They round a bend and stop dead.
                         THEIR POV
                         
          In the distance, Kit and Nikki are climbing into a boat. Nikki sees
          them and waves.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (CALLING}
          We got one!
                         
          Rob and Chaz.
                         
                         ROB
          I thought we looked there an hour ago.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Who cares? Let's get this show on the road!
                         
          He starts running to the boat. Rob reluctantly follows.
                         
                         CHAZ
          (calling back to them)
          Did you find a key? How're we going to get the motor started?
                         
          EXT. BACK OF THE HOUSE - SUNSET
                         
          The house stands quiet, the dying rays of sunlight reflected off the
          large bay windows overlooking the sound.
                         
          EXT. THE SOUND - DUSK
                         
          as, huddled together in a rowboat, Chaz, Nikki, Rob and Kit arduously
          make their way back to the island.
                         
          INT . FRONT ENTRY - NIGHT
                         
          Looking at the front door. Someone is visible through the translucent
          glass pane coming up to the door.
                         
          A knocking sound.
                         
          INT. VARIOUS SHOTS AROUND THE HOUSE - SAME

          INT. FRONT ENTRY
                         
          Muffy finally emerges from the study, crosses to the door and opens
          it. Nikki walks in.
                         NIKKI
                         (AWKWARDLY)
          Muffy, hi! Surprise!
                         
                         MUFFY
          Nikki, what on earth are you doing here? Is something wrong?
                         
                         NIKKI
          No, no, nothing's wrong. Chaz and I just figured there was nothing we
          had to get back to that couldn't wait and you could probably use a
          hand with the clean-up. It's our way of saying thank you.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Oh, great. Where is Chaz?
                         
          Nikki is already moving into the living room.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Putting the boat up in the old boathouse. He'll be up in a minute.

          EXT. FRONT OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT

          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Muffy and Nikki are seated across from each other.
                         
                         NIKKI
          I wonder what's keeping Chaz? He should have been up here by now.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Maybe he stopped to shit in the woods. You know Chaz.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Still... I'm beginning to not like this.
                         
                         MUFFY
          By the way, where did you get the boat to come back here?
                         
                         NIKKI
          The boat? Oh, Cal gave us one.
                         
                         MUFFY
          I see.
                         
          PAUSE.
                         NIKKI
          Listen, I need a drink of water.
                         (RISING)
          You just stay here. I can get it myself.
                         
          She walks out of the living room. Muffy looks after her and smiles to
          herself.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          as Nikki enters. She doesn't turn on any lights, but simply crosses to
          one of the kitchen windows and opens it.
                         
          She gazes out into the night for a moment, then backs out of
          the kitchen...
                         
          INT. DINING ROM - NIGHT
                         
          ...pulling the swinging door closed behind her. She turns, takes two
          steps toward the living room and stops; remembering her water.
                         
          She goes back to the kitchen door, but suddenly it will not open for
          her. Frustrated, she heads back through the dining room, but stops
          dead halfway across and turns slowly and looks back at the kitchen
          door. She goes out of the dining room...
                         
          INT . DOWNSTAIRS HALL - SAME

          and will not yield.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          as Nikki returns.
                         
                         MUFFY
          What about your water?
                         
                         NIKKL
          Oh', uh, I drank 'it in there.
                         (BEAT)
          Listen. Muffy , I'm really getting worried about Chaz. I think we
          should go out and see what's happened.
                         
                         MUFFY
          That's okay. You go. I'll wait here.
                         
                         NIKKI
          No, really. I don't want to go alone. I'm still scared from last
          night. Please come with me.
                         MUFFY
          I'm sure Chaz is fine. I'll stay here by the phone just in case. It's
          safer this way.
                         (BEAT)
          Do you want a flashlight?
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (IRRITATED)
          No, that's okay. I'll be fine.
                         
          She strides out of the living room.
                         
          EXT. HOUSE - SAME
          as Nikki comes out the front door and heads off into the woods.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (MUTTERING)
          Shit.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Muffy sits quietly a moment, thinking. Then she gets up and goes
          toward the kitchen.
                         
          INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL -
                         
          She comes to the kitchen door, pushes it open... no sweat... and enters.
                         
          INT . KITCHEN - SAME
                         
          Muffy doesn't turn any lights on either. She goes to the sink, sees
          that there is no used water glass, then' she notices the open window.
          She smiles.
                         
          She does get herself a bottle of Perrier out of the fridge, opens it,
          pours it and walks back out of the kitchen, leaving the window
          untouched.
                         
          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
                         
          Nikki stumbles through the darkness. Suddenly she disappears from view
          with a loud SPLASH.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Fuck!
                         
          She comes up sputtering to the surface of a small forest pool she has
          fallen into.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Fuck!! Who dug the goddamn swimming pool?!?
          She drags herself out.
                         
          KIT (o.s.)
          Nikki?
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (CALLING BACK)
          Yeah!
                         
          She walks, dripping wet, into a clearing nearby where Kit it making
          Chaz up to look bloody and gruesome.
                         
          NIKKI .
          We have to go to plan B.
                         
                         CHAZ
          She wouldn't come out? Doesn't she care about me?
                         
          No one answers him.
                         
          CHAZ (cont.)
          How do I look?

          No one is here as' Rob pops his head up outside and slips in through
          the open window.
                         
          He stops in the middle of the kitchen and listens. Then he
          goes into...
                         
          INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL - SAME
                         
          He creeps down the hall, then turns and starts to tiptoe up the
          back stairs.

          ...he's hurt! Oh, Godl!
                         
          She stops suddenly. Muffy isn't here. Frustrated, Nikki runs
          back into...
                         
          INT. FRONT ENTRY - SAME
                         
          She looks around.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Muffy!!
                         
          She dashes into...
                         
          INT. STUDY - SAME
                         
                         NIKKI
          Muff--!!!
                         
          ...and stops short. Muffy is lying face down in a pool of blood. Her
          throat's been cut. The useless phone receiver is clutched in her hand
          (making that constant phone company noise that lets you know the phone
          is off the hook).
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (RISING PANIC)
          Muffy?
                         
          Her throat gags a couple of times, as if she is about to be sick. She
          turns and flies out of the room.
          O.S. the front door slams shut behind her.
                         
          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
                         
          NIKKI (O.S,)
                         (HYSTERICAL)
          Chaz!! Chaz!!
                         
          She runs into another clearing (the CAMERA has been here waiting for
          her) where Chaz is revealed lying on the ground, looking much more
          hideous than Muffy.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Chaz, get up! ·Hurry, Chaz!... come on!
                         
          He doesn't move.
                         NIKKI
          Chaz, stop playing around! Get up!!
                         
          She starts kicking him in the side.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Chaz!
                         
          Chaz doesn't stir, but he does speak now without moving his lips.
                         
                         CHAZ
          (hissing, pretending to be dead)
          Will you quit kicking me? It hurts.
                         
                         NIKKI
          It's supposed to hurt! The game's over! Get up!
                         
                         CHAZ
          (still not moving)
          No. I'm dead. You're blowing the whole thing. Where's Muffy?
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (SHRIEKING)
          Muffy IS dead!!! In the house!!!
                         (WHIMPERING)
          Oh, God...
                         
                         CHAZ
          (sitting up suddenly)
          What?
                         
                         NIKKI
          (turning to the woods)
          Kit! Kit, come out!
                         
          There is rustling O.S., then Kit starts to emerge.
                         
                         KIT
          What's going on?
                         
          INT. STUDY - SAME
                         
          Muffy is still lying face down as we saw her last. She hears footsteps
          going upstairs.
                         
          INT. ATTIC - SAME
                         
          Rob is creeping up the attic stairs when he hears footsteps o.s. too.
          He pauses, his face draining of color.
          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          as Chaz, Nikki and Kit come racing up to the door and run inside.
                         
          INT. STUDY - SAME
                         
          as they come charging in...
                         
                         NIKKI
          She's gone!
                         
          Nothing left, but the pool of blood and a thin trail of smeared drying
          blood to indicate that she's been dragged away.
                         
                         KIT
          What?...
                         
                         CHAZ
          Look, she's been dragged away.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (PANICKING)
          Chaz! somebody's still in this house!
                         
                         CHAZ
          We could follow the trail.
                         
                         KIT
                         (DREAD)
          Oh, no... what about Rob?
                         (HALF BEAT)
          Rob!!
                         
          She races out of the study.
                         
          INT. ATTIC - NIGHT
                         
          The three of them come clambering up the stairs, Kit in the lead. They
          turn a corner. Then they see him... dead on the floor.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob...?
                         
          They run over to him.
                         
                         KIT
          (dropping to her knees)
          Rob? Rob??
          (shaking him: wailing)
          Rob!!!
          (dissolving into tears)
          It was only a game!
                         CHAZ
                         (SCARED SHITLESS)
          What the fuck is going on here?!
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (POINTING)
          Chaz, look!
                         
          Clutched in Rob's lifeless hand is a leather bookmark we may have
          noticed before. Chaz slips it out from beneath his fingers.
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (DAZED)
          This was Nan's...
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (TREMBLING)
          Nan...
                         
          Suddenly there is a loud KNOCK beneath them O.S. They all look up.
          Someone is coming slowly up the stairs, the loud footsteps O.S.that
          could only be made by a heavy boot, thundering closer... and closer...
                         
          Kit and Nikki and Chaz huddle around Rob's body and await their
          approaching doom.
                         
          Suddenly a dark figure fills the doorframe at the top of the stairs. A
          hand with a knife is raised. ·Nikki screams. Chaz spies a lamp on the
          floor. He turns it on...
                         
                         NIKKI
          Muffy!
                         
          Muffy walks into the room , lowering the knife.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Good job, you guys. I'm really scared.
                         (LOOKING DOWN)
          The fun's over, Rob.
                         
                         KIT
          (tears in her eyes)
          Muffy, he's dead!
                         
                         NIKKI
          Somebody else is here! In this house!
                         
                         MUFFY
          Sure. Sure.
                         (BENDING OVER)
          Let's see if the dead are ticklish, shall we?
                         KIT
          (pulling her away; screaming)
          Don't you touch him!!
                         
                         MUFFY
          Okay, okay, take it easy.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Muffy, it's not a game anymore!
                         
          Just then there is a loud CRASH o.s. of glass breaking down on the
          first floor. After the slightest pause there is another crash o.s.,
          and another...
                         
          Someone is smashing in all the bay windows along the back porch. Nikki
          screams.
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (ALARMED)
          What the--?
                         
          And she runs back down the attic stairs, followed quickly by the
          others.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME
                         
          as Muffy bursts out of the stairway and into the hall. Then
          Kit.
                         
          Suddenly the door to the stairwell slams shut on Nikki and Chaz
          cutting them off. A key turns in the lock. Muffy and Kit turn back to
          see a male figure in the darkness who'd been hiding behind the door.
                         
          Kit is nearest to him, and without warning, he lunges at her and
          buries a knife into her stomach ·up to the handle.
                         
          Kit screams and chokes, trying to fight him off: but he stabs her
          again, and again and again, plunging the knife deep into her with
          every thrust.
                         
                         KIT
          Muffy! Stop him! Help! He's killing me! Oh, God! He's killing me!
                         
          Muffy, initially paralyzed with fear, now runs for her life, down the
          hallway, down the stairs...
                         
          INT. ENTRY HALL - SAME
                         
          ...and to the front door as Kit's screams O.S. fade to silence. Muffy
          yanks on the door handle, but the door will not open. She pulls again
          and again desperately, but it won't budge,
          She turns and runs out of the entry hall. Just as she CLEARS FRAME,
          the front door swings silently open...
                         
          INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME
                         
          Muffy is racing past the back stairs toward the kitchen when A HAND
          reaches out from the pantry and hooks her around the face.
                         
          She is pulled backward, screaming, through the swinging door into the
          darkened pantry.
                         
          INT. PANTRY ­ SAME
                         
          It is Skip!
                         
          He pulls her head back, exposing her throat. He raises a knife to it,
          still stained with Kit's blood.
                         
                         SKIP
                         (RAVING)
          It's all over, Muffy! Everything'll be mine!
                         
                         MUFFY
          Skip! No! ! !
                         
          He makes a move to slit her throat, when Muffy kicks open
          the swinging door and sees...
                         
                         HER POV
                         
          ...standing on the other side, smiling, in various states of fake
          blood and mess... Rob, Kit, Nikki, Chaz and Nan. Muffy's eyes pop out.
          Skip's hands relax. And the others burst out laughing.
                         
                         FADE OUT
                         
                         FADE IN
                         
          EXT. THE HOUSE ­ DAY
                         
                         CLOSE UP
                         
          A SIGN being lifted into the air. It reads:

          Proprietors: St. John et Frere
                         
          PULL BACK to see Muffy supervising the raising of the sign in front of
          the house, while Skip drives up in the van, bringing the first
          customers to the door.

It is the afternoon of a summer's day. Anna, a twenty-five-year-old brunette, 
comes out from the entrance of a stately building and walks along a pathway 
that leads up to a dirt road. She is in a great hurry and becomes a little 
annoyed and surprised at seeing her father, a meticulously dressed and 
elderly gentleman, standing near the curb busily talking to his chauffeur in 
front of a black British car.
 
				ANNA
		So, there you are... I've been upstairs looking 
		all over for you...
 
There is a moment of silence during which Anna's father deliberately ignores 
her presence. She stares at him intently, trying to determine his mood and 
wondering how she is going to tell him what she has to say before she leaves. 
Finally, he turns around and faces her.
 
				FATHER 
		Oh, I thought you were already on the high 
		seas.
 
Anna is barely able to control her temper, but realizing that the discussion 
is about to take the usual sarcastic turn, she immediately checks herself.
 
				ANNA
		No, not yet, Dad.
 
Her father fixes her with a long ironic look. Conscious of his daughter's 
haste, he is apparently trying his best to detain her.
 
				FATHER 
		Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a 
		sailor's cap with the name of the yacht? 

				ANNA 
		No, Dad, it isn't.
 
There is another moment of silence. Meanwhile, a car has pulled up on the 
other side of the road. It is Claudia, a twenty-four-year-old blonde and a 
friend of Anna's. Both she and the driver get out of the car and remain 
discreetly in the background, waiting for the conversation to end. Anna's 
father resumes speaking, after a cursory nod to Claudia who, in turn, 
responds with a polite but half-hearted smile.
 
				FATHER 
		And how long will you be away? 

				ANNA 
		Four or five days.

				FATHER 
			(resignedly) 
		Oh, very well. I'll just spend the weekend 
		alone by myself and take a little rest. I 
		should be used to it by now.
 
Anna glares at him furiously but still manages to restrain herself.
 
				ANNA 
		Used to what?

				FATHER 
		To the fact of my retirement, not only as a 
		diplomat but also as a father.

				ANNA 
			(protestingly and with a 
			 deep sense of compassion) 
		But how could you say such a thing? 

				FATHER 
		Because it's true. After thirty years -- not 
		having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I 
		should at least allow myself to do so with my 
		own daughter. 

				ANNA 
		And have you any other truths to tell me? 

				FATHER 
		You already know what they are.

				ANNA 
		You mean Sandro, don't you?  Well, I beg of 
		you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.
 
She kisses him on the cheek but the father remains unmoved. It is obvious 
that he still has something else he wants to say to her. In fact, after 
gazing upon his daughter with a certain amount of pity, he finally does say 
it.
 
				FATHER 
		That type will never marry you, my child.

Anna has a difficult time restraining herself but manages somehow to keep 
calm as she answers.
 
				ANNA 
		Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't 
		wanted to marry him.

				FATHER 
		It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
 
He now returns the kiss his daughter had given him a short while ago. Then, 
without once turning around, he heads slowly towards the entrance of the 
house, as Claudia comes into the foreground.

Anna, still very tense and upset over the scene with her father, gets into 
the car. Claudia follows after her, as the driver puts her suitcase into the 
trunk.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Have you been waiting long? You'll have to 
		excuse me.
 
Anna doesn't answer. She merely pats Claudia's hand. The car takes off, as 
Anna's maid, standing to one side of the road, waves a warm goodbye. Claudia 
responds by waving back, but Anna doesn't even look around. Instead, she 
turns to the driver and says:
 
				ANNA 
		Please hurry, Alvaro. We're late.
 
The car speeds ahead along the dusty road, across a verdant strip of land, 
until it reaches the archway of a stone-wall fence around which it turns and 
disappears. It is seen again emerging from behind a cement wall and continues 
racing swiftly onward over a road that runs between two high walls. There is 
no sign of traffic. Only silence. It is an ancient road, and a very elegant 
one. Claudia looks at it admiringly. Anna continues to remain wrapped up 
within herself. The car now makes another turn, heading into a small, narrow 
road flanked on each side by gardens of patrician villas. Suddenly, it 
emerges on a drab, modern street amid the kind of traffic typical of any 
modern town.

Finally the car enters the street where Sandro lives and pulls up in front of 
a small but very fashionable palazzo. Anna and Claudia get out. And as the 
driver starts to remove the suitcases from the trunk, Claudia turns to Anna 
and says:
 
				CLAUDIA 
		I'll wait for you here.
 
Anna starts to walk across the street and is about to enter a building. 
Surprised, Claudia calls out to her:
 
				CLAUDIA 
		But where are you going? 

				ANNA 
		I'm thirsty.

				CLAUDIA 
		If I had a man waiting for me for half an hour 
		and whom I hadn't seen for a month ...
 
All of a sudden, Anna stops. She is pensive, almost sullen.
 
				ANNA 
		You know, I could just as well go without 
		seeing him today.

				CLAUDIA 
		What! After giving us such a run around... 

Claudia stops, smiles, and jokingly tries to laugh it off. 

				CLAUDIA 
		I see... so it's farewell to the yacht...and 
		farewell to the cruise...
 
Anna pays no heed to Claudia's teasing comments but follows her own original 
line of thought.
 
				ANNA 
		You know, it's terrible to be far away from one 
		another. Really, it's difficult to keep an 
		affair going when one is here and the other is 
		somewhere else. But, at the same time...it's 
		comforting.  Because it gives you a chance to 
		consider what you want and how you want it...
		but when he's right there before you all the 
		time... well, he's right there...
			(Then, with a sense 
			 of exasperation) 
		Oh, let's go back....
 
Claudia notices Sandro leaning out of the window from his apartment on the 
first floor of the building. He is looking at them attentively. He is a young 
man of thirty-five. His shirt is unbuttoned and the tie around his neck is 
unknotted. Realizing that he has been spotted, he smiles and waves a cheerful 
hello.
 
				SANDRO 
		I'll be right down.
 
As if seized by a sudden powerful impulse, Anna heads straight towards the of 
the building. Claudia looks at her with astonishment, and watches her 
disappear into the doorway. Then she looks up again at the window. But Sandro 
is no longer there.
 

***
Sandro's apartment is extremely small. Although it contains many books, it 
has the atmosphere of a place that is very seldom lived in. Sandro has just 
finished knotting his tie. He closes his suitcase and heads toward the door. 
He turns back, however, to pick up a towel fallen from the bed. He takes the 
towel into the bathroom. Then he goes to the door again, opens it, and sees 
Anna. She appears a little anxious. Without giving Sandro a chance to say a 
word, she enters the apartment, closing the door behind her. Sandro puts down 
his suitcase and is about to embrace her, but Anna steps aside and begins 
staring at him with an intense look upon her face. Taking him all in with her 
eyes, she examines his suit, his hands, his legs, his shoes. Then her gaze 
moves back up to his face which she proceeds to scrutinize. Sandro is unable 
to understand her behavior, so he shrugs and jokingly exclaims:
 
				SANDRO 
		Would you like to see my profile?
 
He snaps himself into profile, then turns, slowly, in the manner of a store 
window mannequin. Anna continues to stare at him. This time she peers 
directly into his eyes. Sandro is no longer amused.
 
				SANDRO 
		Well, what is it?
 
Finally, Anna puts an end to her staring, and taking Sandro by the hand she 
leads him around the room. She stops in front of a mirror and looks at 
herself. The expression on her face becomes taut, determined. She starts 
unbuttoning her dress as she continues looking at herself in the mirror. 
Sandro comes up close to her shoulders, caresses her hair, and whispers 
softly into her ear.
 
				SANDRO 
		But your friend is waiting downstairs. 

				ANNA 
		She'll wait.
 
Anna turns around and presses herself up against him with such a violent 
passion that Sandro is somewhat dismayed. But only for an instant. Soon they 
are feverishly kissing each other, and it is almost with a sense of sheer 
animal pleasure that Sandro abandons himself.
 


***
Meanwhile, left alone, Claudia is pacing back and forth outside in front of 
the building. She is bored and obviously tired of waiting. Then, as she is 
about to cross over to the other side of the street, she sees Sandro and Anna 
coming out of the doorway. The expression on Anna's face hasn't changed -- 
she appears sad and gloomy. But Claudia doesn't take note of it; she is too 
busy fuming over Anna's lack of consideration, eager to let them both 
understand that she is sick and tired of waiting around.
 
As Sandro opens the window of the car, which is pointed towards Milan, he 
says to Claudia:
 
				SANDRO 
		I have a feeling that you're not used to being 
		alone.
 
				CLAUDIA 
			(glancing first at Sandro 
			 and then at Anna)
		That seems to apply to you also...
 
Meanwhile, the driver has taken Anna's suitcase out of the black car and puts 
it into Sandro's. Claudia picks up her own suitcase and is about to do the 
same but Sandro intervenes and takes it from her.
 
				SANDRO 
		Don't be so humble.

				CLAUDIA 
		How should I be ... arrogant? 

				SANDRO 
		But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't 
		Anna ever told you?
 
While this exchange was going on, Anna has already climbed into Sandro's car. 
Sandro follows and takes his place at the wheel; Claudia gets in alongside 
him. The car takes off at high speed.
 


***
Heading south along a state highway, Sandro's car is traveling at high speed 
over a straight open road. It is twilight and as the evening shadows begin to 
fall, the surrounding countryside is bathed in an aura of mystery.

Inside the car Anna, Claudia and Sandro sit in complete silence. Anna is 
deeply absorbed in her own thoughts. Claudia is looking out of the window, 
enthralled by the dark beauty of the landscape. Another car draws up 
alongside of Sandro's and is about to pass him. But Sandro steps on the 
accelerator and pulls ahead with a tremendous burst of speed. The other car 
lags behind and then turns off at a crossroad. However, Sandro makes no 
attempt to slow down. In fact, spurred on by what has now become a definitely 
hostile atmosphere, he drives even faster.

As Sandro suddenly switches on the headlights, the violent glare that 
polarizes the roadside cuts off Claudia's view. She turns to Sandro with a 
look of disappointment
 
				CLAUDIA 
		It was lovelier before.
 
To please her, Sandro turns the headlights off and once again the countryside 
is covered by a veil of thick but romantic shadows.
 
				SANDRO 
		Like this?
 
Now Claudia again peers out at the landscape -- but only for an instant. 
Sandro abruptly turns the headlights on again, revealing a sharp curve in the 
road up ahead, only about a hundred yards away. He quickly shifts into lower 
gear, and the car swerves slightly. The sudden shift from fourth to third 
gear causes the motor to emit a sound that resembles a cry. The car races 
swiftly towards the curve, getting closer and closer. But at such high speed 
it appears impossible the car will be able to make the turn. Further up 
ahead, where the curve fades, there is a stone wall that runs along the side 
of the road. At this point, even Anna is attentive, her eyes wide open. Both 
she and Claudia are petrified and terror-stricken as the curve and the wall 
loom closer and closer. Fifty yards, forty, ten. All of a sudden, the 
headlights illuminate a large gap in the wall about three or four yards away, 
just on the other side of a small ditch that separates the road from the wall 
itself. There seems to be no other choice. With a frightening leap -- and 
going well over fifty miles an hour -- the car barely makes it over the ditch 
and right through the opening in the wall. The car comes to a sudden halt, 
but skids along on the muddy ground of an empty lot until it finally stops 
near the door of a small farmhouse in front of an old man. He is seated on a 
bench and has been observing the entire scene without budging an inch. 

There is a brief pause -- silence. Then Sandro comes out of the car followed 
by Claudia and Anna. Claudia is visibly shaken. She leans up against the 
building for support, as though in search of something solid and dependable. 
She is also unnerved by the feeling that she is responsible for what has just 
happened.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		It's all my fault!
 
But instead of reproaching her, Sandro turns to the old man and excuses 
himself for having broken into his property. Imperturbably, the old man looks 
up at him and says:
 
				OLD MAN
		And who do you think made that hole over there?
 
Even before he has a chance to be surprised at the old man's remark, Sandro 
becomes aware that Anna is laughing. It is not the hysterical laugh that 
normally might be expected after such a close call. It is, instead a pure and 
simple laugh, almost a happy one, and leaves both Sandro and Claudia plainly 
baffled.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		There's nothing much to laugh at. 

				SANDRO 
		And that's what I say, too. We could have all 
		been killed.
 
Anna looks at them as she continues to laugh.
 
				ANNA 
		I'm sorry ... but I can't help laughing...
 


***
On a calm sea, amid the Aeolian Isles, just off the coast of Sicily, a motor 
yacht is moving quietly and smoothly over the water. It is heading directly 
towards a small island that appears like a huge rock jutting up from the sea, 
sharply silhouetted against the sky, about a hundred yards away. A few sea 
gulls are lazily wheeling around up above.

Aboard the yacht, a sailor is at the helm, peacefully smoking his pipe, while 
another peers out over the water as he munches on a sandwich. It is almost 
noon.
 
Raimondo, a deeply bronzed young man in his thirties, is lying outstretched 
in the sun on top of the cabin. Towards the prow, lying flat on her stomach 
upon a small rubber mat, is Claudia. Her arms are dangling over the side of 
the boat, catching the cool, fine spray of water splashing gently against the 
prow. Corrado comes out of the cabin. He sits down on a bench near the stern 
after placing a cushion under himself so as not to soil his suit, which is 
white and of an elegance that is slightly out of style. Corrado has a 
sensitive face, with a look that is both sharp and intelligent. In age, he is 
closer to his fifties than his forties. Following directly behind him is 
Giulia, one of those impossible women who are so terribly sweet and coy and 
yet so demanding of attention. The pose she strikes as she looks out over the 
water, and the saccharine tone of voice in which she speaks, are precisely 
characteristic of her nature.
 
				GIULIA 
		It's as smooth and slick as oil. 

				CORRADO 
		I detest comparisons made with oil.
 
Anna also appears on deck, looks around and, noticing Claudia, goes over and 
lies down beside her. Claudia rolls over on her back to embrace all that 
wonderful sun but her outstretched arm comes in contact with Anna, who smiles 
and joins her in a friendly embrace.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Did you sleep well?

				ANNA 
		Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night 
		planning to do some thinking about a number of 
		things ... instead, I fell asleep.

				CLAUDIA 
		I didn't know one could sleep so well on a 
		yacht. It lulls you ...
 
Their conversation is suddenly interrupted by Sandro's voice shouting 
"Hello." He comes up to them and gives Anna a warm hug, then nods hello to 
Claudia. He is in a jaunty mood. Stretching himself out on the deck, he opens 
a picture magazine he had brought with him and starts to read. But Anna 
places her hand over the page he is looking at and says to him:
 
				ANNA 
		It would be better for you to get some sun.

Sandro closes the magazine and throws it overboard. The pages come apart in 
the water. Some of them are quickly swept under by the waves, while others 
float and slowly drift away: white specks upon which a few sea gulls converge 
emitting their guttural cries. 

As Sandro stretches himself out in the sun, Anna looks upon him with 
tenderness. She is about to embrace him but stops midway, and then finally 
changes her mind. Instead, she proceeds to stare at him with a profoundly 
troubled expression. Then, momentarily dismissing her anxiety, she cuddles up 
close to him in an effort to provoke his affection. Sandro responds, but only 
with a fleeting kiss. Seeing them together like this, Claudia gets up and 
moves away to the far side of the prow. Sandro and Anna remain as they are 
until they are suddenly enveloped by a dark shadow. Sandro opens his eyes and 
sits up. Anna does the same. The rocky island is now quite close, almost 
directly upon them. It is larger than it previously appeared and casts a 
long, dark shadow over the yacht. The water beneath the overhanging cliffs is 
extremely clear and almost motionless. Sandro rises to his feet and shouts 
out to everybody aboard.
 
				SANDRO 
		Shall we go for a swim? 

				CLAUDIA 
		Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too 
		dangerous.
 
The yacht proceeds to encircle the island. Up ahead, another island comes 
into view. It is smaller, brighter, and less foreboding. Corrado gets up and 
comes over to the prow to join Sandro, Anna and Claudia. He is immediately 
followed by Giulia, who peers intently at the landscape.
 
				GIULIA 
		At one time the Aeolian isles were all 
		volcanoes. 

				CORRADO 
		You must know your third grade geography book 
		inside out.
 
Giulia looks at him resentfully and abashed. Claudia points to an island 
which they have just passed.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		What is that one over there called? 

				CORRADO 
		That must be Basiluzzo.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo, 
		basiluzzo...
 
Corrado then points to an even smaller island which they are now approaching.
 
				CORRADO 
		Now that one is Lisca Bianca.
 
Anna, who had been absorbed all the while in contemplating the landscape, 
though still preoccupied with certain personal thoughts of her own, suddenly 
unfastens her thin dress. Stripping down to her bathing suit, she turns to 
the group and exclaims with a note of exasperation:
 
				ANNA 
		Oh, my goodness... All that yapping just for a 
		little swim.
 
She then goes to the edge of the boat, which has slowed down somewhat, and 
before Sandro has a chance to call out to her, she dives into the water.
 
				SANDRO 
		Anna!
 
Once in the water, Anna starts swimming towards the island. The sailor at the 
helm slows the boat even more so as to keep it within Anna's range. Raimondo, 
meanwhile, has gotten his skin-diving equipment ready; around his waist he is 
tightening a belt to which a long knife is attached. The yacht continues to 
slow down. Sandro now dives into the water and starts swimming towards Anna. 
Claudia and Giulia are removing their clothes and they too get ready to go 
into the water. But Claudia is afraid to dive in while the boat is still in 
motion, so she turns to the sailor and shouts:
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Stop ... stop the boat!
 
The motor is turned off and the yacht soon comes to a halt. A sailor places a 
ladder over the side of the boat. Claudia goes down the ladder, easing 
herself into the water. She moves away from the side of the yacht by swimming 
backwards. Giulia follows her down the ladder but stops on the last rung.
 
				GIULIA 
		How's the water?
 
Sandro looks up and, pointing to the rocks at the highest part of the island, 
answers her.
 
				SANDRO 
		Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, 
		Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come 
		on, Giulia ... your life is much too 
		circumscribed. 

				GIULIA 
		What has everybody got against me this morning?
 
From inside the cabin, a feminine voice is heard shouting:
 
				PATRIZIA 
		Raimondo!
 
Solicitously, Raimondo goes over to the door of the cabin, from which 
Patrizia emerges wrapped in a filmy nightgown. She is a woman of great 
elegance, somewhere in her thirties.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		Why have we stopped?

				RAIMONDO
			(kissing her hand) 
		Lady Patrizia!
 
Then, holding her by the hand, Raimondo leads her towards the prow, where 
Corrado greets her and likewise kisses her hand.
 
				CORRADO 
		Aren't you going in for a swim, Patrizia? 

				PATRIZIA 
		What makes you think I would even dream of such 
		a thing? Raimondo, why don't you go in for a 
		dip?
 
She turns around to look at Raimondo and becomes somewhat startled to see him 
all rigged out in his diving equipment, complete with mask, spear-gun, etc.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
 
				RAIMONDO 
		I detest it. But, after all, what can you do...
		It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt 
		myself.
 
He dives in. As soon as he hits the water, he starts shivering and exclaims:
 
				RAIMONDO 
		Who ever said that man was originally a 
		creature of the sea!
 
Then, lowering the mask over his face, he begins to submerge. On deck, 
Patrizia peers out over the sea and covering her eyes to shade them from the 
sun, remarks:
 
				PATRIZIA 
		I have never understood the islands. With all 
		that water around them, poor things ...
 


***
Out on the water, Sandro and Anna are almost at a standstill, keeping  
themselves afloat with only the slightest movement of their arms. Sandro is 
laughing and joking as though all this purely physical enjoyment of sun and 
water has freed him of all other cares. Anna tries to emulate him but is not
entirely successful. Every now and then, her face becomes clouded with that 
same worried expression.
 
				ANNA 
		When do you have to go back?

				SANDRO
		I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's 
		now in the process of negotiating for a 
		contract here in Sicily...

				ANNA 
		Then how come you're not with him? 

				SANDRO 
		What a question... Because I want to be with 
		you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the 
		deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few 
		days... Isn't this water wonderful!
 
He is lying on his back in the water, with his eyes closed, his face to the 
sun, cradled in the gentle movement of the waves. Anna looks at him, then 
after a moment of silence, she says:
 
				ANNA 
		I'd like to find a place where I can get some
		peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. 
		I'd like to try...

				SANDRO 
		What could be more restful than this?...
			(He opens his eyes and 
			 is upright in the water) 
		Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
 
Instead of answering him, Anna starts swimming rapidly out to sea. Sandro 
tries to hold her back but because she swims much faster, he gives up and 
finds himself alongside of Giulia.
 
 				GIULIA
			 (referring to Anna) 
		Where is she going? 

				SANDRO 
		Ask her.
 
Giulia is not much of a swimmer; she bobs up and down in the water, doing a 
crawl, and it seems she is always on the verge of going under. Still, she 
manages to stay afloat, enjoying herself like a little child. Slightly off to 
one side, Raimondo is exploring the depths, with his spear-gun in hand, ready 
to shoot. He seems to be chasing a fish that is apparently trying to elude 
him. But the water is so clear that it would be difficult even for a fish to 
hide. In fact, only a moment later, Raimondo takes aim with his spear-gun, 
pulls the trigger and the little harpoon shoots out. Then, with a great 
splash, he swims off in hasty pursuit of the fish. A rubber raft, piloted by 
one of the crew and bearing Corrado ashore, comes passing through the 
swimming area. The sailor is carrying on a conversation with Corrado.
 
				SAILOR 
		I've always worked on pleasure boats... even 
		though it's more tiring. 

				CORRADO 
		Why?

				SAILOR 
		Because the owners never seem to have any fixed 
		hours. For example, last night we kept right on 
		sailing... We didn't even have a chance to get 
		some sleep. Still, I like it better.
 
The raft passes alongside of Sandro, and Corrado calls out to him:
 
				CORRADO 
		I'm going ashore to take a look around the 
		island. There are some ruins up there... 

				SANDRO 
		There too...
 
				CORRADO 
		Well, we're still in Italy, you know!
 
The raft continues on its way towards shore. A little distance away, Claudia 
is floating on her back, basking in the sun, with her eyes closed -- almost 
motionless. Her arms are outstretched and only the very slightest movement of 
her fingers in the water is sufficient to keep her afloat. Suddenly, her hand 
comes in contact with something viscous... which seems to be a fish that has 
shot up to the surface of the water. At first, Claudia merely withdraws her 
hand without bothering to see what it is, but since it persists in following 
her, she opens her eyes and notices something moving right next to her. 
Frightened, she lets out a tiny yelp. At that very moment, directly behind 
the fish, Raimondo's rubber fins appear above the water, and she realizes 
that it is Raimondo himself. He removes his mask and breaks out into a hearty 
laugh as Claudia playfully splashes some water into his face.

Observing them from a few yards away is Anna. Having returned from her swim 
out in the open sea, she was about to join Claudia. But Claudia, involved now 
in chasing after Raimondo, doesn't notice her. 

Meanwhile, Raimondo, outdistancing Claudia, finds himself alongside of 
Sandro.
 
				SANDRO 
		What kind of a fish is that? 

				RAIMONDO 
		It's a cernia. 

				SANDRO 
		My God, it's enormous.
 
Claudia, having given up trying to catch Raimondo, swims up alongside of 
Giulia, who is busy observing Corrado disembark on a little strip of beach 
that stands out distinctly white against the dark rocks. Claudia is in a 
playful mood. She dives underwater, grabs hold of Giulia's leg, comes up, and 
then dives under once again. Giulia, caught up in the spirit of all this 
playfulness, drops her concern with Corrado and joins in with the fun and 
merriment.

Suddenly there is a loud shriek, then Anna's voice is heard screaming:
 
				ANNA 
		A shark!... A shark!
 
They all turn around to look at her. Anna is swimming furiously towards the 
boat. Then, immediately, the booming voice of the sailor aboard the yacht 
sounds out:
 
				SAILOR 
		Don't move,  lady... Stay where you are... 
		Stop! Everybody keep still.
 
But Sandro ignores the warning and starts swimming out towards Anna like a 
demon. Raimondo, who was about to climb aboard the yacht, grasps his 
spear-gun firmly in his hand, hurls himself back into the water, and also 
starts to swim in Anna's direction. Claudia is stricken with fear, and holds 
on tight to Giulia. Anna has stopped swimming and is cautiously looking 
around to see if anything comes up out of the water. Then, she looks up and 
seeing Sandro and Raimondo approaching, she shouts:
 
				ANNA 
		Stay away!
 
They both stop. Then, Raimondo hurriedly dons his mask and disappears under 
water while Sandro again starts swimming out towards Anna. Sandro comes up 
alongside her.
 
				SANDRO 
		Anna...
 
But Anna doesn't say a word. Instead, they both swim silently back to the 
yacht, where Claudia and Giulia are already climbing aboard. Patrizia comes 
out of the cabin to see what is happening.

They all lean over the side of the boat, looking down into the water, 
expecting the shark at any moment to come into view. But the water remains 
unruffled, the seaweed below is clearly visible, waving like so many fans. 
Even the rocks at the bottom can be seen with all sorts of small-gilled fish 
darting about. A mysterious, fascinating world and yet, because of what 
happened, one that arouses fear. Everyone aboard is silent. Until Anna and 
Sandro, followed by Raimondo, finally arrive and climb aboard. Sandro 
immediately takes Anna to her cabin, and the others follow, making various 
comments.
 
 				CLAUDIA 
			(to Anna)
		But how did you become aware of it? Did it 
		touch you?
 
Anna doesn't answer but continues on ahead amid the overlapping remarks.
 
				GIULIA 
		I would have died.
 				
				PATRIZIA
		... and how ugly they are ... with all those teeth...

				CORRADO 
			(shouting from the shore) 
		What happened? 

				GIULIA 
			(shouting from the prow) 
		There's a shark in the area. Don't move from 
		where you are! 

				CORRADO 
		Who's moving?
 


***
Inside the cabin, which is partitioned into separate rooms, the general 
layout is neat and orderly, with a number of prints decorating the walls. 
Sandro and Anna, followed by Claudia, enter from the outside deck and cross 
over into Anna's room. It is extremely small, with two cots on one side and a 
long curtain that partially conceals a bureau from which several dresses are 
seen hanging.

Anna is soaking wet in her bathing suit and her hair is all knotted into  
clusters that hang down over her face. Without bothering to dry herself, she 
crouches down on the cot and, assisted by Claudia, wraps a blanket around her 
body. Sandro and Claudia look at her with great concern. A member of the crew 
enters carrying a tray on which there is a half-filled glass of liquor, which 
Sandro takes and offers to Anna.
 
				SANDRO 
		Here, drink some cognac.
 
Anna positively refuses it, and the sailor leaves as Sandro sets the glass 
down on a shelf. Looking up at both Sandro and Claudia, Anna appears pleased 
with their solicitude.
 
				ANNA 
		It's nothing... really. Let's go back... It's 
		all over now. 

A pause and then an instant later, she begins shivering under the blanket. 

				ANNA 
		Only, I'd like to change. I'm a little cold.
 
Leaving Anna and Claudia alone on their own, Sandro turns and goes outside 
the cabin where the others are still congregated, busy chattering. Among the 
remarks exchanged, one that is distinctly heard is Patrizia's.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		But where did the shark go to?
 
As soon as Sandro closes the door to the cabin, Anna is suddenly and 
completely changed. She gets up from the cot, goes over to the curtain and 
draws it aside, revealing an array of feminine attire. Wondering which dress 
to choose, she finally selects two and tosses them on the cot.
 
				ANNA 
		Which one shall I wear?

				CLAUDIA
			(picking up one of the two dresses)
		This one is gorgeous.

				ANNA 
		Then why don't you try it on?
 
As Anna begins to dry herself with a large bath towel, Claudia slips on the 
dress and looks at herself in the mirror with a coquettish expression on her 
face.
 
				ANNA 
		It looks better on you than it does on me... 
		You keep it.
 
Anna is removing her bathing suit as she continues talking to Claudia with a 
tone and manner that reveal a sense of excitement mixed with one of amusement.
 
				ANNA 
		You know, that thing about the shark was all a 
		joke.
 
Claudia looks at her as though dumbfounded, as though she had never known her 
before. She is obviously piqued and angry, but more with herself than with 
Anna.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		There's the difference between you and me: you 
		know how to put over certain things, and I 
		don't. Sometimes I envy you.
 
Anna is all dressed and ready. She opens the door and steps outside, as 
Claudia follows behind. 



***
Out on the deck, Sandro, Patrizia, Raimondo and Giulia are looking over the 
side of the boat, watching the sailor as he approaches the yacht with a 
rubberized raft.  Giulia, with her usual air of affectation, looks down at 
the water splashing up against the raft and asks the sailor:
 
				GIULIA 
		But aren't you afraid?

				SAILOR 
		Ma'am, sharks never attack anybody. Anyway, the
		raft is dark, and they wouldn't be able to see 
		it.

				PATRIZIA 
		So, it is true that they're blind...
 
Anna appears at the door of the cabin and Sandro rushes over to meet her, a 
little surprised to find her looking so cheerful, as though the incident that 
had just taken place were completely forgotten.
 
				SANDRO 
		How are you?

				ANNA 
		Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
 
Anna goes over to the edge of the boat and stands at the head of the little 
stairway leading down to the water.
 
				ANNA 
		I have an urge to put my feet on some land. 
		Aren't you coming?
 
As she starts to go down the steps, Sandro quickly comes over to her.
 
				SANDRO 
		Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a 
		while.

				ANNA 
		Wait for what?

				PATRIZIA 
		Well, with a shark running loose around the 
		place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! 
		They'll have to catch it first. I want to see 
		it right here before my feet, dead or alive. 

				CLAUDIA 
		Better dead.
 
But Anna has already stepped aboard the raft, and Sandro follows her. Giulia 
has her eyes fixed on the beach where Corrado in his white suit is waiting 
for them. Her desire to join him is greater than her fear of the shark, so 
she looks down at the sailor and asks:
 
				GIULIA 
		Will the three of us fit?

				SAILOR 
		Sure, sure. There's plenty of room.
 
Patrizia, instead, turns around and heads back to the cabin. And Raimondo 
follows her shortly after. Giulia descends into the raft and, as it moves 
away from the boat with a slight pitch, she lets out a few hysterical shrieks. 
Anna laughs and then shouts out to Claudia:
 
				ANNA 
		Claudia, aren't you coming?

				CLAUDIA 
		I'm certainly not going to swim across. 
			
				ANNA 
		We'll send the raft back to you.

				GIULIA 
		And bring some cushions when you come, and a 
		towel...
 
Claudia nods assent, and remains there looking over the side and watching the 
water splash against the boat. Suddenly, she looks up at the sky and realizes 
that the sun has disappeared. Actually, it is hidden behind a cloud, and over 
on the horizon a group of other clouds have accumulated.

The sailor left aboard the yacht is now signaling the other sailor on the 
raft who, having deposited Sandro, Anna and Giulia on the beach, is returning 
to pick up Claudia. He sounds the depths with his oar and then shouts up:
 
				SAILOR 
		Okay. Come ahead, come ahead.
 
The sailor aboard the yacht goes over to Claudia and says:
 
				SAILOR 
		I'm taking the boat right up to the shore, and
		we'll let you get off from the gangplank as 
		soon as we get there.
 
Then he disappears inside and soon the yacht starts moving towards the shore. 
Claudia peers out over the landscape; the islands are sharply silhouetted 
against the sea and sky, the volcano on Stromboli smokes feebly, and in the 
distance a ship passes by. Claudia is plainly enchanted by the view. Then she 
collects her thoughts and slowly heads towards the cabin.
 


***
Patrizia, seated at a small table inside the cabin, is busy working on a 
complicated jigsaw puzzle, which, once completed, is supposed to represent a 
typically classical scene. One by one, she selects the various pieces of 
cardboard and inserts them in their rightful places. Simultaneously, she is 
munching on some crackers spread with jam, and a piece of cold fruit. Beside 
her is Raimondo.  He is staring at Patrizia with such an intense expression 
that she becomes thoroughly annoyed and says to him, as she continues working 
at her puzzle:
 
				PATRIZIA 
		What do you want, Raimondo? Do you want me? A 
		few years ago, maybe... but now... And, then, 
		at this hour of the day!
 
Coming down the steps that lead into the cabin, Claudia overhears the end of 
the conversation, and decides to withdraw. But Patrizia sees her and calls 
her back.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		Come, Claudia, do come in... There's no 
		romance going on here.
 
Claudia enters. Raimondo continues to stare at Patrizia, particularly at her 
legs. Patrizia becomes aware that Raimondo is staring at her, and with a 
condescending gesture, she lifts her skirt a little higher to make him see 
better.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		There, have you seen enough now? Are you 
		satisfied?
 
Raimondo nods yes. Claudia is amused by their behavior but also a little 
surprised.

Patrizia calmly resumes her game and Raimondo again begins to stare at her. 
This time, at her breasts. And again Patrizia becomes conscious of the fact 
that he is staring at her. She assumes a bored attitude and looks up at the 
ceiling in a gesture of quiet forbearance. Raimondo reaches out with his hand 
and gently caresses Patrizia's breast. Claudia looks on in amazement. 
Raimondo withdraws his hand.
 
				PATRIZIA
			(regretfully) 
		Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit 
		disappointed?... But I already told you... 

				RAIMONDO 
		If women's breasts were colored, yours would be 
		blue...
 
Patrizia laughs at Raimondo's remark and looks at him sympathetically. Then 
she turns to Claudia.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
 
				CLAUDIA 
		I would say he's pretty depraved. 

				PATRIZIA 
		Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a 
		child.

				RAIMONDO 
		Patrizia, don't start in again... I would 
		rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to 
		love children.

				PATRIZIA 
		You know, I don't love anybody. 

				RAIMONDO
			(angrily)
		I know, dammit, I know! 
			(turning to Claudia) 
		And just think -- if there ever was a woman so 
		right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of 
		dissipations, degradations, infidelities... 
		of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, 
		anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of 
		laziness... of unwillingness.
 
Raimondo has such a disgruntled look on his face that Patrizia laughs.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		He amuses me. I don't know of anything more 
		amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't 
		you find it so, Claudia?

				CLAUDIA 
		One would have to be in love with somebody to 
		know that.

				PATRIZIA 
		Have you ever been in love?

				CLAUDIA 
		Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall 
		we go out?
 
Claudia leaves the cabin and goes up to the deck. Patrizia returns to her 
game, and Raimondo continues to stare at her.
 


***
Along a narrow strip of beach on the island of Lisca Bianca, Sandro, Anna, 
Corrado and Giulia are waiting for Claudia to come ashore. There are some 
patches of vegetation growing here and there, but by and large the island is 
one huge rock with rugged cliffs which descend perpendicularly to the water. 
Jutting promontories give the place a sense of raw, primitive beauty. Seeing 
Anna and Sandro climbing a short distance up along the rocks to find a 
comfortable place where they can lie down and stretch themselves, Corrado 
remarks:
 
				CORRADO 
		If any of you get into your bathing suits 
		again, you can be sure we won't be seeing one 
		another for the rest of the year. I just can't 
		stand seeing anybody in the city after having 
		seen them naked on the beach.
 
The yacht finally has arrived and the gangplank is laid out between the boat 
and the shore. Claudia descends and as she wades ashore she stops, bends over 
to dip her hand in the water, and with a tone of voice resembling that of a 
mother speaking to its newborn child, she pretends she is speaking with 
someone or something in the water.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Oh, how sweet... What a dear little darling!
 
They all turn around to look at her, wondering to whom or what she is 
referring.
 
				GIULIA 
		Who are you talking to? 

				CLAUDIA 
		To the shark.
 
They all break out into a laugh, and Claudia continues her comic bit as she 
playfully pretends to lose her balance on the slippery pebbles along the 
shore. Corrado looks at her somewhat surprised, as though up until now he had 
never seen her comport herself with such a lively sense of humor and wit.
 
				CORRADO 
		Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up 
		with me and take a look over there? 

				CLAUDIA 
		At what?

				CORRADO 
		At the ruins. They're very ancient, you know.
 
Out of the entire group, Claudia is perhaps the only one who really has the 
desire to explore, to see, and to generally take advantage of whatever the 
cruise has to offer.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		That sounds like a good idea. But why don't we 
		all go together?
 
Though Claudia's suggestion is heard by all, none of them make a move. 
Relaxing so comfortably in the sun as they are, it seems the last thing they 
would want to do is to climb up the rocky slopes. So Claudia starts to go up 
on her own, following Corrado who is already under way. But Giulia 
immediately comes up to him and, squeezing his arm to emphasize her plea, 
whispers to him:
 
				GIULIA 
		Please, I beg of you, stay here.
 
Giulia's plea is expressed with such a pitiful sense of humility that Claudia 
is immediately taken aback, although she does not fully understand its 
motive.
 
				CORRADO 
			(noticing Claudia's hesitancy)
		Well? 

				CLAUDIA 
		Well, what?

				CORRADO 
		Have you decided?

				CLAUDIA 
		All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
 
Disappointed and rather irritated, Corrado turns back, while Claudia looks 
around for a place on the rocks where she can comfortably set herself down. 
Giulia, in turn, approaches Corrado.
 
				GIULIA 
		Why didn't you ask me to go with you? 

				CORRADO 
		Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins 
		I'm sure you would have said they were very, 
		very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" 
		to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a 
		baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive 
		little heart that it throbs for anything.
 
				CORRADO 
			(ironically)
		But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why 
		shouldn't one say so?

				GIULIA
			(referring to Corrado)
		He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to
		let me know that he doesn't care about me any 
		more.

				CORRADO 
		Giulia, that remark is not worthy of our twelve 
		years of honest concubinage. I repeat, once and 
		for all, and publicly, that I admire you. Does 
		that please you?
 
				CLAUDIA 
			(under her breath to 
			 Anna and Sandro)
		Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
 
				SANDRO
			(with a faint smile)
		And why haven't they left each other?

				CLAUDIA 
		I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be 
		that they're in love?

				SANDRO 
		Could be. They're the kind of people who are 
		capable of anything.
 
Sandro suddenly grabs Anna around the waist and pulls her to him. His action 
is so unexpected that even Anna is astonished. But Giulia's voice is heard 
again.
 
				GIULIA
			(to Corrado)
		The trouble with you is that nobody can speak 
		to you, that's all.

				SANDRO
			(placatingly)
		Giulia, don't you understand that the more 
		involved you become with people, the more 
		difficult it is to speak with them? 

				GIULIA 
		You men are all so dreadful!

				SANDRO 
		I know we are. But as the years go by, we 
		become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado? 

				CORRADO 
		I hope so.
 
Breaking the nervous tension that has spread itself throughout the group, a 
seaman appears with a small basket of frozen peaches brought from the yacht. 
Claudia runs to the basket, picks up a peach and quickly bites into it.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		How wonderful!

				CORRADO 
		That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's 
		with us.
 
Claudia takes another peach from the basket and gives it to Corrado.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		I think you're very sweet, Corrado. 

				CORRADO 
		More so than the shark? 

				CLAUDIA 
		There's no comparison.

				CORRADO 
		Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?



***
Anna and Sandro have left the group and are ensconced further up among the 
rocks, on a grassy slope overlooking the beach.
 
				ANNA 
		Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have 
		become used to being without you.

				SANDRO 
		You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety. 

				ANNA 
		A little more so this time.

				SANDRO 
		So, it will just take you a little longer to 
		get over it.

				ANNA 
			(angrily)
		But I think we should talk about it. Or are you 
		fully convinced that we too won't understand 
		each other?

				SANDRO 
		There will be plenty of time to talk about it
		later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way 
		we'll have more time...

				ANNA 
		In this case, getting married means nothing. 
		Aren't we already the same as being married? 
		And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already 
		the same as being married?

				SANDRO 
		But why rattle your brains by arguing and 
		talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help 
		at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, 
		Anna. Isn't I that enough?

				ANNA 
		No. It's not enough... I told you before that I 
		would like to get away for a while and be alone. 

				SANDRO 
		But you just said that a month was too...
 
				ANNA 
			(interrupting)
		I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a 
		year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds 
		absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of 
		losing you makes me want to die... And yet... 
		I... I just don't have the same feeling for you 
		any more. 

				SANDRO 
		And what about yesterday... at my house... 
		didn't you have any feeling for me, even then? 

				ANNA 
			(angrily)
		There you go... Must you always spoil 
		everything!
 
She turns and walks away in a rage. Sandro breathes a deep sigh, as though 
the scene had exhausted him, then stretches himself on the ground, his face 
turned skyward, his eyes shut tight.
 


***
The sky over the island of Lisca Bianca is completely filled with clouds. It 
is early afternoon, the atmosphere has darkened, and occasional sounds of 
thunder are heard in the distance.

Sandro is asleep with his arms folded under his head. Further below, Claudia, 
Corrado and Giulia are also taking a nap. Gradually, however, with the sound 
of thunder, they become aroused.
 
				GIULIA 
		Looks like the weather is changing. 

				CORRADO 
		Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the 
		obvious? I can see for myself that the weather 
		is changing.
 
Corrado rises and looks around lazily, listening to what appears to be the 
sound of a motor boat and which seems to be coming from the other side of the 
island. Claudia, spotting a sailor approaching, also rises.
 
				SAILOR 
		We'll have to get going.
 
Claudia turns around, looks up, and sees Sandro asleep by himself.
                                 
				CLAUDIA 
		And where's Anna? 
			(then, turning to the sailor)
		Isn't she on the yacht?
 
				SAILOR 
		I don't know... you see... we were taking a 
		little nap...
 


***
Out on the yacht, Patrizia is completing her puzzle. Only a few pieces are 
missing but the area to be filled in is a very difficult one. Raimondo, who 
has grown impatient over Patrizia's long and tedious concentration, exclaims:
 
				RAIMONDO 
		You've made some mistake there with the 
		bushes... that's why you can't finish it.

				PATRIZIA 
		Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so 
		impatient?
 
Claudia's voice is heard, calling out from the shore.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Patrizia! ...
 
Patrizia raises her eyes and gives a quick, casual glance at the porthole. 
Raimondo immediately takes the hint that she would like him to get up and see 
what Claudia wants. So he goes out to the deck where he sees Claudia calling 
from the shore.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Is Anna there? 

				RAIMONDO 
		I don't think so.
 
He goes over to the cabin, and looking through the portholes, calls out 
Anna's name. But there is no answer, so he returns to the side of the boat 
and shouts back.
 
				RAIMONDO 
		She's not here.
 



***
Meanwhile, on the beach, Sandro is also looking for Anna, disturbed and 
amazed that she is not in sight.
 
				SANDRO
			(angrily, to himself)
		This is the kind of behavior that drives me 
		crazy!

Down at the shore, Giulia is getting ready to step on the gangplank and go 
aboard the yacht but, anxious about Anna's whereabouts, she changes her mind 
and turns back. Claudia, also deeply concerned, decides to remain and look 
around for herself. She turns and starts climbing up towards the rock in an 
opposite direction than that taken by Sandro, who has now reached the top.
 
The search is fruitless; there seems to be no trace of Anna. But Sandro 
continues to explore the area, stopping every now and then to call out Anna's 
name. Then, looking down over the slope, he notices Claudia, Giulia and 
Corrado coming towards him.
 
				SANDRO 
		Did you find her?
 
None of them answer but it is clear from the worried expressions on their 
faces that they too have found no trace of Anna. Still they continue the 
search, each going off in different directions. Claudia, walking over land 
covered with large white rocks and clumps of dry brush, spots something 
moving behind one of the bushes. Anxiously, she starts to walk up closer. 
Suddenly the branches begin to move and a stray lamb emerges. Surprised, but 
also somewhat relaxed, she turns around and calls out to Corrado, who is 
following her only a short distance away.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		It's a lamb!
 
Corrado looks at her without answering, then stops and notices further up 
ahead a jumbled pile of rocks which he feels might very well be the ruins he 
had previously intended to explore. He is about to head towards them but 
suddenly realizes that Giulia is following directly behind him. He quickly 
changes his direction in an effort to avoid her.

Sandro comes upon a small stone hut that leans up against a high section of 
rock. As he starts to approach it, another stray lamb appears, as if from 
nowhere, and runs off, frightened by Sandro's approach. He tries to open the 
door to the hut but finds it locked. As he looks around the area, uncertain 
as to his next move, he sees Claudia and Corrado coming towards him.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Find anything? 

				SANDRO 
		No.

				CORRADO 
		Perhaps she's taking a swim somewhere...
 
Though no less concerned over Anna's disappearance than any of the others, 
Corrado attempts to lighten the tension by feigning a calm and sensible 
attitude. Taking note of the stone hut before him, he observes it carefully 
and remarks:

				CORRADO 
		It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under 
		the sun. Now, look here. Look at this 
		structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, 
		that's how you should design your houses.

				SANDRO 
		Me?... I no longer have any interest in 
		building... And, then, where can you find 
		boulders of rock like this in Milan?
 
Claudia comes up close to the hut and tries to peer through the tiny window 
but inside it is so dark that nothing can be seen. Suddenly, she finds a 
small piece of bread on the ledge of the window. She picks it up and starts 
examining it. Then, realizing the bread is still fairly fresh, exclaims:
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Somebody must live here!

				CORRADO 
			(after examining the bread himself)
		But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of 
		people who live here.
 
The discussion is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of one of the sailors 
who has come up from the shore.
 
				SAILOR 
		We had better get started. The storm may 
		break any minute now.

				CLAUDIA
			(angrily)
		What do you mean! What about Anna?

				SANDRO 
			(to the seaman)
		Tell Lady Patrizia that we can't leave now. In 
		fact, we'll have to make a tour around the 
		island...

				SAILOR 
		Wouldn't it be better if you told that to the 
		Lady yourself. I can't assume the 
		responsibility for keeping the boat here. 
		There's no place to tie it up... And then, 
		you know, it's got a flat bottom, and if the 
		sea gets a little too rough...

				SANDRO 
			(angrily)
		That doesn't make any difference! If we have to 
		stay, we'll stay!
 


***
Aboard the yacht, which is circling the island, Sandro, Patrizia, Raimondo 
and one of the sailors are peering out over the side, scrutinizing the banks 
and rocky slopes in hope of finding some trace of Anna. The jagged cliffs 
appear enormously tall and ominous, harboring tiny grottoes in which someone 
could easily hide.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a 
		cramp or something...

				SANDRO 
		Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a 
		cramp, she would have managed to reach shore 
		somehow.

				PATRIZIA 
		But you have to  consider all possibilities, 
		Sandro.
 
Incensed by her remark, which he considers to be absurd, Sandro moves away 
from Patrizia and goes towards the stern of the boat where he notices Corrado 
signaling to them from a remote section of the beach.
 
				CORRADO
			(calling out)
		There are some footprints around here...
 
But he stops in the middle of the statement, and throws up his arms to 
indicate that the discovery is really of little significance. So he proceeds 
to climb back up along the pathway from which he descended, and the yacht 
continues on its way.
 
				SANDRO 
			(calling from the stern, excitedly)
		Patrizia!
 
Both Patrizia and Raimondo come rushing over to the stern and look towards 
where Sandro is pointing at something dark and obscure afloat on the water up 
ahead.
 
				RAIMONDO
			(to the sailor)
		Mario...Steer the boat that way.
 
The yacht heads in the direction of the black object in the water, but as 
they come up close, they realize it is nothing more than some wooden piece of 
furniture. The turn has taken the boat slightly away from Lisca Bianca and 
they now find themselves closer to the little island of Basiluzzo.
 
				SAILOR 
		Shall I turn back?

				SANDRO 
		No. Now that we're here, let's have a look 
		around Basiluzzo. 
			(then turning to Patrizia) 
		When we were swimming, she swam out in that 
		direction. 

				SAILOR 
		It won't be easy to find a place to go ashore.
 


***
The first shadows of evening begin to fall over the island of Lisca Bianca. 
The sky is now even gloomier, streaked with flashes of lightning. Rumbling 
sounds of thunder are heard in the distance. The entire group is once again 
reunited on the beach, and the impending storm has heightened their fears and 
anxiety. They are cold, restless, and exhausted, but profoundly moved and 
shaken by the reality of Anna's strange disappearance.
 
				SANDRO 
		Let's try to be practical about this. The best 
		thing to do is for all of you to go to the 
		closest island that has a police station, or 
		something, and report the disappearance. I'll 
		remain here... because... well, I don't know, 
		but it seems to me that something may turn up. 
		Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving. 

				CORRADO 
		Then let's get started... It's senseless to 
		waste any more time.

				PATRIZIA
			(to the sailor)
		How long will it take to go there and come 
		back?

				SAILOR 
		If there's a police station at Panarea, it 
		should take us a couple of hours. But if we 
		have to go to Lipari, it will take much longer. 
		Then it also depends on how rough the sea is.
 
Giulia is about to get on her way but she stops and turns around to look for 
Corrado, who notices her looking at him.
 
				CORRADO 
		I'll stay here also.
 
				GIULIA
			(alarmed)
		But why?... What if it starts to rain? 

				CORRADO 
		If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
 
Claudia, who has remained to one side, wrapped up in her own thoughts, 
doesn't make a move to leave. Sandro and Corrado look at her in surprise.

				CORRADO 
			(to Claudia, understandingly)
		Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are 
		already two of us staying... 

				SANDRO 
		I'll go even further and say that her presence 
		here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could 
		be a great hindrance.
 
Ignoring Sandro's remark, Claudia turns and determinedly heads towards the 
interior of the island. Meanwhile, Patrizia and Giulia have gone aboard the 
yacht.
 
				GIULIA
			(calling to Corrado 
			 from the boat)
		Do you want some blankets? ... and something 
		to eat?
 
Corrado makes an irritated gesture signifying no, then together with Sandro 
starts climbing up the rocky slope towards the stone hut. As they meet up 
with Claudia midway, the first drops of rain start to fall and it is clear 
that the storm is on the verge of breaking. The three of them reach the door 
of the hut and Corrado tries to pull it open, but the lock resists. Then 
Sandro comes to his aid, and placing their shoulders up against the wooden 
door, they finally manage to force it open.


***
Inside the hut it is pitch black. Sandro strikes a match and finds a kerosene 
lamp on a nearby table. He lights it and the room is suddenly illuminated, 
revealing a miserable interior with a few broken chairs, several empty boxes, 
a shovel and a few other utensils. Over to one side is a small pile of straw 
suggesting a makeshift bed.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... 
		Why, even this morning... that business about 
		the shark... it wasn't at all true.

				SANDRO 
		And why do you tell us this only now?
 
				CLAUDIA 
		I... I don't know... I didn't think it was 
		worthwhile... She was laughing over it... 

				CORRADO 
		Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she 
		invented a shark. What was her purpose in that? 

				CLAUDIA 
			(indicating Sandro)
		Maybe you'd better ask him.

				CORRADO
			(to Sandro)
		What were you and Anna arguing about?... 
		Excuse me for being so indiscreet, but this is 
		serious...

				SANDRO 
		Nothing but the usual argument... The only 
		thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that 
		she said she had a need to be alone.

				CLAUDIA 
		And how do you explain that?
 
Ignoring the question, Sandro begins pacing back and forth across the room. 
The silence is broken only by the sound of the rain outside which is now 
coming down harder and harder. Suddenly, footsteps are heard approaching the 
hut. Sandro, Claudia and Corrado quickly turn around and face the door, their 
faces clearly revealing the expectation that it might be Anna. Finally the 
door begins to open and an old man appears, carrying a sack in his hand.
 
				SANDRO 
		Are you the owner of this place? 

				OLD MAN 
		No. The owners are in Australia. 

				SANDRO 
		But where did you come from? 

				OLD MAN 
		From Panarea. Why?

				CORRADO 
		Ah, then it was you... I heard a boat leaving 
		here at two o'clock today...

				OLD MAN 
			(scratching his head)
		It must have been around four or five... 

				CORRADO 
		In the afternoon?
 
				OLD MAN 
		No... in the morning. Why? What's happened?

				SANDRO 
		Nothing... nothing at all!

				CLAUDIA 
		But why don't you tell him? 
			(then turning to the old man) 
		A girl who was with us has disappeared. 

				OLD MAN 
		What do you mean... disappeared?  Was she 
		drowned?

				CLAUDIA 
		No, she didn't drown... She just disappeared, 
		and nobody knows where.
 
				SANDRO 
		And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you 
		tell him that too. That's what you believe, 
		isn't it? 

				CLAUDIA 
		Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, 
		you would have been better off trying to 
		understand what Anna was thinking.

				OLD MAN 
		Have you searched in back of the house to see 
		if she might have fallen off that cliff? Last 
		month that's what happened to one of my 
		sheep... I looked all over for it all day long 
		and it wasn't until late at night that I heard 
		it bleating... It had been there the whole 
		day... and was almost dead.
 
Claudia suddenly jumps up and runs out of the hut and into the dark, calling 
out desperately.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Anna! . . . Anna!
 
But her cries are lost in the sound of the storm. Drenched by the rain, her 
shoes full of mud, her dress soaked, she stops, as Corrado, who had followed 
after her, grabs hold of her arm and leads her back to the hut.
 
				CORRADO 
		Come, Claudia...come back inside.
 


***
It is early morning inside the hut, and the flame of the kerosene lamp has 
dwindled down to a tiny, flickering light. Claudia awakens with a bewildered 
look upon her face, wondering where she is and how she comes to be there. She 
notices Corrado dozing on an empty box in a corner of the room, then 
realizing that Sandro and the old man are no longer there, she gets up and 
goes out the door.

Outside, everything is covered by a thick haze, which is gradually beginning 
to lift. Sandro, who is standing a short distance away from the hut, hears 
Claudia approaching and turns around to greet her.
 
				SANDRO 
		Are you feeling better?

				CLAUDIA 
			(nodding yes)
		I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.

				SANDRO 
		You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Yes, very much so.

				SANDRO 
		Has she ever spoken to you about me? 
	
				CLAUDIA 
		Occasionally, but always with affection. 

				SANDRO 
		And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for 
		her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a 
		certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or 
		didn't mean much to her. 

				CLAUDIA 
		I know. I keep asking myself what I could have 
		done to prevent all this from happening.
 
There is a pause, then suddenly they both hear the sound of a motor growing 
louder and louder. They look out over the shore but the haze is so heavy that 
it is impossible for them to determine the source. Then, seeing the old man 
coming up the path, Sandro impulsively runs towards him and seizes him by the 
collar.
 
				SANDRO 
		Whose boat is that? 

				OLD MAN
			(astonished)
		What boat?

				SANDRO 
		Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound 
		of a motor?

				OLD MAN 
		At this time of the year there are so many 
		boats...

				SANDRO 
		And how come you're up so early? 

				OLD MAN 
		Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
 
Sandro is visibly deflated by the old man's casualness, and he decides to 
abandon his questioning. He turns away from him and looks up to see Claudia 
walking slowly towards the top of the cliffs, directly behind the hut where 
the night before the old man had said Anna might have fallen. She looks down 
over the side and quickly withdraws, almost in fear of being sucked down into 
the swirling waters below. She turns away and starts walking towards the 
interior part of the island. In the rocky hollows around her, she notices 
small accumulations of yesterday's rain and, scooping up some of the water 
from one of these rocks, she rinses her face. As she gets up again, Sandro is 
there, standing directly before her. Claudia is almost startled. They 
continue to gaze at one another in silence. Then Claudia abruptly turns away 
and heads towards a higher point of land. A moment later, Sandro joins her 
again and once more they find themselves staring into each other's eyes, 
almost embarrassed by their own behavior, yet unable to control it.

The wailing siren of a police boat resounds through the air like a shrill 
lament. Only then do Sandro and Claudia detach themselves from their trance-
like state, from the sudden compulsion of being drawn towards each other. 
Through the haze, they notice a landing taking place down at the shore. 
Realizing it is their friends returning with the police, they both start 
descending the slope to greet them.

Stepping ashore are Patrizia, Giulia and Raimondo, followed by a Marshal of 
the carabinieri and two police agents. As Sandro and Claudia come rushing 
down over the rocks, Claudia suddenly stops and lags behind so as not to 
arrive on the beach simultaneously with Sandro.

Meanwhile, Corrado has already gone down to the shore and as he goes out to 
meet them, Patrizia, Giulia and Raimondo anxiously look to him as though 
expecting some good news. But Corrado remains silent, then throws out his 
arms in a gesture of despair.
 
				GIULIA 
		How did you spend the night?... In that hut?...
		And what did you have to eat? 

				CORRADO 
		What do you think?

				GIULIA 
		We, too, you know. It was disastrous. First at 
		Panarea, where there weren't any boats... then 
		at Lipari, where everybody was asleep... And 
		the phone call to Rome...

				PATRIZIA 
		We had to notify her father. 

				CORRADO 
		Yes, that was a very good idea.

				PATRIZIA 
		He'll be here sometime today. 
			(then turning to Sandro who 
			 has just arrived on the scene) 
		I also phoned my house in Milan... but Ettore 
		had already left.

				MARSHAL
			(to Sandro) 
		Anything new develop? 

				SANDRO 
		Unfortunately, no.

				MARSHAL
		Very well. First of all, I'll have them search 
		the waters around the island. I brought two 
		frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look 
		up around here.

				SANDRO 
		Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, 
		you'll need some rope and ladders... 

				MARSHAL
		Don't worry, we've got everything. 

				SANDRO 
		Another thing; there's an old man who lives 
		here on the island...

				MARSHAL
			(interrupting)
		I know, I know. One thing at a time.
  
The Marshal starts climbing up towards the interior of the island, with 
Sandro following behind. As Claudia sees them coming in her direction, she 
moves away to a lower section of the island to avoid coming in contact with 
Sandro. Peering over a precipice, she sees the frogmen below, and watches 
them slide into the clear water like two enormous fish.

Sandro and the Marshal have arrived on the edge of the same precipice, where 
two men are lowering a rope ladder into the depths. Moving up further to 
watch the operations, Sandro becomes aware of Claudia standing alone just a 
short distance away. He heads towards her but she tries to avoid looking at 
him. Sandro, however, is unable to take his eyes from her and continues 
walking in her direction. But seeing Patrizia and Raimondo approaching, he 
suddenly stops. A small stone, accidentally loosened from the ground, rolls 
along the path and comes to a halt directly in front of Claudia, almost like 
a message. She picks it up, looks at it, then throws it away. Sandro moves 
away and heads back to the edge of the precipice.

Patrizia and Raimondo join Claudia. Raimondo, who is carrying a box of 
crackers in his hand, offers them to both Claudia and Patrizia.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		No, who wants crackers... Why don't you go and 
		have some coffee made instead?

Meanwhile, Sandro has arrived at the edge of the precipice where he finds 
Giulia and Corrado. They are looking down at one of the carabinieri who is 
dangling from a long rope over the side of the rock, exploring the crevasses 
where a body might have fallen from the precipice above. The Marshal leans 
over to see if anything has been discovered.
 
				CARABINIERE
			(calling up to the Marshal)
		Nothing here!
 
The Marshal turns around in disgust and looks at Corrado who is frankly sick 
and tired of the whole operation.
 
				CORRADO
		Don't look at me like that, Marshal...  I had 
		nothing to do with it.

				PATRIZIA 
			(referring to the frogmen below)
		Let's hope they don't find her... If they do, 
		they would find her dead.
 
All of a sudden, Claudia breaks out into tears. Patrizia doesn't say a word. 
She just lets Claudia cry, knowing it will do her good. Sandro comes over and 
as soon as Claudia sees him there, she stops crying, and avoids looking up at 
him.
 
				SANDRO 
		Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a 
		current that passes by here and ends up at 
		another island... I don't know which... He 
		wants to send one of his men over to have a 
		look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask 
		Raimondo to go with him? 

				PATRIZIA 
		I don't see why I should mind.

				CLAUDIA
			(to Sandro)
		I think that you might go and have a look 
		yourself.

				SANDRO 
		Yes, maybe that is better.
 
He turns and starts heading down towards the beach.
 
				PATRIZIA
			(to Claudia)
		What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.

				CLAUDIA
			(rising)
		Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was 
		awake all night.
 
One of the frogmen emerges with an ancient vase in his hand, evidently found 
in the depths below. Raimondo, who has just arrived with a thermos of hot 
coffee, puts it down and goes over to the frogman to fetch the vase.
 
				RAIMONDO
			(to the frogman)
		What is it?

				FROGMAN
		An ancient vase. There's a buried city under 
		here. It's full of this stuff.
 
Raimondo takes the vase and shows it to Patrizia and Claudia. It is an 
extremely beautiful amphora, in terra cotta, with a figured design around it. 
Patrizia and Claudia momentarily drop their thoughts to examine it. Then 
Corrado, who had observed the scene, comes over, followed immediately by 
Giulia.
 
				PATRIZIA
			(ironically)
		Come on, Corrado, tell us what century it 
		belongs to.
 
Corrado smiles, then comes closer to examine it. Claudia also kneels down to 
look at it. A moment later she feels a presence at her side, and even without 
turning around she knows it is Sandro. Taking advantage of the discovery that 
was made, he purposely has returned to join the group in order to be near 
Claudia. They both now feel between them the warmth of that contact, and for 
a brief moment, succumb once again to that sudden sense of wonderment which 
they already had experienced at dawn.
 
				GIULIA 
		Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to 
		us as a gift?

				CORRADO 
		Really! So that you can stuff it with your 
		geraniums.

				PATRIZIA
			(to Sandro)
		But aren't you supposed to be on your way?
 
Claudia, stricken with dismay, immediately detaches herself from Sandro, who 
replies with a certain sense of embarrassment.
 
				SANDRO 
		Yes... I'm going... I'm going now.


 
***
A patrol boat is anchored off the cliff of a small island where the current 
running through the surrounding waters comes to an end. Sandro is leaning 
against the wall of a dilapidated building, which is constructed right on 
that part of the rock where the sea close by discharges all kinds of refuse. 
Four or five islanders are busy scouring through the accumulated rubbish. 
They are taciturn, poorly dressed people who every now and then come to blows 
over the possession of some article washed ashore by the waves. Sandro is 
watching them, feeling distraught and melancholy. One of the carabinieri who 
had accompanied him is walking up and down beside an elderly gentleman who is 
obviously one of the local gentry.
 
				SANDRO 
			(to the carabiniere)
		It's already two hours... What are we going to 
		do?

				CARABINIERE
		It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for 
		the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca. 

				ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
		And sometimes even twenty-four... depending on 
		the wind...

				CARABINIERE
 		If the girl disappeared yesterday afternoon, 
		we'll have to wait at least until three or four 
		o'clock.
 
Sandro looks at them without commenting, then turns and walks away towards 
the center of the village. The houses and shops around the square are very 
plain and shabby. Sandro spots a barber shop and, fingering his day-old 
beard, enters for a shave.

Shortly thereafter, a clamor of voices is heard outside and Sandro comes 
dashing out of the shop. Seeing the islanders fighting and arguing about 
something drawn up from the sea, he runs over to find out what it is.  As he
arrives on the scene, two policemen step out of the confusion dragging a 
large crate, which they carry over to the door of a nearby shack, amid the 
protests of the islanders who are still arguing and shouting among 
themselves.
 
				VOICES
		It belongs to me... We found it... 

				GENTLEMAN
		Back... Stand back!
 
The two policemen set the crate down and lift the lid. It is full of 
cigarettes.
 
				CARABINIERE
			(to the islanders)
		You see? It contains cigarettes. We'll have to 
		confiscate it.
 
The islanders react violently, shouting out all sorts of epithets. But the 
policemen manage to restrain them and soon the commotion is quieted down.
 
				CARABINIERE
			(to Sandro)
		These people are contemptible. They have no 
		sense of dignity at all.
 
				SANDRO 
			(referring to the crate)
		And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?

				CARABINIERE
		It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At 
		least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I 
		really can't understand it. Contraband 
		cigarettes on that island! It's the first time 
		that ever happened.

				SANDRO 
		Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca. 

				CARABINIERE
		But how could we...at a time like this when we 
		just... well, let's at least first have a look
		around the other islands. Could be that 
		something might turn up there.

				SANDRO 
			(impatiently)
		But even here we were supposed to find who 
		knows what... And all we bring back with us is 
		a crate of cigarettes.

				CARABINIERE
			(shrugging his shoulders)
		As you wish.
 


***
At Lisca Bianca, a helicopter is hovering above the island and preparing to 
land. Waiting for it to descend are Claudia, the old man, the Marshal and 
Anna's father, just arrived from the mainland.

				MARSHAL
			 (to the old man)
		... Is it also true that you saw no boat around
		here at Lisca between yesterday and this 
		morning?

				OLD MAN
		How many times do I have to tell you, Marshal, 
		that I was at Panarea.

				MARSHAL
		I believe you, I believe you... But I'm also 
		certain that you're hiding something from me. I 
		can see it written all over your face... And 
		you know that I have never liked your face. And 
		if you want to know something, that gentleman 
		over there...
			(indicating Anna's father)
		...who's a very important person... doesn't 
		like it either. So, just keep that in mind. 
		I'll talk to you later.
 
The Marshal moves away from the old man and goes over towards Anna's father 
who is watching the helicopter come down.
 
				ANNA'S FATHER  
		I presume by this method that you'll be able to 
		uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or 
		an article of clothing... In other words, 
		something which your men have not been able to 
		find as yet. 

				MARSHAL
		Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging 
		to the girl who has run away is still here on 
		this island...

				ANNA'S FATHER  
			(resentfully)
		Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not 
		a fugitive.

				MARSHAL
		I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that 
		way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...

				ANNA'S FATHER  
		I understand very well. Only I don't want any 
		rash assumptions to be made.
 
One of the carabinieri appears with Anna's valise which he sets down on the 
ground.
 
				MARSHAL
		Here's her valise, sir.
 
The helicopter is now a few feet above the ground, and everyone steps aside 
to allow it room to land. The rush of wind from the propeller sends up a 
cloud of dust, and finally the helicopter touches down. The propeller stops, 
the door opens, and out comes two large bloodhounds accompanied by a police 
attendant. He immediately says something to the dogs in German which suddenly 
creates an atmosphere of resentment among the group assembled there.

Anna's father goes to his daughter's valise, bends down, but doesn't dare to 
touch it.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Do you want me to open it? 

				ANNA'S FATHER  
		Yes, please.
 
Claudia opens the valise and starts pulling out several dresses, a few 
intimate garments, and several other items of clothing. As she continues 
rummaging, she suddenly comes upon two books, Fitzgerald's Tender Is The 
Night and a copy of the Bible, which she hands to Anna's father who, in turn, 
examines them with great care and deliberation.
 
				ANNA'S FATHER  
		This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you 
		think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who 
		reads the Bible could not have committed an act 
		of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I 
		remember when I was in China, many years ago, I 
		happened to be involved in a similar situation, 
		concerning an English woman, the wife of 
		Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. 
		There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at 
		the time that whatever had happened, that clue 
		alone had definitely ruled out the possibility 
		of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said, 
		that whoever reads the Bible believes in God 
		and therefore...
			(then, turning to Claudia in an 
			 almost supplicating tone of voice) 
		No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of 
		fact, I was right... The woman was found two 
		days later. It was a case of amnesia.

				MARSHAL
		Sir, if you have no objections, may we start 
		the search?
 
Anna's father turns around to look at the bloodhounds who are already 
sniffing the air for a scent and anxious to get on with the hunt. Then he 
throws a quick glance at his daughter's valise once more, and with an air of 
disgust and irritation, walks off in a huff, followed by Claudia.
 

				ATTENDANT
			(to the Marshal)
		Get everybody out of the way...

				MARSHAL
		Okay. I'll send them down to that part of the 
		beach over there...
 
After they all have left the area, the attendant leads the two bloodhounds 
over to Anna's valise, instructs them to pick up the scent, then takes them 
up to the very top of the island, where he subsequently unties them from his 
leash and sets them off.

Claudia and Anna's father arrive on the beach where Patrizia, Giulia, 
Corrado, Raimondo and one of the sailors are seated on a pile of rocks.

As the dogs begin running in different directions over the island, trying to 
track down the scent from Anna's valise, the entire group remains silent, 
awaiting the outcome of the search. Suddenly, the bloodhounds come racing 
down the slope, heading directly towards the beach where they are gathered, 
apparently hot on the trail of some familiar scent. To everybody's amazement, 
the dogs stop in front of Claudia, jumping excitedly and barking at her as 
though they had found their prey. Claudia is nonplussed and almost petrified 
with fear. She turns around and sees the others all staring at her. But she 
cannot understand why they are looking at her that way nor why the dogs have 
stopped right in front of her. Then, as if struck by a sudden flash of 
memory, she touches her dress and cries out:
 
				CLAUDIA 
		It's because of this... The dress... It's 
		because of this dress. Anna gave it to me 
		yesterday, right after the swim.
 
Completely relieved, Claudia smiles and bends over to pet the dogs, as the 
attendant comes up to them and ties the leash back on to their necks. Then he 
leads them away and heads once again upthe slope towards the top of the 
island. Anna's father seems almost disillusioned by the negative results of 
the search. Corrado also feels dissatisfied, and addressing himself to the 
Marshal, says:
 
				CORRADO 
		And what are we going to do now? 

				MARSHAL
		We'll try again.

				PATRIZIA 
		But is it really necessary? Those two 
		beasts... How absurd!
 
Meanwhile, the patrol boat has returned and is pulling ashore. Giulia is the 
first one to notice its arrival and she calls out to the others that Sandro 
is back. Then she goes over to where Anna's father is standing.
 
				GIULIA 
		Sandro's here.

				ANNA'S FATHER 
			(coldly)
		I don't know him. 

				GIULIA 
		It seems to me that at a moment like this... 

				ANNA'S FATHER  
		I don't want to know him.
  
By this time, Sandro has come ashore, followed by the carabiniere, and 
immediately goes up to Claudia.
 
				SANDRO 
		Claudia, listen ... Claudia.
 
But Claudia hardly looks at him, and seeing Corrado approaching, she moves 
away from Sandro. 

				CORRADO 
			(to Sandro)
		I didn't think you'd be back so early.

				CARABINIERE
			(interrupting)
		We didn't check the other islands, so...

				CORRADO 
		And why didn't you go there?

				CARABINIERE
			(referring to Sandro)
		He wanted to come back.
 
The sailors have unloaded the crate of cigarettes from the patrol boat and 
the Marshal is getting all the details from the carabiniere.
 
				MARSHAL
		Up until now those smugglers were operating 
		only around the Palermo area. This will be a 
		nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... 
		Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and 
		have them give you instructions on what to do 
		with this crate.

				CORRADO 
		So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might 
		have also been that of these smugglers. Could it 
		be possible, then, that Anna...?

				MARSHAL
			(evading Corrado's question 
			 and pursuing his own thoughts)
		I wonder where they could have unloaded the 
		stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca. 

				CORRADO 
		I was saying... it might even be possible that 
		Anna had left with them.

				MARSHAL
		But for what reason would she have wanted to go 
		away?

				CORRADO 
		Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons 
		for going away, anyone of us might have three 
		thousand of them. So you can assume that she 
		had them. What I want to know, is it possible 
		that the smugglers might have taken her aboard? 

				MARSHAL
		I think it's possible.

				A SAILOR 
			(calling from the patrol boat)
		Marshal!... Headquarters is calling. They have 
		an important message.
 
				MARSHAL
		What is it about?

				SAILOR 
		They've stopped a suspicious-looking boat a 
		few miles from here... yesterday afternoon. The 
		crew has been taken to Milazzo for questioning.
 
The Marshal takes off for the patrol boat, and Corrado goes over to Anna's 
father.
 
				CORRADO 
		Did you hear that? What do you plan on doing?

				ANNA'S FATHER 
			(resignedly) 
		We are in the hands of God. 

				SANDRO 
		That's true...But in the meantime, as far as 
		I'm concerned, it's absolutely necessary to go 
		to Milazzo. 
			(directly to Anna's father)
		I know that you have no desire to meet me, and 
		I shall take pains not to impose myself upon 
		you. But, besides you, I am the closest person 
		to your daughter...

				ANNA'S FATHER  
		However that may be, at this moment my daughter 
		has more need of her father than of you. 

				SANDRO 
		Pardon me for being so frank, but there are 
		certain things that a father -- especially a 
		father like you --cannot understand. So don't 
		be stubborn. I'm coming with you.
 
As soon as he finishes saying this, Sandro turns around and looks at Claudia, 
as though he had just now realized that she was there listening to him. 
Claudia goes to the gangplank and boards the yacht, disappearing into the 
cabin. Having followed her with his gaze, Sandro then turns to Patrizia.
 
				SANDRO 
		Patrizia, what are you going to do? 

				PATRIZIA 
		What do you want us to do? I don't know 
		myself... But we'll do something. 

				SANDRO 
		I'll go and get my valise.
 
Sandro goes aboard the yacht and enters the cabin. On the way to his room he 
meets Claudia who has just changed clothes and is about to return ashore. 
They stare at each other for a moment without saying anything. But the 
intensity in Claudia's look, mixed with fear and desire, is so overpowering 
that Sandro takes her in his arms and kisses her. Claudia immediately 
releases herself from his embrace, but for the moment it lasted, the kiss was 
full and  passionate.  Then she turns and goes out on deck. Sandro remains 
there, momentarily stunned, then picks up his valise and returns ashore.

As Claudia, followed by Sandro, steps back on the beach, she is met by 
Patrizia.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In 
		fact, Ettore should already be there.

				SANDRO 
 			(intervening)
		Good. Then I'll meet you there.
 
He says this primarily for Claudia's sake, hoping to catch her eye. But she 
keeps her head bowed low, and doesn't look up. After a moment of hesitation, 
Sandro turns away and heads towards the small motorboat in which Anna's 
father arrived from the mainland. And without saying another word, he climbs 
aboard. Patrizia places her arm around Claudia's waist and together they 
start walking towards the yacht. But upon reaching the foot of the gangplank, 
Claudia stops.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour 
		around the islands. 

				PATRIZIA 
		To do what?

				CLAUDIA 
		I just can't leave without first searching 
		those islands, one by one.

				PATRIZIA 
		But aren't you tired? I can just about manage 
		to stand on my feet! 
			(then turning around to look 
			 for Raimondo, she calls out) 
		Raimondo! 

				RAIMONDO 
		Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here. 

				PATRIZIA 
		Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please 
		take care of her luggage? Thanks.
 
Raimondo goes aboard the yacht and returns with Claudia's valise. He consigns 
it to one of the carabinieri who, in turn, takes it aboard the patrol boat. 
Claudia follows him aboard. The Marshal comes out of the radio room, steps 
ashore, then joins Sandro and Anna's father on the motorboat, while Patrizia, 
Giulia, Corrado and Raimondo go aboard the yacht.


 
***
In the seaport town of Milazzo, on the Sicilian mainland, Sandro and Anna's 
father are seated in an office at police headquarters.  The sailors picked up 
on a charge of carrying contraband are being questioned by the police 
Lieutenant.
 
				SAILOR 
		No, sir, Lieutenant, we weren't even able to 
		drop anchor once ... the sea was too rough.
 
The Lieutenant motions for the sailor to come up to the desk, then points to 
a sheet of paper in front of him.
 
				LIEUTENANT
		Okay. Just sign here. 
			(turning to a guard 
			 standing at the door) 
		Have the next one come in. He's the last, 
		isn't he?
 
Another sailor enters and timidly approaches the Lieutenant's desk. He is 
rather young, and his face is completely bronzed by the sun.
  
				LIEUTENANT
		They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. 
		Is that right?
 
				YOUNG SAILOR 
		Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my 
		father, too.

				LIEUTENANT
		So that's why you've turned to smuggling, eh? 
		You need the money. Now, I can help you. I can 
		see that you get some assistance from the 
		government. But first there's a little 
		formality we've got to take care of. Just a 
		few questions and then we can all go to 
		lunch... Your friend tells me you dropped 
		anchor three times...
 
The sailor starts, as though taken by surprise, then quickly answers.
 
				YOUNG SAILOR 
		Yes, sir. Three times.

				LIEUTENANT
			(to Sandro and Anna's father)
		Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning 
		to contradict each other. 
			(then, facing the sailor again) 
		Now look here, your friend just swore to me 
		that you weren't able to do any fishing at all 
		because the sea was too rough... And what about 
		the other boat? 

				YOUNG SAILOR 
		What other boat?

				LIEUTENANT
		Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you 
		men throwing those crates overboard. What have 
		you got to say about that?

				YOUNG SAILOR 
			(stuttering) 
		I ... I ... wasn't feeling well ... I.. I was 
		sleeping... I don't know anything ... I ... 
		I'm all mixed up and ...
 
Sandro is unable to control himself any longer. He gets up, walks over to the 
sailor and yells in his face.
 
				SANDRO 
		But what are you saying?... What are you 
		saying?
 
The Lieutenant motions to Sandro to be quiet, then calmly rises from his desk 
and continues.
 
				LIEUTENANT
		Now look here, I'm ready to forget the whole 
		thing: the cigarettes, the contraband --
		everything. If you would only tell me... you or 
		your friends... whether the girl was aboard 
		your boat and how far she went.
 
They all remain silent. The Lieutenant motions to the guard who then leads 
the sailors out of the office.
 
				LIEUTENANT
			(to Anna's father)
		Just as I thought. Even if you caught them in 
		the act, they'd deny it. They always deny 
		everything. And then, in this case, if they 
		were to admit having had the girl aboard, it 
		would mean they'd be admitting to the charge 
		of carrying contraband. Oh, it's easy to say: 
		talk! But if they did talk, the following 
		morning you'd find them cold dead in front of 
		their doorstep.

				ANNA'S FATHER  
		I think it would be worth my while to take a 
		run over to Palermo. The Chief of Police there 
		is a very good friend of mine and I'm sure 
		he'll do whatever he can. I feel we're wasting 
		our time here... Excuse me, Lieutenant. I hope 
		we see each other again under better 
		circumstances. And thanks for everything.
 
Bidding goodbye to the Lieutenant, Anna's father leaves, without looking at 
Sandro. A moment later, Sandro folds the newspaper he was reading, tucks it 
under his arm, and starts heading towards the door.
 
				LIEUTENANT
		At any rate, we'll continue investigating. I 
		know that headquarters has sent out an alarm to 
		all areas...

				SANDRO
			(showing the newspaper 
			 to the Lieutenant)
		Tell me, Lieutenant, do you happen to know this 
		F.Z. who wrote this article here?
 
The Lieutenant takes a look at the paper which carries a two-column story 
headed: DISAPPEARANCE OF A ROMAN TOURIST AT LISCA BIANCA.
 
				LIEUTENANT
		That's Francesco Zuria. He's the news 
		correspondent.

				SANDRO 
		Where can we locate him? Don't you think that 
		by offering a reward to anyone who can give us 
		some information...


				LIEUTENANT
		Zuria is in Messina. You might try him. Shall 
		we phone him?
 
From the opposite end of the corridor through which Sandro and the Lieutenant 
are walking, appears the Sergeant who was in charge of the patrol boat on 
which Claudia toured the islands in search of Anna. After saluting his 
superior, the Sergeant says:
 
				SERGEANT
		Have you any instructions for me, Lieutenant? 
		May I return to Lipari?

				LIEUTENANT
		Yes. With whom did you leave the crate of 
		cigarettes?

				SERGEANT
		I left it at the warehouse.
 
The Sergeant again salutes his superior, then continues on his way along the 
corridor. Sandro abruptly turns around and follows after him.
 
				SANDRO 
		Pardon me, Sergeant, but when did you get back?

				SERGEANT
		About two hours ago.

				SANDRO 
		And the young lady who was with you? 

				SERGEANT
		I don't know... She said she had to catch a 
		train.
 
Sandro remains a while, absorbed in his thoughts, then hurriedly leaves the 
building, and heads towards the station.
 


***
On her way to the waiting room of the station, Claudia purchases a newspaper, 
then goes over to an empty bench and sits down. Turning to the local news 
section, she suddenly comes upon the article announcing Anna's disappearance.

A moment later, Sandro appears at the door. Claudia looks up at him but 
doesn't say a word. He walks over and sits down beside her.
 
				SANDRO 
		Where are you going?... To Montaldo's? 

				CLAUDIA 
		Yes.

				SANDRO 
		Then I'll go with you.
 
There is a moment of silence, then Claudia shows him the newspaper article.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone 
		with information to get in touch with them. 

				SANDRO 
		Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk 
		with them...

				CLAUDIA 
		Yes, you should go. 

				SANDRO 
		But then when will we see each other?
 
Claudia looks at him imploringly, intent on making him understand, without 
having to tell him outright, that it is not a question of their seeing each 
other. Sandro, of course, does realize and suddenly springs to his feet and 
nervously begins pacing back and forth across the waiting room. Claudia, in 
turn, also rises and goes over to him.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		I know it's difficult. But if you go on like 
		this it will become even more difficult.
 
The bell announcing the train's arrival is sounded. Sandro turns around and 
faces Claudia, almost with a sense of helpless despair.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Please, don't look so solemn... And don't wait 
		for the train to come in.
 
But Sandro doesn't move. And again Claudia insists, imploring him not to 
stay, although she realizes full well that this may mean a final goodbye.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Please, please leave. I don't want to look out 
		of the window and wave to you with a 
		handkerchief.
 
Sandro still doesn't move, and is about to say something, but Claudia looks 
at him so pleadingly and with such a determined expression, that he finally 
succumbs and starts walking towards the exit behind the train tracks.

The train has just pulled into the station. The platform is completely empty 
and Claudia is the only one to board the train. She climbs up the steps and 
the door is closed behind her. A second later, she appears at the window, 
looks out briefly, then disappears into her compartment. The station master 
raises the signal for the engine to start, a short whistle is heard, and soon 
the train gets under way.

Sandro dashes out across the tracks, swings open one of the doors, and boards 
the train as it picks up speed and pulls away from the station.

Claudia is seated in a corner near the window, looking out. She appears 
completely relaxed and totally drained of energy, fatigued after so much 
tension. After a few seconds, she turns around and is abruptly startled to 
see Sandro standing nearby in the corridor. He comes over to her compartment 
and takes a seat directly opposite to hers. Claudia is absolutely furious.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Go ahead, now say something! I want to know 
		just what it is we have to say to each other.
 
Sandro remains silent, waiting for Claudia to settle down and calm herself. 
But she continues to reproach him.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I 
		don't want to see you... How can I make it 
		clear to you?...Why did you come?

				SANDRO 
		I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		But sooner or later we've got to end this 
		relationship. And it's better to do it right 
		now. 

				SANDRO 
		I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's 
		idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For 
		whom? If Anna were here I might understand your 
		scruples. But she's not...

				CLAUDIA 
			(deeply wounded)
		Oh, Sandro... 

				SANDRO 
		I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But 
		isn't it better to look things squarely in the 
		eye?

				CLAUDIA 
		For me they are exactly as they were when we 
		met three days ago -- just three days ago...
		don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I 
		guess they aren't like that any more. My God, 
		is it possible to forget in such a short time, 
		for things to change so quickly? 

				SANDRO 
		It takes even less.

				CLAUDIA 
		But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used 
		to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I 
		have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, 
		why don't you help me? 

				SANDRO 
		I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, 
		is for us to be together.

				CLAUDIA 
		No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's 
		make believe nothing happened. And when we get 
		to the next station, get off. 

				SANDRO 
		And what about you?

				CLAUDIA 
		Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
 
Suddenly, she stands up and goes into the corridor. The car is of an old type 
-- one half is first class, the other second. Claudia stops in front of a 
second-class compartment from which the sound of two voices is heard. One is 
that of a woman -- sweet, very delicate and very feminine; the other is that 
of a man with a Sicilian accent. Sandro joins Claudia. Standing there 
together they hear the conversation.
 
				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		I work there but I'm really a stranger. 

				MAN'S VOICE  
		I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you 
		and she has often spoken to me about you.

				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
 
				MAN'S VOICE  
		Yes, she takes care of the garden. 

				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the 
		villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener. 

				MAN'S VOICE  
		So? That's logical. You see, both being 
		gardeners, they spoke about you to one another. 

				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		And what did they say about me? 

				MAN'S VOICE  
		They told me that you were a very nice girl, 
		that you always mind your business... In other 
		words, things of that sort.
 
There is a moment of silence. Then, the sound of music is heard coming from 
the compartment. Claudia and Sandro look at one another with a smile on their 
faces. Then Claudia leans over to peek into the compartment. The woman is 
young; she has thick, wavy brown hair.  He is one of those typical seducers 
from the provinces, with black hair. There is a tiny radio between them. 
Sandro also takes a peek into the compartment. Then they withdraw as the two 
resume their conversation.
 
				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		We have a radio like this, too. 

				MAN'S VOICE  
		No, not like this one.

				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		And why wouldn't we have one like this?

				MAN'S VOICE  
		Because this is a Chinese radio.
 
Another pause. Sandro takes hold of Claudia's hand and presses it. She 
doesn't resist, but allows him to do it.
 
				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		Certainly a radio this small is very practical. 
		It's especially useful for... I don't know... 
		for traveling.

				MAN'S VOICE  
		But for you, what comes first: music or love?
 
Claudia presses up close to Sandro, amused and, at the same time, obviously 
moved.
 
				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has 
		to look around, but to get a radio, all you 
		have to do is buy one.

				MAN'S VOICE  
		Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man, 
		and I know what's what: first love, and then 
		music.
 
Claudia laughs but she is still very upset. All of a sudden, she starts and 
looks out the little window. The train is coming into a station and is 
beginning to slow down. Claudia grabs Sandro by the sleeve and pulls him 
through the corridor. Sandro tries to resist.
 
				SANDRO 
		Claudia, listen to me...

				CLAUDIA 
		No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
 
She continues to drag him through the corridor, until they finally reach the 
platform. Then she opens the door. They are both highly emotional. Claudia is 
almost hysterical.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Promise that you won't try to look for me... 
		you shouldn't try to look for me any more... 

				SANDRO 
		But why, Claudia?... Why?
 
Sandro tries to grab her in his arms, but Claudia pushes him away, almost 
with a sense of violence, as though she were afraid she might change her mind 
once in his arms. In the meantime, the train has come to a stop in the 
station. Sandro pauses to look at Claudia once more.
 
				SANDRO 
		Even if you chase me away, I... Claudia, let's 
		not wait any longer... After, it will be too 
		late ... Come with me.
 
Claudia is visibly battling with herself. Then, in one last moment of 
decision, she pushes Sandro towards the door and goes back into the car.
 
Once on the ground, Sandro walks back and forth along the platform to see if 
he can find Claudia, hoping she might look out the window to wave goodbye. 
But she doesn't appear. The train starts to move, as Sandro desperately tries 
to catch a glimpse of Claudia. But she is not to be seen. Sandro starts 
running along the platform, but the train is now going too fast. He stops -- 
angry, disappointed and upset.
 


***
At the entrance-way of a luxurious villa, Claudia, who has just arrived, is 
greeted by the Princess. She is an elderly woman, rather ordinary in 
appearance but very aristocratic in taste and manner.
 
				PRINCESS  
		Did you have a good trip? It is such a 
		magnificent day! I am very happy that Sicily is 
		able to give you so warm a welcome. And you do 
		deserve it. You're such a lovely blonde. Come, 
		my dear.
 
Claudia smiles, and follows the Princess into the garden.
 
				PRINCESS  
		And where are you from? 

				CLAUDIA 
		From Rome.

				PRINCESS
		Oh, how nice! So, you're from Rome... And would 
		you happen to know of some intelligent 
		clergyman in Rome who might be willing to come 
		here and stay with us? We have our own private 
		little chapel... It is a masterpiece, with 
		seventeenth-century frescoes... and the 
		remains of all our dead ancestors, a wonderful 
		collection... He would find it very convenient 
		there, and could say his own masses. Then he 
		would have to spend a little time with my 
		husband, who never sees anyone, to keep him 
		occupied.

				CLAUDIA 
		An intelligent clergyman, Princess? But I 
		think the intelligent clergymen of today have 
		so many other things to do.

				PRINCESS 
		Well, perhaps one with a little physical 
		handicap. One who is slightly lame, for 
		example.
 
In the meantime, they have arrived at a shady alcove where, seated in various 
wicker lounge chairs, are Patrizia, Giulia and a young man dressed in simple, 
casual clothes. The first one to notice Claudia and to greet her with warm 
cordiality, is Giulia.
 
				GIULIA 
		Well, finally! We were beginning to get worried 
		about you, too.
 
Claudia plunks herself down in one of the lounge chairs next to Patrizia. The 
young man rises and bows slightly.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		But where did you finally end up? 

				CLAUDIA 
		It was futile. We went all over.
 
There is a moment of silence; the thought of Anna returns to weigh on the 
group. Claudia pours herself an orange drink from a pitcher on the table 
beside her.
 
				CLAUDIA 
			(referring to Anna) 
		But why does she do these things? 
			(she takes a sip from 
			 her glass, then rises) 
		I can't stand it any more.
 
She takes a few steps, looks around at the villa, and at the other end of the 
alcove sees Corrado and Ettore saying goodbye to a pair of elderly gentlemen.
 
				GIULIA 
			(to Corrado and Ettore)
		But how can you carry on a discussion in this 
		heat?

				CORRADO 
		When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is 
		affected only by the cold.

				ETTORE
			(noticing Claudia)
		And who is this? 

				PATRIZIA 
		This is Claudia, Anna's friend...
			(to Claudia) 
		You've never met my husband, have you?
 
Ettore immediately recalls Claudia's name from a previous conversation that 
was apparently held before she arrived.
 
				ETTORE  
		By the way, have you phoned him?
 
				CORRADO 
		You mean Sandro? I told you already. He's not 
		in. At least he's not at the hotel.

				ETTORE  
		Now look what has to go and happen... At a time 
		when I'll be needing him. How can we discuss 
		things when we lack dates and figures?... 

				PATRIZIA 
		But didn't he say he was coming here...
 
Now, with all this talk about Sandro, the sense of relaxation Claudia had 
felt upon her arrival, has changed into a feeling of anxiety that becomes 
more and more noticeable.

				ETTORE  
		Well, what are you all waiting for? Send a car 
		out to get him. He can't be more than a couple 
		of hundred miles away...

				GIULIA 
		To me, the fact that hasn't shown up is a good 
		sign. Do you want to bet that he's found Anna? 

				ETTORE  
		Maybe. But do you know that forty thousand 
		persons a year disappear in Italy without 
		leaving a single trace behind them. Forty 
		thousand! Almost as much as the entire 
		population of San Siro... Raimondo, will you go 
		and see if you can locate Sandro? 

				RAIMONDO 
		Okay.
 
A gong announcing lunch resounds throughout the garden.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		First let the poor thing have something to eat. 

				ETTORE  
		It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a 
		meal.

				PRINCESS  
		I've never met this Sandro. What kind of a 
		person is he?... He couldn't have done her in 
		himself, by any chance?

				ETTORE
			(breaking out into a loud laugh)
		Sandro?... Oh, sure... I can see Sandro calling
		Anna over to him and saying: Listen, Anna, I 
		intend to get rid of you, but since it's so 
		painful and complicated... and besides, I 
		don't happen to have a gun on me... why don't 
		you do me a favor and get rid of yourself on 
		your own...
 
There is a moment of complete, dead silence, during which the same disturbing 
thought flashes across the minds of all those who are present like a sudden 
revelation.
 
				GIULIA 
		My God, how could we joke over something like 
		that! We should be ashamed of ourselves. 

				PRINCESS 
			(rising)
		Come on, let's go.
 
They all get up except Claudia. She is left so completely shaken by the 
conversation, by the thought, that it seems she no longer has the strength to 
move. Giulia, after giving Corrado a defiant look, turns and smiles at the 
young man who had stopped to wait for her.
 
				GIULIA
			(to Claudia, referring 
			 to the young man)
		Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's 
		eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do 
		you know -- he paints. 

				GOFFREDO 
		Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you 
		need is to buy some oils and start painting. 
		Even Rembrandt did the same.
 
Giulia laughs with a strange sense of excitement, then takes Goffredo by the 
arm and leaves. Claudia remains alone. She watches the group heading towards 
the house,  Giulia holding tight to  Goffredo, Ettore  to Patrizia. Their 
voices are heard, somewhat unclear.
 
				ETTORE  
		But... where is the Prince?... Is he well? 

				PRINCESS  
		The last time I saw him, the day before 
		yesterday, it seemed he was well.

				ETTORE  
		Princess, why don't you sell this villa? I 
		would turn it into a lovely psychiatric clinic. 

				PRINCESS  
		It's a little like that already.

Finally, even Claudia starts moving, slowly, behind the others; but she is 
still very much upset.
 


***
A crowd of people that keeps growing and growing from one moment to the next, 
is gathered in one of the main streets of Messina, in front of a men's store 
with its shutters half-shut. The local police are unable to control the flow 
of traffic, which has been blocked as a result of the crowd. The cars are 
packed close to one another, raising a great din with their horns. The throng 
is composed chiefly of young men pushing and climbing over each other to get 
near the shop to see inside. Sandro tries to make his way through the crowd 
in an attempt to get up close himself, but the confusion is so great that he 
finds the going very difficult. Remarks and comments are heard above the 
noise.
 
				FIRST YOUNG MAN
		Who is it, Sophia Loren? 

				SECOND YOUNG MAN
		Oh, no! It's some model from Turin with a 
		low-cut dress.

				OTHER VOICES
		It's Queen Saroya... I saw her... So, who 
		could it be?

				THIRD YOUNG MAN
		They've torn her dress... She's almost nude... 
		She ran into the shop to hide herself...
 
A police siren is heard from afar, then before long it fills the air and 
dominates every other sound.  An Alfa Romeo pulls up, followed by a police 
wagon full of policemen. Both vehicles maneuver their way through the crowd 
like snakes through a jungle, and stop right in front of the shop. Sandro 
takes advantage of the opening created by the two cars and thus finds himself 
a few steps away from the door. Bending over in order to see through the 
small space left open by the half-drawn shutters, he notices several 
newspapermen and photographers.
 
				SANDRO
			(to one of the newspapermen) 
		Which one of you is Zuria?

				NEWSPAPERMAN
		He's inside.
 
Meanwhile, the policemen have come out of the wagon and arrive at the door of 
the shop, with the Chief of Police leading the way. One of them raises the 
shutter, and the crowd, which has backed away slightly at the insistence of 
the police, begins pressing forward threateningly. Soon pandemonium breaks 
loose. In the confusion, Sandro manages to get inside the store along with 
the policemen and two photographers. The shutter is again lowered, just a few 
inches behind him.
 
Standing in the middle of the shop is a most charming and provocative young 
brunette with tight-fitting pants and a blouse that is open almost from the 
neck to the waist. She is wearing nothing under her blouse, so that with 
every movement of her body, one cannot help catching a glimpse of her naked 
breasts. As the policemen come forward, she receives them with a smile. 
Sandro asks one of the journalists standing nearby if he can tell him which 
one of them is Zuria.  The journalist points to a man who is only a few steps 
away -- a man not very old but who has a ravaged face, and whose hair is 
almost completely white.
 
				SANDRO 
		Zuria?

				ZURIA  
		Yes. Until proven otherwise. 

				SANDRO 
		I would like to ask you something. 

				ZURIA  
		Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
 
Everybody is gathered around the Chief of Police and the girl. The store 
clerks are looking at her admiringly. The manager, most upset, is explaining 
the situation to the Chief of Police.
 
				MANAGER
		I phoned you, Chief, because, in view of the 
		situation... I thought it best...
 
The girl interrupts him. She has a very self-satisfied look on her face.
 
				GIRL
		I came down here to buy a foulard... Suddenly 
		I realized that little by little, directly 
		behind me, I was being followed by so many 
		men, and more and more of them kept coming.
 
				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Well, I should think so... Dressed like that.

				GIRL
		But I have always gone around like this, 
		everywhere in the world. Nothing like this has 
		ever happened to me before.
 
Zuria turns to Sandro and clears his throat. Outside, the crowd becomes very 
noisy.
 
				ZURIA
			(to the girl) 
		How old are you?

				GIRL
		Nineteen. My name is Gloria Perkins. I'm 
		married and a writer by profession. I write in 
		a trance, almost always in contact with people 
		who are dead. Tolstoi, for example, or 
		Shakespeare. But the movies also interest me.
 
Zuria nods to Sandro as if to say: now watch this.
 
				ZURIA  
		How do you find the men of Messina? Are you 
		shocked by their warm display of friendliness? 

				GIRL
		No, why should I be shocked? We're in Italy, 
		not Finland.

				ZURIA  
		And how were you received in Palermo?
 
The girl turns around and looks down at Zuria with contempt, but she manages 
to remain calm.
 
				GIRL
		In Palermo I was with my husband. Now I'm 
		going to Capri to write an article for the 
		Tourist Office.
 
Zuria clears his throat again and whispers to Sandro.
 
				ZURIA  
		She did exactly the same thing in Palermo. 

				CHIEF OF POLICE
			(to the girl) 
		If you want to go back to your hotel... we're 
		ready to escort you.                   

				GIRL
		Oh, yes, thank you... 
 
Photographer snaps a flash photo. The girl immediately strikes a pose. Other 
flashes follow. The clerks ask for her autograph. One of the policemen raises 
the shutter; the girl comes forward smiling, and is greeted with a certain 
kind of roar from the crowd. The group leaves the shop. Sandro and Zuria also 
come out. The girl, ushered out by the policemen, climbs into the Alfa Romeo. 
The guard holds the crowd back. There are more camera flashes. More smiles 
from the pretty stranger. Finally the car pulls out, followed by the police 
wagon. Sandro and Zuria watch the car disappear through the crowd, which 
starts to disperse. The din, however, is still enormous, due to the 
unsnarling of the traffic jam.
 
				ZURIA  
		Do you like her?
 
Sandro shrugs his shoulders, somewhat surprised by the journalist's question.
 
				ZURIA  
		She costs a hundred thousand lire. 

				SANDRO 
		You're kidding!

				ZURIA  
		No, I'm not. Why do you think she does all 
		this? It's one of the many ways she can put 
		herself on display. When you bait the trap, the 
		mouse will snap. To tell you the truth,  if it 
		wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand 
		lire represents my whole month's salary, well...
		But you had something you wanted to ask me?
 
Sandro is still looking at the journalist with a sense of incredulity, almost 
as if he felt Zuria's conversation was something out of this world. But he is 
brought back to reality by Zuria's last remark, which is made as the 
journalist starts walking at a very hurried pace.
 
				SANDRO 
		I read one of your articles regarding the 
		disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc.

				ZURIA  
		Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to 
		write a story about this thing that just 
		happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned 
		out.

				SANDRO 
			(impatiently)
		Now listen, if I had any information, I 
		wouldn't have come here to ask you. But I see 
		that you, too, lack any information ...
 
The journalist casts a sidewards glance at Sandro. He is a bitter and 
sarcastic man, one who is completely absorbed with his own little problems 
and his own daily routine. But for this very reason he is quite capable of 
taking any kind of insult, either big or small.
 
				ZURIA  
		As a matter of fact, I've already had several 
		phone calls on that article. One said they had 
		seen the missing girl in an automobile 
		somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw 
		her on the pier talking with some strange 
		sailors... Could be she secretly left the 
		island by boat...
 
				SANDRO 
		Is that possible?

				ZURIA  
		Who knows?... Another one has it that she 
		entered a store in Troina. This information 
		comes from the storekeeper himself who stated 
		that such and such a girl had bought I don't 
		know what in his store... at Troina.

				SANDRO 
		Is that far from here?

				ZURIA  
		About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give 
		you the name of the storekeeper.
 
				SANDRO 
		Yes... of course... But you should also print 
		that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow 
		morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't 
		it?... I mean, it's widely read...

				ZURIA  
		Yes, but why do you think our readers would be
		interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, 
		the editors wouldn't print it.

				SANDRO 
		You really must do me this one favor. 

				ZURIA  
		Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor? 
			
				SANDRO 
		Then let's call it a business proposition. 
		Something to round out your salary.
 
The journalist clears his throat without answering. Then he grabs Sandro by 
the arm and takes him back to the other side of the street where a few 
people, left over from the crowd, are still discussing the incident that just 
took place as they gradually drift away from the scene. The traffic is now 
back to normal.
 


***
At the Princess' villa, Claudia is in her room, applying some fresh make-up 
in front of a small dressing table. Although she appears thoroughly engrossed 
in all the minute details of her make-up, nevertheless, she seems 
considerably  interested in any sound that comes through her window.

The rumble of a motor is heard. Claudia runs to the window and looks out into 
the garden. A dark car pulls up in front of the service entrance. A uniformed 
chauffeur gets out of the car and enters the house carrying a package under 
his arm. There is an obvious look of disappointment on Claudia's face. She is 
about to return to the dressing table when she notices, there in the garden, 
Giulia heading towards the house accompanied by the young Prince, Goffredo. 
Claudia is profoundly shocked by Giulia's behavior as she laughs, jokes, 
bends over to pick up some flowers, and skips along unashamedly.

In the meantime, Patrizia has entered the room with two wigs, one of which 
she is wearing and the other in her hand. She also has on a cocktail dress, 
but one that is more elaborate than Claudia's. Patrizia immediately goes up 
to the mirror of the dressing table and, while she finishes arranging the wig 
on her head, says to her friend:
 
				PATRIZIA 
		Are you ready? I'm not. That's all we needed -- 
		a cocktail party... The vitality some people 
		have irritates me! 
			(indicating the wig on her head)
		How does it look?
 
Claudia, who has meanwhile tried on the other wig and is looking at herself 
in the mirror, turns around to Patrizia.
 
				CLAUDIA
			(ironically)
		It's divine! 

				PATRIZIA 
		You say that just to flatter me. 

				CLAUDIA 
		Do you consider that a compliment? 

				PATRIZIA 
		No.
 
The two of them burst out laughing and together they leave the room. Then 
after a few steps through the corridor, they separate with a friendly gesture 
towards each other. Patrizia goes into her room while Claudia prepares to 
descend the wide stairway. Coming up the same stairway are Giulia and the 
young Prince, Goffredo.  There is something of an embarrassing moment between 
them. Then Giulia, aware of Claudia's presence, detaches herself from 
Goffredo and, as they reach the top of the stairs, she comes over to Claudia 
and takes her by the wrist in order to confide with her more intimately.
 
				GIULIA 
		He wants to show me his paintings. He won't 
		let go  of me  anymore.  Poor thing, he must 
		have a crush on me...
 
She laughs with an obvious sense of amusement, but she is also tickled by her 
own vanity. Claudia looks at her without knowing what to say to her.
 
				GIULIA 
			(even more excited)
		Please, you come too... 

				CLAUDIA 
		But for what reason should I come there? 

				GIULIA 
		Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with 
		him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have 
		you noticed his eyes?
 
Claudia resigns herself to escorting Giulia to the floor up above. The very 
top of the stairway leads to an attic, where Goffredo is leaning over the 
railing, looking down.
 
				GOFFREDO  
		Giulia... 

				GIULIA 
		Here I am.
 
Seeing the two of them arriving together, the young Prince feels 
disappointed. But he knows he has to cover his intentions with a show of good 
manners. When the two women reach the top of the stairs, he bows to Claudia 
in a most respectful fashion. Then he leads them down a low and narrow 
corridor to a door they pass through.
 
The attic is bright and spacious, with slanted roof, and two huge windows. It 
is filled with paintings, easels, canvases, brushes and oils. As soon as 
Giulia enters the studio, she moves away from Claudia and attaches herself to 
the young Prince who is setting up one of his paintings on an easel beside 
one of the windows. Claudia looks around the room with a sense of 
indifference. Going over to the window, she looks out and sees a vast 
panorama of the countryside. 

Giulia looks at the painting with a certain amount of surprise. It is a 
picture of a nude woman; a shapely figure, slightly plump, in the manner of 
Renoir.
 
				GIULIA 
		Claudia, come and see. It's a nude.
 
Claudia is looking through the paintings that lean up against the wall face 
backwards. She turns one around: a nude woman. A second: another nude woman. 
A third: the same.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken. 

				GIULIA 
			(to Goffredo)
		But why all nudes?

				GOFFREDO  
		Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a 
		woman.

				GIULIA 
		And where do you find the models? 

				GOFFREDO  
		Oh, there are as many as one wants. 

				GIULIA 
			(turning to Claudia)
		I thought the model was something obsolete 
		nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
 
Claudia goes back to look out the window: a group of flying birds swoops down 
to land directly under the roof. The birds settle themselves in a little nest 
directly in front of the window. Claudia bends over to get a better look and 
is actually able to see the little nest, as she hears behind her the exchange 
of remarks between Giulia and the young Prince.
 
				GOFFREDO  
		It's strange how anxious women are to display 
		themselves. It's almost a natural inclination. 

				GIULIA 
		But how could they pose like that? I couldn't. 

				GOFFREDO  
			(with a grave, youthful sensuality)
		Why don't you try?

				GIULIA 
		Me... Goffredo, you're mad! 
			(turning to Claudia) 
		He's mad.

				CLAUDIA 
		Not really.
 
Claudia moves away from the window, and continues to look at Giulia and 
Goffredo with a deep sense of amazement. Giulia is euphoric, kittenish and 
trembling with excitement. Goffredo is firm, resolute and serious.
 
				GIULIA 
		Don't you ever paint men?

				GOFFREDO  
		Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint 
		you a beautiful portrait.

				GIULIA 
		But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more 
		beautiful than me.

				GOFFREDO  
			(insistent)
		But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.

				GIULIA 
			(timidly)
		I appeal to you more?
 
Giulia glances over at Claudia, who is still preoccupied looking out of the 
window, then screws up her courage and boldly advances towards Goffredo, 
making her intentions clearly understood. Goffredo immediately responds to 
her invitation and draws himself close up against her. There is a moment of 
hesitation, then a kiss -- awkward but passionately violent. Giulia, on her 
part, is completely shameless. Claudia turns around exactly at that moment 
when the two of them are caught up in a feverish embrace. She looks at them, 
completely dumbfounded, then takes a few steps forward as though she doesn't 
believe her own eyes.
 
				CLAUDIA
			(almost unconsciously) 
		Giulia!
 
Giulia quickly turns around, her face is flushed with excitement but also 
with an expression that seems somewhat triumphant. Before anybody has a 
chance to say anything, she heads towards the door, swings it open and stands 
firmly on the threshold,  obviously intent on telling Claudia to leave. In 
fact, Claudia doesn't wait to be told but immediately walks out into the 
hallway.
 
				GIULIA 
		And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he 
		wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny 
		little heart is beating like mad, and that at 
		this moment, it's the only thing that interests 
		me. Is that clear? 

				CLAUDIA 
		It couldn't be any clearer.
 
Giulia takes a few steps backward into the room, and seeing Claudia still 
there looking at her strangely, exclaims:
 
				GIULIA 
		Now what do I have to do to be left in peace? 

				CLAUDIA 
		I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close 
		the door.
 
And with a violent bang that leaves Claudia startled, Giulia slams the door 
shut. Claudia remains standing there for a moment, still very much amazed. 
But she is aroused from her stupor by the sound of a car pulling into the 
courtyard. Then she rapidly starts descending the stairs.
 
Claudia has reached the hallway leading out to the garden and is anxiously 
waiting there, looking at the car that has just arrived. But she is not able 
to distinguish exactly who it is, and her view is also blocked by Ettore and 
Corrado who have just come out of the house and are now standing in front of 
the car. So she walks out to the garden and joins the group. A certain look 
of disappointment spreads over her face as she sees only Raimondo come out of 
the car. Evidently, Sandro has not been located.
 
				RAIMONDO 
		He's not at the hotel... and he probably wasn't 
		even in Milazzo. The room clerk said he rented 
		a car...
 
Claudia moves away from the group, as though she has heard enough. She goes 
over to lean against an enormous vase standing there on the side. Her hands 
are trembling. In back of her she hears the sounds of the others' voices but 
cannot distinguish what they are saying. Then Patrizia arrives and calls out 
Claudia's name. But she has to repeat it a second time before Claudia 
realizes she is being called.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		Claudia... Let's go.
 
Claudia turns around but doesn't move. Another car pulls up, driven by the 
same chauffeur who had evidently picked her up the other day, and in which 
the Princess is already seated.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		I'm not coming.

				PATRIZIA 
		But then why did you bother changing?
 
Patrizia remains puzzled for a moment as though searching for a motive behind 
Claudia's sudden decision, then discreetly turns away without insisting and 
goes over to the car. In the meantime, Giulia and Goffredo have come out 
through the hallway and head towards one of the two cars. Corrado looks at 
them with a cold and critical stare, then with a deliberate intent to prick 
Giulia's feelings, he says:
 
				CORRADO 
		Giulia is like Oscar Wilde; give her the 
		superfluous and she will do without the 
		essential.
 
Ettore breaks out into a laugh as he helps Patrizia into the car.
 
				ETTORE  
		That's him; he'd die if he didn't have somebody 
		to quote. He comes up with quotations like that 
		even at a board of directors meeting...
 
Claudia watches them getting into the car. She is beside herself, completely 
wrapped up in her own thoughts.
 


***
In the rear of a general store, on the outskirts of a small Sicilian town, a 
woman is seated at the window. She is very young, thin and irascible. Up 
front, her husband is speaking with Sandro, and as she listens attentively to 
what he is saying, a sarcastic smile spreads over her face.
 
				HUSBAND  
		Be patient, I can't remember everything. 

				SANDRO
			(indicating the newspaper article)
		But it even says what she bought: a bar of soap! 
		So there's no point in making believe you can't 
		remember.
 
After waiting a few seconds to give her husband a chance to explain himself, 
the wife jumps up from where she is sitting, comes over to Sandro and yanks 
the paper from his hands. Then she starts reading the article in a jerky 
manner typical of one who is not too literate.
 
				WIFE  
		"A young female stranger, whose description 
		corresponds with that of the missing girl, came 
		into my store..."
 
She suddenly stops reading and turns toward Sandro.
 
				WIFE  
		She came and then she left. With him. But this 
		one won't admit it. 
			(turning upon her husband furiously)
 		You think I wasn't aware of it...
 
The husband, a young man, tries to keep calm and carry on the conversation in 
a logical, persuasive manner.
 
				HUSBAND  
		But if I was carrying on with the girl, why 
		would I want to give any of this information to 
		the newspaper?

				WIFE  
		That's what I'd like to know myself.

				HUSBAND  
		Fine, that makes two of us who want to know. In 
		fact, three, with him. 

He indicates Sandro.  Then, seeing a fat, luscious female customer enter the 
store, he turns to her and continues:

				HUSBAND  
		Ah, Lady Amalia, would you be interested in 
		knowing why I told the newspapers about a 
		certain girl who came here the other day and 
		then disappeared?
 
The woman, anxious to learn about any new bit of gossip, becomes immediately 
interested.
 
				LADY AMALIA
		Disappeared? Who is she? ... Where? When?

				HUSBAND  
		And that makes four. Anybody else?...
 
Sandro, a little sick and tired of the whole matter, and wanting to put an 
end to what has by now become farcical, intervenes.
 
				SANDRO 
		You have to be precise. Did this girl enter 
		your store or didn't she? 

				WIFE
			(shouting)
		Yes!

				SANDRO 
			(ignoring her)
		Was she blonde or brunette? 

				HUSBAND
			(calmly)
		Brunette. 

				WIFE
			(contradicting him)
		Blonde. 

				SANDRO 
		How was she dressed?

				HUSBAND  
		I don't quite remember. Seems to me she wore a 
		black dress.

				WIFE
			(intervening sarcastically)
		He doesn't look at dresses, he looks at what's 
		under them.
 
The husband turns around and looks at his wife menacingly.
 
				SANDRO 
		Pardon me, but has anyone else been here asking 
		about this girl?

				HUSBAND  
		No ... I don't think so. 

				SANDRO 
		Thanks.
 


***
Sandro leaves the store. He walks a few steps along the pavement, then sits 
down at a small outside table of a nearby caf. He looks out over the square: 
a small Sicilian town, quiet and still in the hot afternoon sun. Every now 
and then, he glances up at the country road that winds around the town, as 
though he were waiting for someone.

A few moments later, in fact, a car comes into view and slows down as it 
reaches the square. The driver looks out for a place in which to park. Sandro 
rises to his feet. The car comes to a stop a few steps away from him. The 
driver rushes out of the car to open the door for the person inside: it is 
Claudia. Sandro immediately goes over to meet her, looking at her somewhat 
amazed. Not only does he see her more elegantly dressed than he has ever seen 
her before, wearing a smartly tailored polka-dot suit, but also as an 
entirely new person, as someone whose beauty he has discovered for the first 
time. For a moment they continue staring at each other, without even 
bothering to say hello.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Any news?

				SANDRO 
		Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, 
		there is some slight indication...
 
Claudia drops her gaze, relieved by even that slight note of hope. Then she 
looks up at him again, as though inspired by another sudden thought: 
something which must have lingered in her mind from one of the Princess' 
humorous quips. Then, the owner of the general store appears on the scene. 
After having dealt his nagging wife a crushing verbal blow, he turns to 
Sandro, but not without first glancing at Claudia, for whom it soon becomes 
evident he has really come out on the street.
 
				HUSBAND  
		Listen... In the paper they forgot to say that 
		as soon as the girl left here she took the bus 
		to Noto. The bus leaves from the square, over 
		there. I saw her clearly... I came to the door 
		to see her off... She was a beautiful girl. 
		Lovely pair of legs!
 
While speaking, he continues to keep an eye on Claudia with the look of one 
who thinks his gaze is loaded with irresistible masculinity. All of a sudden, 
he pulls out a package of Nazionali cigarettes from his pocket and offers one 
to Claudia. She looks at him dumbfounded, then automatically declines with a 
shake of her head. In turn, he lights up a cigarette, inhaling the smoke 
voluptuously. Meanwhile, his wife has come upon the scene and looks at him 
suspiciously. Then, with a sad, wistful voice, she turns to Claudia.
 
				WIFE  
		You're from Rome, aren't you? I knew right away 
		because I'm from Viterbo... He was a soldier 
		there and so...
			(indicating her husband, and
			 then quickly continuing) 
		I don't like it very much, here.
 
				HUSBAND
			(interrupting)
		Then why don't you go back?
 
His wife turns and looks at him hatefully, exactly in the same manner he had 
looked at her.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		How long have you been married? 

				WIFE  
		Three months.

Claudia and Sandro look at each other. There is a moment of embarrassment, 
then Sandro breaks the silence.

				SANDRO 
		Well... Thanks for the information.
 
They exchange goodbyes, then Claudia and Sandro move away from the store and 
head towards Claudia's car. Suddenly, Sandro takes Claudia by the hand.
 
				SANDRO 
		It's better if we present a happy picture, no?
 
Claudia is about to withdraw her hand but she is taken aback by Sandro's 
phrase, which also fills her with a warm and tender feeling after the squalid 
situation with the young storekeeper and his wife. Now Sandro opens the door 
of the car, looks at Claudia as if to ask her consent for what he is about to 
do, and since Claudia says nothing but just stands there trying to figure out
which one of the feelings struggling within her will win, he removes 
Claudia's valise and closes the door.
 
				SANDRO 
			(to the driver)
		Tell the Signora Patrizia that we are 
		continuing the search...and that the Signorina 
		Claudia will manage to survive somehow...
 
The driver bows slightly, then he climbs into the car and departs. Sandro and 
Claudia remain there, watching the car disappear out of view. Now Sandro 
turns to look at Claudia, and smiles at her. Claudia is visibly upset. She 
doesn't smile back but merely turns away and heads towards Sandro's car.
 


***
Claudia is intent on looking at Sandro who is doing the driving. The car is 
traveling on a country road but Claudia shows no interest in the landscape. 
She continues to stare at Sandro as if she wants to know his most secret 
thoughts. Suddenly, feeling himself being stared at, Sandro turns towards 
Claudia. She quickly drops her gaze. Then Sandro turns his eyes back to the 
road, and Claudia looks up at him again.

From a bend in the road up ahead, preceded by the loud and penetrating blast 
of a horn, the bus mentioned earlier by the storekeeper appears. Sandro 
barely manages to stop the car in time off to one side of the road. He gets 
out and places himself in the middle of the road where he starts signaling 
for the bus to stop. With a loud screech of its brakes, the bus comes to a 
stop almost directly in front of him. The bus driver opens the window and 
leans out.
 
				DRIVER
		Did your car break down? 

				SANDRO 
		No. I only want some information.
 
Meanwhile, the driver's assistant gets down from the bus and the passengers 
lean out of the windows.  Claudia has also gotten out of the car and appears 
on the scene.
 
				SANDRO 
		We're searching for a girl of about 
		twenty-five... Seems she boarded this bus two 	
		days ago, in the afternoon... You should 
		remember her because she was a stranger around 
		here...
 
The driver gets down from the bus and comes over to Sandro, scratching his 
head.
 
				DRIVER
		She was a little nervous... dark-haired ... with 
		a kerchief around her head?
 
He turns to his assistant for verification, who, in turn, searches his memory 
and then adds:
 
				ASSISTANT
		Two days ago... wasn't there that midwife on 
		the bus, too? Sure, that's right, and she was 
		talking to some young woman ...

				SANDRO 
		Can you tell me where she got off? 

				ASSISTANT
		All I can tell you is that the midwife is from 
		X... 

				SANDRO 
		Okay, thanks.
 
Sandro turns and goes back to his car while the others climb back on the bus 
which begins to leave. Claudia and Sandro remain standing near the car, 
watching the bus disappear. Then Claudia turns and looks out over the fields. 
She sees a dry riverbed filled with stones that sparkle in the sun, beside it 
a high rocky bank. Sandro stands next to her and she becomes vividly aware of 
his presence. As she glances at him, he turns around, then she quickly starts 
up a conversation as though she were anxious not to have any romantic mood 
develop between them.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		My God ... Let's hope it was her.
 
Then, still feeling Sandro's eyes fixed upon her, she turns and starts  
heading towards the car.  Sandro catches up with her and takes her hand. 
Before they climb into the car they look at each other intensely. A moment 
later, the car takes off at full speed.
 


***
In a courtyard of the midwife's house, Sandro and Claudia are questioning a 
middle-aged woman.
 
				MIDWIFE  
		I only exchanged a few casual words with her, 
		as one would ordinarily do on a public bus... 

				SANDRO 
		And do you remember where she got off? 

				MIDWIFE  
		Well...probably at the last stop, which is Noto.

				CLAUDIA 
		After that, you didn't see her anymore?
 
The woman pauses for a few seconds and looks at Claudia as though she had 
detected some hidden motive behind the question. And when she resumes 
speaking, what she has to say is in sharp contrast to the way she says it. 
They are words of protest but spoken condescendingly, almost sweetly, yet 
leaving no doubt as to their meaning.
 
				MIDWIFE  
		What are you trying to insinuate, young lady?
		Why should I have seen her again? I don't do 
		anything that's illegitimate.

				CLAUDIA 
		Oh, no... What are you saying? I'm not 
		insinuating anything...

				MIDWIFE  
		And furthermore, my dear young lady... because 
		you really are a dear, you know ...if the story 
		of that girl is merely a pretext, let us say, 
		to get in touch with her, then I feel it is my 
		duty to warn her. These things are very, very 
		dangerous, especially in a neighborhood like 
		this where people occupy themselves more with 
		other people's affairs than their own.
 
Seeing Claudia being put into an uncomfortable position, Sandro, who had been 
following the midwife's discussion with a cagey attitude, intervenes.
 
				SANDRO 
		Then you should also be able to tell me where a 
		young girl might stay in Noto; are there any 
		hotels or rooming houses?

				MIDWIFE  
		There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, 
		near the municipal building. As for rooming 
		houses, I don't know...

				SANDRO 
		Thank you.

				MIDWIFE  
		Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service 
		any time.
 
Claudia starts moving hurriedly out of the courtyard, followed by Sandro.
 


***
Sandro's car is speeding across a harsh, sun-baked landscape, bypassing long 
lines of peasants returning from the fields: the women seated on donkeys, the 
men on foot. The more fortunate among them have horse drawn carts.
 
Claudia is looking at the surrounding countryside and spies an iron bridge 
that is all rusty and obviously no longer in use.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Look at that bridge! Who knows why they even 
		bothered to make it...
 
The car continues onward, passing an abandoned factory, then a railroad 
station, also abandoned, its tracks covered by weeds, the ticket office 
haphazardly boarded up with old wooden planks.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Look at that: a factory... a station... and 
		look at those tracks, all full of weeds... But 
		why?
 
Sandro shrugs his shoulders and continues driving without saying a word. Up 
ahead a small town comes into view, with monotonous rows of newly constructed 
homes lined up along the side of the road. The car enters the town and stops. 
Sandro gets out and goes over to a fountain nearby, but the fountain is dry. 
Somewhat surprised, he begins to look around. And only then do Sandro and 
Claudia become aware that the silence around them is an unnatural one, that 
the doors and the windows of all the houses in the town are tightly shut. 
There is no sign of life anywhere, except for the weeds growing between the 
cracks in the walls, invading and suffocating everything in sight. 

Claudia gets out of the car, joins Sandro, and together they start walking 
along the streets. The sun beats furiously down upon the crumbling houses, 
upon the church, upon the useless monument in the square on which a 
dedication is inscribed: "To The Agricultural Worker." 

Sandro looks around in absolute silence. Claudia is also  silent, somewhat  
dismayed. Instinctively, she presses up close to Sandro who leads her to a 
shady spot where the ground is overgrown with weeds. 

Sandro and Claudia are lying next to each other on the grass. Sandro appears 
calm but is actually looking at Claudia as though he were about to embrace 
her with his eyes. Then he takes her hand. Claudia offers no resistance; in 
fact, she entwines her fingers around his, almost with a sense of 
desperation. Sandro tries to kiss her. She makes a feeble attempt to resist, 
looks around, and sees the deserted town, the barren fields, the crumbling, 
sun-baked walls. She turns and looks at Sandro again, and now it is she who 
kisses him. When they break apart, they stretch themselves out upon the grass. 
Sandro kisses her violently, again and again and again...
 


***
The early twilight shadows are beginning to fall. The sky is still clear but 
the sun is fading. There is a deep silence and the air is absolutely still. 
In a certain sense, Sandro's car, standing there in the middle of the 
deserted street, is the only thing alive in that desolate town.

Huddled close to each other, Claudia and Sandro are asleep on the grass. 
Lazily, Claudia awakens, and then Sandro also opens his eyes. They are both 
somewhat disheveled.
 
				CLAUDIA
			(faintly audible)
		It's late... We should be going.
 
Little by little, she leaves behind the drowsiness of her deep and peaceful 
sleep, purring languorously in a typically feminine fashion. Sandro smiles 
and gently embraces her. A moment later, Claudia releases herself from 
Sandro's arms, sits up and realizes that the countryside and the town itself 
are as black and motionless as death. A cold shiver runs down her back and 
she quickly comes to her feet.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a 
		town, it's a cemetery.

				SANDRO 
		Who knows why they all left...
 
Claudia starts to move but her legs are still numb from her sound sleep and 
she hobbles along comically, laughing at the same time. Sandro also gets up 
and finds that his legs are cramped. Hobbling and laughing himself, he 
follows Claudia towards the car. But the car, baked by the sun, is like an 
oven. They both make boisterous and playful exclamations, then another 
embrace, another kiss. Finally, they climb into the car and drive off with a 
loud roar that echoes up and down the abandoned town.
 


***
Sandro and Claudia arrive in the town of Noto and pull up on the opposite 
side of the street from the Trinacria Hotel. As they climb out of the car, 
Claudia turns to Sandro:
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone. 

				SANDRO 
		Are you joking?

				CLAUDIA 
		Don't think that I want to save myself from any 
		embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting 
		Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say 
		certain things easier if you're alone. Please, 
		Sandro, do try to understand me... It would 
		look like I was trying to influence you, to 
		force you, to control you... and that makes me 
		feel uncomfortable...
 
Sandro agrees by a nod of his head and indicates that he understands very 
well. Nevertheless, he doesn't move. Several agonizing moments go by in which 
they both remain silent and still, looking at the hotel across the way. Then, 
tossing away his cigarette, Sandro finally walks off and goes into the hotel.

Left alone, Claudia strolls along for a few steps. She sees a letter box up 
against a building and deposits a postcard she had been carrying with her. 
She remains there for a moment, watching a parade of ants crawling along the 
wall, ending up who knows where. They come and go, scurrying up and down in 
vast numbers, incredibly busy. Then Claudia turns away and starts pacing back 
and forth, stopping from time to time behind townspeople who mill about in 
the streets; she pays them no heed. Several young men pass by and turn around 
to look at her. They are obviously the town's dandies. Circling around her, 
they exchange suggestive comments to one another. Even among the women 
Claudia arouses a certain curiosity. But she remains totally unaware of it; 
such is the intensity with which she concentrates her gaze upon the hotel 
entrance. Suddenly the sound of a shutter being lowered directly behind her 
causes her to start and turn around. It is a shop being closed. Other shops, 
further down the street, are also closing for the day. The people in the 
streets begin thinning out and it is not long before Claudia is left entirely 
by herself. In that total solitude, the doorway of the hotel emerges like the 
mouth of some dark and fearful cavern, so much so that Claudia is unable to 
keep her eyes fixed upon that spot. She turns her head away, but her 
attention is immediately drawn back again. From the darkness of the hotel's 
hallway, she spies Sandro coming out. Claudia doesn't wait to see if he is 
alone or not, for she has only one thought in mind: not to let herself be 
seen. But she doesn't know what to do since there is practically no one else 
in the streets and all the shops are closed. Then she notices a tobacco shop 
still open and she quickly dashes into it. She goes up to the counter as she 
opens her purse and starts looking for some change.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Some cigarettes, please... Do you have any?...
		Nazionali with filters ...
 
Her hands tremble as she searches for the money. Finally, she pays the  
storekeeper and immediately lights up a cigarette. Suddenly, she wheels 
about, having heard Sandro enter. He is alone. Throwing away his cigarette, 
he comes up to her, all nervous and excited, and they both step out into the 
street.
 
As soon as she is outside, Claudia leans up against the wall as if she has no 
strength left. She lets her cigarette fall to the ground and shuts her eyes.
 
				SANDRO 
		What is it, Claudia?

				CLAUDIA 
		Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so 
		ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so 
		small... I hate myself ...

				SANDRO 
		Does it please you to say such things? 

				CLAUDIA 
		Oh no... It doesn't please me at all... 

				SANDRO 
		Then why do you say them?
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because 
		if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love 
		you," I would believe you...
 
   Sandro is about to say the phrase, somewhat jokingly in the hope that it 
might calm her, but also with a certain amount of seriousness. But as soon as 
he opens his mouth to say "Claudia," she places her hand over his lips.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		No... Because then I'd force you to swear it, 
		I'd force you to tell me an infinite amount of 
		things... and that wouldn't be right, it 
		couldn't be right... It would be absurd.

Sandro tries to calm her with an embrace.
 
				SANDRO 
		Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would 
		mean nothing much can be done about it.

				CLAUDIA 
		But just think -- the very same things you had
		said to her who knows how many times... maybe 
		even just before we left, while I was waiting 
		outside your place...

				SANDRO 
		So, even if I did say them, I was sincere with 
		her, as I am now with you.

Moved by Sandro's remark, Claudia lifts her head and looks deeply into his 
eyes. The statement reveals him as being someone quite different from the 
person she had imagined him to be, and at the same time, it opens up for her 
a new way of looking at things. Shaking his head, and with much tenderness, 
he says:
 
				SANDRO 
		I have never seen a woman like you, who needs 
		to see everything so clearly.
 
At the sound of a man's voice coming from behind him, Sandro turns and sees a 
gentleman with two large packages under his arms, pointing to a bell-cord 
dangling on the side of a door nearby.
         
				MAN
		Excuse me, but would you mind pulling that cord 
		for me?
 
Sandro pulls the bell-cord and the sound of a bell is heard inside.
 
				MAN
		Thank you.
 
The door opens and the gentleman quickly steps inside. Sandro looks up at the 
building.
 
				SANDRO 
		At one time, all these houses were convents.
 
He takes Claudia by the arm and pulls her away towards the square, then looks 
attentively around the area. Bathed in the soft twilight, the buildings and 
the churches bordering the square reveal themselves in all their beauty. 
Sandro and Claudia climb up the steps of a church building and from there 
gaze at the scene. Gradually he allows himself to be overcome with 
enthusiasm. 

				SANDRO 
		Look! What a fantastic scene! What movement, 
		what disorder! They were very much concerned 
		with scenographic effects... an extraordinary 
		sense of liberty...
 
There is a moment of silence during which he continues to look at the scene 
before him. Then, giving voice to a sincere thought, he exclaims:
 
				SANDRO 
		Really, I've got to stop this business with 
		Ettore... I would like to go back and start 
		working on my own projects again. You know, I 
		had many ideas... 

				CLAUDIA 
		And why did you drop them?

				SANDRO 
		Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate 
		for the construction of a school. It took me 
		only a day and a half to finish it, and I got 
		paid six million lire. Ever since then I've 
		been doing estimates for other people's 
		designs.
 
Claudia looks at him as if she were about to render judgment, and Sandro 
becomes aware of it.
 
				SANDRO 
		Why are you looking at me like that? 

				CLAUDIA 
		I'm sure you'd be able to design some very 
		lovely things.

				SANDRO 
		I don't know about that. And then, who's 
		interested in beautiful things nowadays?
 
The last words are spoken with a deep sense of sadness, Sandro avoiding 
Claudia's glance. He laughs to himself and for a while remains silent. He 
takes another look up at the dark outlines of the buildings, then turns to 
Claudia.
 
				SANDRO 
		Claudia, let's get married? 

				CLAUDIA 
			(astonished) 
		What! Get married?

				SANDRO 
		Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you 
		say?

				CLAUDIA 
		What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, 
		not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of 
		it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did 
		you have to ask me? 

				SANDRO 
		You look at me as though I had said something 
		foolish...

				CLAUDIA 
		And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you 
		really sure...that you want to marry... me? 

				SANDRO 
		That's why I asked you...

				CLAUDIA 
		So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so 
		much simpler... that people could just come 
		together by the color of their hair or the size 
		of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? 
		Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm 
		sorry, I wear size 8.
 
Sandro smiles and playfully ruffles Claudia's hair. She also smiles, then 
slowly they both head towards the hotel.
 


***
It is morning inside the Hotel Trinacria.  Claudia has just had breakfast in 
her room and is almost finished dressing. It is a rather large room, set out 
with old pieces of furniture. The place is in a state of disarray, and the 
door leading into Sandro's room is wide open. Because of the general 
disorder, Claudia is unable to find her stockings. But instead of being 
angered by this, she appears quite jovial and laughs gaily. As she continues 
to look for her stockings, Sandro appears in the doorway.
 
				SANDRO 
		Are you ready?
 
Claudia comes up to Sandro and gazes upon him with a look of adoration.
 
				CLAUDIA 
			(ironically)
		But why am I so infatuated with you?

				SANDRO 
			(smiling)
		Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot 
		outside...

				CLAUDIA 
		Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
 
She starts looking hurriedly around the room again but is still unable to 
locate her stockings. Suddenly, up from the street comes the sound of music. 
It is a popular tune, wild and rhythmic, emanating from a publicity truck as 
part of some local advertising stunt. Claudia is overtaken by the music and 
cannot resist the temptation to do a little dance for Sandro. Little by 
little, she starts swaying back and forth to the music. Then, kicking off her 
shoes, she begins to dance around the room in her bare feet. Sandro looks at 
her, amused but also somewhat impatient.
 
				SANDRO 
			(leaving)
		Okay. I understand. See you later.
 
Claudia rushes up to the door, and feigning an exaggerated attitude of 
despair, says:
 
				CLAUDIA 
		And you leave me here all alone... in this 
		hotel room... 

				SANDRO 
		As soon as you're ready, you can come down and 
		catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right 
		outside on the square.
 
Claudia is in a playful mood and she is anxious to demonstrate her 
exuberance.
 
				CLAUDIA 
			(teasingly)
		Very well. But you must first tell me that when 
		you go out without me it's like going out 
		without one of your legs. Go ahead, have a look 
		around the town all by yourself, but you'll 
		have to hobble along on only one leg. And you 
		must also tell me that you are filled with a 
		great desire to embrace my shadow on the 
		walls... Then you must tell me...
			(suddenly her tone of voice 
			 changes and she becomes 
			 quite serious) 
		You must tell me that you love me.
 
Sandro replies with the same good-natured tolerance with which he had been 
watching Claudia as she danced her coquettish dance.
 
				SANDRO 
		But you know it already. Why must I tell you? 

				CLAUDIA 
		So, you wonder why?
 
Without waiting for him to answer, she goes back towards the center of the 
room and once again starts looking around for her stockings. Sandro begins to 
leave.
 
				SANDRO 
		Then I'll see you later. 

				CLAUDIA 
		Okay. In a few minutes.
 
Sandro goes out the door. Claudia finally locates her stockings and proceeds 
to finish dressing.
 


***
Sandro comes out of the hotel and crosses over to the sunny square. He starts 
strolling down along a street which leads to a baroque church that opens up 
to a wide flight of stone steps. Beyond these steps is a small dead-end 
street that runs up against the faade of a large and magnificent old 
building. A few feet away from the faade, seated on a bench in the shade, is 
an old coachman whose horse is standing beside him with its head deep in a 
sack of hay.

Sandro goes down the flight of steps and approaches the door of the old 
building which is closed. He rings the bell but there is no answer. Then he 
notices a time schedule posted on the door indicating visiting hours. After 
glancing at it, he walks over to the seated coachman.
 
				SANDRO 
		It's closed. Isn't there any custodian or 
		caretaker inside?
 
				COACHMAN
		 	(apathetically)
		Nobody there.

				SANDRO 
		But it says it's open from 9:30 to 10:30., and 
		it's ten o'clock now...  That's a fine way to 
		greet tourists.

				COACHMAN
		Tourists? Last year a few Frenchmen came here 
		and they all walked around in their bathing
		suits. So they were made to understand that it 
		was better if they didn't come at all.
 
Sandro shakes his head and is about to say something but he sees the door 
opening and a man appears.  Sandro goes over to him.
 
				SANDRO 
		Are you the custodian?

				CUSTODIAN
		Yes, come right in.
 
Sandro enters and finds himself inside a large courtyard of noteworthy 
architectural design, though somewhat in a state of decay. The custodian goes 
on his way and Sandro walks further into the courtyard where two young men 
are studying the architecture. On hearing Sandro's footsteps, they turn 
around for a moment, then resume their observation. They are, in fact, young 
architectural students busily engaged in taking notes and copying certain 
architectural details. They do this with an extraordinary interest, almost 
with a sense of religious zeal. Sandro continues to stroll through the 
courtyard. His footsteps are the only sounds to be heard disturbing the 
otherwise absolute silence. The two young students exchange words between 
each other but they speak in faint whispers, almost as though they were 
inside a church. 

Sandro gazes up at the arcades, the columns, the windows. He is obviously 
filled with a painful sense of regret, resentful and bitter. He turns to look 
at the two young students who are deep in their studies and ignore his 
presence. But he is unable to ignore them; they plainly annoy him. In a 
certain sense, they humiliate him. He turns away and heads towards the exit, 
walking on the tip of his toes so as not to make any noise. Then he goes out, 
quietly closing the door behind him.
 


***
In the hotel lobby, a maid is cleaning and dusting, and at the same time, 
singing little snatches from a popular romantic tune. The hotel manager, who 
is busy writing something in the register behind the desk, looks up and says:
 
				HOTEL MANAGER
		Go ahead, keep right on singing...
 
Disappointed, the maid immediately stops singing, and the manager resumes 
writing. But she quickly looks up again as she hears footsteps coming down 
the stairs. It is Claudia.
 
				HOTEL MANAGER
			(to Claudia)
		Excuse me for interfering, but I've heard about 
		that girl... Here in this place one gets to 
		know about everything... That girl you're 
		looking for... Why don't you try asking at the 
		youth hostel in Pergusa? Almost all the young 
		girls traveling through here end up there.
 
Claudia is immediately interested to hear this bit of news and is about to 
ask for additional information. But she is suddenly distracted by Sandro who 
enters the lobby at that very moment.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		I was just coming out to meet you. How come 
		you're back so soon?
 
Sandro doesn't answer but merely shrugs his shoulders. Then he takes Claudia 
by the arm and gently leads her towards the stairway. He has a worried 
expression on his face and remains absolutely silent as he starts climbing 
the stairs. As they walk through the corridor, Claudia looks at him 
anxiously, wondering what is wrong.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Sandro ...What's the matter? 

				SANDRO 
		Nothing.
 
He opens the door to his room and ushers Claudia in. As soon as he enters, he 
takes off his jacket and throws it on a chair. Then he walks over to the 
window and closes the shutters. Then, without saying a word, he turns to 
Claudia, grabs her in his arms and squeezes her. Claudia smiles, and 
playfully yells "Ouch!" Then he goes to kiss her but Claudia tries to resist 
but doesn't succeed. This little struggle stimulates Sandro and is enough to 
make him forget all reserve. He drags Claudia on to the bed and forces her to 
lie down.

				CLAUDIA 
		No, Sandro... Please... 

				SANDRO 
		Why?

				CLAUDIA 
		No reason why...
 
But Sandro hugs her and kisses her again. This time, Claudia lets herself be 
kissed.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		What's the matter with you?
 
Sandro only responds by kissing her again. Then Claudia yields. Sandro is 
angry and excited, as though he wanted to take his resentment out on Claudia.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You 
		seem like an entirely different person ...
 
				SANDRO 
		And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have 
		a new kind of adventure.
 
Wounded, Claudia pushes him away with all her might, and exclaims:
 
				CLAUDIA 
		What are you saying?

				SANDRO 
		I was only joking, really... Can't I make a 
		joke? And now you've got to tell me why you 
		don't want to.

				CLAUDIA 
		Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...
 
She stops short, then turns aside and reaches out to touch his jacket on the 
chair, looking into the pockets, not with curiosity but with a sense of love. 
Sandro grabs her by the shoulders and forces her to turn around.
 
				SANDRO 
		But what?
 
Claudia remains silent, then gets up from the bed, and in a subdued tone of 
voice, says:
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Did the hotel manager speak to you about that 
		place nearby?

				SANDRO 
		Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like 
		staying to listen to what she had to say. If we 
		had to listen to everybody...

				CLAUDIA 
		No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we 
		haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even 
		with Anna's father. We should have at least 
		sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he 
		must be feeling awfully lonely.

				SANDRO 
		I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're 
		the least suitable persons to be with him. And 
		as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he 
		is?
 
There is a moment of silence, then Claudia starts heading towards the door.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Come, let's go. Pack your things, and I'll get 
		mine ready too.
 



***
It is evening. Sandro's car is pulling into the town of Taormina on its way 
to the San Domenico. It comes to a small square and passes by a group of men 
and women seated on the steps of an ancient ruin. They are dressed in evening 
clothes and are laughing and giggling. The car turns into the street of the  
San Domenico and stops in front of the hotel. A porter immediately comes out 
and opens the door. Claudia and Sandro get out and head towards the small 
courtyard that leads into the foyer.

The lobby is full of activity and alive with people dressed in formal attire. 
Claudia is clearly intrigued by everything she sees: the surroundings, the 
people, etc. Sandro approaches the reception desk as Claudia walks slightly 
ahead, anxious to see what is going on. The sound of music is heard coming 
from one of the halls at the other end of the lobby. There is obviously a 
party underway: further on, through a glass partition, couples are seen 
dancing. Suddenly, Claudia stops. Directly up ahead, she notices Patrizia. As 
soon as she see Claudia, Patrizia comes to greet her, smiling.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		Well, I'm looking for somebody else and who do 
		I find but you.
 
Claudia smiles and they both kiss each other on the cheek.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		How are you?
 
Instead of answering, Patrizia takes Claudia by the hand and leads her over 
to a bench along the side of the wall and sits down. Claudia remains 
standing, somewhat annoyed by the crowd of people around her.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place? 

				PATRIZIA 
		Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
 
Patrizia rises and leads Claudia out to a terrace that overlooks the entire 
bay which is dotted with lights. Claudia takes in the view but her attention 
is still focused on Patrizia. She waits from one moment to the next to have 
questions thrown at her, but Patrizia remains silent. So Claudia turns around 
and looks at her as though to say: Come on, say what you have to say and 
let's get it over with. But Patrizia smiles at her sweetly and only murmurs:
 
				PATRIZIA 
		You look so wonderfully tanned.
 
Claudia feels relieved and presses Patrizia's hand, almost with a sense of 
renewed friendship. Sandro appears from behind the glass partition and comes 
out on the terrace to greet Patrizia.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		And here's Sandro. 
			(he kisses her hand)
		Why don't you two go upstairs and change? 

				SANDRO 
		Yes, we will.
 
They leave the terrace and go through one of the halls towards the corridor 
that leads to the rooms. Claudia walks ahead, with Patrizia and Sandro 
following slightly behind. The hall is still packed with people.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		Did you manage to find good rooms?
 
				SANDRO 
		They didn't seem too good.

				PATRIZIA 
		You should have told Ettore. He always manages 
		to get what he wants.

				SANDRO 
		Ettore must be fed up with me by now. 

				PATRIZIA 
		Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well 
		that he'll forgive you anything; just as long 
		as you admit to him that you're a worse driver 
		than he is...
 
Claudia looks at Sandro, assured by Patrizia's reply. She remains thoughtful 
for a moment, then asks Patrizia:
 
				CLAUDIA 
		How do you manage to put up with all this 
		confusion? You always said people bore you. 

				PATRIZIA 
		You shouldn't always take me seriously. 
		Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my 
		mother and now my husband; both of them are 
		like dynamos. 

				SANDRO 
		Your mother?

				PATRIZIA 
		Yes, even I had a mother. She was part 
		Austrian, but she was still my mother. My 
		childhood was like a tennis match; they 
		bounced me back and forth, here and there...

				CLAUDIA 
		My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.

				PATRIZIA 
		What do you mean by sensible? 

				CLAUDIA 
		It means being without money.
 
Patrizia and Sandro burst out laughing, and Sandro reaches out and ruffles 
Claudia's hair. They have arrived in front of a room that is situated on the 
ground floor, and are greeted by a hotel clerk who is waiting for them with 
keys in hand. The door is already open and Claudia is about to enter.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		See you soon, then.
 
Sandro nods yes and Claudia waves so long, as Patrizia takes her leave. 
Claudia enters the room behind the clerk, and Sandro follows. Claudia stops 
in the middle of the room, as the clerk goes through his various duties with 
professional exactitude: he turns on the lights, draws the window curtains, 
checks to see if there are enough hangers in the wardrobe, then finally opens
the door to the adjoining room, into which he disappears. All his movements 
seem completely automatic.
 
				SANDRO 
			(commenting under his breath)
		You see? Just like a robot.
 
Then Sandro enters the adjoining room, where the clerk has in the meantime 
turned on all the lamps and performed all the other little duties. Sandro 
starts to undo his tie. Claudia remains standing in the middle of the room, 
listening to all of Sandro's movements in the other room. A knock is heard at 
the door of Sandro's room and Sandro is heard saying:
 
				SANDRO 
		Come in.
 
A few seconds later, the porter also enters Claudia's room with her baggage. 
She opens the valise and starts taking out her nightgown and other 
necessities. Her gestures are slow and imprecise because fatigue has overcome 
her. Several moments pass, and Sandro appears at the door in his pajamas.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too 
		involved tomorrow.

				SANDRO 
		Aren't you going to change?

				CLAUDIA 
		You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
 
Sandro shrugs his shoulders without, apparently, giving much thought to 
Claudia's statement. He goes into the bathroom saying:
 
				SANDRO 
		Sure, that's what I said...
 
The sound of the shower running is heard.
 
				SANDRO 
		Wow, it's ice cold...
 
Claudia goes up to the door adjoining the two rooms and stops at the doorway 
of the bathroom that is situated between the two rooms.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Sandro, I'm not coming down. 

				SANDRO 
		Why?

				CLAUDIA 
		I'm too sleepy.

				SANDRO 
		Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. 
		I learned how to do it when I was a child. I 
		never slept. And I had friends who even slept 
		less than I did. The one who went to bed first, 
		paid a penalty. And we really didn't do 
		anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a 
		cafe and discuss things for a while... then 
		we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to 
		some drunkard... watch them putting up posters 
		or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing 
		by... or go for a stroll around the market 
		place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl 
		in the neighborhood by standing in front of her 
		window and calling out her name...
 
Claudia has been listening to Sandro with her head leaning against the door 
jamb, her eyes closed. As soon as Sandro stops, she goes back to her bed and 
starts undressing. Sandro comes out of the bathroom, wearing a bathrobe, and 
going over to Claudia, says in an affectionate tone:
 
				SANDRO 
		You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to 
		get up tomorrow? 

				CLAUDIA 
		Late, very late.
 
Claudia disappears into her bathroom, and Sandro returns to his room. After a 
while, his voice is heard.
 
				SANDRO 
		Did you know that when I was a boy I wanted to 
		be a diplomat? Can you imagine that! Me, a 
		diplomat? It's strange but I never thought I'd 
		be rich. I saw myself living in a rooming house, 
		full of geniuses...
 
Claudia has slipped into her nightgown and returned to her room. Sandro is 
heard clearing his throat, and then continuing.
 
				SANDRO 
		Instead, I have two apartments, one in Rome and 
		one in Milan. As far as genius goes, it's a 
		habit I've never formed. What do you think of 
		that?
 
Sandro reappears at the doorway, already half dressed. Claudia slides into 
bed and stretches herself out under the covers.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		I look at things differently... But maybe it's 
		best we talk about it some other time. Do you 
		mind turning off that light over there?
 
Sandro turns out the lamp on the table while Claudia closes the main switch. 
The room is enveloped in darkness. Sandro approaches the bed and bends over 
Claudia to kiss her.
 
				SANDRO 
		Good night, my love.

				CLAUDIA 
		Good night. Tell me that you love me. 

				SANDRO 
		I love you.

				CLAUDIA 
		Tell me once more. 

				SANDRO 
		I don't love you. 

				CLAUDIA 
			(smiling) 
		I deserve it.
 
Sandro goes towards the door, then turns and smiles.
 
				SANDRO 
		That's not true. I love you.
 
He returns to his room, closing the door behind him. He seems somewhat 
meditative, as though the little discourse he has just delivered has in some 
way touched him deeply. He also seems a little sad. Then he puts on his tie 
and jacket, lights up a cigarette, and goes to the door.
 


***
Sandro comes out of his room and walks along through the corridors, heading 
towards the reception halls down at the other end. Other persons are walking 
up and down the corridor in both directions.
 
Sandro's attention is attracted by the figure of a woman who is coming his 
way at a rather quick pace. She is wrapped in a tight-fitting evening dress 
that emphasizes the various harmonious parts of her body. Sandro looks at 
her. He seems to recognize her but isn't quite sure who it is. The girl 
passes alongside of him and apparently she too has the same impression, for 
she gives him a look that lasts much longer than it normally would between 
two complete  strangers. She stops in front of a door but before entering, 
she casts another glance at Sandro, who suddenly recalls that she is the same 
woman who had almost provoked a riot in the streets of Messina and who was 
forced to take refuge in a men's shop. There is a moment of hesitation, then 
the girl opens the door and disappears into the room. Sandro continues on 
ahead until he reaches the bar, which is still very crowded. 

Evening clothes of all kinds. Shiny silks. Jewels dangling from wrists, necks 
and ears that are either white or bronzed by the sun. Shoes of silver or 
lustrous black. Headdresses of many women -- high, cropped or short and 
bobbed. Men with hair well groomed but also frequently mussed. A vast, 
tumultuous wave of people, all wealthy and respectable, talking, laughing and 
carrying on as though the whole wide world was right there and everybody in 
it was like them. 

Snatches of witticisms. Faces of passing people. Hands reaching out for 
glasses. The expressions on the face of the barman, smiling and indifferent. 
The sad, sullen face of the cloakroom attendant. The dumbfounded look on the 
face of a thirteen-year-old elevator boy.

Sandro feels very much at home in this milieu. One thinks so little, forgets 
so easily. And things are so conveniently ignored, beginning with one's own 
self. Sandro moves through the crowd, here and there. Standing next to the 
orchestra is a girl in black pants, singing strange songs in a soft, 
suggestive voice. 

Sandro encounters Ettore. As soon as he sees Sandro, Ettore comes over and 
places an arm around his shoulder, almost in the form of an embrace.
 
				ETTORE  
		Well, finally... Come, I'll introduce you to my 
		friends.

				SANDRO 
		I want to take a look around first... I'll join 
		you later.

				ETTORE  
		Say, I hope it's understood that starting 
		tomorrow morning, I'll need to have you around. 
		If you don't give me some figures to work with, 
		how can I proceed?
 
Sandro agrees with a nod of his head. But he is thoughtful and somewhat 
saddened. As Ettore returns to his friends with whom he had been speaking and 
laughing, Sandro looks at him almost with a sense of rage.

Then he goes back to the bar and orders something to drink. He is not aware 
that the girl from Messina is just a few yards away and is watching him. She 
is extremely tanned, extremely voluptuous, and extremely beautiful.

Sandro moves away from the bar with the glass in his hand. He passes in front 
of a semi-dark room and takes a peek inside: a television set is turned on 
but nobody is watching it. Sandro is restless. He comes to a terrace and 
stops to look down at the illuminated docks below. The headlights of cars 
passing by fan out across the road that runs along the shore of the sea. With 
an angry gesture, Sandro finishes his drink, gulping the whiskey down in one 
fast swallow. He squeezes the empty glass in his hand as though he had wanted 
to crush it.
 


***
The early rays of dawn are faintly seen coming through a window at the far 
end of the corridor. Claudia comes rushing out of her room and runs over to 
Patrizia's door. She knocks, then without waiting for a response, she enters.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore? 

				PATRIZIA 
		I imagine he must be inside sleeping. 

				CLAUDIA 
		Would you please see if Sandro is with him? 
		He's not in his room. I'm sorry to disturb you.
 
Patrizia gets up out of bed and goes into the adjoining room.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		Ettore... 

				ETTORE  
		What is it?

				PATRIZIA 
		Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking 
		for Sandro.

				ETTORE  
		And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask 
		Claudia.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		Yes, yes, of course. 

She returns to her room. 

				CLAUDIA 
		Patrizia, I'm afraid.

				PATRIZIA 
		More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at 
		night.

				CLAUDIA 
		I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel 
		she's back, and that they're together.

				PATRIZIA 
		But what's gotten into you?... We would have 
		known. Sandro must be out in the garden 
		somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or 
		watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely 
		surprise indeed if he turned out to be the 
		sentimental type.
 
Claudia sinks down into a chair, weak and exhausted.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let 
		yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to 
		your room and get back into bed.

				CLAUDIA 
		Just several days ago, the thought of Anna 
		being dead would have made me sick. And now, I 
		don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. 
		Everything is becoming so damned simple and 
		easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and 
		suffering.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		You should never wish to get melodramatic over 
		anything.

				CLAUDIA 
		Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being 
		like that.
 
Claudia gets up and leaves the room. She continues walking down along the 
corridor, checking here and there. But the hotel is deserted. There are still 
a few lights  on in  the reception hall but not enough to illuminate the 
place adequately. Finally, she reaches the main hall and stops. The only 
signs of last night's party is a certain disorder in the placement of the 
armchairs and ashtrays filled with cigarette butts. Even the main hall seems 
completely deserted. But all of a sudden, Claudia becomes aware of something 
moving on a sofa at the far end of the room. She takes a few steps, walking 
silently over the thick carpet, so as to get a better look. There seems to be 
a slight movement among what appears to be a jumbled pile of male and female 
clothes, partly hidden from view by the back of the sofa. Claudia goes up 
still closer because she is not able to see clearly what or who it is. Only 
that she has the impression of having seen that suit before... A man's suit. 
She is now able to distinguish what it is: a couple embracing and kissing.

Claudia approaches still closer. She is now just a few steps away. Little by 
little, as she advances, her face takes on such a painful look of 
astonishment that she appears almost petrified. She hesitates and bumps up 
against a little table that makes a small noise. The couple on the sofa come 
out of their embrace and look up. The man is Sandro; the woman is the girl 
from Messina. Sandro looks at Claudia as though he were filled with terror. 
The girl, instead, seems quite amused. Claudia remains for a moment, staring 
at them as if she can't believe her own eyes, and is incapable of making any 
move. Then, she abruptly turns away and starts running. She runs through the 
main hall, the reception room, the courtyard, and out into the street.
 
There is not a soul to be seen. No sound. The day is breaking clear and 
serene.

Claudia comes over to a bench with its paint all peeling off, but she doesn't 
sit down. Transfixed, and with her eyes almost wide open, she stares out at 
the sea, and at the waves which are also a mystery unto themselves.
 
Footsteps are heard approaching from behind, but Claudia doesn't even bother 
to turn. It seems that nothing could distract her from that painful state of 
shock which is written all over her face. A young laborer in overalls, 
carrying a small bundle under his arm, passes by, glancing at her with a look 
of curiosity. He walks a few paces ahead, then turns around to look at her 
again as though she were some kind of strange creature.

The sound of footsteps dies down in the distance, and everything is silent 
once more. There is only the gentle lapping of the waves as they roll up 
against the shore. Claudia is completely oblivious to the scene. Several 
birds swoop down emitting their small cries. A sudden but almost 
imperceptible sea breeze ripples Claudia's hair.

Other footsteps are heard approaching: slow, heavy. Claudia is still not 
stirred from her thoughtful, trance-like state. The footsteps come to a halt 
directly behind her. It is Sandro. He appears thoroughly crestfallen. He 
doesn't even have enough courage to look at Claudia. His face is worn and 
disfigured, like that of a tired old man. And he lets himself fall limp onto 
the bench. They both remain completely motionless, without looking at each 
other. And detached: Claudia standing, Sandro seated. Behind them, the 
skeleton of cement. Further off, the sea.

Gradually, Claudia turns her head towards Sandro. Her eyes are filled with 
tears. She looks down upon him as though he were something that greatly 
pained her. She moves up closer to the bench. Sandro doesn't budge an inch. 
Claudia reaches out to him with her hand, then slowly, gently, and with an 
overwhelming sense of desperation, she caresses his hair.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - STORAGE ROOM - 20 YRS. EARLIER

               Darkness. Then the GLINT of a flashlight. Its beam rocks 
               crazily to and fro across the inside of a small storage room 
               as we hear two children arguing.

                                     OLDER KID
                         You're doing it wrong.

                                     YOUNGER KID
                         Shut up.

                                     OLDER KID
                         You're doing it wrong.

               It's hard, but we get a sense of the room in the whipping 
               beam of light. Huge, dark coats lined up like sides of beef 
               on steel batons. Bent, stained helmets hung like African 
               masks.

               Beneath them BRIAN, 7, and STEPHEN, 12, are trying to struggle 
               into a pair of the ludicrously massive coats over their 
               pajamas.

                                     STEPHEN
                         It doesn't go like that.

                                     BRIAN
                         Who asked you?

                                     STEPHEN
                         If you do it like that it'll open in 
                         the fire. Then you'll get burned and 
                         DIE.

               The door suddenly opens, morning sunlight roaring in. It's a 
               fire station storage room full of fire gear. A fireman stands 
               in the doorway, tall, athletic, their father; DENNIS 
               McCAFFREY.

                                     DENNIS
                         Who's going to die?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. 
                         He never does it right.

                                     DENNIS
                              (gestures for them to 
                              come out)
                         Well, let's have a look.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - DAY

               The two boys tromp out of the closet. The rubber turn-out 
               boots are as high as their thighs. The ends of the coats 
               drag on the floor. They salute, Brian's arm just an empty 
               sleeve. Dennis kneels down and re-fastens Brian's coat.

                                     DENNIS
                         Your brother's right. If you don't 
                         fasten these correctly they could 
                         open and you'd get burned.

                                     STEPHEN
                         And DIE!

                                     BRIAN
                         You wouldn't let me die, would you, 
                         Dad?

                                     DENNIS
                         McCaffreys are smarter than fire, 
                         Brian.
                              (playfully slaps their 
                              shoulders)
                         How 'bout lunch, huh?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Fireman shit?

                                     DENNIS
                         Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd 
                         you grow up, a barn?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Firehouse.

                                     DENNIS
                         Cute.

               -- The station suddenly fills with the BELLOW of an ALARM 
               KLAXON.

                                     DENNIS
                              (sighs)
                         Never fails...

               A young fireman, ADCOX, appears with the dispatch card.

                                     DENNIS
                         Big deal?

                                     AXE
                         Medium deal.

                                     DENNIS
                         Want to come along, Brian? Watch the 
                         old man earn his keep?

                                     STEPHEN
                              (pissed)
                         Dad!

                                     DENNIS
                         You've come along a dozen times, 
                         Stephen, give your brother a chance. 
                         We'll be back in a few minutes.
                              (to Brian)
                         How 'bout it, sport?

                                     BRIAN
                         Sure!

               Dennis scoops Brian up and loads him into the fire engine 
               cab. The other three firemen climb aboard and take their 
               places.

               EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - DAY

               There's a cough of diesel, a crunch of gears, and the engine 
               is pulling out of the station.

                                     DENNIS
                         Hit the button, Brian.

               Brian stamps his foot on the siren button. The red light 
               snaps on, the siren growls and blares, and they're off down 
               the street. Brian turns around in his seat and, at the last 
               instant before the corner, makes eye contact with his older 
               brother.

               They stick their tongues out.

               EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER

               The engine howls its way through the city. Brian, sandwiched 
               between his father and Adcox, looks out in wonderment at 
               intersections zipping past like picket fences, at people on 
               sidewalks holding hands over their ears, at the red emergency 
               lights bouncing crazily off shop windows.

               EXT. BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER

               Lazy smoke curls out the second story of a commercial block. 
               Medium deal. The engine pulls up and the firemen are jumping 
               off like ship rats. Dennis opens his door, hops down, and 
               pauses just long enough to point a serious finger at his 
               son.

                                     DENNIS
                         Stay near the truck.
                              (winks)
                         And keep an eye out for us, huh? 
                         We're short handed today.

               Brian nods vigorously, taking the command seriously. Dennis 
               smiles and is off, dragging a hoseline with his crew toward 
               a doorway they disappear into. Brian climbs down from the 
               cab.

                                     ENGINEER
                         Don't stray too far, little man.

               Brian smiles to the pumper operator. He just wants a better 
               look. And he gets it: Smoke turned evil and dark now, taking 
               on purpose.

               EXT. BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER

               There's a level of apartments above the storefronts. As Brian 
               watches, a window opens and out steps his father and Adcox 
               onto a small fire escape. Their attention's on the next window 
               over, out of reach, wrapped in leaky smoke.

               Suddenly Dennis climbs up onto the fire escape railing, armed 
               with only an axe, and JUMPS across to the next metal balcony. 
               A ballsy, dangerous move. He kicks in the window, breaks out 
               the frame with his axe, and dives in.

               A beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a terrified, 
               smudged little girl. He hands the little girl over the railing 
               to a fireman now coming up the more traditional way -- a 
               ladder.

               Dennis's face lifts and grins at Brian; dirty, bigger than 
               life, invincible. He winks a wink only possible between 
               fathers and sons and he's gone again, back into the swirling 
               darkness. As Brian stands there, full of love, full of pride, 
               he sees a piece of awning along the roofline crack; releasing 
               a sickly yellow tongue of flame that slinks over the roof. 
               The flame seems to pause, to stare at Brian a beat. Shhh, 
               don't tell anyone. Brian is transfixed, his little head 
               staring up in astonishment.

               Nobody else has noticed it.

               Brian can see his father and Adcox through the window; 
               probing, looking for the flame lurking just above. Brian 
               starts to call out in a small, hesitant voice,

                                     BRIAN
                         Dad...

               He tries to call louder... But suddenly everything is 
               happening very fast in slow motion:

               -- Brian can see Adcox testing the ceiling with a pike pole 
               as Brian steps forward, under the power of a flame that 
               beckons him as -- 

               Dennis suddenly THROWS his body against Adcox, knocking him 
               clear just as a flame EXPLODES DOWNWARD from the ceiling 
               fully against him as -- All the building's windows BLOW OUT 
               and it's like the sky's erupted for Brian, a burning hailstorm 
               that falls and pelts the ground around him. Plaster, wood, 
               and something metal that cracks against the pavement and 
               spins slowly.

               A fire helmet.

               And Adcox is coming out the door now, blackened and torn, 
               hopeless tears streaming down his face.

                                     AXE
                         Get us some backup! We need some 
                         goddamn backup!

               And, spotting Brian, he runs towards him. And the helmet 
               spins and spins and Adcox keeps running, and the sky is 
               raining fire, and the flame on the roof has risen up now to 
               its full, horrifying size and it's laughing now, laughing at 
               the little boy as the helmet finally stops spinning, and we 
               read the printing on the neck guard.

               MCCAFFREY

               And Adcox is sobbing and has his arms around the boy, 
               protecting him from the fire, the world, but it's like Brian 
               doesn't see him. He pulls away from Adcox, walks up to his 
               father's helmet, And puts it on.

               The scene EXPLODES with a flash as a photographer captures 
               the instant.

               INT. SEEDY APARTMENT - DAY

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. BRIAN'S CAR - DAY

               Hold on the freeze-frame. Let it become an aged cover of 
               LIFE. The magazine jiggles and rocks and we see now it's 
               sitting atop a box of knick-knacks jostling in the back seat 
               of an aging BMW. There's plenty of other boxes here, a live 
               on the move, and in the driver's seat, BRIAN McCAFFREY, now 
               27. There's piles of empty burger wrappers, Coke cans, and 
               Florida knick-knacks on the dash board; a little blow-up 
               palm tree, a cheesy hula girl emblazoned with "McCaffrey 
               High-End Stereo Sales".

               EXT. HIGHWAY - MONTAGE - DAY

               Brian and his battered BMW shoot past prairie, cow country, 
               nervous suburbs and finally a sign: WELCOME TO CHICAGO.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Wind tugging at his bangs, Brian stares down at the graves 
               of Dennis and Mary Elizabeth McCaffrey.

               INT. CHICAGO GAS STATION RESTROOM - DAY

               In a crusty sink he combs his hair, knots a tie around his 
               neck.

               EXT. CHICAGO FIRE DEPARTMENT TRAINING ACADEMY - DAY

               Brian walks through its sculpted columns, straightening his 
               tie. He comes to a door, FIRE ACADEMY CHIEF. He takes a deep 
               breath, steadies his gaze, and enters.

               INT. FIRE ACADEMY CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY

               The ACADEMY CHIEF sits at his desk going over a file. Out 
               the window can be heard a FIRE TRAINING CLASS in action.

                                     CHIEF FITZGERALD
                         Is this a joke?

               Brian's sitting in the seat opposite.

                                     BRIAN
                         If it was a joke, sir, you'd be 
                         laughing.

                                     CHIEF FITZGERALD
                         You walked out on this academy six 
                         years ago. One week to graduation. 
                         You think we forgot that? You think 
                         I did?

                                     BRIAN
                         I want another shot, Sir.

                                     CHIEF FITZGERALD
                              (beat)
                         Look, everybody remembers your old 
                         man. Being his son, all you had to 
                         do was breathe to graduate here. 
                         Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew 
                         us off. Why should I take you back?

                                     BRIAN
                         If you remember, sir, my test scores 
                         were in the top --

                                     CHIEF FITZGERALD
                         -- I don't give a damn what your 
                         test scores were, maybe you could 
                         have been a good firemen, but you 
                         had your shot.

                                     BRIAN
                         I need another one, sir.

                                     CHIEF FITZGERALD
                         Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try 
                         again next year.

                                     BRIAN
                         No, it isn't out of your hands or 
                         you wouldn't even have met me. If I 
                         push you have to let me back in. 
                         Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.

                                     CHIEF FITZGERALD
                              (simmers)
                         Even if you graduate this academy, 
                         you've still got nine months of 
                         probation. That's hard duty, son. If 
                         you don't really love this job, it'll 
                         kill you.

                                     BRIAN
                              (rises)
                         See you Monday. Sir.

               As we hear the BLOW OF A WHISTLE

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CHICAGO FIRE DEPT. TRAINING ACADEMY - GRADUATION DAY

               And everybody lined up at attention in dress blues.

                                     CHIEF FITZGERALD
                              (at podium)
                         Though the world changes every day, 
                         some things are truly forever: 
                         Courage, devotion, and honor in what 
                         we do. This class is a special one, 
                         for we dedicate it to the three 
                         firefighters that have fallen this 
                         year: Donald Knowlton, Richard Walter 
                         and Michael Petzold...
                              (silent beat)
                         Ladies and gentlemen, it is with 
                         pleasure that I certify that Candidate 
                         Class number 322, having successfully 
                         completed all academy requirements, 
                         are hereby graduated to the Chicago 
                         Fire Department.

               Candidates and their relatives CHEER and leap to their feet. 
               Something struggles inside of Brian. He doesn't stand at 
               first. Another Candidate, TIM, 20, looks at him strangely. 
               So does the Academy Chief, his eyes finding Brian's. And 
               Brian's standing slowly now, joining them...

               EXT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

               An expensive one. We hear a window BREAK.

               INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

               Through the dimness a file cabinet. An AXE SUDDENLY SLAMS 
               into it, RIPPING it apart. Files crash to the floor. And a 
               picture. 1970. Four young guys marlin fishing. Time of their 
               lives.

               INT. BROWNSTONE BEDROOM - NIGHT

               And a GREY PUTTY being SLAPPED along the edges of a door.

               INT. PUB - NIGHT

               A split-level firemen's dive; complete with mounted axes and 
               personalized T-shirts from various engine companies proudly 
               declaring "LADDER CO. 6 -- AXE FIRST, HOSE LATER" and "CHICAGO 
               FD, 150 YEARS OF TRADITION UNIMPEDED BY PROGRESS".

               Tonight the place is firmly in the hands of an army of 
               recently graduated candidates. A few on the back patio have 
               hooked up a charged hoseline and are taking potshots at 
               balloon targets, each other, the neighbor's cat. Brian and 
               Tim, still in their uniforms, enter from the street. Survey 
               the scene.

                                     BRIAN
                         Completely out of control.

                                     TIM
                         What the hell are we waiting for?

               As they shoulder their way inside, another CANDIDATE appears 
               holding proudly a fistful of sealed envelopes.

                                     CANDIDATE
                         Hot off the presses, guys. Station 
                         assignments.

               Tim and everyone else but Brian eagerly tear into them. Brian 
               nonchalantly shoulders up to the bar.

                                     BRIAN
                         A beer, Willy!

               The barkeep turns and smiles.

                                     WILLY
                         Well, if it isn't the littlest 
                         McCaffrey.
                              (to candidates with 
                              hose)
                         Hey! You break anything with that 
                         you buy it!
                              (to Brian)
                         Sorry, there must be something wrong 
                         with my eyes. I keep thinking that's 
                         a fire department uniform.

                                     BRIAN
                         It's in my blood, Willy.

               The candidates are ripping open their assignments, exclaiming 
               to each other: "All right! Engine 117! That's a slum! They 
               get cookers every day!". "Oh no, Engine 10, that's a nice 
               neighborhood"...

               Willy turns to the bulletin board behind him and unpins a 
               stack of business cards.

                                     WILLY
                         Really. Well, let's have a look at 
                         what else was "in your blood". I 
                         always look forward to getting these, 
                         they make such a nice collage for 
                         the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, 
                         Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."

                                     BRIAN
                         Didn't offer the kinda growth and 
                         challenge I need.

                                     WILLY
                         Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile 
                         Log Cabins". That was in your blood 
                         about six months wasn't it?

                                     BRIAN
                         Management were pin heads.

                                     WILLY
                         "Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?

                                     BRIAN
                         Coffee sucked.

                                     WILLY
                         And just this year, "Brian's Sound 
                         Spectrum". Your own company even. 
                         Big step.

                                     BRIAN
                         I was ahead of my time.

                                     WILLY
                         You know, I've got a perfect little 
                         spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, 
                         Fireman"...

               Tim holds an envelope marked McCAFFREY out to Brian.

                                     TIM
                         Aren't you even curious?

                                     BRIAN
                         Engine 115, right?

                                     TIM
                              (opens it, surprised)
                         How'd you know? These are supposed 
                         to be sealed.

                                     BRIAN
                         Lucky guess.
                              (winks)
                         And a case of scotch to a captain in 
                         station assignments.

                                     TIM
                         You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?

                                     BRIAN
                         Lots of fires. They promote faster 
                         there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s 
                         list, half the guys on it came from 
                         that battalion. Gotta think about 
                         your future, Timmy. 115's the station.

                                     TIM
                         Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your 
                         way into a station, why not 17 with 
                         me and your brother?

               On Brian's reaction

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               A Porsche knifes through darkened streets. The DRIVER, 50, 
               is dressed for success. Pulling up to the brownstone we saw 
               earlier, he gets out and rubs his eyes. Another day in the 
               salt mines.

               Climbing the short stairs, he sticks his key into the lock 
               and opens the door. It is the last thing he will ever do.

               A THUNDERING EXPLOSION ENGULFS the stoop.

               INT. PUB - NIGHT

               The place is packed now with girls flirting with the 
               candidates, putting their helmets on, etc. The horseplay 
               around the bar suddenly stops at the sweet sound of a SIREN.

               EXT. PUB - NIGHT

               Everyone steps outside, cocks an ear. And here it comes, the 
               real thing, SCREECHING past in a full-tilt rush. Shouts and 
               raised toasts.

                                     TIM
                         Hey, that's my cousin's company! 
                         C'mon! Let's go!

               As Brian turns, he suddenly confronted by an elderly 
               LITHUANIAN WOMAN.

                                     BRIAN
                              (surprised)
                         Mrs. Viatkus...

               She grabs his cheeks and rattles off in Lithuanian. Brian 
               can only smile. Then two attractive jean-clad legs step up. 
               JENNIFER.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                              (surprised)
                         Jennifer.

                                     JENNIFER
                         You're back.

                                     BRIAN
                         You look great.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Thanks for calling.

                                     BRIAN
                         Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low 
                         profile... the academy... I graduated 
                         today.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Huh.

                                     BRIAN
                         So... I see you're still in the 
                         neighborhood.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Not quite. Just visiting. I live in 
                         Lincoln Park now.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah? What have you been up to?

                                     JENNIFER
                         I work for city hall.

                                     BRIAN
                         Really? No kidding.

                                     JENNIFER
                         What, you think I just dried up and 
                         blew away when you left? The world 
                         does turn once in awhile Brian, even 
                         without your permission.

               Just then, Tim OPENS UP the hoseline, DRENCHING Brian.

                                     TIM
                         Don't want you overheating, Brian!

               Brian ducks the stream and PULLS a length of hose near his 
               feet, FLIPPING Tim. Brian JUMPS him, shuts off the hose and 
               pins him to the pavement.

                                     TIM
                         Okay okay! Uncle!

               Brian walks back toward Jennifer

                                     JENNIFER
                         You've certainly matured.

               She turns to leave.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well, if nothing else, it's nice to 
                         know we can still be friends.

                                     JENNIFER
                         I don't want to be your friend, Brian.

               Another in a series of fire engines HOWL past. Tim grabs 
               Brian by the shoulder.

                                     TIM
                         Let's go, man!

               EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

               Brian and Tim jump into Brian's car. They shoot blindly down 
               the street looking for the fire engine, running down red 
               lights or anything else that gets in their way. Brian suddenly 
               hits the brakes, SCREECHING to a stop. They roll down their 
               windows. Far off can be heard the wind-up of a siren.

                                     TIM
                              (points)
                         That way.

               EXT. STREETS - FIRE ENGINE - NIGHT

               SCREECH. They fly around a corner, down a block, and there 
               it is, lights flashing up ahead. Brian GUNS it, roars up 
               alongside the fire engine. Tim leans out the window, shakes 
               a bottle of beer, and lets loose a foamy eruption in the 
               truck driver's face.

                                     DRIVER
                         Tim! You crazy motherfucker!

               But he's laughing.

                                     TIM
                         What'cha got?

                                     DRIVER
                         Box alarm. Walton Ave.

                                     TIM
                         We'll meet ya.

               EXT. BROWNSTONE - WALTON AVENUE - NIGHT

               As Brian and Tim pull up two engine companies are already 
               dragging lines toward the rolling brownstone we saw explode 
               earlier. Tim cheers the firemen on like a drive-in movie.

               Brian watches the fire with uneasy fascination. Embers 
               whipping into the night, drifting to the ground around him.

               One of the engine companies is entering the doorway now. He 
               watches as they willingly crawl into a place any sane person 
               would run for their life from. Jesus Christ. FLASH -- Brian 
               turns at the blinding snap of a camera. Several locals are 
               gathered around a parked car, some taking pictures. Brian 
               notices that right away. It takes a beat longer to notice 
               the CHARRED CORPSE stuffed head-first through the windshield. 
               It's the Porsche driver, his legs sticking out at crazy 
               angles. A dog barks furiously at it.

                                     TIM
                              (also looking at body)
                         Man. Something sure put a crimp in 
                         his evening.

                                     BRIAN
                         Backdraft.

               The brownstone fire quickly transforms itself into noisy 
               clouds of dirty white steam. And one of the firemen is coming 
               back out now, walking toward Brian.

               When he's just a few yards away he pulls off his air mask 
               and helmet and we shudder with Brian, because the man is a 
               dead ringer for HIS FATHER.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Well, look what we have here. Nice 
                         costume. Rent it?

                                     BRIAN
                         I want to thank you for coming to my 
                         graduation, Stephen. It was a great 
                         inspiration to me.

                                     STEPHEN
                         So you're going to fight fires now, 
                         huh?

               He pats Brian's cheeks, leaving behind large charcoal smears.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (re smears)
                         Doesn't work on you.
                              (turns to leave)
                         See ya around, little brother.

                                     BRIAN
                         Not likely.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (turns)
                         Well, see you're wrong already. Had 
                         a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we 
                         decided in the interest of brotherly 
                         love, that maybe you shouldn't be 
                         way over on the other side of town. 
                         So starting tomorrow, your assigned 
                         to company 17. My company.
                              (Brian's color drops 
                              a hue)
                         One case of scotch, you're getting 
                         cheap in your old age, Brian...

               And Stephen turns for his own men, Tim staring at Brian as 
               clouds of smoke drift past like ghosts.

               EXT. BROWNSTONE - ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT

               A flame LEAPS up into the foreground. Touches a cigarette. 
               The cigarette glows, lingers, then lowers slowly from the 
               mouth of RIMGALE, fifty-five years old and six and a half 
               feet of solid granite. Wearing a windbreaker and grey slacks 
               tucked into fire department rubber boots, he takes another 
               slow drag. Looks at the body stuffed into the windshield. 
               It's twenty yards away from the brownstone. Stephen looks up 
               as Rimgale drops the cigarette, crushes it with his boot, 
               and crosses the street to the building.

               INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

               Charred walls hiss and snap in the steamy darkness. Rimgale 
               is there, gloomy in the beam of his flashlight. He crouches 
               down, plays his flashlight along the ruined baseboard.

                                     SHADOW
                         If you stare any longer Stevie, I'll 
                         start charging you admission.

               Stephen is leaning in the doorway, watching him.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Got a cause?

                                     SHADOW
                         Are the glory boys actually showing 
                         interest in Investigation's work? I 
                         may have a stroke.

                                     STEPHEN
                         The glory boys just want to finish 
                         their report so they can go home.

               Rimgale's flashlight finds a wall socket that he pries loose 
               and holds up to the light. He lowers it, takes in the walls, 
               the room.

                                     SHADOW
                         They're gonna have to wait a few 
                         days on this one.

               EXT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

               Tim's talking to his cousin. Brian hangs back, watches the 
               body-bag people load the Porsche driver into a meat wagon. 
               There's a still an audience for this, still stray dogs 
               circling and barking. Brian walks up, looks inside the car, 
               and sees on a seat the ragged remains of a FINGER.

                                     BRIAN
                              (to coroner crew)
                         Hey, you forgot... this.

               They're already climbing into the wagon. The driver smiles 
               creepily.

                                     CORONER DRIVER
                         We always leave something for the 
                         dogs.

               Brian looks across the fireground, sees his brother walking 
               back to the fire engine. They share a brief, edgy glance.

               EXT. HOUSE - DAY

               A modest one. South-side Irish old fashioned. Brian walks 
               up. There's a little kid, about five, playing with a toy 
               fire truck on the drive.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey, Sean. What's goin' on, man?

               The kid stares at him without a glimmer of recognition.

                                     BRIAN
                         It's Uncle Brian. Y'know.

               He makes his hand into a talking puppet.

                                     BRIAN
                              (bandito accent)
                         "Spinach? We don't need no stinking 
                         spinach". Remember?

               The kid drops his toy truck and flees inside.

                                     KID
                         Mom! Mom!

               INT. HELEN'S HOUSE

               Brian follows, sticks his head in the door.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hellooo...

               A warm looking woman, 30's, HELEN, comes around the corner.

                                     HELEN
                         Brian?

                                     BRIAN
                         Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.

                                     HELEN
                         You look like... Brian.

               She gives him a tentative hug.

                                     HELEN
                         'Bout written you off. How long have 
                         you been in town?

                                     BRIAN
                         Four months.

                                     HELEN
                         Four months?

                                     BRIAN
                         I know, I know, Should'a called. 
                         I've been really busy. I joined the 
                         fire department.

               Helen's expression suddenly saddens.

                                     HELEN
                         Oh Brian...
                              (beat)
                         You guys... you really know how to 
                         put each other through it, don't 
                         you?

               The little kid is peeking fearfully from the kitchen doorway.

                                     BRIAN
                         That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.

                                     HELEN
                         Yeah, you'd be surprised what three 
                         years can do to a kid.

                                     BRIAN
                         Sean, come on out, man. What, you 
                         forget your favorite uncle?

                                     HELEN
                         Stephen told him you were killed in 
                         a hot tub accident.

                                     SEAN
                              (intense)
                         Dad was kidding, Mom.

               And the kid runs unexpectedly away, angry.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well that's two things to strangle 
                         Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?

                                     HELEN
                              (beat)
                         Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. 
                         He moved out last April.

               An embarrassed sting.

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh, man, I'm sorry.

                                     HELEN
                         You guys ought to try picking up a 
                         phone once in awhile.

               EXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - MARINA - DAY

               A small one on the river. Several boats bob peacefully. Except 
               one. Raised high in dry-dock, it's an ancient fishing trawler. 
               Bachman-Turner-Overdrive drifts up from the galley on badly 
               fuzzed speakers as Brian climbs the ladder.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey.

               Stripped to the waist, Stephen's bent-over cleaning out the 
               guts of the inboard motor. He looks confused to see Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         I talked to Helen...

               Wrong thing to say. Stephen turns back to his work.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...Man, I thought dad's boat was 
                         finally retired to the family 
                         graveyard. Don't you worry about 
                         falling out of this thing?

               Stephen straightens up, his forearms smudged with grease. 
               Brian admires the unwashed cereal bowls and peeling deck 
               paint.

                                     BRIAN
                         I like what you've done with the 
                         place.

                                     STEPHEN
                         It's comin' along... want a beer?

               Stephen tosses him a beer from the fridge. As Brian pops it, 
               he sees the small pile of city-issue gallon size cans in the 
               corner. Armorall, solvent, extinguisher foam.

                                     BRIAN
                         Been ripping off fire stations?

                                     STEPHEN
                         It's old stuff Adcox gave me that 
                         the department was going to throw 
                         out anyway. Still good enough though 
                         for this tub.

               Brian winces at the music coming out of shot speakers.

                                     BRIAN
                         Bachman Turner Overdrive?
                              (looks through music 
                              rack)
                         ...Buffalo Springfield?... Stephen 
                         Bishop? Oh man...

               Brian lifts one of the tapes -- an 8-track -- and holds it 
               carefully in his palm as if it were a rare and fragile relic.

                                     BRIAN
                         My God, an actual operating 8-track.

                                     STEPHEN
                         What, you've never seen one before?

                                     BRIAN
                         In the Field Museum once.

                                     STEPHEN
                         It works.

                                     BRIAN
                         It worked when you were in sixth 
                         grade.

               INT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - DAY

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               EXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - DAY

               Brian opens the trunk of his old BMW. It's full of stereo 
               boxes marked BRIAN'S "SOUND SPECTRUM".

               INT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - CABIN - DAY

               Brian's gutted the speakers and is re-wiring them.

                                     STEPHEN
                         People actually used to pay you for 
                         this?

                                     BRIAN
                         Millions, Stephen -- And sexual 
                         favors.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Sheep don't count.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah? What about Laura --

                                     STEPHEN
                         That was never proved.

               Brian moves over to another speaker.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Why'd you come here, Brian?

                                     BRIAN
                         I wanted to know why you messed with 
                         my station assignment. I mean, is 
                         this really gonna have to one of 
                         those big brother -- little brother 
                         "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still 
                         pissed" games?

                                     STEPHEN
                              (sighs)
                         What is it with you, man, huh? How 
                         do you manage to keep coming up with 
                         new and amazing ways to screw up? 
                         That scotch bullshit? Am I really 
                         supposed to believe you came crawling 
                         back home because you suddenly felt 
                         heart strings moan for the family 
                         biz? You were bankrupt, man.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey! You don't know me --

                                     STEPHEN
                         I know you cold, Brian. The scary 
                         thing is, you probably could have 
                         faked it for awhile. But you see, in 
                         this job there's no place to hide. 
                         Isn't like selling log cabins. You 
                         have a bad day here -- someone dies. 
                         And that's not fucking good enough. 
                         Want another beer?

                                     BRIAN
                         So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna 
                         ride my ass till I cough blood?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Big bad brother is going to treat 
                         you like any other probie -- that I 
                         don't think is going to make it.

               Brian staples the last of the audio cord in place and switches 
               on the tape player. The cabin fills with sharp, crystal clear --
               Stephen Bishop.

                                     BRIAN
                         There's only so much technology can 
                         do.
                              (picks up his tool 
                              box)
                         Thanks for the beer.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Thanks for the speakers.

               EXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - DAY

               Brian climbs down off the boat. Looks up at Stephen.

                                     BRIAN
                         Y'know, I told myself a million times 
                         I didn't want to be a fireman. I 
                         said bullshit to that line about 
                         tradition and family legacy. I know 
                         I split, and I know how you felt...

                                     STEPHEN
                         Yeah, you know. You know what it 
                         felt like.

                                     BRIAN
                         I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta 
                         know.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I think you're gonna find out, Brian. 
                         Don't be late tomorrow.

               INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING

               A simple one-room walk-up. A stereo blares Chicago blues as 
               Brian buttons up his uniform in the mirror. He steps back, 
               looks at himself, -- and oh man what the hell am I doing...

               EXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - STREET - MORNING

               Brian climbs into his car, turns the key -- nothing. He gets 
               out, looks under the hood, then SLAMS it down in frustration.

               INT. ELEVATED TRAIN - MORNING

               A pissed-off Chicago, hauling itself off to work in the 
               morning snap, passes by Brian's window. Tough Midwestern 
               brick. Tough Midwesterners. Heads-down in their 150 year war 
               with a wind committed to pushing the whole damn thing into 
               Lake Michigan.

               EXT. EL STATION - MORNING

               The train clacking away above him, Brian walks down the 
               sidewalk carrying his fire equipment. He turns a corner and 
               comes on.

               EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - MORNING

               Brian stands there. It's his dad's station. Turn of the 
               century abused. Sooty with stone gargoyles and a pair of 
               faded red doors that suddenly CRANK OPEN as Brian comes up 
               the drive. Fire engine 17 and ladder truck 46, lights 
               flashing, pull out onto the apron.

               The fireman sticking his head out of the passenger window is 
               Stephen. One look at the silver trumpet on his collar and we 
               know this isn't Fireman McCaffrey but Fire LT. McCaffrey.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You're too late, probie.

               Tim, in ladder truck 46, waves a small bye-bye as both rigs 
               begin heading down the street.

                                     BRIAN
                              (chasing)
                         Goddamn it, Stephen...

               Brian bolts full-out for the engine. At the last instant 
               before he falls on his face a fireman reaches out and drags 
               him aboard.

               INT./EXT. FIRE ENGINE 17 - DAY

               It's Adcox, the fireman from the first scene, now a veteran.

                                     AXE
                         Why baby McCaffrey, how ya doin'?

               The Pumper driver, SCHMIDT, pops in a howling ROCK TUNE as 
               they zoom off.

                                     SCHMIDT
                              (re Brian to Adcox)
                         You know this rug rat?

                                     AXE
                         Know him? I practically raised him.
                              (Jewish mom)
                         And he never calls, he never writes...

               Brian shouts over the noise to GRINDLE, 35, one more seat 
               down.

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm Brian.

                                     GRINDLE
                         I'm sorry.

               Grindle sticks his nose out the window, sniffs, then begins 
               buckling up his coat.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Boys, I do believe we have a 
                         barbecue...

               As Brian and Adcox fasten up their own equipment --

               EXT. FACTORY - DAY

               Smoke pours with confused indecision from every window of a 
               five story factory as the pumper and ladder company pull up.

                                     GRINDLE
                              (staring at confusing 
                              smoke)
                         I hate it when we gotta fucking go 
                         look for it.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to Schmidt)
                         Call in another alarm. We're gonna 
                         need some back-up.

               Everyone begins strapping on air tanks and masks. Adcox drags 
               the rig's suction line to the hydrant. A beautiful illegally 
               parked Mercedes is blocking the way.

                                     AXE
                              (to Stephen)
                         Oh these moments do try me...

                                     STEPHEN
                              (admiring car)
                         Be gentle.

               Whistling to himself, Adcox SMASHES the brass coupling through 
               the passenger window, runs the line through and SMASHES it 
               out the other window before connecting up to the hydrant.

               Stephen and Grindle pull hose off the bed and move out. 
               Brian's so jacked up he can't get his air tank on right. 
               Schmidt calmly helps him into his gear.

                                     SCHMIDT
                         It's only rock 'n roll, kid.

               Stephen, Adcox and Grindle are crouched at the door, ready 
               to go. Brian takes a hose roll and runs to catch up when 
               he's cut-off by dazed Latin workers shouting incoherently at 
               him in SPANISH.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hey, probie! How 'bout it, huh?

               Brian pushes past the workers and takes his position on the 
               hose line. Stephen reaches over and re-adjusts Brian's air 
               tank strap.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You're doing it wrong.

               Stephen eases the door open. Thick smoke rolls sickly out 
               over their heads.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to Brian)
                         Stay beside me.

               And in they go...

               INT. BURNING FACTORY - DAY

               Inside the smoke is like liquid lead. Going by feel, they 
               hump the hose up one staircase after another, crawling on 
               their hands and knees toward a dull red glow. Turning a 
               corner, they enter

               INT. BURNING FACTORY - A VAST ROOM - DAY

               Totally ablaze. Brian looks up in wonder at the buffeting 
               waves of flame in the ceiling, at the SCREECHING timbers 
               crumbling to the white-hot floor. At the walls HOWLING in 
               bestial agony. It is the most horrifying, and wonderful thing 
               he has ever seen.

                                     AXE
                         Wash it to the windows?

                                     STEPHEN
                         No, we'll hit the son of a bitch 
                         head on.

                                     AXE
                         It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta 
                         get behind it.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. 
                         It'll just steam on us. It won't 
                         flash. Go high in the ceiling.

               Adcox and Grindle shrug and pull their helmets down tight, 
               expecting the worst. Adcox opens up the nozzle, turning loose 
               a high pressure BLAST OF WATER into the ceiling. The fire 
               SCREAMS in manic anger and HEAVES a cloud of HOWLING steam 
               that WHIRLS back and BAKES them like lobsters. Brian gasps 
               for air as swirling ash batters his facemask. A window 
               somewhere EXPLODES. Somebody shouts. Christ, you can't see 
               anything. Stephen HOOPS in victory.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to fire)
                         I knew you were a pussy! C'mon! Steam 
                         us!
                              (to firemen)
                         Let's go!

               The chase is on! Going for the throat while the fire's 
               confused and defensive, the firemen SCRAMBLE through the 
               boiling cloud. They hit it in the ceiling, in the walls, 
               forcing it back and back. It HOWLS and CLAWS in anger, 
               furiously throwing cinders and broken timbers in their faces. 
               The walls ECHO with its SCREAMS as it retreats to a corner.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Ya love it, probie?

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm in heaven, Lt.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hook us up to a stand-pipe.

               Brian runs back to the wall to hook up his hose roll to the 
               building water system. He goes to unscrew the cap with his 
               hydrant wrench but it keeps slipping off the nut.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Jesus, how 'bout man, huh? We're 
                         gonna loose this!

               Brian finally gets it hooked up and runs back.

               EXT. FACTORY - OTHER SIDE - DAY

               Tim and three guys from his ladder company, come up an 
               extended aerial ladder, CRASH through a window and

               INT. FACTORY - DAY

               begin HACKING their way toward Brian's company as -- BOOM! 
               It's a sudden, shattering vibration that shakes the building 
               to its foundations. Then, a sucking sound: RUSH-RUSH-RUSH... 
               Stephen speaks calmly into his radio handset.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hey Otis, is it...?

                                     SCHMIDT
                              (into radio)
                         Yeah.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Goddamn it, where's our backup? 
                         Where's the second-in companies?

                                     SCHMIDT'S VOICE
                         Sorry, man. John Wayne time.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to firemen)
                         Dig in!

               The firemen hesitate. PENGELLY, the Truck Company Lt., looks 
               at Stephen with concern.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Dig in, goddamn it!

               The crews immediately gather in the center of the floor. 
               They turn over tables, chairs, anything to form a barrier. A 
               circling of the wagons. -- BOOM! rush-rush-rush -- BOOM! 
               Each louder than the last. Stephen and Brian are ducked behind 
               an overturned desk. Adcox and Krizminski clutch hoselines 
               like frontiersmen's Winchesters.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You're gonna love this.

               -- rush-rush-rush -- CRAAAASH!! On an instant the world comes 
               apart as all four walls of factory windows EXPLODE in a hail 
               of glass. A wave of HOWLING FLAME POURS IN after it, SHRIEKING 
               and HISSING.

               At the same moment, part of the floor beside a heavy sewing 
               machine GIVES WAY and a ladderman, SANTOS, FALLS THROUGH, 
               grabbing the edges at the last minute as flames BELLOW UP 
               from underneath. He SCREAMS as his grip loosens.

               Grindle leaps to the ladderman's side, grabbing his arms and 
               coat. Brian hesitates just an instant and Stephen SHOVES him 
               out of the way to back up Grindle.

                                     SANTOS
                         Help... Oh God...

               Adcox's taken the hoseline and is opening fire. Water and 
               flame crash and snarl across the floor in a blood curdling 
               ROAR. It's a thrashing, murderous standoff.

               Stephen and Grindle have got Santos but the angle's bad. 
               Blow it now and all three could take a header. Santos is 
               panicking, losing his grip. Grindle bores his eyes into the 
               man's with the calm and conviction of Moses.

                                     GRINDLE
                         You go, we go.

               They may all die, but they won't leave him. He calms a little, 
               hangs on till they PULL him out of harm's way. Adcox continues 
               with the hose as suddenly, everyone HITS the deck as the 
               fire EXPLODES over them, BURSTING their coats into flame. 
               Tim's company opens up their line, WASHING everybody down 
               before CHARGING after the fire. A ladderman, NIGHTENGALE, 
               steps on Brian's back.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey!

                                     NIGHTENGALE
                         Sorry man, I thought you were dead.

               Brian, stunned, sits up, his coat and helmet smoking. Stephen 
               seems totally unaffected and is already on his feet and over 
               the top of the barricade, the others backing him as he 
               mercilessly drives the fire back, trapping it finally into a 
               corner. The fire hisses, spits, shakes the walls with its 
               furious anger. But it's all bluster now, the fire's dying.

                                     PENGELLY
                              (ladder co. captain)
                         Stephen! BC's on the radio. Says 
                         they think a civilian got left behind 
                         downstairs.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Adcox! Take Tim and do a search.

               Adcox leads Tim downstairs. Brian looks shaken up. Stephen 
               helps him roughly to his feet.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Don't you fold on me now, man.

               Brian burns at that and shakes his brother's arm off.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Clear the hose for me.

               Brian's walking over to clear the hoseline when he hears it. 
               small voice. Faint. "Help me..."

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey, I think it's coming from a 
                         different staircase.

               Nobody hears. -- Brian takes off down the other steps on his 
               own.

               INT. BURNING FACTORY - DOWNSTAIRS

               It's only the fire's ghost here, lazy and slow.

               Off the corridor are rooms full of commercial sewing machines. 
               Brian enters one and drops to his knees.

               Looks under a table, flashes his light behind a work stand. 
               Nothing. He turns to backtrack his way out when A TONGUE OF 
               FLAME suddenly LEAPS up through the floor in front of him, 
               cutting off the door. Brian lands on his ass as it hisses 
               and giggles and dances unreally in front of him.

               I never forget a face, kid. -- That fire from childhood. He 
               could maybe force his way through but Jesus, the way it looks 
               at him --

               -- Brian ROLLS away from it. Looks for another doorway -- 
               And ends up in thick smoke. He drops to a crawl, stays on 
               his belly where the air's clear. When he sees it. Behind 
               some furniture. Something flesh-colored. Shit. It's a body. 
               He crawls up closer. It's a woman. Adrenalin pounding the 
               top of his skull off, he grabs her and stumbles back down 
               the hall, makes a turn --

                                     BRIAN
                         I got one!

               EXT. FACTORY - DAY

               -- And now he's bursting from the building onto a short fire 
               escape, shouting at the top of his lungs.

                                     BRIAN
                         I got somebody! I got somebody!

               A sea of media flashbulbs ERUPTS in his face. The press have 
               arrived in force, crowding the street. Brian pushes through 
               them to a clear spot on the far side of the engine. Two fire 
               paramedics rush over as he lowers the figure.

                                     BRIAN
                         Is she... Is she alive?

               The paramedics suddenly stop their efforts. Turn to Brian.

                                     PARAMEDIC
                         I'm afraid you're a little too late 
                         with this one.

               They step aside. Brian looks down. The woman looks strange. 
               Mostly because she's a heavy store DRESSING DUMMY. The 
               paramedics burst into laughter. Brian, looking pale and 
               shaken, turns and walks away. He passes Grindle and Tim, 
               sitting on the pumper's tailboard helping the REAL woman 
               that was found inside.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Sorry to hear about the mannequin. I 
                         heard you two were close.

               Photographers have appeared and are flashing the woman. Dizzy, 
               Brian wanders off, tries to help out with the choking clog 
               of singed factory employees before finally turning quickly 
               into

               EXT. FACTORY ALLEY - ACROSS THE STREET - DAY

               Where he barfs his guts out in private. Doubled-over, one 
               arm on the brick wall for support, we see the raw terror. 
               The demons rushing out of him.

                                     BRIAN
                         Shit...

               Someone else does too. Jennifer. Dressed now in a long 
               expensive coat, she's standing at the end of the alley with 
               a clipboard. Brian, ashes smeared across an ashen face, 
               spittle on his chin, doesn't notice her.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (appearing beside him)
                         You all right?

               Stephen isn't pale. He's flushed and buoyant. All this hasn't 
               taken anything from him. It's made his day.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah. Fine. I'm a little busy right 
                         now.

               Stephen leans against the wall. Folds his arms.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Y'know, you got an awful short memory 
                         for direct orders. I told you to 
                         stay beside me.

                                     BRIAN
                         -- C'mon, Stephen.

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- You split the team, man. And what 
                         was that crap with the standpipe? 
                         You'd think you and a hose were never 
                         introduced before.

               Stephen turns to leave. Brian yells after him.

                                     BRIAN
                         Goddamn it Stephen!

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- I told you to stay next to me!

                                     BRIAN
                         -- I was doin' it! I was up there 
                         fucking doin' it. You don't know, 
                         man, you don't know what I did!

                                     STEPHEN
                         What you did was drop the ball, 
                         Probie. Get that right.

                                     PENGELLY
                              (from end of alley)
                         Hey! Stevie! They're callin' for ya.

               Stephen turns to walk away. Pauses.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Bet 30,000 dollars a year and twenty 
                         two days a month off sounded pretty 
                         good twelve weeks ago, huh?

               As Stephen leaves, we see that Jennifer's been standing at 
               the end of the alley, listening to them. She's turns and 
               walks as Brian looks up. We register his surprise. He watches 
               her head toward a dynamic-looking guy in his 40s, ALDERMAN 
               SWAYZAK, surrounded by reporters.

               EXT. BURNED BUILDING - FRONT - DAY

                                     SWAYZAK
                              (to reporters)
                         Roger, Paul... How's it going, guys?

                                     REPORTER
                         Another fire in this district. Getting 
                         to be Cinder Alley up here.

                                     JENNIFER
                              (walking up)
                         You used that last week.

               She hands Swayzak a clipboard.

                                     AXE
                              (yelling down from 
                              window)
                              (to Brian)
                         Hey! Probie! We're still workin' 
                         here, man.

               INT. BURNED BUILDING

               Brian and the rest of the company rip open the walls and 
               beat the last weak flames in a final flurry of dingy sparks.

               The moment the smoke clears just a fraction, cigarettes appear 
               in everyone's mouth. Was it good for you? The talk is easy 
               and obscene, the intense camaraderie of shared danger. Ash 
               clods are thrown playfully back and forth in the afterglow 
               of having taken on the worst there is and walking away one 
               more time.

                                     GRINDLE
                              (to Adcox)
                         Stephen man, what's going through 
                         that guy's head? Takin' it on in the 
                         first room... this shit's happening 
                         too often. It could've flashed. 
                         Should've flashed.

                                     AXE
                         But it didn't. Guy knows.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Guy's lucky.

               Adcox sees Brian. Smiles.

                                     AXE
                         Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the 
                         clincher. You did okay.

                                     BRIAN
                         My Lt. might have something to say 
                         about that.

                                     AXE
                         Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. 
                         You're working for the toughest Lt. 
                         on the job. Saw him once pick up a 
                         probie he thought was moving too 
                         slow and throw him into a burning 
                         building. It's just bad luck you're 
                         family.

                                     BRIAN
                              (beat)
                         John, when you're in there... in the 
                         fire... do you ever see...

                                     STEPHEN
                              (from across room, 
                              interrupting)
                         C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...

                                     BRIAN
                              (to Adcox)
                         -- Never mind.

               Brian turns and sees out the window Jennifer and Swayzak 
               standing near Rimgale's red fire dept. sedan.

               EXT. FACTORY - DAY

               Rimgale walks up to his sedan.

                                     SHADOW
                         Alderman Swayzak.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Investigator Rimgale.

                                     SHADOW
                         I need to get in the trunk.

               Swayzak's leaning on it. We sense the dislike between them. 
               Swayzak steps aside. Rimgale pops the trunk.

                                     SHADOW
                         Awful expensive shoes to be wearing 
                         at a fireground, Alderman. But then 
                         I guess you haven't been to too many 
                         fires.

                                     JENNIFER
                         I wanted to talk to you about Alan 
                         Seagrave's death. We still haven't 
                         gotten a fire report from your office.

                                     SHADOW
                         You'll have an answer as soon as I 
                         do.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         People are asking how a prominent 
                         taxpayer got stuffed through the 
                         windshield of his own car. They're 
                         asking me.

                                     JENNIFER
                         --The point is, Investigator, you 
                         haven't even told us yet if the fire 
                         was accidental. We're starting to 
                         get the feeling your office is 
                         dragging out this case to embarrass 
                         the Alderman because of his fire 
                         dept. reorganization program --

                                     SHADOW
                         -- You mean his firehouse closing 
                         program, -- Don't you?

                                     JENNIFER
                         We'd just be very disappointed if it 
                         turned out your office was playing 
                         politics.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         -- Because I'm not. I care about 
                         this city, and I care about this 
                         department --

               Rimgale cuts him off with the shutting of his trunk lid.

                                     SHADOW
                              (calm of a monk)
                         Alderman, I have a remarkably 
                         uncomplicated job. To decide if a 
                         fire's arson, and if so catch the 
                         pain in the ass doing it. But to be 
                         honest, if my methodical investigative 
                         methods just happen to muck up the 
                         campaign of certain mayor wanna-bees, 
                         well, I guess I can't say I sleep 
                         any less peacefully.

               And he walks back to the burned building.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         I wish I could just fire the son of 
                         a bitch.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hey! Swayzak!

               Stephen's leaning out of an upstairs window. As the TV cameras 
               turn, he drops down onto a fire engine hose bed and pops 
               right into Swayzak's face with a murderous grin.

                                     STEPHEN
                         We almost lost a whole company up 
                         there, Swayzee buddy. Isn't any back-
                         up since you closed '33. And we really 
                         appreciate it, the guys and me. 
                         Honest. I know you've got my vote 
                         for mayor.

               Grindle and Santos start walking for Stephen. Brian's there, 
               following after them.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Look Lt., I'm on your side. If there's 
                         a problem, please, work with our 
                         task force to fix it.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Oh yeah, your famous task force... 
                         three guys have already died this 
                         year because of the cuts made by 
                         your "task force"...

                                     GRINDLE
                         Stevie, c'mon man...

               Stephen silences Grindle with an outstretched hand. Swayzak 
               leans close, out of earshot of the cameras.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         You see that funny glow that's 
                         starting to blink in the corner of 
                         your eye, Lt? That's your career 
                         dissipation light -- and it just 
                         went into overtime.

                                     STEPHEN
                         If anybody's light's gonna blink, 
                         it's yours.

               Swayzak holds his ground. It's a tense, out of control moment 
               between them. Rimgale turns from his work, watches Stephen 
               with concern. Adcox suddenly inserts himself face-to-face 
               with Swayzak and we see the raw hatred.

                                     AXE
                         You're in firemanland now, Swayzak. 
                         Do yourself a favor and just walk 
                         away.

               Swayzak holds Adcox's gaze, then turns for his car. Brian 
               watches Jennifer climb in beside her boss.

                                     BRIAN
                         This is your city job?

               Jennifer shrugs as they pull away.

               INT./EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - LATE DAY

               Brian jumps down from the rig as it backs up the driveway. 
               Across the street a middle-aged woman flashes them from the 
               balcony of her apartment.

                                     AXE
                         That's Franny. She likes firemen.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Tim, fill out the alarm card.
                              (to Brian)
                         Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the 
                         ladders and hang some hose.

               Adcox watches Brian and Tim exchange looks. Tim shrugs. Brian 
               sighs and pulls out the pike poles, starts across the floor 
               before freezing suddenly at a murderous GROWL. Brian turns 
               and sees a DOG. Sort of. It has the rib cage of a wild beast, 
               fangs, long greasy hair. It blocks his way, SNARLING with 
               hate.

                                     GRINDLE
                         That's The Thing. You can't stay 
                         unless he likes you.

               Slobber drools out of its mouth as it GROWLS.

                                     BRIAN
                         Have you guys got something against 
                         dalmatians?

               Brian wipes some of the crusted grime from his face, looks 
               back and forth between Franny and The Thing, and sighs.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - BUNKROOM

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - LOCKER ROOM

               Brian enters, strips down his battered uniform, and opens 
               his locker. The mannequin from the fire SPRINGS OUT, legs 
               spread. A sign taped to its mouth says: "TAKE ME BRIAN, YOU'RE 
               MY SUPERMAN!"

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - WASHROOM

               Brian and the others scrub the morning's fire off their bodies 
               in the station shower. Tim keeps filling his mouth full of 
               water and launching it upward in a stream.

                                     BRIAN
                         Do you have to do that?

                                     TIM
                              (pumped)
                         Could you believe that fire? Man! 
                         First day! There I was, Adcox and 
                         me, pullin' that lady right out of 
                         the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it 
                         here -- No surround and drown for 
                         this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn 
                         Stephen's amazing. You see how he 
                         took that fire by the balls? I'm 
                         gonna be that good some day, you 
                         watch.

               Brian compares himself to the praise heaped on Stephen.

                                     TIM
                         Y'know what Stephen said to me, right 
                         when all the shit was coming hard? 
                         "You never know till the moment the 
                         fire stares you down if you're just 
                         gonna do this job or be great at 
                         it".

                                     BRIAN
                         Ah man, is he usin' that line now on 
                         you? What, you think he made that 
                         little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used 
                         to have to listen to my old man use 
                         that every morning.

               Brian shuts off his shower and walks out.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - BUNKROOM

               Stephen sits alone at his bunk, slowly stretching a strained 
               and ruined back. He blows out a long, tired breath, and begins 
               working ointment into an anciently scarred and battered knee.

               On the wall is a small glass case full of station memorabilia 
               through the years. There's a two battered fire helmets there, 
               set reverently on velvet. Beside it is a photograph of his 
               father. Grinning. Top of the world. He's wearing a T-shirt 
               proudly stenciled FIGHTING 17th.

               Father and son exchange a long, awkward greeting.

               In the doorway, Brian stands watching his brother, who not 
               even 40, suddenly seems an old and broken man.

               The ALARM KLAXON suddenly sounds. Brian, just in a towel and 
               Tim, in boxers covered with little dinosaurs, dash for the 
               fire pole.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - APPARATUS FLOOR

               Tim and Brian slide down and bounce off the floor.

                                     GRINDLE
                         -- C'mon! C'mon! Go! Go!

               Brian and Tim rush for their equipment. Grindle grabs their 
               arms.

                                     GRINDLE
                         No! C'mon! This way!

               He hustles them across the apparatus floor, through a doorway, 
               and into the kitchen.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - KITCHEN/DINING AREA

               The makings of a meal are laid out on the counter. Brian and 
               Tim come to a screeching halt. The rest of the station is 
               sitting calmly at the kitchen table, watching.

                                     BRIAN
                         What's going on?

                                     PENGELLY
                         Dinner, Probies. Get started.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - KITCHEN

               Tim and Brian, still in their boxers, set down plates of 
               food.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Better be good.

                                     SANTOS
                         Or we feed you to The Thing.

               Everybody digs in. The table is a craze of half a dozen 
               different conversations. On the TV mounted above on the wall 
               are news shots of Seagrave's body sticking out of the 
               windshield.

               Adcox stands and tinks his glass with a spoon for silence.

                                     AXE
                         Gentlemen, please... As 17's official 
                         toastmaster --

                                     SANTOS
                         And bullshitter.

                                     AXE
                         Thank you, Santos. Did I happen to 
                         mention that you were cut out of my 
                         will?
                              (company laughs)
                         I think it appropriate that we 
                         recognize the two asswipes -- I mean 
                         probationary firemen -- among us who 
                         today were baptized officially into 
                         the world of Old Man Fire. First to 
                         Tim, who despite being handicapped 
                         at birth with a rather dull expression 
                         and a really hideous pair of ears, 
                         not only took on the beast but pulled 
                         from its clutches -- assisted by a 
                         more famous and brilliant firefighter -- 
                         me -- a kicking and screaming civilian 
                         that will probably end up suing us 
                         for breaking her fingernail.
                              (laughs)
                         And to Brian, who's own contribution 
                         was both more beautiful and less 
                         likely to sue.

               Adcox puts his arm affectionately around the mannequin, seated 
               with honor at the head of the table. Right beside The Thing.

                                     AXE
                         Y'know, when I heard that both 
                         McCaffrey brothers were going to be 
                         assigned together here, well, my 
                         heart was filled with... a sudden 
                         desire to transfer.
                              (laughs)
                         So raise a glass, lads. To funny-
                         looking Tim, and the McCaffrey 
                         brothers, who despite years of getting 
                         on each other's nerves have managed 
                         with great effort... to still be 
                         pissed off at each other. Gentlemen!

                                     COMPANY
                              (together, a toast)
                         Fuck you!

               The klaxon suddenly rings. Two bells. The ladder guys groan 
               and get up.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Bye, boys.

                                     SCHMIDT
                              (winks)
                         We'll keep it warm for you.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - BUNKROOM

               Dawn lightens the room as Brian slowly opens his eyes and 
               sees in extreme, fish-eyes close-up: THE THING GROWLING at 
               him. Brian turns the other direction and sees Stephen, fully 
               dressed, standing over his bunk.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Clean the toilets.

               INT. APPARATUS FLOOR

               Bleary-eyed, the nine firemen line up raggedly in front of 
               their rigs, dressed like shit but for peaked uniform caps 
               they wear only at this moment. Stephen stands before them, 
               does a quick glance up and down the line.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Okay, company dismissed. -- See ya 
                         guys tonight at Fitzgerald's 
                         retirement party.

               They shuffle for the door. As Brian passes,

                                     STEPHEN
                         You want a ride?

               EXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

               Stephen pulls up. Brian opens the door.

                                     BRIAN
                         Thanks.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Brian --
                              (a beat that hangs 
                              there)
                         -- See ya tonight.

               INT. RESTAURANT - RETIREMENT PARTY - NIGHT

               That's been cleared out for a huge PARTY in full swing. An 
               Irish folk band cuts loose a merciless bagpipe beat. City 
               brass--including Alderman Swayzak -- a few reporters, firemen 
               and their families all mix together for this is a RETIREMENT 
               PARTY for the Captain Fitzgerald. Brian enters, seeks out a 
               beer at the bar. Stephen's there, swaying with what is clearly 
               not his first drink of the evening.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hey.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey.

               CHEERS as a one joke gift after another is laid on the Chief. 
               Stephen sees his ex-wife, Helen, dancing with another man. 
               He turns away.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I gotta change the view...

               Santos and Grindle walk up.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Heard you didn't make the list for 
                         captain, man. I'm sorry...

               Stephen just shrugs.

               Brian sees Jennifer across the room. She looks great. Refined 
               as she expertly works the room, schmoozing and hugging and 
               calling various politicos by their first name.

               As she speaks to one, a waiter offers a drink. As she accepts, 
               a bottle appears over her shoulder and splashes it with red 
               syrup.

                                     BRIAN
                              (holding bottle, 
                              interrupting)
                         With grenadine, right?

                                     JENNIFER
                         When I was twenty.

                                     BRIAN
                         Oooh, very sophisticated. Having 
                         fun?

               Her attention broken, the politico has slipped away. Annoyed, 
               Jennifer leads Brian aside and speaks low, but angrily at 
               him.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Look, I'm not the same girl who had 
                         nothing better to do than wrap her 
                         legs around you on a Saturday night. 
                         This isn't about fun. I'm working 
                         here.

                                     BRIAN
                         Carrying Swayzak's notebook?

                                     JENNIFER
                         Let me tell you something. Martin 
                         Swayzak is going to be this town's 
                         next mayor.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. 
                         How can you work for that guy?

                                     JENNIFER
                         Why do you think Marty came here 
                         tonight? Because he cares about your 
                         department. You don't know how hard 
                         he works. You don't know about his 
                         programs helping West Side --

                                     BRIAN
                         -- All I know is that his programs 
                         are getting firemen hurt.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about 
                         efficiency. I've got two cousins on 
                         the job, you think I'd work for him 
                         if I didn't believe in it?

               Jennifer instantly cuts off as a well-dressed COUPLE passes 
               and switches stunningly into schmmoze-mode.

                                     JENNIFER
                              (to man)
                         -- Tom, how nice to see you. I know 
                         Marty'll be very happy you came. 
                         Thanks so much for the donation.
                              (to woman)
                         Marie... how's little Kevin? Really? 
                         Seen the polls? This is the year...

               They move away. Jennifer turns to Brian and switches just as 
               fast back to their argument.

                                     JENNIFER
                         -- The thing that really makes me 
                         angry is the way your union has --

               Brian can't help it. He cracks up.

                                     BRIAN
                         What was that? Oh man, you have picked 
                         up a few moves since John Paul II 
                         Boulevard.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Yeah, well I like to think I'm just 
                         a little past hanging out on JP II 
                         watching the Irish pick fights and 
                         Litwalks barf in the planters.

                                     BRIAN
                         I seem to remember some pretty good 
                         nights on JP II.

               Brian turns and walks away.

               ACROSS THE ROOM

               Adcox is talking with another knot of firemen. He's brought 
               a date, SALLY, a hot little number that has a habit of 
               standing on her tip-toes when she talks.

                                     SALLY
                              (looking at Swayzak 
                              across room)
                         Yuck, what a scumbag.

                                     AXE
                              (to Santos)
                         Fuckin' city transferred Sally three 
                         months ago out of parking violations 
                         into Swayzak's office. Now I gotta 
                         pay my own goddamn tickets and she's 
                         stuck with an asshole.

                                     SANTOS
                         Pay more?

                                     SALLY
                              (shrugs)
                         No, but there's more exercise -- 
                         being chased around a desk.

               There's a commotion at the other end of the bar. A group of 
               firemen have gathered around a weekly magazine.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Aw, I don't believe this shit.

                                     SCHMIDT
                         Somebody get a shovel! You seen this, 
                         Stephen?

               As they hold it up to Stephen we see a photo spread titled 
               DARING FIRE RESCUE.

               The first photo shows Brian rushing out of the burning 
               building with seemingly a woman in his arms. The second photo 
               shows the backs of Adcox and Tim's helmets as they 
               administered aid to the real woman they saved. The implication 
               is it's the same woman.

                                     BRIAN
                         What?

                                     TIM
                              (reads)
                         "Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, 
                         on his very first fire, showed the 
                         kind of bravery and courage of a 
                         veteran firefighter when he risked 
                         life and limb to double-check a 
                         burning floor alone, emerging 
                         victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a 
                         seamstress for the North Shore 
                         Clothing Company... McCaffrey first 
                         gained prominence as the subject of 
                         a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning 
                         photograph taken at the scene of his 
                         father's death..."

               The old photo is there too. Brian and his dad's helmet.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Whadda we gonna do about this?

               Stephen glances over the headlines.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Y'know, I think it's a union bylaw 
                         that if a guy gets in the paper -- 
                         especially if it's bullshit -- he 
                         owes the company a drink. In fact...
                              (motions to waiter)
                         ...I'll have a double. On the hero.

               The other firemen jump in with drink orders. Dozens of them.

                                     BRIAN
                              (confused)
                         What's going on?

               Tim shows him the magazine. Brian reads with horror as 
               Alderman Swayzak appears beside him.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Brian McCaffrey, right?

                                     JENNIFER
                         Brian, this is my boss, Alderman 
                         Swayzak.
                              (to Swayzak)
                         Brian's a big fan of yours.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah. Big fan.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         And I'm a huge fan of what you did 
                         to save that woman, Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Uh, I think there's been a mistake. 
                         I didn't save that woman.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         No need to be modest, Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         No, you don't understand, I saved a 
                         mannequin.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         -- That really was incredibly work 
                         you did. You and your brother, 
                         fighting fires together, helluva 
                         image, isn't it? You must feel lucky 
                         to be assigned under his command.

                                     BRIAN
                         Every little boy's fantasy.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Brian, let me come to the point. I'd 
                         like to offer you a job.

                                     BRIAN
                         I have a job.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         This one's still with the fire 
                         department. One of our best 
                         investigators, Don Rimgale, is working 
                         on a very difficult, visible case 
                         right now. We think he could use 
                         another pair of hands and you're 
                         exactly the kind of guy I want 
                         representing us: An authentic hero 
                         from a traditional firefighting clan.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions --
                         like dying young.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Not every job in the fire department 
                         comes with a tombstone, Brian. This 
                         could be a great opportunity to 
                         move... beyond a fire engine.

               Brian looks at Jennifer, then smiles at Swayzak.

                                     BRIAN
                         Thanks anyway, Mr. Swayzak, but fire 
                         engines sorta run in my family. 
                         Politics don't.

               -- A man suddenly steps between them to pump Swayzak's hand. 
               Brian shakes his head and walks away. Swayzak shoots a 
               concerned glance at Jennifer. She catches up with him at the 
               buffet table.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Boy, took you all of thirty seconds 
                         to blow that.

                                     BRIAN
                         C'mon Jennifer, he's just another 
                         North-Side jag-off with a mouth.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Brian, do you always have to be so 
                         stupid? Think about your future for 
                         once.

                                     BRIAN
                         So now you suddenly care about my 
                         future?

                                     JENNIFER
                         Look, I didn't mean to take a piece 
                         out of you back there, I just thought 
                         you'd call when you came back. You 
                         didn't and...
                              (beat)
                         Don't blow it just because of this 
                         garbage between us.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in 
                         front of your boss. But I'm not gonna 
                         be a poster boy for him, I'm trying 
                         to do something here. There's five 
                         hundred smoke eaters in this room 
                         that do that stuff for real every 
                         day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of 
                         them.

               Across the room, Stephen's at the buffet, watching Helen 
               dance with her fireman date, the drinks hammering him hard.

                                     PENGELLY
                         Aw man, how can she dance with that 
                         guy?

                                     SCHMIDT
                         I hate that guy. He's a dispatcher. 
                         I hate his voice.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Whatever...

                                     PENGELLY
                         I mean, I know women have gotta bang 
                         somebody, but why that son of a bitch?

               Stephen gives Pengelly an icy, sideways look.

                                     SCHMIDT
                         Hey Stevie, he's an asshole...

               Stephen smiles and pushes off the bar -- right for Helen as 
               she dances.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a 
                         second about Sean...

                                     HELEN
                         Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we 
                         talk about this later?

                                     DATE
                         How ya doin', Stephen?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Jackson.

               Jackson steers her away but Stephen isn't done yet. He dogs 
               them.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to Helen)
                         What's wrong with right now? He's 
                         your son for christ's sake. He's --

                                     JACKSON
                         Hey, Stephen, what about that dumb 
                         ass brother of yours, huh?

                                     STEPHEN
                         ...Yeah?

                                     JACKSON
                         Savin' a mannequin... How fuckin' 
                         stupid can a guy get?

               Stephen suddenly PUNCHES Jackson.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You can't talk about my brother like 
                         that...

                                     HELEN
                              (sighs)
                         Here we go...

               And Stephen PLOWS into Jackson. Another fireman JUMPS to 
               Jackson's aid. And Brian's there, defending his brother, 
               PUNCHING OUT a fireman. The crowd finally pulls the two apart.

                                     JACKSON
                         You're crazy, man!

                                     STEPHEN
                         Leave me alone!

                                     AXE
                         Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!
                              (Stephen calms a little)
                         You stupid dumbshit, you never know 
                         when to fucking quit, do you? You 
                         ever wonder why your career's in the 
                         fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be 
                         stuck a Lt. for life?

                                     STEPHEN
                         No.
                              (beat)
                         I need a drink.

               Stephen takes a step for the bar -- then suddenly turns and 
               JUMPS Jackson again. Brian pulls him off and drags him for 
               the door.

                                     BRIAN
                         You don't need a drink, man. You 
                         need to get outta here...

               As Jennifer watches Brian lead Stephen out the door.

                                     JENNIFER
                              (to Swayzak)
                         Ah those McCaffreys... just hate 
                         leaving a party with anyone left 
                         standing...

               EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               Brian leads Stephen toward his car.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I'm okay... leave me alone...

               Stephen pushes Brian away and promptly stumbles to the 
               sidewalk.

                                     BRIAN
                         So you got a 'roid going with Jackson 
                         or what?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Nah, he's nothin'. It's just 
                         sometimes... sometimes you just gotta 
                         punch somebody out, y'know?

               Brian stands there and folds his arms.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I don't think I can get up.

               Brian lends an arm.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I 
                         can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, 
                         too.

                                     BRIAN
                         C'mon, let's crawl home.

               EXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - NIGHT

               Stephen throws an arm over Brian's shoulder as he leads him 
               up onto the boat.

                                     STEPHEN
                         ...Adcox, those guys...they don't 
                         get it... it isn't the goddamn 
                         promotion... or dad... I'm not my 
                         old man, y'know? No fire's gonna get 
                         me... I don't give a shit about being 
                         a captain... it's just... it's just 
                         they don't trust me anymore...
                              (blows out painful 
                              breath)
                         ...they don't trust me anymore...

               INT. STEPHEN'S BOAT

               Brian's flops his brother on the bed. Unties his shoes.

                                     STEPHEN
                         If you'd get out of my fuckin' way. 
                         I could take my own goddamn shoes 
                         off...

               He clearly can't. Brian slips them off.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You're such a pain in the ass... 
                         You've always been a pain in the 
                         ass...

               There's just a grim wall lamp above Stephen's face.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... 
                         Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' 
                         blind...

                                     BRIAN
                              (touching light)
                         This?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Yeah... too bright...

               Brian turns off the dim light. Stephen's breathing deepens.

                                     STEPHEN
                         They don't know... they don't know 
                         what I hear in there...

               Brian tucks the blanket around him.

                                     STEPHEN
                         ...This boat could be okay, huh?... 
                         Take it out weekends... Sean 'n me...

               Stephen's voice drifts off into sleep. Brian watches a moment, 
               the rare look of peace on his brother's face, then leaves.

               EXT. FIRE ACADEMY - NIGHT

               Dark and still. Brian, carrying a roll of hose, scales the 
               chain link.

               EXT. FIRE ACADEMY - EXERCISE GROUND - NIGHT

               Is a practice stand-pipe. Brian counts down to himself, then 
               rushes the stand-pipe, spinning off the cap with a hydrant 
               wrench and attaching the hose coupling. He does it again, 
               over and over.

               EXT. FIRE ACADEMY - DAWN

               The sky's gone pink and blue as Brian climbs back over the 
               fence. Adcox, coming out of a donut shop across the street, 
               sees him.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. STREET - CHICKEN ACCIDENT - DAY

               A truck has JACKKNIFED across the avenue and SPILLED its 
               contents -- several THOUSAND baby chicks. They're scurrying 
               everywhere as Brian's company tries to round them up. It's 
               hopeless as the exhausted firemen stuff handfuls of the 
               cheeping cargo into their turn-out coats. There's ghetto 
               kids all around, grabbing at the chicks, grabbing at the 
               fire engine.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (at kids)
                         Hey! Knock it off!

               Brian stops a beat. Rubs his eyes.

                                     AXE
                              (smiles)
                         Maybe you should have gotten more 
                         sleep last night.

               Brian looks at him. Does he mean what he thinks he means? 
               Tim is coming out of a small store across the street. He 
               hands a small bag of groceries to Adcox.

                                     TIM
                         This everything you wanted?

               Everyone grows suddenly silent.

               EXT. WIDOW'S HOUSE - DAY

               A fireman's without even saying so, "Petzold" on the mailbox, 
               Engine 17 parked out front. Brian's alone outside, cleaning 
               the diesel fuel off his arms. Watching a small kid playing 
               with a toy fire truck in the drive.

               INT. WIDOW'S HOUSE

               Tim and Brian are loading the groceries into the fridge. 
               Stephen and Grindle are fixing a loose cabinet door as Adcox 
               sits caulking a faucet fitting at the kitchen table with a 
               young WOMAN.

                                     WOMAN
                              (to Stephen)
                         Can I help you guys at all?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Nah, we just about got it.

                                     WOMAN
                              (noticing Adcox's 
                              shirt)
                         Sally must be finally ironing your 
                         shirts.

                                     AXE
                         It's just new. Couple'a shifts and 
                         it'll be as thrashed as the rest.

               The sight of uniform is too much for her. Her eyes cloud.

                                     WOMAN
                         I'm sorry...

               Adcox reaches out and lets her weep on his shoulder.

                                     AXE
                         It's okay...

                                     WOMAN
                         I miss him... I just miss him, 
                         y'know?...

               EXT. WIDOW'S HOUSE - DAY

               Adcox stands out at the fire engine smoking a cigarette, 
               lost in himself, watching the little boy play with his toy 
               fire truck. Stephen's followed him out.

                                     AXE
                         This job... This fuckin' job 
                         sometimes... To buy it trying to go 
                         the extra yard, man, that's one thing, 
                         but to buy it just because there 
                         wasn't any back-up... it's bullshit...

               Stephen leans down close.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Yeah, it's bullshit. So what? Fuck 
                         Swayzak. Fuck 'em all. We don't go 
                         into fires for them. You know that. 
                         Christ, you taught me that.

               A beat of understanding between them. Stephen looks back at 
               the house.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You know Knowlton pretty well?

                                     AXE
                         Yeah...

                                     STEPHEN
                              (beat)
                         Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?

               Adcox can't help but smile.

                                     AXE
                         Biggest in two battalions.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (beat, smiles)
                         We're gonna be okay, man...

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - DAY

               As Brian and Tim scrub down the fire engine, the rest of the 
               company lies sprawled in

               THE STATION REC ROOM

               Watching a weepy soap. Schmidt walks through and is snared 
               by the TV's glow. He hesitates. Shares the moment.

                                     SCHMIDT
                         Is she going to get the divorce?

                                     SANTOS
                              (sighs with honest 
                              concern)
                         Hell if I know, man.

               A ladderman, WASHINGTON, walks in with a memo.

                                     WASHINGTON
                         Hey, Pengelly, you made the captain's 
                         list!

               Everybody clasps Pengelly on the shoulder. "Way to go". "All 
               right, man". Brian turns and sees Stephen out on the apparatus 
               floor, watching. Watches. Pengelly's younger than him.

               EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - TRAINING BUILDING/HOSE TOWER - DAY

               An expanse of concrete lying out back of the station. Built 
               in one corner is the concrete shell of a five story training 
               building, just wide enough for a stairway and room on each 
               level. Twenty yards away, Brian, Tim and Adcox stand ready 
               beside a pile of coiled hose rolls.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (looking at watch)
                         Alright... Go!

               Tim picks up a roll of hose, 50 pounds, throws it over his 
               shoulder and runs with Adcox to the foot of the building. 
               There's a fixed standpipe that Adcox ties into as Tim drags 
               the other end inside and up a flight of stairs.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Go!

               Brian lifts another hose roll under his arm and runs for the 
               building.

                                     STEPHEN
                         That isn't a football, probie. Get 
                         it on your shoulder.

               Brian runs up two flights to meet Tim and connect his end. 
               Tim heads down for another roll as Brian drags his up another 
               two flights. It's a bitch.

               Sweating, he barrels back down the stairs, passing Tim coming 
               up with another roll.

                                     BRIAN
                         Having fun, fireman?

               Tim flips him off. Brian laughs and sprints for another roll.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You're not breaking any records, 
                         Brian.

               Brian holds it under his arm and takes off. Stephen grabs a 
               roll himself, hoists it to his shoulder and runs alongside.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Your shoulder. Like this!

               Brian lifts it to his shoulder.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Come on! Pick it up!

               They come to the doorway. Instead of stopping, Stephen follows 
               Brian in and runs alongside up the stairs. Without a word 
               spoken it's become a race between them.

               Brian's face explodes in sweat. His heart pounds as they go 
               up flight after flight. The hose rolls weigh a 100 pounds. A 
               thousand. Neck 'n neck all the way; grunting, their throats 
               burning, only one flight from the roof Stephen STUMBLES and 
               SCRAPES his leg. Brian pauses. Stephen's already back on his 
               feet.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Run, damn you!

               Brian does, Stephen already gaining on him -- getting ready 
               to pass him -- when they burst gasping out onto the roof, 
               Brian the "winner" by a nose. Stephen drops his hose roll, 
               sticks his face into Brian's, -- And laughs. Unsure, Brian 
               starts to join in. Stephen stops suddenly.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Roll the hose.

                                     BRIAN
                         What, are you kidding? By myself?

               Adcox and Tim, down below, have already disappeared back 
               into the station.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You heard me.

               We see now what Stephen apparently doesn't. He was scraped 
               badly, his pant leg torn and leaking dark circles of blood.

                                     BRIAN
                         What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll 
                         let you win next time.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (in Brian's face)
                         You got a problem with drilling, 
                         probie?

                                     BRIAN
                         No, Lt., I don't have a problem with 
                         drilling. But let's just have one 
                         drill. Not one for the company and 
                         one for me.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Roll the hose.

               Stephen turns and walks away. Brian stands there watching 
               him in blind fury, finally exploding.

                                     BRIAN
                         Goddamn you Stephen, I'm not gonna 
                         quit. You hear me!

               An awkward beat between them that's interrupted suddenly by 
               the station alarm klaxon. Stephen smiles.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Well, thank God for fires...

               EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Smoke and confusion. A MOTHER is screaming hysterically at 
               Stephen as he jumps down from the engine.

                                     MOTHER
                              (grabbing his coat)
                         My baby! My baby's still up there!

                                     BATTALION CHIEF
                         Hang on a sec, Stevie, we got a 
                         hoseline coming.

               Stephen doesn't even pause and enters the building. Brian 
               hesitates a beat, then follows.

               INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Where they bomb up a staircase just as a WALL OF FIRE LASHES 
               DOWN, KNOCKING them on their ass. Stephen jumps to his feet 
               with an axe as Brian struggles to get up.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Don't take that kind of shit from 
                         it! Don't let it know you're scared! 
                         Come on!

               Stephen, with just his axe, CHASES up the stairs at the fire, 
               HAMMERING at the flaming boards. The fire retreats into 
               another room, SLAMMING the door shut behind it.

               Brian struggles up the stairs. The two of them slide up on 
               either side of the closed door, Stephen cradling his axe 
               like a SWAT team shotgun. The door breathes in and out and 
               something animal scratches and snarls on the other side.

               Brian can feel the panic rising in his throat. That thing 
               behind the door, that slobbering, evil thing. It wants out. 
               It wants... him.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Ready?

                                     BRIAN
                         Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the 
                         hose team...

                                     STEPHEN
                         Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I 
                         say... It won't get us.

               Stephen HAMMERS the lock with his axe and KICKS the door 
               open. A WALL OF FLAME ROARS out past their cheeks, then 
               BACKWASHES in.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Now!

               Stephen picks up the door, and using it as a shield CHARGES 
               into the flames. Brian tries to follow but the fire WELLS 
               UP, cutting him off. He hesitates. It's that goddamn flame 
               again, leering at him. Daring him. It BUCKS suddenly, DROPPING 
               Brian to his knee. He GROANS in pain.

               -- And now Adcox and Grindle are coming up the stairs with a 
               hoseline WASHING DOWN the room. Clouds of furious steam bellow 
               out and across the ceiling. Nobody could be alive in there.

               Except Stephen. His entire outfit smoldering, he emerges 
               from the clouds like a fucking god, carrying in one arm a 
               gasping child.

               EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - AFTERMATH - DAY

               Most of the firemen have gathered together for post-fire 
               coffee and stories. Brian sits off alone on the fire engine 
               bumper, apart from them. Santos walks up.

                                     SANTOS
                         They think she's gonna live...

               Stephen walks up. Sits down beside him.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You okay?

                                     BRIAN
                         I waited... I would have fucking 
                         waited...

                                     STEPHEN
                         That's not what it's about, Brian. 
                         The point is there was a kid in there. 
                         And what if there'd been two? I went 
                         in because that's what I do. It's my 
                         way. It's dad's way. It isn't 
                         everybody's way.

                                     BRIAN
                         Dad's way? Where did he tell you 
                         that? In a fucking seance?

                                     STEPHEN
                         You said you wanted to know something, 
                         Brian. What did you learn today?
                              (Brian doesn't answer)
                         What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to 
                         move on?

               Brian lingers only a moment before standing.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're right, Stephen... You win... 
                         You're the best, man...

               Brian hands Stephen his helmet and walks away.

               INT. SWAYZAK'S OFFICE - DAY

               There's only six like it in city hall, and this one has a 
               view.

                                     SECRETARY'S VOICE
                              (on intercom)
                         Brian McCaffrey on line two for 
                         Jennifer.

                                     JENNIFER
                         I'll take it in my office.

                                     SWAYZAK
                              (turns to her and 
                              smiles)
                         Go get him.

               INT. CORRIDOR/CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Jennifer comes out of Swayzak's office and walks down to her 
               own.

               INT. JENNIFER'S OFFICE/INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

               -- It's a tiny, bleak little rat hole. She picks up the 
               receiver...

                                     JENNIFER
                         Brian?

               We see Brian in his apartment.

                                     BRIAN
                         I've been thinking about what you 
                         said the other night... If the offer's 
                         still on the table, I'd like to talk 
                         about it.

                                     JENNIFER
                              (beat)
                         ...Okay. I'll arrange things with 
                         your assignment captain.
                              (beat)
                         Marty's a good man, Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah...

               Brian hangs up. He stares at it a moment, then SLAMS it 
               against the wall.

               Jennifer stares at the phone with something almost like 
               sadness.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BROWNSTONE - DAY

               Stephen drives past the burned-out brownstone that fried 
               Alan Seagrave. He parks in the alley behind, walks up the 
               building, and PULLS OFF a plywood sheet covering a blown-out 
               window.

               INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY

               Stephen walks through the creepy, brutalized silence. Back 
               to where Rimgale had focused his investigation that night. 
               He searches the floor, the wall, looking for something...

               EXT. ARSON HQ/FIREHOUSE - DAY

               A crumbling one in Chinatown. Brian checks the address on 
               his slip of paper. He stands there a beat, hating himself.

               INT. FIRE STATION/ARSON HQ

               It's a regular station but for the rear that has been 
               converted into arson squad offices. As Brian approaches the 
               office door he can see Rimgale sitting at his desk. Standing 
               nervously beside it is a fresh-faced, uniformed PROBIE.

                                     SHADOW
                              (to probie)
                         ...So stop me if I get this wrong... 
                         The fire's almost out... You're 
                         upstairs on the unburned floor 
                         checking for heat. You've been told 
                         by your Battalion Chief, your Captain, 
                         by me, not to do anything up there 
                         until ordered. But now the itch 
                         starts, and all of a sudden comes 
                         the Glory Boy Flash: Hey, I'm a hero. 
                         Heroes don't just stand around. So 
                         on your own you decided to punch out 
                         a window for ventilation. Was that 
                         before or after you noticed you were 
                         standing in a lake of gasoline?

               The kid is dying a thousand deaths of humiliation.

                                     SHADOW
                         You could've crispered half your 
                         company with that little stunt, but 
                         more importantly you wrecked the 
                         physical evidence I use to prove 
                         it's arson. You've made my day longer, 
                         Probie. Go home and think about that.

               The kid shuffles off hang-dog. Rimgale's angry gaze falls on 
               Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new 
                         assistant.

                                     SHADOW
                         Your Dennis' kid.
                              (beat)
                         I work alone.

               And Rimgale walks into his office, leaving Brian marooned in 
               the doorway. Stepping behind a small partition, Rimgale 
               changes his shirt. Brian can just glimpse from where he stands 
               a horrible burn that has consumed most of Rimgale's stomach. 
               Rimgale catches the look.

                                     SHADOW
                         Are you still here?

                                     BRIAN
                         Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not 
                         going anywhere.

                                     SHADOW
                         Then go find a corner. I don't want 
                         you in my way.

                                     BRIAN
                         I think we should get something 
                         straight here. I was assigned to 
                         this office by the city.

                                     SHADOW
                         Look, I knew your father, he had a 
                         helluva reputation on this job. But 
                         that don't mean you get any slack. 
                         Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I 
                         gotta eat you, that's the rules and 
                         I got nothing to say about that. But 
                         Swayzak or no, you live with me. 
                         Step out of line, and I don't care 
                         who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.
                              (beat)
                         You think you're the first?

               Rimgale glances at his watch, puts on his coat, and picks up 
               a small paper bag.

                                     BRIAN
                         Where are you going?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MAX SECURITY PRISON - DAY

               And the face of RONALD, an unremarkable man in his 40s. 
               Unremarkable but for laser eyes and two heavily bandaged 
               hands. Go wide and find him sitting in an institutional chair -- 
               handcuffed, actually -- in an institutional hall. A uniformed 
               guard stands nearby as Brian and Rimgale come down the 
               corridor. Ronald smiles upon seeing Rimgale.

                                     RONALD
                         Shadow.

                                     SHADOW
                         How ya doin', Ronald. Staying 
                         comfortable?

                                     RONALD
                         Didn't think you'd make it.

                                     SHADOW
                         Wouldn't miss this for the world, 
                         pal.

                                     RONALD
                              (looking at Brian)
                         Who's this?

                                     SHADOW
                         He works for me.

                                     RONALD
                         Is he a fireman?
                              (smiles)
                         I like firemen.

                                     SHADOW
                         You like everybody, Ronald.

               Ronald's eyes pick up Brian's name on his prison ID badge.

                                     RONALD
                         Brian McCaffrey...
                              (eyes light up happily)
                         Oh this is really a treat. Brian 
                         McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, 
                         huh?

                                     BRIAN
                              (heating up)
                         Hey, do I know you?

                                     SHADOW
                         You don't know him.

                                     RONALD
                         I know you.

                                     BRIAN
                              (to Ronald)
                         What the hell are you talking about 
                         my --

               Rimgale silences Brian with a threatening hand.

                                     SHADOW
                         Knock it off. Now.

                                     RONALD
                         Tell him about me, Shadow?

                                     SHADOW
                         Ronald here likes telephones. Used 
                         to tape wooden matches to the bell 
                         striker and wrap it in cotton. Came 
                         up with a whole little thing there, 
                         didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, 
                         what did you do? You just started 
                         making calls... mostly day care 
                         centers and retirement homes, wasn't 
                         it?

                                     RONALD
                         Did he tell you how we finally met?

                                     SHADOW
                         Nobody cares, Ronald.

                                     RONALD
                         Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. 
                         You're depriving our famous young 
                         friend here...

                                     VOICE IN CORRIDOR
                         Okay... Ronald Bowland...

               The cop helps Ronald to his feet and all four are marching 
               down the hall.

                                     RONALD
                         It was on State Street, right?... 
                         Just your basic warehouse torch for 
                         the owner. Cakewalk. But the animal... 
                         turned on me... 'Ol Shadow here, he 
                         shows up -- whole place is going 
                         like hell -- my hair, my hands... 
                         could've just let the animal take me -- 
                         but Shadow, he's a good camper, so 
                         he tries to pull 'ol Ronald out. 
                         Guess he didn't notice the tub of 
                         phosphorous next to me...
                              (smiles)
                         Notice you're still a little shy 
                         about rolling your sleeves up, Shadow. 
                         Show him your stomach yet?

               INT. PRISON - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

               Ronald in the hot seat before a parole board, Rimgale and 
               Brian on the sidelines.

                                     MAN
                         ...All right, the parole board has 
                         received Mr. Bowland's fitness report, 
                         his ID-44, endorsement from his 
                         section warden... Dr. Norris?

                                     WOMAN PSYCHIATRIST
                         As supervising psychiatrist I would 
                         describe Mr. Bowland's progress as 
                         remarkable. Taking into account his 
                         disability and the six years already 
                         served, I recommend parole.

                                     MAN
                         Mr. Bowland, do you regret your 
                         crimes?

                                     RONALD
                         Yes. I understand now the pain I 
                         caused.

                                     MAN
                         If released, will you commit these 
                         crimes again?

                                     RONALD
                         I won't.

                                     MAN
                         Do you consider yourself ready for 
                         society?

                                     RONALD
                         Yes.

               The parole board shuffles their papers. It's a done deal. 
               Rimgale suddenly stands and approaches Ronald.

                                     SHADOW
                         Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.

                                     RONALD
                         Absolutely.

                                     MAN
                              (surprised)
                         Excuse me, Mr. Rimgale.

                                     SHADOW
                         Excuse me.
                              (to Ronald)
                         What do you do with little girls?

               A tortured look comes over Ronald's face. He's holding back. 
               From the paper bag, Rimgale suddenly tosses a burned baby 
               doll in his lap.

                                     SHADOW
                         What do you do with them, Ronald? 
                         Huh?

               Rimgale then lights a cigarette lighter in Ronald's face.

                                     RONALD
                              (smiles)
                         -- Burn them.

                                     SHADOW
                         And old ladies?

                                     RONALD
                         -- Burn them.

                                     SHADOW
                         And the world -- the whole world.

                                     RONALD
                              (smiles)
                         -- Burn it all.

               The parole board stares, stunned. Rimgale stands.

                                     SHADOW
                         See ya next year, Ronald. Gotta go.

               EXT. THEATRE BUILDING - DAY

               A pre-war theatre closed with a sign: UNDER RENOVATION -- 
               OPENING XMAS 1991. DAVID BENTON, mid-forties, climbs out of 
               his car and walks to the entrance with some rolled-up 
               blueprints.

               INT. THEATRE BUILDING - DAY

               Benton walks through the vast theatre and up to a beautiful 
               Art Noveau office door: DAVID BENTON, PRIVATE. He goes to 
               insert his key. Drops it. As he reaches down, we see a tiny 
               wisp of smoke SUCK back under the door. Benton sniffs, as if 
               he smells something, then shrugs and inserts his key. It'd 
               have been a good story if he'd lived longer.

               The moment he pushes the door open It EXPLODES OUTWARD in a 
               ROARING FIREBALL.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THEATRE BUILDING - SUNDOWN

               Later and engine companies have already knocked down the 
               building fire as Brian climbs out of Rimgale's red sedan.

                                     SHADOW
                              (opens trunk)
                         Hey kid, c'mere -- At least make 
                         yourself useful.

               He starts handing Brian handfuls of equipment cases. Loaded 
               down, Brian follows Rimgale into the building.

               INT. THEATRE BUILDING

               Fire crews are at work in here, including Engine 17 at the 
               other end of the theatre. Brian's surprised to see them, his 
               eyes locking briefly with Stephen's. An ENGINE COMPANY LT. 
               walks up to Rimgale.

                                     ENGINE LT
                         We were lucky with this one. Could've 
                         taken out the whole complex, but the 
                         explosion blew out most of the flame. 
                         Good for us.
                              (looks to body)
                         -- Not so good for him.

               "Him" is our previous owner, David Benton, just his hands 
               and a leg showing from under the collapsed door. Rimgale 
               crouches beside it.

                                     SHADOW
                         Turn this over.

               Brian does. The corpse's keys are still in the lock. So's 
               Benton. Blown with such force he seems fused with the door. 
               On the door's edge Rimgale notices a small patch of melted, 
               sticky goo. With his penknife he scrapes a sample and seals 
               it in a glass vial, stands, and walks into the office.

               INT. THEATRE OFFICE

                                     BRIAN
                         What do you want me to do with --

               Rimgale, now inside, silences him with an outstretched arm.

                                     SHADOW
                         -- Shhh.

                                     BRIAN
                              (after a beat)
                         What are you listening to?

               Rimgale doesn't answer. His eyes drift over the scorched 
               walls as he speaks softly to them.

                                     SHADOW
                         You sneaky little son of a bitch... 
                         Hide and seek... Come on, tell me 
                         what I want to know...

               He scratches at some soot. Smiles and lifts a small hand 
               recorder.

                                     SHADOW
                              (business-like into 
                              recorder)
                         Heavy smoke stains observed in entry 
                         room. Demarkation line high. Fire 
                         never got hot enough here to cook 
                         soot off. It started somewhere else...
                              (walks down hall)
                         Less soot here. More heat.
                              (they enter back room)
                         And very little soot here.
                              (to Brian)
                         Get that couch out of the way.

               Brian pulls it aside. The lower third of the wall is 
               completely untouched by soot.

                                     SHADOW
                              (to himself)
                         So you were happy here. Warm and 
                         cozy and in no hurry...
                              (into recorder)
                         Soot high, clean unburned wall low, 
                         indicates slow burn in thermal 
                         balance.
                              (to Brian)
                         Find me some glass.

                                     BRIAN
                         Glass?

                                     SHADOW
                         Do we have a language barrier here? 
                         Glass.

               There's some on the sill of a blown window. Brian hands a 
               shard to Rimgale, who turns it over in his palm.

                                     SHADOW

                         Glass found in ignition room is in 
                         small, thin pieces, indicating 
                         explosion. Lack of discoloration 
                         indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion 
                         must of come after a slow burn.
                              (shuts recorder off)
                         You little tease... What were you up 
                         to you little bastard, huh? What 
                         made you that mad?
                              (then, an idea)
                         Or scared.
                              (switches on recorder)
                         It started in this room. Took its 
                         time, hung out... but the air ran 
                         out. It couldn't breathe. So it was 
                         snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still 
                         all that trapped heat, lying low, 
                         waiting for some sucker to open the 
                         door and give it that one gulp of 
                         air...

                         -- Another backdraft.

               Rimgale turns to the wall, a section where the plaster is 
               severely damaged. He probes with a penknife.

                                     SHADOW
                         Finish coat burned away... Severe 
                         spawling of rough coat...

               Rimgale follows the damaged wall down -- down -- to a melted 
               wall socket.

                                     SHADOW
                         That's our ignition point. Dig it 
                         out. Carefully.

               Brian chops it out from the wall. Rimgale crouches down, 
               peels back the melted faceplate and examines the wires. The 
               copper tip is severely melted. Rimgale sniffs the plug.

                              (into recorder)
                         Temperature in this room was about 
                         2000 degrees, but copper wire in 
                         outlet is melted, which requires 
                         5000 degrees. An accidental short in 
                         the plug could of created a spark of 
                         7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the 
                         wire and start a fire.

                                     BRIAN
                         No it couldn't.

               Rimgale shuts off the recorder. Stares down Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         I mean you'd be right -- with normal 
                         wire. But that's gauge ten in that 
                         plug -- industrial stuff. Who knows 
                         why they put it in here -- but it 
                         won't melt at less than 12,000 
                         degrees. And no natural spark short 
                         of lightning gets that hot.
                              (Rimgale just stares)
                         In another life I was in high-end 
                         electronics.

               Rimgale opens a plastic bag and puts the plug inside.

                                     SHADOW
                              (into recorder)
                         Have outlet analyzed for any traces 
                         of flammable accelerants.

               Rimgale stands and walks out.

                                     BRIAN
                         Don't mention it.

               INT. THEATRE BUILDING - NIGHT

               Brian follows Rimgale down from the office into the vast 
               theatre. Walls hiss and spit. Brian's surprised to see his 
               former engine mates there, tromping and crunching their way 
               through broken glass, their flashlights like dancing 
               fireflies. Tim passes by.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey, Tim.

               Everybody turns at the voice and the air suddenly chills.

                                     TIM
                              (distant)
                         Brian.

                                     SHADOW
                              (to Brian)
                         Check the wall for burn patterns.

               And Rimgale's off to another room. Brian turns and looks at 
               the wall. It's endless.

                                     BRIAN
                              (to Tim)
                         So, you surviving without me?

                                     TIM
                         There's no replacement 'cause of 
                         your boss' cuts, if that's what you 
                         mean. If someone else goes out on an 
                         injury we're really screwed.

                                     BRIAN
                         Swayzak's not my boss.

               Silence. Brian looks over the wall. A dirty puddle separates 
               him from it.

                                     GRINDLE
                              (to Brian)
                         Ooooh, like the tie. Love the tie.

                                     BRIAN
                         Grindle, scrape down that wall for 
                         me, huh? I would myself, but the tie 
                         'n all, y'know...

               Grindle stares at him a beat, then wordlessly steps into the 
               muck and pulls free a section of wall, dropping it on the 
               ground in front of Brian. Santos and Grindle look at each 
               other.

                                     SANTOS
                         Uh, Brian, if you're lookin' for 
                         smoke patterns, there's some good 
                         ones over here.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah? Where?

                                     GRINDLE
                              (as Brian walks over)
                         Little to the right... further... 
                         further... Right behind there. Hey, 
                         could you hand me that pike pole?

               There's a pike pole leaning against the wall. Brian pulls it 
               aside. SPLASH -- The pole had been supporting a small, sagging 
               piece of ceiling that instantly collapses, dumping twenty 
               gallons of murky, putrid black water all over Brian's civvys. 
               Nobody laughs.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Sorry, maybe that wasn't it after 
                         all.

               Stephen appears around the corner. Sees what's happened.

                                     STEPHEN
                         That's just about enough, guys, okay?

                                     SCHMIDT
                         See ya around, Brian.

               They leave. Brian stands there, humiliated.

                                     AXE
                              (to Brian)
                         What the hell's the matter with you, 
                         huh? You're steppin' in the shit 
                         again. You could've done it. You 
                         don't want this.
                              (the suit 'n tie)
                         Wake up, kid.

               Brian burns with shame and anger as Adcox walks away. Stephen 
               hands Brian a towel.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Here. Dry yourself off.

               Brian snatches it from him. Glares at his brother.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Look, you are sorta making yourself 
                         fair game.

                                     BRIAN
                         Thanks for the insight.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Brian, look --

                                     BRIAN
                         Just leave me alone, okay?

               Brian walks away. Stephen calls after him.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hey, Bri... Rimgale's okay. I don't 
                         get half the shit he's talking about, 
                         but then everybody says the same 
                         thing about me. Who the hell knows?

               INT. HELEN'S HOUSE - DAY

               Helen, Stephen's ex-wife, is sitting at her kitchen when she 
               looks up suddenly at a strange sound coming from the roof.

               EXT. HELEN'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY

               On the short, sloping roof, Stephen stands hammering a shingle 
               back into place. Helen sticks her head out the dormer window.

                                     HELEN
                         Stephen, what are you doing here?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Fixing my roof.

                                     HELEN
                         It's not your roof anymore.

               He stops and tosses the hammer aside. Looks at his watch.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Where's Sean?

                                     HELEN
                         He's got piano lessons.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Oh yeah? How's he doing?

                                     HELEN
                         He's going to be a fireman.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Give up, babe. You can't fight it. 
                         Believe me, my mom tried...

                                     HELEN
                              (beat)
                         Stephen, you gotta stop just showing 
                         up on the roof like this.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I just wanted to, I don't know, not 
                         exactly apologize for the other night -- 
                         especially since I don't remember 
                         much of it --

                                     HELEN
                         -- You remember.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Yeah... I just thought I should say, 
                         I don't know, something.

                                     HELEN
                         The great communicator.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Sorry I hit Jackson.

                                     HELEN
                         He deserved it. He was born deserving 
                         it.

                                     STEPHEN
                         He treats you okay?

                                     HELEN
                         Okay.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I treated you better.

                                     HELEN
                         You treated me like shit.

               But she smiles.

                                     HELEN
                         You want some coffee?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.

                                     HELEN
                         What's wrong, Stephen?
                              (looks at her)
                         C'mon, you only beat up the roof 
                         when something's on your mind.
                              (beat)
                         How's Brian doing?

                                     STEPHEN
                         He's out.

                                     HELEN
                         I know he's out, but how's he doing?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Y'know, I treated him better than 
                         any other probie I ever had. He 
                         probably hates my guts, but I did 
                         the best thing for him. I made him 
                         finally look in the mirror.

                                     HELEN
                         Ah Stephen, that's what this is really 
                         about, isn't it? You always have to 
                         be right.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hey, I'm the first one to admit when 
                         I'm wrong.

                                     HELEN
                         Yeah? When was the last time?

                                     STEPHEN
                         In a fire? Never.
                              (beat)
                         Look, I'm his brother. I care about 
                         him, y'know? He was going to get 
                         himself killed. Maybe not today, 
                         maybe not in a year, but it would've 
                         happened. And I couldn't -- I just 
                         couldn't...

                                     HELEN
                         You can't keep being his father...

               Stephen sighs deeply.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You know what I realized today? I 
                         can't remember my dad's face anymore. 
                         There's pictures of him staring at 
                         me everywhere I go, but the guy behind 
                         them... he's gone...

               He sighs and hops down from the roof to the driveway.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I'll see ya around, Helen.

               She watches him as he walks lonely up the street.

               INT. CITY MORGUE - DAY

               A Lab Tech, RICCO, leads Brian and Rimgale through the autopsy 
               area till they come on two corpses lying side by side covered 
               in plastic.

                                     RICCO
                         Okay, Alan Seagrave and Donald 
                         Cosgrove...

               If you say so. Brian's stomach does a half-gainer as he's 
               confronted by two hideously charred bodies.

                                     RICCO
                         ...Both deaths due to close encounters 
                         with stationary objects; office door 
                         for Mr. Cosgrove, '89 Porsche for 
                         Mr. Seagrave. No non-relevant traumas. 
                         No significant blood toxicology. 
                         Attitude of both trajectories 
                         consistent with explosions.

               Brian is discreetly avoiding his gaze, whistling quietly to 
               himself as he looks over specimen jars on a shelf.

                                     RICCO
                         They ran the residue you scraped 
                         from both crispers' front doors. 
                         It's a combination of plumber's putty 
                         and rayophene gum. Burns almost 
                         completely away when you light it.

                                     SHADOW
                         Putty? On both doors?

                                     RICCO
                         There's something else kinda 
                         interesting...

               Ricco lifts Benton's charred shoulder. Underneath we see 
               some of his clothes that have melted and co-mingled with his 
               flesh.

                                     RICCO
                         See this?

               A credit card has been fried right into Cosgrove's skin about 
               where his back pocket should have been.

                                     RICCO
                         Guess he didn't leave home without 
                         it.

               Ricco erupts in a honking laugh, then switches instantly 
               back to a business tone.

                                     RICCO
                         Anyway, down here, take a look...

                                     SHADOW
                         McCaffrey, hold this for us.

                                     BRIAN
                         Uh, I don't think that's in my 
                         contract...

                                     SHADOW
                         I just re-wrote your contract. 
                         C'mere...

               With supreme reluctance Brian pulls the crisper's head and 
               shoulder away from the table.

                                     RICCO
                         Jesus Christ, he isn't gonna try to 
                         sell you insurance, lift him.

               Brian gathers the torso up and hoists him higher.

                                     RICCO
                              (to Rimgale)
                         See that patch of shirt? We wondered 
                         about the discoloration so he ran a 
                         spectro. On a lucky shot we picked 
                         up some traces of Trychticholorate. 
                         Nobody around here had ever heard of 
                         it.

                                     SHADOW
                         Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an 
                         absorption catalyst in toxic waste 
                         accidents. It's pretty rare, they 
                         stopped making it a couple'a years 
                         ago.

                                     RICCO
                         Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes 
                         in a gas state from the fire.

                                     SHADOW
                         What the hell was it doing in the 
                         fire?

                                     RICCO
                         That's your job.

               At that instant, Cosgrove's eyes OPEN and his body SIGHS. 
               Brian DROPS the body in shock and backs away, stunned.

                                     SHADOW
                         I asked you to hold him, not feel 
                         him up...

               INT. RIMGALE'S CAR - DAY

               Rimgale's FD sedan. Brian is still wringing imaginary guts 
               off his hands. Rimgale tosses an open fire chem book in his 
               lap.

                                     SHADOW
                         Read.

                                     BRIAN
                         "Trychtichlorate is a binary 
                         structured --"

                                     SHADOW
                         -- Go to the bottom. Under heat 
                         properties.

                                     BRIAN
                         "During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin 
                         or higher, Trych breaks down and 
                         dissipates. Will consume magnesium".

                                     SHADOW
                         Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot 
                         it takes water molecules and BAMM!

               Rimgale CLAPS his hands next to Brian's head, STARTLING him.

                                     SHADOW
                         Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just 
                         to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take 
                         much at all to melt ten gauge wire. 
                         Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a 
                         powder trace -- unless you could 
                         find something that would eat its 
                         residue.

                                     BRIAN
                         Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can 
                         announce Seagrave was a murder.

               Rimgale looks at Brian. He's getting tired of this.

                                     SHADOW
                         Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone 
                         may have put the chemical in the 
                         outlet, but we found it as a vapor 
                         in Cosgrove's clothes.

                                     BRIAN
                         And the putty around the door?

                                     SHADOW
                         Even if it was used to seal the air 
                         off, that doesn't explain why someone 
                         would go to the trouble of a 
                         backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot 
                         easier

                                     BRIAN
                         But the right guess on this is arson.

                                     SHADOW
                         I don't guess.

                                     BRIAN
                         Some people say you don't do much of 
                         anything when it comes to this case.

                                     SHADOW
                         I don't work for them, either.

               INT. ARSON HQ - DAY

               Brian's sitting at a desk. He's finishing up a huge paper 
               clip Tyrannosaurus. The phone RINGS.

                                     BRIAN

                         given me all week.

               We see Jennifer's calling from her office, she's busy signing 
               papers brought to her and okaying campaign posters as she 
               talks.

                                     BRIAN

                         Boss and I are up to about three 
                         words an hour.

                         There's another fund-raising party 
                         tonight. Marty'd really like you to

                         I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.

               He tosses a paper airplane.

                                     JENNIFER
                         I could use a date.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...

                              (into phone)
                         Call ya back.

               Brian hangs up quickly and walks back into

               INT. ARSON HQ - ANOTHER ROOM - DAY

               Rimgale's there, crouched excitedly beside a trash can that's 
               lid's been sealed closed. He tamps a piece of putty on the 
               rim and backs away.

                                     SHADOW
                         Take the top off. Go ahead. Take it 
                         off.

               Brian walks over and RIPS OFF the lid. -- Instantly a tongue 
               of flame SHOOTS straight up past his head and BLOWS out.

                                     BRIAN
                         Jesus!

               Rimgale's grinning like a little kid.

                                     SHADOW
                         That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, 
                         he's different, goddamn it! You see 
                         what this tells us, huh? Our killer 
                         doesn't love fire!

                         What?

                         much. -- The burns were all lit in 
                         outlets surrounded by double 
                         firebreaks in the walls. And he made 
                         his burns backdrafts.

                         But he killed these guys.

                                     SHADOW
                         But he could have killed everybody 
                         there. The firebreaks kept it from 
                         spreading in the wall. The backdraft 
                         blew out the flame. That's it. That's 
                         the reason.

                                     BRIAN
                         What reason?

                                     SHADOW
                         Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave 
                         and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot 
                         of trouble to make sure they died by 
                         fire, but also made sure the fire 
                         blew itself out.

                                     BRIAN
                         That's why the sealant on the doors... 
                         So what have we got, a torch with a 
                         conscience?

                                     SHADOW
                         No, we have a stone killer trying to 
                         make a point.

                                     BRIAN
                         Are you going public with this?

                                     SHADOW
                         No. Do that and I guarantee you'll 
                         scare him off. I don't want him 
                         running away.

               EXT. PARTY BOAT - NIGHT

               A Latin band cuts loose as beautiful people mill about against 
               a beautiful Chicago skyline. An AIR HORN blows, and suddenly 
               the skyline is MOVING. We're on a huge, private party boat.

               EXT. PARTY BOAT - NIGHT

               Brian's leaning on the boat railing watching the passing 
               parade of rich and beautiful. Across the sea of champagne 
               and brie, he spots Jennifer talking with her boss, Swayzak. 
               He has his hand on her back.

               Jennifer spots Brian. She smile, detaches herself and walks 
               over.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Hi.

                                     BRIAN
                              (eyes on Swayzak)
                         Hey...
                              (beat)
                         So are you dating your boss or what?

                                     JENNIFER
                         If you weren't at least the 300th 
                         person to ask me that, I'd probably 
                         be pissed.
                              (beat, sighs)
                         Boy, you sure know it's a man's world 
                         sometimes...

                                     BRIAN
                         Sorry.
                              (beat)
                         Are you dating anyone?

                                     JENNIFER
                         You think that's really any of your 
                         business?

                                     BRIAN
                         Well, you did invite me here.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Marty did.
                              (beat, smiles)
                         But I wanted you to come to.

               Swayzak suddenly appears with his entourage.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Mr. McCaffrey...

                                     BRIAN
                         Nice boat.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         It isn't mine.
                              (to photographer)
                         Let's get a picture.

               Swayzak swings around and puts his arm cheesily around Brian's 
               shoulder. Another staffer slaps a SWAYZAK FOR MAYOR sticker 
               to Brian's lapel. Jennifer rolls her eyes to Brian. I'm 
               sorry... Snap.

                                     SWAYZAK
                              (seeing someone else)
                         Larry!
                              (sotto to Jennifer)
                         What does he do again?

               Swayzak leads her off in pursuit. Left alone, Brian turns to 
               the railing, stares off at the passing city. You can hear 
               the wind-up of a siren.

               And there it is now, an engine company zooming along Wacker 
               Drive. Something digs and kicks inside of Brian as he watches 
               it disappear.

                                     JENNIFER
                         How's the job going?

               She's appeared again beside him.

                                     BRIAN
                         Okay.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, 
                         isn't he?

                                     BRIAN
                         No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's 
                         not a dummy, though. He's juggling 
                         alot of balls on this one.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert 
                         Einstein just to figure out if these 
                         guys were killed by accidents or 
                         not.

                                     BRIAN
                         Jesus, give him a break. There isn't 
                         enough proof yet to go public. Sure, 
                         we found some chemical shit we think 
                         somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 
                         'em, and we've maybe figured out why 
                         backdrafts, but you can't rush this 
                         stuff. Not 'till it's locked.

                                     JENNIFER
                         But Rimgale's probably going to come 
                         around to arson.

                                     BRIAN
                         In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.

               BAMM!

               Both of them look up sharply. A woman drunk out of her mind 
               has tipped over in her chair. She laughs, her fellow 
               tablemates laugh, everybody laughs. Jennifer takes Brian by 
               the arm in the opposite direction and smiles.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Save me.

               EXT. PARTY BOAT - NIGHT

               The band's completely cut loose now. A wild percussion rhythm 
               that has everyone on their feet dancing like madmen. Brian 
               and Jennifer stomp and sweat and shake and giggle through 
               hair crazily askew. The lakeshore is twinkling and wonderful 
               as it slips past. The drums beat faster and harder and the 
               only thing that isn't moving now is their eyes -- eyes locked 
               on each other.

               EXT. ARSON HQ - NIGHT

               Sweaty, flushed with the evening and a few drinks, Brian and 
               Jennifer pull up in her car.

                                     BRIAN
                         Thanks for the invite.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Got anything to drink in there?

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh, there might be something stashed 
                         away for emergencies.

               INT. ARSON HQ/FIRE STATION

               The regular engine company's gone to bed and the arson squad's 
               packed in for the night, leaving the apparatus floor quiet 
               and dim as Brian and Jennifer enter.

               Brian leads her back past the engine and arson sedan to the 
               rear where Rimgale has his offices. As they walk Jennifer's 
               eyes drift up to the old sculpted parapets, the press-tin 
               ceiling.

                                     BRIAN
                         This is one of the oldest fire 
                         stations in the city. Lotta tradition 
                         locked up in here. What do you think?

                                     JENNIFER
                         Homey.

                                     BRIAN
                         See that trap door up there? That 
                         used to lead to the hay loft when 
                         they had horse-drawn engines. It was 
                         pretty different then... but kinda 
                         the same, y'know?

                                     JENNIFER
                         Do you miss it?
                              (he doesn't answer)
                         You seem like you do.

                                     BRIAN
                         When I came back, I knew more than 
                         anything else that I wanted to be a 
                         fireman.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Then why did you quit?

                                     BRIAN
                         I wanted to be a good one.

               INT. ARSON HQ - BACK OFFICES

               They walk into the back arson offices. Brian pokes through a 
               few drawers, one or two shelves. Finally he lifts a squat, 
               specialized fire extinguisher. The bottom has been hollowed 
               out, leaving room for a fifth of bourbon.

                                     BRIAN
                         Old firehouse trick.

               He pours her a glass. Jennifer takes a generous sip of her's, 
               turns, brushes past him and breathes,

                                     JENNIFER
                         So show me your fire truck.

               INT. ARSON HQ - APPARATUS FLOOR

               Brian escorts Jennifer along the side of the behemoth.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well, our specimen here is your basic 
                         standard issue piece of primary 
                         suppression equipment. This area is 
                         the pumping panel, which controls 
                         the rate of liquid insertion into 
                         the hose.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Uh huh.

               Brian lifts a narrow, tapered straight-bore nozzle.

                                     BRIAN
                         This is a six inch playpipe, cast 
                         bronze to keep it firm during hard 
                         flows.
                              (picks up another 
                              item)
                         This is our pipe extender, used in 
                         forward lays...
                              (moves on)
                         This is our hard suction line... Our 
                         adjustable insertion nozzle...
                              (comes around back of 
                              trunk)
                         ...And this is the hose bed.

               Beat. The air cracks between them. And is brushed aside. In 
               an instant they're all over each other. Tangled lips and 
               gulping breaths. Jennifer abruptly breaks it off

               -- And looks mischievously up at the hose bed, with its long 
               curling rolls of soft cotton.

               Brian doesn't remember this precise scenario being discussed 
               at the academy, but he improvises admirably, popping up onto 
               the hose bed and offering a gentlemanly hand to Jennifer. As 
               they tumble into the soft folds

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Engine 17 roars up, lights flashing, to a high-rise. As the 
               crew jumps down Tim trips and falls flat on his face.

                         Jesus Tim, if you're going to kill 
                         yourself at least wait till the fire, 
                         it's better P.R.

               Jennifer unbuttons Brian's shirt.

               She pulls the shirt off his shoulder as we

               Engine 17 walking up to a frazzled security guard in the 
               lobby.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Where is it?

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Don't know. There's alarms going off 
                         on three different floors.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Wonderful.

               They climb into the elevator.

               INT. HIGH RISE - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               It's cramped on the way up with the bulky coats, helmets, 
               hose rolls, and the tangible nervousness that always goes 
               with this kind of fire. The elevator Musak plays 101 Strings 
               version of "Tie A Yellow Ribbon 'Round The Old Oak Tree".

                                     TIM
                         How do we know if the floor's going 
                         to be on fire?

                                     STEPHEN
                         If the doors open and it's hot, don't 
                         get out.

               INT. ARSON HQ - HOSE BED

               Brian pulls off Jennifer's stockings. As she kicks it away...

               INT. HIGH-RISE - UPPER FLOOR - NIGHT

               The elevator stops. DING. The door opens. No howling blaze, 
               not even any noise, but enough hanging smoke that you can't 
               see your hand in front of your face.

               They fan out gingerly onto the floor, looking for the fire. 
               Hide and seek in a white fog bank. Everybody stops and 
               listens. Slowly, carefully, they feel their way through the 
               haze.

                                     STEPHEN
                         It's here.

               On cue something snakes past behind the walls, whispers and 
               whines and shivers up and over them and then is silent. 
               Grindle attaches a hoseline to the building standpipe.

                                     GRINDLE
                         These high-rise gigs give me the 
                         creeps.

                                     AXE
                         Let's wait for a back-up, Stephen. 
                         We're early on this one, it hasn't 
                         even broke out yet. We're one short 
                         as it is with Brian gone.

               But Stephen's on the hunt now. Obsessed.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Want to learn something?

                                     TIM
                         Yes sir!

               Stephen and Tim take the lead, their axes gripped like 
               shotguns. Grindle backs them up with a charged hoseline.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Adcox, go with Pengelly and check 
                         the other side.

                                     AXE
                         It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' 
                         us up. Not with this one.

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- What the hell's the matter with 
                         you? You always check the other side. 
                         I haven't got time for bullshit right 
                         now, okay? We got a job here.

                                     AXE
                         Let me take the lead, Stephen...

                                     STEPHEN
                         Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking 
                         job!

               Adcox folds. With a stricken look on his face he takes his 
               crew down the other way. Stephen and Tim slowly feel their 
               way.

               CRACK

               Everybody SPINS around in terror. Nothing. Something inhuman 
               giggles down ahead of them. Stephen smiles.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (like a mantra)
                         Oh, you're so very sly, but so am 
                         I...
                              (to Tim)
                         ...Listen to it... you can tell when 
                         a wall cracks which way it's gonna 
                         jump... you can hear the doors breathe 
                         if they're hot...

               Tim looks confused. He doesn't get it.

               They come to a side door. Stephen runs his hand down the 
               jam, feels for heat. Then he steps back, takes a deep breath, 
               and CRASHES the door down with one AXE BLOW. Quiet inside.

               INT. ARSON HQ - HOSE BED - NIGHT

               Brian and Jennifer are into the rhythm now, breathing deeply. 
               On the wall above them are framed photos of dead firemen. 
               Watching.

               INT. HIGH-RISE - SECOND DOORWAY - NIGHT

               Stephen concentrates on the sound of the fire above him, --
               then abruptly turns and CRASHES down another door.

               INT. ARSON HQ - ALARM KLAXON GOES OFF - NIGHT

               Brian and Jennifer lie in a tight embrace, enjoying the 
               moment, the lull, as suddenly the lights SNAP ON and an alarm 
               klaxon BELLOWS. Firemen are coming down the pole now.

                                     JENNIFER
                         What's going on?

               They frantically climb into their clothes. The firemen haven't 
               noticed them as they climb aboard. They've STARTED THE ENGINE.

                                     JENNIFER
                         What are they doing?

               EXT. ARSON HQ - STREETS - NIGHT

               And before either of them realizes it, they're suddenly 
               pulling out into the street and WAILING off down the block. 
               The wind's wild in their hair, the siren deafening, the 
               flashing red lights blinding staccato, And Jennifer loves 
               it. She kisses Brian fiercely, he lets out a war whoop lost 
               in the blast of air, and together they hold each other as 
               the night screams past and...

               EXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

               Engine 17 pulls up into the parking lot of the high-rise 
               fire. Firemen leap out of the cab and rush around behind to 
               pull off lengths of hose from the bed. As the folds curl 
               away the fireman is stunned to see a woman's stocking come 
               out with it.

               With equal shock he looks up and watches as a disheveled and 
               grinning Brian and Jennifer climb calmly down out of the 
               bed.

                                     BRIAN
                         Excuse us.

               INT. HIGH-RISE - TIM'S DOOR - NIGHT

               Stephen and Tim creep along the hall.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to Tim)
                         Lotta smoke, but it isn't rolling... 
                         that means it's hiding... staying 
                         sleepy... one of these doors...

               Tim's come to one.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to himself)
                         Easy... no hurry... you're not going 
                         anywhere...

               Stephen BANGS down another door. Sticks his head in to check. 
               A little woodpecker toy dips up and down in a glass of water.

               Tim readies his axe before his door, gathers his courage as 
               Stephen comes out of the room he was checking. Sees Tim 
               lifting his axe.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Did you check the door for heat, 
                         Tim?

               Tim doesn't hear. The axe is already up.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Tim?

               Tim's committed now, coming hard at the door. And Stephen 
               sees it for just an instant -- Small tendrils of smoke edging 
               lazily around the door -- then being sucked back in.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Tim!

               He rushes for Tim as Tim's axe SMACKS the door and a whine 
               behind it builds and roars and howls and Tim's all follow-
               through now, hitting the door with his shoulder as 

               The door EXPLODES OUTWARD, HURLING TIM against the opposite 
               wall and for an instant he's okay but he freezes in terror 
               as A SHRIEKING TONGUE OF FLAME SHOOTS OUT THE DOORWAY and 
               Grindle shouts in horror and opens his hose line as the flames 
               wrap Tim like a jealous lover as Adcox hears it and screams,

                                     AXE
                         Oh God! Oh God no!

               And Tim's screaming now too, because his helmet, his mask, 
               his face, it's all melting and Grindle dives suicidally at 
               the monster, BLASTING it with his hose as Stephen ignores 
               the flames and puts his arms around Tim as Grindle DOUSES 
               them both, killing the flames.

               The monster rolls wounded back into the room, into the air 
               shafts as Tim whimpers incoherently, sliding down the wall 
               as Stephen tries to help but oh God you can't tell what's 
               face and what's mask and helmet anymore.

               Grindle looks back where the fire came from. There's a corpse 
               in there, burned and lying between two doors.

               Adcox rushes to Tim's side sobbing and it's the end, the end 
               of the goddamn world...

               EXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

               Brian and Jennifer are having the time of their lives, when 
               suddenly a group of firemen pass by rushing someone on a 
               stretcher to an ambulance and Brian sees -- sweet Jesus -- 
               it's Tim. Jennifer turns away in horror. They load Tim into 
               the van as Adcox and Grindle jump in to ride along. To hold 
               his hand.

               Stephen watches the ambulance disappear out into the street. 
               Frustration and fury tear at him as he takes off his coat 
               and slams it to the ground. He kicks it, kicks it till his 
               strength's gone. He turns, his wounded eyes finding Brian.

               INT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

               Rimgale walks down the smokey corridor. The charred civilian 
               is there, sitting in the short stretch of hall between two 
               blown doors. Through the haze Rimgale sees Stephen crouched 
               in the interior room, picking at the debris. Lost in himself.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hey, Stevie.

               Stephen stands and looks around the room, seemingly unaware 
               of Rimgale. He walks wordlessly straight out past him, his 
               eyes streaming with tears.

               INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

               Brian shoulders his way through the emergency room. He passes 
               a small alcove full of vending machines. Adcox is there, 
               sipping a paper cup, leaning against the machine in deep 
               anguish.

                                     BRIAN
                         Is he...

                                     AXE
                         He's alive.

               INT. HOSPITAL ICU - NIGHT

               Further down the hall is ICU. Grindle and Santos are there, 
               sitting outside the room, raw and weary. Grindle nods to 
               Brian. Everyone's still stained and smudged from the fire.

               Everyone but Brian.

               Brian looks through a door window into the room. There, 
               surrounded by doctors and physicians, lies Tim. He's been 
               cut out of his uniform. Gauze bandages everywhere. As a pair 
               of forceps peel some away Brian glimpses what used to be a 
               face, now only reds and browns and leaky whites. He turns 
               away.

                                     BRIAN
                         Do they think he'll pull through?

                                     GRINDLE
                         They're not saying.

                                     BRIAN
                         I should have been there.

                                     NIGHTENGALE
                         None of us should have been there, 
                         Brian.

               Voices rise down the hall. Turn to shouts. It's Adcox and 
               Stephen, tearing heartbreakingly into one another. Brian 
               can't make out the words but it's ugly, emotional. Abruptly 
               it ends and Stephen emerges from the alcove, walking toward 
               them upset.

                                     BRIAN
                         You had to do it, didn't you?

               Stephen's got other things on his mind.

                                     STEPHEN
                         ...Not now, Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Had to take on another fire bare-
                         handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth 
                         man in there instead of looking out 
                         for your probie. Is that what 
                         happened? Is it, Stephen?

                                     STEPHEN
                         I had that fire. He didn't listen!

                                     BRIAN
                         He didn't listen? He was a fucking 
                         candidate! He was your responsibility. 
                         He shouldn't have been there in the 
                         first place, Stephen.
                              (beat)
                         You burned him.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Fuck you.

               Brian grabs his arm.

               Stephen SNAPS and roughly PUSHES Brian, knocking him against 
               the wall. Brian comes off it in a flash and is all over 
               Stephen. They go down and it's all thrashing and shouting 
               now. A horrible, endless draw. Grindle and Santos are in it, 
               pulling them apart, holding them up against opposite walls.

               Both brothers glare at one another, tears filling their eyes. 
               Brian shakes Grindle off and walks away.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ARSON HQ - BRIAN'S DESK - MORNING

               Brian sits staring blankly. A newspaper drops in front of 
               him. FIRE DEPT. SAYS IT'S MURDER. Rimgale stands above him.

                                     SHADOW
                         Goes on about how the break was made 
                         through the discovery of "chemical 
                         traces" and a "behavioral link". Oh, 
                         and Swayzak's quoted saying the chief 
                         investigator is closing in on the 
                         torch and expects an arrest "any 
                         time".

               Brian's eyes wince closed.

                                     SHADOW
                         Get your stuff and get out.

               INT. JENNIFER'S OFFICE - DAY

               She's pouring some coffee as Brian bursts in.

                                     JENNIFER
                              (surprised)
                         Brian. What's wrong?

                                     BRIAN
                         You told Swayzak about our arson 
                         lead. It's all over the fucking news.

                                     JENNIFER
                         I didn't know it was a secret. There 
                         aren't supposed to be secrets between 
                         the city and its investigators --

                                     BRIAN
                         -- Bullshit! You knew what I told 
                         you wasn't ready for the papers --

                                     JENNIFER
                         Will you please keep your voice down, 
                         there's people --

                                     BRIAN
                         -- You could have scared the son of 
                         a bitch off. We may never bust him 
                         now. All for a couple's political 
                         points.

                                     JENNIFER
                         I was doing my job.

                                     BRIAN
                              (grabs her arm)
                         Yeah? And just how much of all this 
                         has been "doing your job"?

                                     JENNIFER
                              (shakes it off)
                         Let me ask you something, do you 
                         really think Marty had you assigned 
                         to arson because of your firefighting 
                         skills? Who the hell are you kidding? 
                         I was there, remember? I saw you and 
                         your brother --

                                     BRIAN
                         Leave Stephen out of this --

                                     JENNIFER
                         Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.
                              (beat)
                         Who are you? Just another probie 
                         working for Swayzak --

                                     BRIAN
                         -- I work for the city.

                                     JENNIFER
                         You knew what we were asking you to 
                         do. Don't suddenly pull out a 
                         conscience now. The fit isn't right.

               Swayzak appears in the doorway. He looks haggard, as if he 
               hasn't slept. There's something haunted in his eyes.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a 
                         letter to the Times explaining how 
                         yesterday's arson announcement was a 
                         fabrication by your office. They 
                         loved it. And you know what? You 
                         were right, my family background in 
                         firefighting gave it weight.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Oh Brian...

               Brian shoulders his way past Swayzak and walks out.

               INT. HOSPITAL - TIM'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Brian walks up to Tim's room. Stephen's sitting there, ragged 
               looking. Inside the young probie lies wrapped in tubes and 
               gauze and years of wasted promise. An EKG beeps, a respirator 
               hisses, and Brian gulps down something heavy in his throat.

                                     STEPHEN
                         He's gonna live. Maybe not much else, 
                         but he's gonna live...

               Stephen walks away.

               EXT. ARSON HQ - MORNING

               As Rimgale gets out of his car a limousine pulls up. Swayzak 
               opens the rear door from inside.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Inspector.

                                     SHADOW
                         Alderman.

               INT. SWAYZAK SEDAN - DAY

               Cruising through traffic. Swayzak is disheveled, unshaven, 
               fidgety. A man who hasn't slept and had a few drinks before 
               the one he's pouring now. He offers one to Rimgale.

                                     SHADOW
                         I usually have breakfast first.

               Swayzak apparently doesn't.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         When are you going to catch the prick 
                         that's doing this, Don?

                                     SHADOW
                         "Don?"

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Don't you have any leads at all?

                                     SHADOW
                         No Marty, I don't.

               For the first time, Rimgale sees real fear on Swayzak's face.

                                     SHADOW
                         We still haven't found a connection 
                         between the victims.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, 
                         Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried 
                         in a goddamn high-rise!

                                     SHADOW
                         Holcomb? I didn't know the name of 
                         that victim had even been released 
                         yet.

               The sedan stops back at arson HQ. They'd gone around the 
               block.

               EXT. ARSON HQ - SWAYZAK SEDAN - DAY

               Rimgale opens the door, climbs out, lingers.

                                     SHADOW
                         Is there a connection between them, 
                         Alderman?

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Just catch the son of a bitch.

               The door shuts and Swayzak roars away.

               INT. ARSON HQ - BACK OFFICES - DAY

               Rimgale walks back into his offices. He's surprised to see 
               Brian there working at his desk.

                                     SHADOW
                         What the hell are you doing here?

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do 
                         whatever you want me to do. I just 
                         want to help catch the guy that burned 
                         Tim. You gotta give me another shot.

               Rimgale stares at Brian, appraises him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HIGH-RISE

               A CLOSE UP of Rimgale POPPING the molding around the door 
               frame of Holcomb's burned office. Underneath can be seen 
               traces of the same white residue from the other fires.

                                     SHADOW
                         I thought 'ol Marty was acting a 
                         little strange... And he's right.

               Rimgale rubs the white powder between his fingers.

                                     BRIAN
                         Backdraft?

               Rimgale stands at the spot in the short hall where the body 
               lied between two doors.

                                     SHADOW
                         The backdraft was set somewhere in 
                         there. It fried Holcomb when he opened 
                         the inner door. But the outer door 
                         held... and waited for Tim...

               Brian steps into the inner office.

                                     SHADOW
                         So find me the fire.

               Brian begins searching, probing. He finally stands. Defeated.

                                     SHADOW
                         You're thinking too much of the 
                         building and not enough of the ghost.

               Brian's eyes don't understand. From Rimgale's coat comes a 
               plastic flask. He pours out of it a liquid onto the floor 
               and lights a match.

                                     SHADOW
                         In a word, Brian, what is this job 
                         all about?

                                     BRIAN
                         Fire.

               Rimgale drops the match.

               WUMP. A small flame explodes to life.

                                     SHADOW
                         It's a living thing, Brian. It 
                         breathes, it eats, and it hates.

               The fire's climbing a wall, chewing a corner.

                                     SHADOW
                         The only way to beat it is to think 
                         like it. To know that this flame 
                         will spread this way across the floor 
                         not because of the physics of 
                         flammable liquids or heat convection, 
                         but because it wants to.

               FWUMP. It darts west. Licks the ceiling. The fire purrs and 
               hisses. Stretches luxuriously and attacks savagely.

                                     SHADOW
                         Some guys on this job, fire owns 
                         them. It makes them fight on its 
                         level. But the only way to truly 
                         kill it is to love it a little, just 
                         like Ronald.

               Brian stares at the flame. A goblin reaching out for him... --
               Woosh! Rimgale hits it with a fire extinguisher. In an instant 
               the goblin is gone, the genie in the bottle.

                                     VOICE
                         What the hell are you guys doin'?

               A young woman's entered.

                                     SHADOW
                         We're the fire department, lady.

                                     WOMAN
                         Well color me stupid, I always thought 
                         the fire dept. put out fires.

                                     SHADOW
                              (to woman)
                         You work here?

                                     WOMAN
                         Till yesterday. What do you think 
                         the odds are that a non-refundable 
                         ticket to Paris survived this?

                                     BRIAN
                         Somewhere between zero and no way.

                                     WOMAN
                         Shit. What a mess.

                                     SHADOW
                         You seem real broken up about Mr. 
                         Holcomb.

                                     WOMAN
                         Jeff Holcomb? The Darth Vader of tax 
                         accountants? He was a sleezeball. 
                         Hopefully a sleezeball that carried 
                         some insurance.

                                     BRIAN
                         Go talk to the building owner.

                                     WOMAN
                         He was the building owner.

                                     BRIAN
                         Our book lists the owner as Dekom 
                         Trust.

               She looks at him like he's the dumbest human she's met all 
               week.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - STEPHEN'S STATION OFFICE - DAY

               Stephen's lying sprawled on his bunk, his hands pressed over 
               his eyes. There's a voice outside the door.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I'm busy.

                                     GRINDLE
                         He just wants to --

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?

               A beat, then Rimgale himself enters.

                                     STEPHEN
                         What, they don't knock on your planet?

               Rimgale takes in Stephen's room, the half empty bourbon 
               bottle. Without a word, Rimgale walks over and pours it out. 
               He sits down beside Stephen.

                                     SHADOW
                         I still haven't gotten your fire 
                         report, Stevie. On Tim.

               A wave of pain rolls through Stephen.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I'm working on it.

                                     SHADOW
                         I deal with this stuff every day. 
                         But a fireman... you never get used 
                         to it.
                              (beat)
                         What happened up there? He was a 
                         candidate. Did he pay attention? Was 
                         he listening?

                                     STEPHEN
                         ...He wasn't listening to the right 
                         thing...

                                     SHADOW
                         What do you listen to, Stephen?

                                     STEPHEN
                         You don't know... nobody knows...

                                     SHADOW
                         I might.

               Stephen's eyes meet Rimgale's and hold.

                                     STEPHEN
                         It knows us. This one knows us.

                                     SHADOW
                              (beat)
                         I need that report, Lt.

               Stephen takes Rimgale's notebook out of his lap, rips out a 
               page, and writes angrily in huge block letters.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Tim-went-to-the-fire-and-now-he-
                         doesn't-have-a-face.

               Stephen throws the sheet at Rimgale, stands, and walks out.

               An Escher drawing of a place, endlessly vast racks spun around 
               an open central core. High up, lost among its rows, Brian is 
               going through rack after rack of dog-eared record books as

                         very high on Seagrave, either.

               A beat, then he looks directly at Brian.

               With glowing skyscrapers leaping up in the background, it's 
               an unexpectedly quiet, serene place along the lake. Jennifer 
               sits alone at a bench, watching an ancient fisherman look 
               for dinner, as Brian walks up.

                         know why he keeps that hidden.

                         You could check. It'd be in his files.

                         Y'know, four years ago I was working 
                         in a bakery. Two years ago I was 
                         bringing Marty coffee and he didn't 
                         even know my name. I run that office 
                         now. Marty believed in me and I 
                         believe in him. You want me to just 
                         throw that away?

               And it hangs between them, two people lonely on the edge of 
               the lake.

               At a workbench, under a single lamp, Stephen stands amongst 
               a confusion of tools, wire, And a wall socket.

               With a pair of pliers, he tugs at something within the socket, 
               puts the face-plate back on and screws it down. He stares at 
               it, and we feel the sudden wave of hopelessness cascading 
               through him.

               He sets the socket back down -- and SCATTERS everything aside 
               in a single, furious move.

                         was there were no ifs. Life and death, 
                         right and wrong. When someone called 
                         the fire department, we came... Those 
                         guys don't know how much I love 
                         them... You don't leave people 
                         hanging... cause that's what it's 
                         all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till 
                         death do us part. Isn't that what 
                         you heard?... It's you go, we go... 
                         Cause without that, it's the end of 
                         families, it's the end of the fire 
                         department... and when the fire 
                         department stops coming... that's

               there, lending a hand, beaming as Stephen tries to show him 
               how to flip an egg. Helen enters in her robe. He kisses her.

                         second...

               Stephen musses his son's hair and follows her out into the 
               hall.

                                     STEPHEN

                         -- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- He's gettin' good on those eggs. 
                         And y'know, he told me he actually 
                         likes the piano.

                                     HELEN
                         I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.

               The blow's so long and hard and deep you don't even see it.

                                     HELEN
                         It's... It's just things have 
                         changed... you're the same, Stephen, 
                         but things are different now... you've 
                         got a son... you're the best at what 
                         you do Stephen, you always were, but 
                         you scare me now...

               Just then, Sean sticks his head into it.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to Sean)
                         Hey... Sean-man, your dad blew it. I 
                         forgot I had to work this morning...

                         Promise.

               Helen's turned away.

               Finally the chair turns, revealing a haunted man. Polls are 
               far from his mind.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Jesus Christ, Marty, what's going 
                         on?

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Leave me alone.

               She sees a fire department file on the murders open on his 
               desk.

                                     JENNIFER
                         We've come a long way together, Marty. 
                         I've staked my whole career on you. 
                         And now you're sneaking around this 
                         office, leaking things to the papers 
                         behind my back...
                              (beat)
                         Is there something you're not telling 
                         me about these deaths?

               Swayzak's eyes are dead metal.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         No.

               And he turns his chair around again. Jennifer stands there a 
               beat. -- Then turns to the filing cabinets.

               EXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Brian drives up and parks. He's half way to the staircase 
               when he sees someone sitting in the dark in a car.

                                     BRIAN
                         Jennifer?

               She hands him a manila envelope.

                                     BRIAN
                         What is --

                                     JENNIFER
                         Just take it.

               Silence.

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm sorry.

                                     JENNIFER
                         That's a dumb thing to say.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're right.

               She starts her car.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Goodbye, Brian.

               INT. FIRE DEPARTMENT REPAIR DEPOT

               A cavernous hall full of dozens of fire trucks loaded on 
               jacks. Rimgale's sedan's there, the repairman shaking his 
               head in amazement at the undercarriage.

                                     REPAIRMAN
                         What the hell do you do with this 
                         thing?

               Rimgale's looking through the report Brian's handed him.

                                     SHADOW
                         This is the copy of Swayzak's manning 
                         report that was released. Everybody 
                         on this job knows it's bullshit but 
                         we could never argue with the numbers. 
                         They're all airtight.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah? Airtight?

               He dumps three more reports on Rimgale.

                                     BRIAN
                         I've got three different drafts of 
                         the same report -- with different 
                         numbers that're all over the place. 
                         Looks like they were just making it 
                         up as they went along.

                                     SHADOW
                         Did a little check on the consulting 
                         firm that wrote the report. They did 
                         exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower 
                         study. It's not even really a company. 
                         No employees, no directors, just a 
                         PO Box.

                                     BRIAN
                         Then who wrote the report?

                                     SHADOW
                         It had to be someone who knows 
                         numbers. Some kind of fancy 
                         accountant. But what's the connection?

               Brian hands him something else. A photograph. Swayzak and 
               the other three, posing on a fishing boat, 1970. Time of 
               their lives.

                                     SHADOW
                         I think it's time Mr. Swayzak and us 
                         had a little heart to heart talk.

               EXT. SWAYZAK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The red arson sedan pulls up to wealthy home. Rimgale and 
               Brian walk up and knock on the door -- it creaks open ajar. 
               They push the door open slowly.

               INT. SWAYZAK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               It's dark as they enter.

                                     SHADOW
                         Hello? Swayzak?

               Brian and Rimgale split up down different halls. It's the 
               HISS Brian hears first. Then the FLASH of an electrical socket 
               FLARING ice-cold cobalt blue. Suddenly the room's dimensions 
               are there in frantic, strobing shadows. Chairs, a couch --

               -- And a figure that JUMPS Brian. the light from the burning 
               plug is a fierce strobe as the figure, a confused shadow, 
               crashes Brian to the floor. They STRUGGLE.

               The figure GRABS Brian's throat. Brian PUSHES him back

               -- Against the burning wall plug. The figure SHRIEKS in pain, 
               gets his hand on a crowbar and SLAMS Brian -- who crumples, 
               dazed. The figure stands -- just as Rimgale TACKLES him. The 
               figure CRASHES across a gas space heater, SNAPPING the 
               connection off. The figure SLAMS Rimgale HARD with the 
               crowbar, squirms free, and stumbles out the door.

               Hissss... Rimgale climbs to his feet as fire eats at the 
               wall. A baby backdraft wagging its tail. He goes to a dazed 
               Brian's side, lifting him by his armpits and

               EXT. SWAYZAK HOUSE - NIGHT

               helping him outside. Hissss... The ruptured space heater 
               pumps gas furiously. Rimgale sees that. He also sees a bedroom 
               door ajar on the far side of the house. And through the door 
               a couch. And on the couch, A body. Hissss...

               INT. SWAYZAK HOUSE - NIGHT

               Rimgale rushes back inside. It's Swayzak, unconscious.

               EXT. SWAYZAK HOUSE - NIGHT

               Rimgale drags him out on the stoop beside Brian just as the 
               gas WHUMPS and the doors and windows EXPLODE in a HOWLING 
               FIREBALL, the shrapnel BLOWING Rimgale off his feet. Brian 
               slowly shakes his head clear. He looks around, tries to orient 
               himself.

                                     SHADOW
                         Uh... I sorta got a problem here...

               Brian climbs up to his feet and walks over to where Rimgale 
               lies at a weird angle, a piece of wrought iron fence punched 
               through his shoulder.

               INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

               Rimgale lies in an emergency room bed.

                                     SHADOW
                         Well Brian, I guess you can say it's 
                         arson now...

                                     BRIAN
                         How ya feeling?

               Rimgale grunts.

                                     BRIAN
                         Did you pull me out?

                                     SHADOW
                         Yeah.

                                     BRIAN
                         Did I say thanks?

                                     SHADOW
                         No.

                                     BRIAN
                         Just wondering.

                                     SHADOW
                         I hate hospitals. You're so... so 
                         goddamn useless...

               Rimgale suddenly kicks the bed frame in anger. He kicks it 
               over and over with frustration till something finally SNAPS 
               off. Brian waits, let's him vent his frustration.

                                     BRIAN
                         So what do you want me to do?

                                     SHADOW
                         I've been lying here hours... just 
                         thinking... We're close...
                              (beat)
                         We're not looking in the right place, 
                         Brian. This one knows us and we're 
                         not looking in the right place...

               INT. PRISON INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

               Brian's sitting alone in a chair. Finally the opposite door 
               opens and in enters Ronald.

                                     RONALD
                         Well, Mr. Life magazine. Come all 
                         this way just to say hi?

               Brian hands him a stack of murder files.

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm close... but I can't get who it 
                         is...

                                     RONALD
                         So you came to me...
                              (smiles)
                         Well, this is going to be an 
                         interesting afternoon after all...

               As Ronald starts to read the files

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. PRISON INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER - DAY

               Brian still sitting there. Watching Ronald devour the 
               statistics. The photos of charred bodies. Ronald finishes, 
               leans back.

                                     RONALD
                         Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you 
                         a story, you tell me one. Fair?

                                     BRIAN
                         Who's doing this?

                                     RONALD
                         Your first question should be who 
                         isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not 
                         enough damage. And an insurance pro? 
                         Where's the profit margin?

                                     BRIAN
                         Then who --

                                     RONALD
                         -- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.

                                     BRIAN
                         I don't have a story.

                                     RONALD
                         Sure you do.

               Ronald drops on the table a dog-eared copy of that 1972 LIFE 
               magazine with Brian on the cover.

                                     RONALD
                         Famous story even. Straight burn. 
                         Just an engine and truck first on 
                         scene. What did you feel, Brian, 
                         when you first got there?

                                     BRIAN
                         What?

                                     RONALD
                         You gotta tell a story too, Brian. 
                         It's fair. C'mon, don't think too 
                         hard --

                                     BRIAN
                         I... I thought it was great. I loved 
                         it. It was nothing to these guys... 
                         medium deal.

                                     RONALD
                         Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a 
                         civilians hollering -- medium deal. 
                         So young fireman Adcox and Captain 
                         McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get 
                         out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey 
                         does the ballsy jump across... what 
                         were you feeling, Brian?
                              (Brian doesn't answer)
                         C'mon, you promised. Be honest.
                              (Brian just stares)
                         Okay... Guard!

                                     BRIAN
                         -- I wanted to be him. Right then I 
                         wanted to be him more than anything...

                                     RONALD
                              (smiles)
                         Very good, Brian. -- About your report 
                         here. The way to a torch's heart is 
                         through his tools. That's how you 
                         know him. It's the way he talks to 
                         the fire. And to you if you listen.

                                     BRIAN
                         The outlets.

                                     RONALD
                         That's a probie answer. You're smarter 
                         than that, Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Trychticholorate.

                                     RONALD
                         Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox 
                         and McCaffrey, they go back inside. 
                         Only there's another fire in there 
                         nobody sees. And it took your dad, 
                         didn't it Brian? Did you see him 
                         burn?

               In a flash, Brian suddenly reaches across and grabs Ronald 
               by the collar.

                                     BRIAN
                         Who the fuck is doing this?

                                     RONALD
                         After it took your dad... the fire... 
                         did it look at you Brian? Did it 
                         talk to you?...

               And Ronald sees something in Brian's eyes. He smiles.

                                     RONALD
                         You see, our world's aren't so 
                         different...

               Brian releases Ronald.

                                     BRIAN
                              (quiet)
                         Who's doing this?

               The arsonist smiles a creepy, horrible grin.

                                     RONALD
                         Think, Brian. Who doesn't love fire, 
                         but knows it better than anyone else? 
                         Who's around trychticholorate 24 
                         hours a day?

               A cold shock rolls through Brian as he slumps back in his 
               chair.

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh Jesus Christ...

                                     RONALD
                         Not such a far walk after all, is 
                         it, Brian?

               EXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - MARINA - NIGHT

               Brian climbs up onto Stephen's boat. Nobody home. He opens 
               the cabin door, goes inside and hits the lights.

               INT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - NIGHT

               There's cereal bowls in the sink, beer bottles on the table, 
               And a stack of fire department supplies in the corner.

               His whole body aching with reluctance, Brian begins looking 
               through them. Solvents, Armorall, a small specialty can of 
               fire dept. chemicals. There's a label of ingredients on it. 
               Way down at the bottom, Is trychticholorate. Nausea wracks 
               its way through Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh goddamn it Stephen...

               Footsteps. Brian spins around in stone shock as Stephen comes 
               into the cabin.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hey, what are you doing here?

                                     BRIAN
                         Just... Just wanted to say hello...

                                     STEPHEN
                         So hello.

               Brian backs away from the chemicals.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Well, long as you're here you can 
                         help clean up a little. I've got a 
                         guy coming to look at this in a few 
                         minutes.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're selling dad's boat?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Yeah, it's just another memory in my 
                         life right now. And I got way too 
                         many of them...

                                     BRIAN
                         I really should get back. There's... 
                         there's something I'm supposed to 
                         do.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Yeah? What have you got to do?
                              (beat)
                         Look at you. Look at your face. All 
                         the things you must be thinking. 
                         Man, you must really hate my guts. 
                         Well, you know what? It's okay.

                                     BRIAN
                         Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk 
                         about this some other --

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- Okay, so you don't like me. You 
                         don't like everything I've done. 
                         What, because I wasn't such a genius 
                         the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, 
                         dad was gone, what was I supposed to 
                         do? You tell me, what the fuck was I 
                         supposed to do?!

               He KICKS the bulkhead wall.

                                     BRIAN
                         It's okay, Stephen, I --

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I 
                         don't have all the answers, but 
                         goddamn it, I've got some.
                              (beat)
                         Look, you're gonna do what you have 
                         to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten 
                         in the way. I'm your brother, not 
                         your father. Go on. You gotta go 
                         somewhere? Go...

               Brian turns to leave. Pauses.

                                     BRIAN
                         I saw it.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Saw what?

                                     BRIAN
                         When dad died, I saw another fire...

                                     STEPHEN
                         Everybody did.

                                     BRIAN
                         I saw it before it got them. I tried 
                         to yell, but... He asked me to look 
                         out for him. And I didn't do it. I 
                         let him die.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (stunned)
                         ...Jesus, you been carrying that 
                         around for twenty years? For christ's 
                         sake, you were seven years old! You 
                         think he could have heard you in 
                         there?

                                     BRIAN
                         I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. 
                         You don't know how hard it was for 
                         me to put that uniform on...

                                     STEPHEN
                         Maybe I do.
                              (sighs)
                         ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?
                              (beat)
                         People can change Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Sometimes right when you're looking 
                         at them.

               Brian sees the chemicals in the corner again and something 
               freezes up inside. Stephen catches the look and there's 
               horrible silence between them.

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh God, Stephen, what's going on 
                         with you?

                                     STEPHEN
                         I don't know, Brian... I don't know...

               EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - NIGHT

               Brian stands before the fire station. His brother's and his.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - UPSTAIRS LOCKER ROOM

               Brian PRIES the lock off Stephen's locker. Starts looking 
               through it. Adcox comes out of the shower with a towel on, 
               starts shaving in a mirror. He doesn't notice Brian. Adcox 
               turns to head for his own locker and the towel slips a little. 
               And Brian's universe caves in.

               An icy claw tears out his stomach. Gulping breaths, he forces 
               himself to look at Adcox's back.

               On it is a small, rectangular burn. It's fresh and it's the 
               size of a wall socket. At that moment Adcox turns. The two 
               of them stare at one another just a beat, then Adcox walks 
               past him. Just then the alarm bells RING. Brian hesitates a 
               beat, confused, then turns and runs down to

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - APPARATUS FLOOR

               Where firemen are scurrying around, suiting up. Brian looks 
               frantically for Stephen, sees him out back.

               EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - BACK OF STATION - SUNDOWN

                                     BRIAN
                              (breathless)
                         -- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta 
                         talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- What are you doing here?

                                     BRIAN
                         I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! 
                         I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, 
                         he's been killing people!

                                     STEPHEN
                         I know.

                                     BRIAN
                         How do you know?

                                     STEPHEN
                         I knew when you came looking for the 
                         chemicals. Looking for me.

                                     BRIAN
                         -- What were they doing there?

                                     STEPHEN
                         They were for the fucking boat, Brian.

               Grindles sticks his head out the back door.

                                     GRINDLE
                         We gotta roll, Stevie...

                                     STEPHEN
                         I'll be there.

                                     GRINDLE
                         They're waitin' man.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I'll be there, goddamn it!

               Grindle goes back in.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to Brian)
                         Anything else?

                                     BRIAN
                         What are we going to do about this?

                                     STEPHEN
                         I'll handle it.

                                     BRIAN
                         We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. 
                         I'll handle it. Me.

               Stephen turns and walks toward the station.

               Brian's eyes go to a window just above it. There, watching 
               him, watching the whole exchange between brothers, is Adcox.

               Adcox stares at Brian a beat, then finally disappears as 
               Brian hears the cough of diesel engines.

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh, Christ. Stephen...

               He starts running for the station.

               INT./EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - NIGHT

               -- It's too late. Adcox climbs aboard just as the engine 
               company pulls out and whistles down the street.

               The ladder company is just easing onto the drive. Brian 
               hesitates only an instant, then runs to the equipment racks, 
               PULLS off the hooks his helmet, coat, boots -- and jumps 
               onto the truck as it takes off in pursuit.

               INT./EXT. ENGINE COMPANY 17 - NIGHT

               As it howls down the avenue, Stephen turns around and stares 
               at Adcox sitting behind. The glimmer of an understanding...

               INT./EXT. TRUCK COMPANY 46 - NIGHT

               The laddermen look confused seeing Brian sitting among them.

               A CAR Suddenly CUTS the truck company off. The driver SLAMS 
               the brakes, PUSHING the truck company into a HORRIBLE SKID. 
               The back fishtails, the wheels JUMP the curb, BASH a mailbox, 
               and then the whole rig ROLLS onto its side and DRAGS to a 
               stop.

               It's tangled confusion in the rear cab. Firemen, unhurt, 
               piled atop one another. Brian slides his way out from under 
               them and looks down the street where plumes of smoke rise 
               six blocks away.

               He starts running.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE FIRE - NIGHT

               Flames and smoke curl from a huge industrial warehouse along 
               the river as Brian, panting, runs up. He searches frantically 
               through the maze of arriving engine companies, looking for 
               number 17. There it is but nobody's home. Brian stops a 
               passing captain.

                                     BRIAN
                         Where are they? Where's 17?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         On the roof.

               Brian looks up at the smoke and whirling firestorm four 
               stories above him, feels the bile of fear in his throat, the 
               desperation, -- And begins strapping on an air tank.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Brian, now fully suited up, climbs the endless rungs of an 
               extended aerial ladder.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE ROOF - NIGHT

               Tongues of flame ROCKET skyward through ragged holes. Black 
               clouds drift murderously, roofing tars bubble and hiss as 
               the roof itself GROANS like a comatose dinosaur, reminding 
               you the whole thing could go any minute -- and you with it.

               Trudging alone across this alien, spongy surface, Brian looks 
               for his company. It's almost impossible to tell anyone apart, 
               faces hidden behind helmets and masks.

               Suddenly a cloud of smoke clears and there's two firemen 
               near the edge, "17" on their helmets.

                                     BRIAN
                         Stephen --

               The helmets look up. Stephen and Adcox. Facing each other. 
               Adcox cradles an axe.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Brian?

               Brian starts to move beside Stephen but Adcox turns, tightens 
               his grip on the axe, and now all the cards are on the table. 
               A hissing black cloud drifts through. They're the only three 
               people on earth.

               Adcox's eyes are clouded with tears.

                                     AXE
                         Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- What the fuck were you thinking, 
                         huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.

                                     AXE
                         They were killing firemen, man. When 
                         Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's 
                         files... They were my friends, I had 
                         to do it. I had to do it for the 
                         department.

                                     BRIAN
                         Did you do it for Tim?

                                     AXE
                              (pain, to Stephen)
                         That was an accident! Jesus Christ, 
                         why did you have to go in there so 
                         fucking early? Why didn't you listen 
                         to me!

               Brian and Stephen are backed up against the roof edge -- 
               sixty feet up. Far below a fireboat has begun pumping a 
               massive stream at the side of the building.

                                     AXE
                         You gotta let me finish --

                                     BRIAN
                         Just come down, John. Just --

                                     AXE
                         -- Shut up! Your dad would fucking 
                         puke if he saw how you've shit on 
                         his department!

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- Knock it off!

                                     AXE
                              (to Stephen)
                         -- You can't let him turn you against 
                         your friends, man --

                                     BRIAN
                         -- He killed people --

                                     AXE
                         -- You know what Swayzak would do to 
                         the department if this got out? --

                                     BRIAN
                         -- Stephen, this is bullshit --

                                     AXE
                         -- What he would do to your dad's 
                         department? You gotta let me finish 
                         it --

               And there's a horrible glimmer of confusion on Stephen's 
               face.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're his Lt., Stephen...
                              (beat)
                         Are you gonna handle it? Are you 
                         Stephen?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Shut up!

                                     AXE
                         ...What do you want me to do, Stephen? 
                         Talk to me. What am I supposed to 
                         do?

                                     STEPHEN
                              (beat)
                         There's a fire. We've got a job here. 
                         Let's get on with it.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - ACROSS THE ROOF - NIGHT

               The rest of the crews are totally oblivious to what's 
               happening through the smoke on the other side. Grindle and 
               Santos feel the roof go suddenly spongy beneath them.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Shit... It's going! Clear the roof! 
                         Now!

               Everybody drops their equipment and runs for the edges as

               EXT. WAREHOUSE ROOF - BRIAN ET. AL - NIGHT

               Brian, Stephen and Adcox react as the roof HOWLS and GROANS 
               and huge SPLITS begin racing along it. And then it goes.

               The center section DROPS, and in rolling waves of SCREECHING 
               steel, the hole spreads outward; DEVOURING.

               Adcox shoves them aside and runs for his life as the hole 
               races for them, SWALLOWING roof.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Jesus Christ Brian, run! Run goddamn 
                         it!

               And Brian balls-out dashes for the edge. Stephen's made one 
               corner, Brian desperately heads for another. At the last 
               instant -- as the HOWLING FLAME BELLOWS UP to his ankles -- 
               Brian LEAPS OFF the roof --

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

               -- And falls half a story before CRASHING onto an exterior 
               fire escape. Flames have cut off the fire escape two floors 
               below, so Brian climbs down as far as possible, crawls onto 
               a ledge, KICKS out a window, steps through,

               And falls.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

               Blackness and emptiness, two stories of it, before he CRASHES 
               into a pool of water at the bottom. He's in a freight elevator 
               shaft, thrashing madly, drowning. Great SHEETS of WATER are 
               POURING through an upper doorway and CASCADING down like 
               monsoon rain.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - FIREBOAT

               We see it's coming from the fireboat's rushing stream.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - ELEVATOR SHAFT

               The weight of his equipment is pulling Brian underwater. 
               Struggling against the insane swirls and the sheets of water 
               still POURING DOWN, Brian unhooks his air tank. He leans 
               back, tries to float on the rising column of water. -- His 
               coat catches on something -- YANKS him underwater. He 
               struggles feverishly -- finally tears the coat off.

               The building GROANS in earnest. Flaming chunks of plaster 
               CRASH down around Brian, forcing him to duck underwater. The 
               place is coming apart.

               Ten feet above, one of the falling chunks SMACKS a gas main, 
               SPLITTING then IGNITING it. A white-hot JET OF FLAME SHOOTS 
               from one side of the shaft to the other.

               Brian's floating okay, he's floating right up into the flames.

               Brian tries to flatten himself out, to keep everything but 
               his nose below water, but he's still moving up -- the heat 
               becoming so intense his face flares and he's ducking under 
               water now, trying to stay alive, trying to decide whether to 
               drown or burn --

               -- When there's a CRASH. And suddenly another door on the 
               shaft is tearing open. There's a glint of an axe. A 
               flashlight.

               It's Stephen.

               Brian has about two seconds left. In that time Stephen sees 
               the shut-off for the gas line mounted on the wall opposite. 
               It's unreachable, a good twelve feet across a horizontal 
               curtain of flame. Before we can even assimilate that, 
               Stephen's already jumped. A crazy leap over the fire. He 
               SMACKS the opposite wall, HITS the shut-off, and FALLS 
               CRASHING into the pool beside Brian.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't 
                         you stay behind a desk where you 
                         belong?

                                     BRIAN
                         "You never know till the fire stares 
                         you down if you're gonna be --"

                                     STEPHEN
                         Oh shut up, huh?
                              (grimaces)
                         I think I broke my goddamn arm...

               Brian helps him stay above water. The level continues to 
               rise, bringing them finally even with an open doorway they 
               scramble through.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT

               It leads to a stairwell that's become a RAGING TORRENT of 
               water spilling down it. No way. They push through to the 
               next doorway and out onto

               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               The place is full of hundreds of chemical drums. The fire 
               has cracked its way into the room as WUMP -- drums begin 
               EXPLODING, SHOOTING UPWARD Roman candle fountains of 
               glittering FLAME. Brian helps Stephen as they snake their 
               way past sweating drums -- pressure valves hissing madly 
               with desperation. They duck low, round a corner,

               INT. WAREHOUSE - CATWALK - NIGHT

               -- And walk right into an axe handle that SMACKS Brian's 
               throat KNOCKING him gasping flat on his back. It's Adcox.

               Stephen JUMPS Adcox and TACKLES him on the edge of a metal 
               platform that extends out from the raised flooring.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You stupid son of a bitch! What the 
                         fuck are you doing!

                                     AXE
                         Stevie... I...

               Adcox struggles against him, heaving and sobbing.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Let it go! Goddamn it let it go!

               And Adcox releases the axe.

                                     AXE
                         I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

               Brian's on his feet now, coming toward them, when a chemical 
               drum below EXPLODES, the shock wave BUCKLING the platform 
               and DROPPING it several feet before it HOLDS. Brian, cut-
               off, is HIT with a wall of debris.

               Adcox and Stephen are FLUNG across the platform and THROUGH 
               the shattered railing. Stephen grabs a piece of broken, 
               dangling strut and hangs on with one hand.

               In his other hand is Adcox. Hanging below him, his grip 
               loosening.

                                     BRIAN
                         Stephen!

               Brian's struggling to get out from under the debris. The 
               railing Stephen's hanging onto is slick, his hand SLIPPING 
               along it. But he won't let go of Adcox. His eyes bore into 
               his best friend's with absolute conviction.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You go, we go.

               The towering shots of FLAME from below have begun to IGNITE 
               Adcox's pant leg. He's starting to burn. But Stephen won't 
               let go. Won't let go even as the flames crawl up Adcox's 
               back. And Stephen's hand is slipping and slipping and then 
               it isn't slipping anymore because it's come off.

                                     BRIAN
                         NO!

               Adcox and Stephen FALL. There's a narrow catwalk half-way 
               down. Stephen HITS with a sickening CRUNCH.

               Adcox falls past it, down into the flames.

               There's an exposed I-beam running from the ruined platform 
               out over the catwalk. Brian climbs up onto it, balances across 
               over the fire below and jumps down to the catwalk where his 
               brother lies, battered but still alive.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're gonna be all right, man.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - FLOOR - NIGHT

               Brian looks down and across the factory floor. There, coming 
               through the doorway, is Pengelly and Nightengale with a 
               hoseline.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey! Over here!

               They start for him when another drum EXPLODES, FLATTENING 
               them and launching their hoseline into a crazy, thrashing 
               arc. The flame has cut them off from the hose. Stephen sees 
               what Brian's thinking.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Wait for another hose team...

               But Brian's already moving for the catwalk ladder.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Wait for the goddamn hose team!

               Brian puts his feet on the outside rungs of the ladder and 
               SLIDES down to the factory floor. He's heading for the 
               hoseline when WHAM! -- The fire cuts him off. Not just any 
               fire. That same one from so many years ago.

               Don't fuck with me, kid. I'm not in the mood.

               Nightengale's lost his helmet and it's lying near the flames 
               spinning slowly upside down -- just like his father's. Brian 
               stands there, paralyzed, as the fire laughs at him. Same old 
               little kid with his finger up his ass. Then something 
               different comes into Brian's eyes.

                                     BRIAN
                         No... No more.

               There's a pathetic little wall extinguisher mounted on the 
               pole. Brian lifts it, approaches the fire. You can practically 
               hear the flames laugh at him. Brian suddenly turns and SLAMS 
               the neck of the extinguisher against the pole, BREAKING it 
               off before HEAVING the cannister HISSING into the flames 
               where it EXPLODES -- a cloud of extinguisher powder that 
               STUNS the flames just long enough for Brian to dash through 
               and TACKLE the hose.

               The fire shakes off the powder, rises up to kill -- Just as 
               Brian spins and HITS it with the STREAM.

               -- And it's like a howling train wreck as the two grapple 
               with each other -- Pengelly and Nightengale have an opening, 
               and they're dashing for the catwalk ladder up to Stephen 
               because the fire doesn't care -- it only has eyes for Brian 
               now --

               -- And Stephen sees Brian tackle the monster, and his eyes 
               fill with tears --

               -- And the fire's pushing Brian -- pushing him with the fury 
               of a frightened street bully -- but Brian won't give -- and 
               now the fire's back's broken -- it's whimpering, dying.

               And Pengelly and Nightengale have climbed up to Stephen now, 
               pulling him away.

                                     STEPHEN
                         That's my brother! That's my brother 
                         goddamn it!

               And the fire's just a little gremlin now, sighing sadly as 
               Brian steps up with the hoseline.

                                     BRIAN
                         Another time, friend.

               And whoosh, it's gone.

               EXT. BURNED BUILDING - NIGHT

               Brian rushes up as paramedics load his brother into an 
               ambulance.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (smiles, weak)
                         You are such a pain in the ass...

               As Brian jumps in with him

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

               Paramedics swarm over Stephen as the ambulance screams through 
               the night. Brian's right there, holding his hand.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't 
                         let 'em...

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... 
                         I won't.

               His brother squeezes Brian's hand, his eyes never leaving 
               him.

                                     PARAMEDIC
                              (reading EKG)
                         Oh shit, give him some lidocaine, 
                         now. Now.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (beat)
                         Who's your brother?

               Stephen's EKG's begun to falter. The other paramedic fires 
               off an injection into his IV.

                                     PARAMEDIC
                         His pressure's fading -- push some 
                         adrenalin.

               The EKG's become erratic. Stephen's eyes never leave Brian's.

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh man, don't you die... Don't you 
                         die...

                                     PARAMEDIC #2
                         He's going south... He's gonna box 
                         damn it...

               They put an ambo bag over Stephen's face. The eyes never 
               leave Brian's.

                                     BRIAN
                         Goddamn it don't you die now... Not 
                         now!

               They're breathing for him now. The EKG begins shrieking.

                                     PARAMEDIC
                         V-fib!

               The paramedics begin scrambling to load the defibrillator 
               pads on Stephen's chest. But the fireman's eyes never waver 
               from Brian. They look into his with complete conviction, 
               complete acceptance, And then they don't.

               FADE TO BLACK:

               Then, FADE UP TO:

               EXT. MICHIGAN AVE - DAWN

               A silent, quiet street absolutely empty of traffic. Then 
               over the crest of Chicago's mightiest thoroughfare, creeps 
               slowly a fire engine. It's emergency lights are on but not 
               the siren. This engine isn't in a hurry today.

               Behind comes another fire engine. And another. Ten, twenty, 
               all of them creeping slowly along. And behind the engines 
               now walk firemen in their dress blues. Hundreds of them. 
               Walking silently in step behind

               TWO COFFINS

               Loaded in the rear of Engine 17. Santos drives as Grindle, 
               Brian, and the men of ladder company 46, walk behind. The 
               silent procession passes under extended aerial ladders crossed 
               like dress swords. Average people stop, take their hats off.

               EXT. LAKE SHORE DRIVE - THE SILENT PROCESSION

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Two coffins, lying side by side, draped in the blue and white 
               of the Chicago flag. A single fire helmet rests atop each 
               casket.

               Brian stands at attention beside Helen. He holds the hand of 
               Stephen's son Sean, his eyes clouded with tears as a fire 
               dept. honor guard plays Taps. Jennifer's there, too far away 
               to touch.

               Rimgale, still wearing a head bandage, stands stiffly beside 
               a brass bell and speaks with a voice raw and weary.

                                     SHADOW
                         In the Chicago Fire Department the 
                         alarm code 3-3-5 signifies that the 
                         company has returned home to quarters. 
                         We will now ring out that code to 
                         welcome home John Adcox and Stephen 
                         McCaffrey...

               With a small hammer Rimgale rings out 3-3-5 on the bell.

               The honor guard folds the flag covering Stephen's casket and 
               hands it to Helen, who holds it to her breast as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               A sea of blue uniforms drifting across green as the funeral 
               breaks up. Brian hugs Helen and Sean. Lets them go.

               EXT. CEMETERY EDGE - DAY

               Rimgale's there, resting against his dept. sedan as Brian 
               walks by, pauses, and leans on it beside him. A beat.

                                     SHADOW
                         Your brother was a good man.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah.

                                     SHADOW
                         Another couple of good men get burned 
                         up for their city? Is that how it's 
                         going to read?
                              (Brian doesn't answer)
                         You're the only one that knows.

                                     BRIAN
                         Like it never happened...

               Rimgale turns to walk back to his sedan. He pauses. Looks 
               back to Brian.

                                     SHADOW
                         Want to help me with something?

               INT. OFFICE - DAY

               An elevator opens as Brian and Rimgale walk quickly out, 
               down a hall, and BURST into Swayzak's office.

               INT. SWAYZAK'S OFFICE - DAY

               The Alderman's there, giving a press conference from his 
               desk.

                                     SHADOW
                         Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?

                                     SWAYZAK
                              (confused)
                         Investigator...

               Rimgale sits on Swayzak's desk.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         I'm a little busy right now --

                                     SHADOW
                         This'll only take a minute. There's 
                         two cops outside that want to ask 
                         you about this --

               Rimgale drops the manning report on Swayzak's desk.

                                     SHADOW
                         This is just a guess of course, but 
                         I think they're gonna want to know 
                         why you secretly paid Donald Cosgrove, 
                         Jeffrey Holcomb and Alan Seagrave to 
                         create a phony manpower study.
                              (to cameras)
                         You guys'll wait, right?

               The room explodes with questions. Through the din Brian leans 
               over the desk very close to Swayzak.

                                     BRIAN
                         See that glow flashing in the corner 
                         of your eye? That's your career 
                         dissipation light. And it just went 
                         into high gear.

               Brian turns and pushes his way out. At the door he pauses 
               and looks back at Rimgale. The investigator nods and smiles 
               just a little...

               INT. SWAYZAK'S OFFICE CORRIDOR

               As Brian walks down it, Rimgale appears and calls to him.

                                     SHADOW
                         -- Brian.

               Brian hesitates.

                                     SHADOW
                         Don't keep looking over your shoulder 
                         for the ghost. It's gone now.

               And there's just a beat between the investigator and his 
               probie before Brian nods and walks away.

               EXT. SWAYZAK OFFICE CORRIDOR

               Brian walks down the hall. He passes Jennifer's small office. 
               She's in there, surrounded by packing boxes.

                                     BRIAN
                         I think your boss is going to need 
                         some spin control.

                              (beat)
                         What'll you do?

                         I don't have the slightest idea...

                         I'll see ya around, huh?

                         It's a small town.

               And morning breaking across the avenues and up against the 
               tired brick of firehouse 17.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - LOCKER ROOM

               Brian sits staring into his locker, lost in thought, his 
               equipment stacked up on the bench beside him. THE ALARM KLAXON 
               SOUNDS

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - APPARATUS FLOOR

               And firemen scurrying to their equipment on the apparatus 
               floor. They're climbing aboard their rigs now and the pumper's 
               diesel is coughing to life.

               At the last moment, as it begins to pull out, Brian comes 
               sliding down the pole in his turn-out gear, bounces off the 
               floor, and climbs aboard as the engine WHISTLES away.

               INT. ENGINE 17 - CAB

               There's a new fireman beside him on the bench. He can't get 
               his coat buckled right. Brian leans over does it for him.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're doing it wrong.

               EXT. FIRE ENGINE 17 - STREET - DAY

               And the fire engine slips away from us, down the avenue,

The sound of the HELICOPTER approaching...

                                                            2.
INT. ARMY HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- SUNRISE

The unmistakable SOUND OF GUNFIRE from below.

                      PILOT
          Holy shit, that's live fire!

As the Helicopter comes over the clearing, Styles and the
Pilot squint down through the windscreen to see the Two Men,
huddled together as BULLET HITS kick up DUST around them!

                      STYLES
          Who's shooting at them-

The Bigger Man raising his own his weapon and RETURNING FIRE.
The Smaller Man frantically waving the Helicopter down...

                         PILOT
          I can't see-

Below, the Bigger Man still shooting and then he lowers his
rifle and there's only SILENCE. No return fire.

And then Styles sees why. A THIRD MAN. Lying by the
treeline. Chest torn open by gunfire. Obviously dead. His
clothes - the same fatigues the first two men are wearing.

                      STYLES
          That was one of their own, he just
          Shot one of their own men-

                      PILOT
          Who was trying to shoot them-

                      STYLES
          Get us on the ground!

EXT. CLEARING -- SUNRISE

As the Helicopter comes in for a landing, the Bigger Man
kneels next to the Smaller Man, who bleeds from a bullet
wound to the arm.  His face, pale, sweating. The Bigger Man
wipes the Smaller Man's brow and speaks softly and seriously.

                      BIGGER MAN
          Are you ready for this?

The Smaller Man nods.

INT. ROADHOUSE -- MORNING

A full on shit-kicking dive.     Nearly empty, given the hour.
A TELEVISION plays the morning    news over the bar.  Only two
inhabitants - one a BARTENDER,    the other the lone CUSTOMER,
smoking and picking at a plate    of criminally runny eggs.

                                                           3.
                      HARDY
          Tell the truth, Vic. You made these
          with a blender, right?
He grins and we get our first good look at
TOM HARDY - Three day stubble, dark rings around his eyes,
but a with strong jaw and steady voice. Not your average
barfly. Somebody who maybe used to be somebody.
                      BARTENDER
          Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't
          make no damn difference to me.
                      HARDY
          You know that was like a quadruple
          negative?
The Bartender takes the plate away from him.
                      HARDY
          Can I at least have a drink?
                      BARTENDER
          It's ten thirty in the morning.
                      HARDY
          Yeah, if you've slept.
                      BARTENDER
          You know the law - no liquor before
          noon. Could lose my license.
                      HARDY
          Don't you mean "don't need no liquor
          license not taken away from me"?
The Bartender smiles.
                      BARTENDER
          Hurricane kept you up, too?
                      HARDY
          Yeah, and I could've used the sleep.
          I'm supposed to meet people here
          tonight, try and get some work going.
He stops, his attention suddenly on the TV.    A NEWSCASTER:
                      NEWSCASTER
          ...is expected to announce the grand
          jury indictments in the Guissepe
          Torres police corruption case as
          early as tomorrow afternoon.
          Speculations abound that up to ten
          former homicide detectives could be
          named in the proceedings-

                                                           4.
The Bartender turns the TV off hastily.   Embarrassed:
                      BARTENDER
          Sorry.
Hardy just looks away. The Bartender puts an empty glass
down and fills it to the lip with bourbon.
Hardy nods a "thank you" and reaches for the glass when the
PAGER on his hip goes off. He checks the number.
                      HARDY
          Bill Styles...
                      BARTENDER
          Who?
                      HARDY
          Old friend. Haven't talked to him
          in- 911. Can I use your phone?
The Bartender hands him a cordless and Hardy dials.
                      HARDY
          Hey, Bill, it's Tom. Long time no.
          . . whoa, whoa, slow down. Yeah...
          yeah, of course I'll come. An hour.
He hangs up and hands the phone back to the Bartender.
                      BARTENDER
          What was that?
Hardy, obviously shaken by the call.
                      HARDY
          I gotta go out to McKinley.
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- MORNING
Establishing. A sprawling five square mile compound nestled
in the Louisiana backwoods. Also damaged by the Hurricane.
HELICOPTERS loaded with emergency supplies land and take
off, REPAIR CREWS work feverishly on damaged buildings, all
while CADET PLATOONS complete morning drills around them.
This is still a boot camp after all.
SUPERIMPOSE: 1130 HOURS - FORT MCKINLEY BASIC TRAINING CENTER
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- MAIN GATE -- MORNING
Styles stands waiting nervously just beyond the CHECKPOINT
with WARRANT OFFICER JULIA OSBORNE - early 30's, attractive,
close cropped hair and icy eyes. In the middle of protesting.

                                                          5.
                      OSBORNE
          This is totally unnecessary-
                      STYLES
          He asked to see a policeman, we're
          getting him a policeman .
                      OSBORNE
          But this guy you called, he's not
          even Army-
                      STYLES
          He's former Army and the best I've
          ever seen in a room. Besides, he
          knows the territory, we did Basic
          together here.
              (off her look)
          You've had three hours with Dunbar
          and haven't gotten a peep, we need
          to take a different tack.
                      OSBORNE
          He's not Army, it's not official-
                      STYLES
          Then it's unofficial.
He takes a hit from an ASTHMA INHALER, as a '71 PONTIAC GTO
drives through the gate and pulls up. Hardy emerges.
                      OSBORNE
              (re: his appearance)
          Doesn't get any unofficialer than
          that...
The two old friends embrace.
                         HARDY
          How are you?
                       STYLES
          Been better.
              (pause)
          I read about what's been happening
          With you... I should have called-
                      HARDY
          What kind of trouble are you in?
Styles looks at the ground.      Momentarily flustered.
                         HARDY
          That bad?
                      STYLES
          Would I have called you if it wasn't?
          If there was any other way-

                                                       6.
                      HARDY
          Tell me what I can do.
                      OSBORNE
          You can get us some answers.
Hardy takes off his sunglasses, noticing her.
                      STYLES
          This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne,
          The closest thing we have to an in-
          House investigator.
                      HARDY
          And here you are going out of house.
          How's that make you feel, Jules?
                      OSBORNE
          Hostile and uncooperative.
                       HARDY
          Fantastic.   You want to tell me what's
          going on?
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS MORNING
Hardy follows Styles and Osborne. They pass SOLDIERS
replacing broken windows and sweeping up glass.
                      STYLES
          The official term for it is
          "Clusterfuck" . By the time Beth hit
          us, I'd canceled all off base
          exercises save one - a six man cadet
          team and their Drill out in the bush.
          We're missing three and the Sergeant.
          The cadets are in their eighth week
          of the cycle, nobody here knows much
          about them, up to and including their
          names. But the Sergeant...
                      HARDY
          It's not West, is it?    Tell me it's
          not West.
Styles' look tells him it is.
                       HARDY
          Ah, Christ
                      OSBORNE
          You knew Sergeant West?
                      HARDY
          He was our Drill here.    Man's older
          than sand.

                                                   7.
                      STYLES
          A few years ago, the Army picked our
          good buddy as their go to non-com to
          trot out to the press to talk about
          the kinder, gentler military. He
          even did the standard video greeting
          played to all incoming Basic cadets
          across the country.
                      HARDY
          Well, he's a good soldier.
Osborne nods, agreeing.
                      HARDY
          I didn't mean that as a compliment.
                      OSBORNE
          Sergeant West's served for twenty-
          Three years. He's the public face
          of the modern Army.
                      HARDY
          And you notice I'm not in the Army
          anymore.
They round a corner.
                      STYLES
          The exercise was one of his Section
          Eight "private sessions". Left around
          2100 yesterday and were scheduled
          for pick up at 0630 this morning.
                      HARDY
          And the problem is you only got three.
                      STYLES
          No, the problem is one's dead, one's
          got a bullet in his arm, and one
          won't talk. The one who won't talk
          was trading live fire with the dead
          one as we reached the pick-up.
                      HARDY
          I'm assuming that's what made him
          the dead one?
                      STYLES
          Cadet Roberto R. Nunez.   Killed right
          in front of me.
                      OSBORNE
          Search parties for the others are
          fanning out in a ten click radius
          from the pickup. If they're hurt
          and we can get to them in time...

                                                          8.
                      STYLES
          I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets
          we retrieved are to be flown to D.C.
          On a transport leaving here at 1700-
                      HARDY
          Which gives us about five hours.
          Why'd you call me?
                      STYLES
          The guy in interrogation said he'd
          only talk to a cop.
                      HARDY
          And I'm the closest thing to it,
          right?
Styles stops, turning to his friend.
                      STYLES
          Tom, bottom line: I let those kids
          go out there. If JAG shows up and I
          don't have any answers for them, my
          career is finished-
                      HARDY
          I'm not gonna let that happen.
Styles exhales, relieved.
                      STYLES
          Thank you. Osborne will brief you
          on the cadets. And Tom?
              (half-smile)
          It really is good to see you.
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- OSBORNE'S OFFICE -- MORNING
Osborne and Hardy enter, stepping over broken glass and
hurricane debris. Hardy looks around.
                      HARDY
          Gotta be honest, I love what you've
          Done with the place-
                      OSBORNE
          You and the Colonel go back.
                      HARDY
          He got me through Basic and a lot of
          other stuff. I owe him.
                      OSBORNE
          You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading
          about in the papers, right? New
          Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes
          from Guissepe Torres.

                                                           9.
                      HARDY
          It was for suspicion of bribery,
          it's really all in the wording-
                      OSBORNE
          Wording and your friendship with the
          Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable
          having you involved in this.
                      HARDY
          Subtlety really isn't one of you
          finer points, is it, Osborne?
Osborne opens her mouth to reply but Hardy cuts her off.
                      HARDY
          Three things. First - You don't
          have a choice. Second- I've never
          taken a bribe in my life. And Third -
          I'm still a little drunk from last
          night, so if I skip over the witty
          banter and move forward to straight
          hitting on you, try not to take
          offense. Tell me about the two guys.
                      OSBORNE
          Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe,
          so all we have are their dogtags.
          Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall-
                       HARDY
          Levi?   Who names their kid Levi-
                      OSB0RNE
          Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
                      HARDY
          Christ... Remind me to thank Bill
          for mentioning that on the phone-
                      OSBORNE
          Kendall Junior is still  in surgery,
          so he won't be available  to answer
          for his name or anything  else for
          another hour - the cadet  we're talking
          to first is Dunbar.
                      HARDY
          He's in interrogation?
                       OSBORNE
          Yes.
                       HARDY
          Move him.

                                                        10.
                         OSBORNE
          Why?
                      HARDY
          Because interrogation rooms look
          suspiciously like interrogation rooms,
          which doesn't exactly put people at
          ease. Is he cute?
                         OSBORNE
          Excuse me?
                      HARDY
          Is Dunbar cute?
                       OSBORNE
              (pissed)
          That is the most unprofessional-
                      HARDY
          Is he handsome, self assured, carry
          himself well, does he look you in
          the eyes or down at the floor, does
          he have good bones, suggesting good
          breeding, does he slouch or sit up
          straight - these are important
          questions, as they reveal a great
          deal about this man's character so
          please get over yourself for two and
          a half seconds and tell me is he
          cute?
Osborne stares at him.    She finally nods.
                      HARDY
          Thank you. At some point in there
          I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do,
          go at him with everything you got.
                      OSBORNE
          Good cop/bad cop?
                      HARDY
          Something like that.
She starts to go make preparations.
                       HARDY
          Oh, and Osborne? You have any donuts
          around here?
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDOR -- MORNING

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING
A small cluttered room with the shades drawn. A folding
table has been set up in the middle of it with a chair on
each side. Dunbar takes a seat in the far chair. Takes in
his surroundings as the MP's leave, locking the door.
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDOR - MORNING
Hardy and Osborne head towards the Coffee Room.
                      OSBORNE
          I questioned him for three hours and
          he didn't make a sound. You don't
          have a badge, he won't talk to you.
                      HARDY,
          Ten bucks says I have him talking in
          under three minutes.
Osborne starts the timer on her digital watch.
                        OSBORNE
          Go.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING
Dunbar looks up as they enter.    Hardy smiles, cheerily.
                      HARDY
          Cadet Dunbar, good morning! I'm Tom
          Hardy and I believe you've already
          met Officer Osborne. I understand
          you had a rough time of it last night?
No response.    Hardy takes a seat across from the cadet.
                      HARDY
          Not talking, huh? You probably just
          want to get some food and some sleep.
          They feed you yet?
No response.    Hardy reaches into his pocket.   Pulls out a
DONUT.
Dunbar eyes it, wary but definitely wanting it.
                      HARDY
          Go on. You can eat in front of
          someone and still not talk to them -
          my parents did it for years.
Dunbar grabs the donut, wolfing it down.
                      HARDY
          Want another one?
No response.    Osborne looks to her watch - it's been a minute.

                                                           12.
                      HARDY
          Maybe later. Ray, let me say this
          up front - I'm not a cop.
Dunbar turns away, no longer interested.   Hardy continues:
                      HARDY
          I used to be, but that's beside the
          point. Who I am doesn't really
          matter; what matters is that right
          now, you're in a shitload of trouble.
          You understand that, right?
No response.
                      HARDY
          Now, I don't know if you did what
          you did in self defense and frankly
          I don't really care. I'm just doing
          a favor for Colonel Styles because
          he wants to know if anyone else who's
          still out there is in need of
          assistance. To be honest with you,
          though, I don't care about that
          either.
Dunbar looks up at this, surprised.
                      HARDY
          I don't know those guys, you do.
          They die, to me, it's like seeing a
          couple people died in a fire on the
          news - tragic, but it doesn't affect
          me. The only thing I care about is
          I agreed to do a favor for a friend
          and try and talk to you till your
          transpo shows up. You like baseball?
No response.   Osborne looks at her watch - two minutes.
                      HARDY
          I could talk baseball for   days.
          Batting averages, ERA's, I   got
          statistics in my brain, I   don't know
          how I remember them. It's    freaky.
          You wanna talk baseball?
Dunbar, completely confused.
                      HARDY
          Come on Ray, we're gonna be here
          five hours, we gotta talk about
          something. So who do you like?
A long silence and then:

                                                        13.
                      DUNBAR
          I don't like baseball.
Hardy grins as Osborne stops her watch at 2:41.
                      HARDY
          Why not?
                      DUNBAR
          I asked for a policeman.
                      HARDY
          You're under military arrest, it's
          not gonna happen. What's wrong with
          baseball?
                      DUNBAR
          It's... too slow.
                      HARDY
          Well, it's a game of anticipation,
          that's the beauty.
                      DUNBAR
          I just don't like it.
                      HARDY
          What do you like then?
As they continue, we TRACK under the table to reveal a HIDDEN
MICROPHONE...
INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- MORNING
Styles and an M.P. listening to the Coffee Room conversation.
DUNBAR'S VOICE, over the speaker:
                      DUNBAR (O.S.)
          I don't know... I like the Army.
                      HARDY (O.S.)
          C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army
          during Basic. I'll tell you straight,
          I hated it here.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING
                      DUNBAR
          You did Basic here?
                      HARDY
          Fifteen years ago under Sergeant
          West. Piece of work, that guy. I
          remember, he used to have these two
          silver .45's with ivory handles and
          if you weren't quick enough, he'd
                      (MORE)

                                                              14.
                         HARDY (CONT'D)
             knock you on the head with one of
             them. He still carry those guns?
He Dunbar nods.
                         HARDY
             I was also his " knife dummy" .
                 (to Osborne)
             See, West used to say he could slit
             a man from stem to sternum in three
             seconds. He'd use this length of
             pipe to demonstrate and if you were
             the knife dummy, you'd spend all day
             getting a pipe rammed into your balls
             if you weren't fast enough to defend
             yourself. That was a loooong day.
Hardy laughs at the memory and turns back to Dunbar.
                         HARDY
             Incidentally, Ray, I promised them
             I'd ask where West and the others
             are. Can we get to them?
He looks to the floor.
                         DUNBAR
             There's no need...
                         HARDY
             They're dead, aren't they?
Dunbar looks back up at Hardy.
                         DUNBAR
             Yeah.
INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- MORNING
Styles lowers his head at this.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING
                         HARDY
             You kill them?
No answer.    Hardy rubs his nose.   Osborne steps forward.
                         OSBORNE
             The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez,
             You're a murderer-
                         HARDY
             See, Ray, this is what we call "good
             cop, bad cop".
                 (MORE)

                                                        15.
                       HARDY
          She shouts, I stand up for you, you're
          grateful, a bond of trust is
          established.
Osborne, stunned by this.
                      HARDY
          But I don't want to play games.
          That's why you're not in an
          interrogation room, with one of those
          two way mirrors - everyone knows
          those things are two way, right?
Dunbar looks at him good nods slowly.
                      HARDY
          Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you
          another donut and you think about
          whether you want to talk more, okay?
                      DUNBAR
          Okay.
Hardy smiles at him, gets up, and leaves.
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDOR -- MORNING
Osborne follows him out into the hall where Styles waits.
                      OSBORNE
          Baseball?
                      HARDY
          Believe somebody owes me ten dollars-
                      OSBORNE
          You made me look like an idiot-
                      HARDY
          Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the
          object of the interrogation is to
          make you look good- Everyone knows
          good cop, bad cop - by admitting it
          I appeared trustworthy.
                      STYLES
          You think he did it?
                      OSBORNE
          No-
                      HARDY
          Yes-
They stop, looking at each other.

                                                          16.
                      STYLES
          You've got four hours and forty-five
          minutes to find out.

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING

Hardy returns, another donut in hand, Osborne behind him.

                      HARDY
          Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?

                      DUNBAR
          I'm not telling you what happened.

                      HARDY
          Okay... but I would like to know
          about the other cadets. What they
          were like - nice guys? Dunbar takes
          a deep breath.

                      DUNBAR
          Some.

                      HARDY
          Tell me about them.

As Dunbar begins to talk, we FLASHBACK...

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO

Row upon row of freshly shaven headed CADETS stand at
attention. Their first day of boot camp.

                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          First day was when I met Pike.    Sarge
          hated him from the beginning.

A man with a face of granite strides up and down the lines.

Two ivory handled pistols on his hips. His lifeless cobalt
blue eyes take in the Cadets. This is SERGEANT WEST.

                      WEST
          You motherfuckers have just made the
          worst mistake of your lives! You
          have chosen to join my Army! This
          Army is my mother, my father, and my
          little virgin sister and I will not
          allow anyone or anything that is not
          up to my standards near her pretty
          little virgin cooze, do you understand
          me - give me a sir, yes, sir!

                      THE CADETS
          Sir, yes, sir!

                                                         17.
                      WEST
          Those who I deem unworthy to pass
          through this camp will quit, and
          those who refuse to quit I will kill.
          You ever hear of a training accident -
          Give me a sir, yes, sir!
                      THE CADETS
          Sir, yes, sir!
                      WEST
          In my time I have killed sixteen men
          for the good of my country, sixteen
          men whose entrance into this Army I
          could not condone, as it would weaken
          the fabric of this nation's defense!
          This base suffers an average of three
          training accidents a year, unfortunate
          incidents that I will not hesitate
          to repeat if you cross me, understand -
          Give me a sir, yes, sir!
                      THE CADETS
          Sir, yes, sir!
                      WEST
          So forget what you've seen on Sixty
          fucking Minutes about the kinder,
          gentler military - you will either
          succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
He walks over to a tall black cadet in the front row.   PIKE.
                      WEST
          My power here is absolute, isn't
          that right, nigger?
                      PIKE
          Sir, yes, sir!
West hauls off and SLAPS Pike across the face!
                      WEST
          I hail from Biloxi, Mississippi where
          we string greasy coon necks up from
          tree branches when the mood strikes
          us you have a problem with that?
                      PIKE
          Sir, no, sir!
West grabs Pike by the neck, CHOKING HIM. The others Cadets
GASP. Pike goes down on his knees, the loss of air is so
great. He reaches up automatically to try and save himself...

                                                          18.
                      WEST
          What the fuck is this? You lay a
          hand on me while I'm trying to do my
          duty and rid the world of you?
He KICKS PIKE IN THE BALLS and releases him. Pike goes fetal
on the ground, VOMITING, as West stands over him, screaming.
                      WEST
          Get the fuck up, you're still in
          formation, get the fuck up!
Pike somehow gets to his feet, vomit streaking his clothes.
                       WEST
          What the fuck have you done to that
          uniform, take it off, take it off,
          take it off!
Pike, still gasping, can't move fast enough.    West slaps him
again and tears the man's shirt off.
                      WEST
          Get those fucking pants off, I want
          you buck ass naked, you don't deserve
          to wear these beautiful United States
          Army issue clothes!
Pike struggles off the rest of his clothes until he is NAKED.
West turns and spies Dunbar in the line.
                      WEST
          Cadet, what's your name!
                      DUNBAR
          Sir, Dunbar, sir!
                      WEST
          You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
                      DUNBAR
          Sir, yes, sir!
West draws one of his PISTOLS and gives it to him.
                      WEST
          Dunbar you are to stand here and
          guard this nigger for the next twenty-
          four hours! He is not to be given
          food, water, or clothes! If he so
          much as moves, you are to blow his
          nigger brains out, is that clear?
                      DUNBAR
          Sir, yes, sir!

                                                           19.
                      WEST
          The rest of you, fallout for
          physicals!
The rest of the Cadets fallout, following West away to one
of the buildings, leaving Dunbar and Pike.
One with a gun, the other naked.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Fifteen guys quit that day.    But not
          Pike.
EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING
The CADETS, navigating a log spanned over a PIT OF MUD.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Time went on and the Sarge started
          singling people out.
One of the Cadets, a small man named ANDERSON, falls from
the log. Screaming, West dives into the pit and pulls
Anderson out, knocking him on the head with a pistol.
EXT. TARMAC -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- AFTERNOON
Anderson stands naked, his arms straining to hold up,TWO
PAINT CANS perpendicular to his body as West berates him.
                      DUNBAR
          He'd zero in on a fella and ride him
          till he quit.
EXT. MAIN GATE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- NIGHT
Anderson, now in civilian clothes, gets into a TAXI.   Quit.
EXT. FIRING RANGE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING
West, screaming at a weasely looking cadet named CHILDS.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Those who wouldn't quit, he'd put in
          what he called Section Eight.
INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- NIGHT
A horribly dilapidated quarters. Four cadets, Dunbar, Pike,
Childs, and MUELLER sleep in rickety bunks.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Washout rejects, guys he said were ,
          "dumbfucks too stupid to know they
          were dead". He separated us from
          the rest. We slept alone...

                                                          20.
INT. MESS HALL -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING
The same four Cadets, eating ON THE FLOOR as the other members
of the Cadet Corps chow at tables.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          . . .ate alone.. .
EXT. REGULAR BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- EVENING
The four Cadets fallout on a run shirtless, with heavy packs
and rifles held over their heads as the rest of the Cadet
Corps files into their barracks for sleep.
                      DUNBAR ( V. O . )
          ...and trained long after the other
          guys got to turn in.
EXT. PARADE GROUNDS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING
The Cadet Corps, mustered. West zeroes in on NUNEZ (the
"dead one"), whose t-shirt has a spot on it.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Fellas lived in daily fear of being
          Sectioned and with good reason, too.
West pulls Nunez out of line by his ear and kicks him over
towards a separate muster of our Four Section Eighters.
                      DUNBAR
          They figured we were the boys who'd
          meet with a "training accident" .
Nunez takes a place among them.   Looking absolutely terrified.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
Osborne leans forward.
                       OSBORNE
          Are you saying Sergeant West tried
          to kill you?
                      DUNBAR
          No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit.
          Making it through was kind of an
          honor. Some of the other guys on
          the base told us that if you could
          hack Section Eight, Command would
          consider you at the top of the class.
                      HARDY
          That's not exactly true...
              (off their looks)
          I'm living proof. How did you get
          Sectioned, Ray?

                                                        21.
Dunbar gives a look that almost resembles a smile.
                      DUNBAR
          That first night with Pike. I made
          the mistake of letting him sit down
          at around 0300.
                      OSBORNE
          Tell us about the other guys, the
          ones West weeded out.
                      DUNBAR
          There were six of us...
EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE.-- ONE WEEK AGO -- EVENING
The six members of Section Eight on a forced run through the
rain. We focus in each face as Dunbar describes them. First
up is MUELLER a tall Aryan looking blonde with a square jaw.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Mueller was from Tulsa, a real good
          ol' boy type. One of those "his
          Daddy's Daddy's Daddy died at Bull
          Run and no bleeding heart Yankee was
          gonna take away his scatter gun" .
          He idolized West.
Muller, grinning, as West kicks his ass to pick up the pace.
Next to him is NUNEZ, a strapping hulk of a manchild.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          And Nunez idolized Mueller. Big
          fella from New Mexico. After he got
          Sectioned he just followed Mueller
          around like a lap dog. He wasn't
          mean like Mueller, though, didn't
          have it in him.
Next to Nunez is CHILDS, small and weasely with feral eyes.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          But Childs did. Didn't talk to
          anyone, but you got this feeling
          something was wrong with him, like
          real wrong. Type of guy you felt
          uncomfortable going to sleep near.
Behind Childs runs Pike.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Pike I told you about. He took the
          brunt of it from Mueller and West.
          Once they found it out he was a
          convict they were merciless.
                      (MORE)

                                                           22.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          He'd been busted for Auto Theft,
          judge gave him the option of jailor
          the Army. He made the wrong choice.
Next to Pike, Dunbar and KENDALL run side by side.   Kendall
is short like Childs, but also weak. Wheezing.
                      DUNBAR
          Finally Kendall and me. Kendall was
          a smart guy, we got along okay.
          Pike and I tried to help him, but...
Kendall falters and Pike stops to try and help him up. West
smacks the him away, practically kicking Kendall to his feet.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          He was sickly. Had that shaking
          thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
                       OSBORNE (V.O.)
          Epilepsy.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Yeah. Spent half his time in the
          infirmary. Only reason he enlisted
          was his father. West didn't section
          him till last week.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                      HARDY
          And those were the guys who went on
          the exercise with you?
                       DUN BAR
          Yeah.   And that's all I'm saying.
Hardy leans back in his chair.
                      HARDY
          You smoke, Ray?
                      DUNBAR
          This is one of those interrogation
          tricks, isn't it? You don't give me
          a cigarette till I tell you more.
                      HARDY
          No, actually, I just left mine in
          the car and was hoping you had some.
Dunbar studies him for a moment and then pulls a pack of
Dorals from his pocket and puts them on the table.
                       HARDY
          My brand.   Must be my lucky day.

                                                         23.
He takes one and lights it.      Dunbar does the same.
                      HARDY
          Let me ask you one thing. You seem
          like a good guy, Ray. You carried
          Kendall wounded to the pickup. So
          what I don't get is what you did to
          make Nunez want to kill you?
Dunbar just looks at the ground. A KNOCK at the door.    Hardy
and Osborne turn to see an M.P. stick his head in.
                         M. P.
          Sirs?
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- MORNING
Hardy and Osborne emerge to find Styles waiting for them.
                      HARDY
          He's not done by a longshot, I can
          get more out of him-
                         STYLES
          He can wait.     Kendall's out of
          surgery.
EXT. ARMY JEEP (MOVING) -- MORNING
Hardy and Osborne sit in the back of the open car as it
rumbles across the grounds, headed towards the Base Hospital.
They sit in silence until:
                      HARDY
          Why'd you join the army?
Osborne looks at him, annoyed.
                      OSBORNE
          You really want to make banal chit-
          Chat like that now?
                      HARDY
          You're right. We should sit in
          silence.
                      OSBORNE
          We're in the middle of a murder case-
                      HARDY
          Best time for banal chit-chat.
He slips something into his pocket.
                      OSBORNE
          What is that?

                                                    24.
                      HARDY
          Microrecorder for Kendall - didn't
          have- time to wire his room. Now
          tell me why you joined the army or
          I'll jab this pen through your neck.
Osborne smiles in spite of, herself.
                      OSBORNE
          Typical army brat story. Dad was
          noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was
          never any real doubt of joining up.
                      HARDY
          You had a mobile of bayonets above
          your crib.
                      OSBORNE
          Something like that.     You?
                      HARDY
          I lost a bet.
Osborne laughs.
                      OSBORNE
          You're kidding.
                      HARDY
          Yeah. That's just the story I tell
          the girls to get them into bed.
          Truth is... I don't know. The whole
          honor and duty thing. Make a
          difference in the world, crap like
          that. Didn't really work out.
Osborne studies him.
                         OSBORNE
          I bet    that's the second story you
          tell    the girls to get them into bed,
          after    you make them laugh with the
          first    one.
Hardy just smiles.
                      OSBORNE
          This is the straight hitting on me
          you were talking about, isn't it?
                      HARDY
          The very same.
                      OSBORNE
          You do understand that there's
          absolutely no way I could ever be
          attracted to you, right?

                                                        25.
                      HARDY
          I plan to grow on you.
                      OSBORNE
          You're off to a late start.
                        HARDY
          So noted.
They pass an OVERTURNED CLIMBING TOWER.
                      HARDY
          You guys really got the shit kicked
          out of you here.
                      OSBORNE
          Imagine what it must have been like
          for them out there. What do you
          think of Dunbar?
                      HARDY
          He's telling the truth, up to a point.
                        OSBORNE
          What point?
Hardy doesn't respond, instead looking out as they pass the
SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS.
                      OSBORNE
          Something wrong?
                      HARDY
          Being back here. Gives me the
          willies.
                      OSBORNE
          Not the happiest of memories?
FLASHCUT TO - FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. A bunch of young Cadets,
Hardy and Styles among them, doing forced push-ups by the
barracks in the rain as West randomly berates and KICKS THEM.
BACK TO HARDY - As he looks away and shakes it off.
                        HARDY
          No.
INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- RECOVERY UNIT -- DAY
A NURSE leads Hardy and Osborne down a spotless white hall.
                      NURSE
          Normally we wouldn't let anyone see
          him this soon, but Colonel Styles
          said it was urgent-

                                                         26.
                      HARDY
          It is.
                      OSBORNE
          Remember, he's the son of a Senator,
          so go easy. Kid gloves.
                      HARDY
          Got it.
INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- KENDALL'S ROOM -- DAY
Kendall lies in a bed, a network of tubes in his arm.   He is
awake but pale, still weak. He studies his visitors.
                      KENDALL
          You... I've seen you around the Base.
          But you...
              (POINTING TO HARDY)
          You're not Army, are you?
                      HARDY
          Coast Guard, special detective detail.
          We feel this incident may have put
          the beaches of Florida at risk.
Kendall's laugh turns into a cough.   Placing Hardy.
                      KENDALL
          That's it. You're that policeman
          with friends in low places. Tell
          me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these
          days? Those racketeering indictments
          must have really been a downer-
                      HARDY
          Levi, you got about four hours before
          armed men show up here, put you on a
          plane to Washington, and lock you in
          a very small dark room.  I suggest
          you talk to us.
Kendall smiles again, not losing any of his cool.
                      KENDALL
          I've done nothing wrong.
              (gestures to his wound)
          I'm the victim here.
                      HARDY
          But not the only victim, right?
                      KENDALL
          My, my, my, how did things turn so
          hostile so quickly? If I didn't
          know better, I'd say you two were
          out to get me.

                                                          27.
                      OSBORNE
          We just want-
                      KENDALL
          What, "The Truth"? Please. There
          are degrees of truth, officer, always
          degrees. Things are not what they
          seem.
Hardy stares at him for a moment and then gets up to leave.
                      HARDY
          It's too early in the day for me to
          give a shit about some pissant cadet's
          bad version of "intrigue". You want
          to talk to us, send word over to the
          brig. Let's go.
Nonplussed, Osborne follows.    Hardy turns back at the door.
                      HARDY
          You're working too hard, Levi. I
          can tell cause you're sweating. And
          you're sweating cause you have no
          idea what Dunbar's already told us.
INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- CORRIDORS -- DAY
Hardy and Osborne walk to the NURSE'S STATION.
                      OSBORNE
          That was kid gloves?
                      HARDY
          Have no fear, Osborne, we have not
          yet begun to fight.
He pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it.
                      OSBORNE
          But we have to question him-
              (noticing)
          Thought you didn't have cigarettes-
                       HARDY
          I lied.   Wait for it...
Osborne just stares at him, not knowing what to say next.
The PHONE at the Nurse's Station rings and a NURSE answers.
Listens for a moment, hangs up, and turns to them.
                      NURSE
          Cadet Kendall-
                      HARDY
          We're on our way.

                                                        28.
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY
Hardy and Osborne sit across from Kendall's bed.
                      HARDY
          Sergeant West is dead isn't he?
Kendall nods.
                      HARDY
          And the other three Cadets?
Kendall hesitates, then nods again.
                      HARDY
          Feel free to elaborate .
Kendall takes a breath and begins, all trace of bravado gone.
                      KENDALL
          My father is a powerful man. Over
          the years he's used that power to
          protect me, in one form or another,
          from certain... unpleasantries.
              (deep breath)
          I am a homosexual.
                      HARDY
          Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
                      KENDALL
          He is not, shall we say, wild about
          the idea. He has asked me on numerous
          occasions to be more discreet about
          my proclivities, and I have done my
          best to oblige him. However, in the
          last four weeks, I began a
          relationship with another cadet.
          What do you think of that?
                      HARDY
          I think you just blew "Don't Ask,
          Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
                      KENDALL
          The Sergeant discovered this
          relationship and wanted me expelled.
          My father interceded, so instead,
          West Sectioned me and made sure every
          other cadet knew that I was gay.
                      OSBORNE
          He couldn't kick you out so he wanted
          you to quit on your own.
                      KENDALL
          He wanted more than that.

                                                        29.
                      HARDY
          More intrigue, Levi?

Kendall stares at them, dead serious.

                      KENDALL
          Yes.

INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- LAST NIGHT

The six Cadets asleep, all except Kendall, who stares up at
the patchwork ceiling.

                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          It was the regular Tuesday night
          drill. He'd let us sleep for an
          hour and then wake us up, drag us
          out to the bayou, and work us all
          night, separate from the others.
          The door SLAMS OPEN, revealing West.

                      WEST
          Get up, get up, get up! We're going
          on a little night hike, boys - muster
          in five on the south tarmac!

He leaves as the Sectioners rise, groaning.

                      PIKE
          Hurricane's due after midnight and
          we're still going out?

                      MUELLER
          Toughens us up, Pike.    You don't
          like it, quit.

Pike pulls on his pants and shoots him the finger.

                      KENDALL
          Maybe we shouldn't go.

                      MUELLER
          The faggot speaks.

                      KENDALL
          You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?

                      MUELLER
              (mocking gay lisp)
          You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?

Mueller and Childs laugh, but Nunez looks concerned.

                      NUNEZ
          You really heard this?

                                                          30.
                      PIKE
          You know Popham, works in the kitchen?
          He told me it was on the radio.
He stops, listening.    They all hear the WIND, HOWLING outside.
                      KENDALL
          We should tell him we're not going.
                      MUELLER
          Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir,
          we don't feel like going out - we
          don't want to get rained on." He'll
          kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
He pulls on his rain poncho and is out the door, Nunez right
behind him. The others, getting ready, all except Kendall.
Dunbar comes over and puts a hand on his shoulder.
                        DUNBAR
          He's right.    We don't have a choice.
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- TARMAC -- LAST NIGHT
The six cadets, mustered in front of West and a TRANSPORT
CHOPPER. West hands out M-16's, sidearms, and grenades while
yelling above the wind.
                      WEST
          A rifle, a pistol, and three
          phosphorous grenades to a man! This
          is live fire, so keep those safetied
          until we touch down; I don't want
          anyone shooting their dick off!
Some chuckling.
                      WEST
          Some of you may have heard there's a
          hurricane coming! American soldiers
          do not wait for good weather - they
          do not wait for a bright sunshiney
          day to do their duty! An American
          Soldier learns to operate in the
          worst conditions and turn said
          conditions into an advantage against
          their enemy! Anyone who thinks these
          conditions are too harsh, feel free
          to lay down and die, you get me?
                      THE CADETS
          Sir, yes, sir!
                      WEST
          LZ is two clicks North of a cabin,
          you are to split into teams of two
                      (MORE)

                                                          31.
                      WEST (CONT'D)
          and work your way through your
          designated area blasting as many
          targets as you can find! Each area
          has twenty targets, first team to
          take all twenty and find the cabin
          wins! Teams are as follows - Dunbar
          and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall
          and Childs!
Mueller groans.
                      WEST
          I will be in the areas monitoring
          your progress and if I see anyone
          drag ass I will personally slit you
          stem to sternum and leave you for
          dead! Fall out!
The Cadets board the Transport Chopper. Kendall gets on
last, passing West who leans in and whispers to him:
                      WEST
          You're gonna die tonight, faggot.
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
Osborne looks up.
                      OSBORNE
          He said what?
                      KENDALL
          "You're gonna die tonight, faggot" .
          Clear as day.
                      OSBORNE
          No one else heard it?
                      KENDALL
          He whispered it in my ear.
Hardy scratches his temple.
                      HARDY
          Levi, I don't know   if you're familiar
          with investigative   work, but we have
          this little thing   called "motive"
          and you just gave   yourself one.
                      KENDALL
          You said you wanted to know what
          happened- I'm telling you the truth.
                      HARDY
          What happened to "degrees"?

                                                           32.
                      KENDALL
          Didn't kill him-
                      HARDY
          Then who did?
INT. ARMY TRANSPORT HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- LAST NIGHT
On Kendall, sitting among the Sectioners in silence.
terrified he looks like he's about to throw up.
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          I wanted to tell someone what he'd
          said, but I couldn't. Mueller would
          just laugh. Nunez and Childs wouldn't
          care. Pike and Dunbar were okay,
          but... When West outed me, he isolated
          me. An outcast among outcasts. And
          I'd just been told tonight was the
          night I'd die.
The Chopper touches down on the edge of the BAYOU. The door
rumbles open as West points out different team directions in
the blackness.
                      WEST
          First team, second team, third team,
          go, go, go!
The click of rifles being unsafetied as the cadets pour out
of the helicopter.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT
We track with Kendall and Childs as they head away from the
Landing Zoe, rifles up, heads down, side by side. Moving
the brush quickly and quietly, eyes scanning for targets.
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          I knew Childs a little, we worked at
          the PX together.
The wind is picking up and it's started to RAIN.   Their
ponchos flap loudly against the elements.
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          I started getting it in my head that
          maybe West had paid him, maybe he
          was the one who was supposed to give
          me a training accident-
The ROAR of GUNFIRE!  Kendall turns  towards it,  SCREAMING
for a moment... Until he sees Childs  lower his  smoking rifle,
a SHREDDED TARGET on a tree in front  of them.   He looks down,
noticing has his own weapon TRAINED  ON CHILDS.  ..
Childs steps forward, knocking Kendall's rifle away.

                                                           33.
                      CHILDS
          Don't you ever point a gun at me!

                      KENDALL
          I'm- I'm sorry. . .

Kendall, terrified. Shaking. A beat. Childs picks up the
rifle from the ground and hands it back to him.

                      CHILDS
          Come on, let's move.

VARIOUS SHOTS -- Kendall and Childs, moving through the bayou,
Childs taking out targets. It's raining harder now.

                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          All I could think of was West, out
          there somewhere in the dark. Maybe
          watching the others, maybe watching
          me. And waiting to make his move.

Childs speaks, and Kendall almost jumps out of his skin.

                      CHILDS
          Christ, am I alone in this world?
          Shoot something-

A SOUND from the left. Kendall panics, pivots, and FIRES...
Into DARKNESS. No target, no West, no nothing. Kendall,
really freaked out now.

                      CHILDS
          A target, Kendall, cap a fucking
          target. What's wrong with you?

                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          I thought I was gonna have an attack.
          Go into a fit and bite off my own
          tongue in the middle of the bayou.
          Childs could tell I wasn't right.

                      CHILDS
          Just safety your shit and get behind
          me, okay? I'll take care of this.

Kendall nods and lets Childs walk ahead. Staring at Childs'
back as they move on. On Kendall's face, thinking...

                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          Maybe it was a trick. Maybe this
          was when they'd get me, when I felt
          safest.

CLOSE. ON KENDALL'S FINGER - Clicking off the safety again.
Moving towards the trigger...

                                                             34.
                         KENDALL (V.O.)
            But if I struck first and took out
            Childs, then maybe I could make it
            out alive...
Kendall raises the rifle.    Sights Childs' back.      A moment
of utter silence and then...
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                        KENDALL
            Maybe I shouldn't tell you that.
            Maybe I should tell you I wasn't
            scared at all. But I was...
                (long pause)
            Enough to almost kill him.
                        HARDY
            But you didn't.
                          KENDALL
            No.    Poetic justice, though.
                             OSBORNE
            Why?
No reply.   Hardy smiles, understanding.
                        HARDY
            Because Childs is the one who shot
            you.
Osborne looks up, surprised.           Kendall nods.
                        KENDALL
            But that came later.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT
As Kendall safeties his rifle and lowers it... The SOUND of
a tremendous EXPLOSION comes from their right! Kendall and
Childs knocked off their feet as the sky momentarily LIGHTS
UP with the blast as a MAN SCREAMS!
                             CHILDS
            Over there!
Childs points to the right, where the dim shine of PHOSPHOROUS
can be seen through the trees. He drags Kendall to his feet
and the two take off running towards it.
Kendall panting and scared, ducking branches and leaping
ditches as the two sprint towards the dying glow.
                             CHILDS
            Hello!    HEL-

                                                           35.
The sound of GUNFIRE!   Childs TACKLES Kendall...
                        CHILDS
          GET DOWN!
They hit the deck, face down in mud. It takes them a second
to realize the shots are not directed at them.
                      CHILDS
          Fuck, what the fuck is going on-
                      KENDALL
          What do we do?
                      CHILDS
          Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
He trails off. The gunfire and screaming have stopped.
Silence now, save for the wind and rain.
                      KENDALL
          Don't want to go-
                        CHILDS
          Fine.
Childs rises and heads towards where the sounds were.
Kendall, lying in the rain and mud, shivering.    Alone.   After
a moment he gets up and follows.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED,-- LAST NIGHT
The SCORCHED GROUND and TREES smolder under the rainfall.
Kendall finds Childs, standing down by the creek.
Something lies by his feet.
                        KENDALL
          What's-
He stops, seeing.
                      KENDALL
          Oh, Jesus.. .
WEST. Literally spread out on the ground, dead. Eyes open,
face half blackened, he has been ripped in two at the torso.
A horrifying sight. Kendall stumbles back from it.
                      KENDALL
          Did- Did you-
                       CHILDS
          It was the grenade you fucking idiot.
          Look at him!

                                                          36.
Kendall can't.   He sits, sobbing.   Part horror, part relief.
                      CHILDS
          This isn't our area.   Whose area is
          This-
                      MUELLER
          Can anybody hear me!
Childs pivots at the sound of Mueller coming over the ridge.
                      MUELLER
          Hey, I-
              (seeing it)
          Holy fuck. .,. holy fuck, what the
          fuck did you guys do?
                      CHILDS
          We found him like this-
Mueller raises his rifle at the weeping Kendall.
                      MUELLER
          You killed him you fucking faggot-
                      CHILDS
          We found him like this! Kendall was
          with me the whole- Listen to me!
Mueller, finally seeming to understand.    Lowering the gun.
                      MUELLER
          Jesus, Jesus fucking Christ...
Muttering to himself, walking in circles.
                      CHILDS
          Where's Pike?
No response.
                      CHILDS
          Mueller, where's Pike?
Mueller looks up.
                      MUELLER
          We got- I don't know, we got separated
                      CHILDS
          Before or after the explosion?
              (no response)
          Mueller-
                      MUELLER
          I don't know!

                                                        37.
                      KENDALL
          How can you not know-
Mueller comes at him, screaming:
                      MUELLER
          Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot,
          You just shut the FUCK UP-
                        CHILDS
          HEY!
Mueller stops, eyes crazed. Childs looks to the sky, which
is becoming worse by the second.
                      CHILDS
          We have to get out of this.    To find
          the cabin.
He helps Kendall to his feet.
                      KENDALL
          What about Pike?
                      CHILDS
          Maybe he'll be there.    Either way,
          we have to go.
Kendall nods, slowly.   The two start up the hill.
                      MUELLER
          Shouldn't we- I mean, we shouldn't
          just leave him here.
He points down to West's body.    Childs looks at it.
                      CHILDS
          You can carry him if you want.
He and Kendall continue on. Mueller lingers a moment longer
and then turns, following them up the hill.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT
Kendall, Childs, and Mueller make their way through the bush.
The WIND and RAIN have conspired into a FULL BLOWN HURRICANE.
The three men are practically stumbling now, leaning in
against it to stay on their feet. Kendall spies something
through the maelstrom. It looks like WET WOOD. He points:
                        KENDALL
          There!
THE CABIN -- Wooden, one story, and large, it resembles a
solidly built shack. It is being thrashed by the storm.

                                                          38.
The trio stumble towards the front door...
INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
Obviously abandoned. Bare of any furniture save for two
wooden chairs next to an empty fireplace.
DUNBAR and NUNEZ shout in surprise as the three men
practically collapse into the cabin. Dunbar runs to bolt
the door against the elements as Nunez helps them up.
                      NUNEZ
          What happened to you-
                      MUELLER
          What happened to you?
                      DUNBAR
          We finished the course and came here,
          Then heard an explosion-
              (to Mueller)
          Where's Pike?
                      CHILDS
          We don't know. West is dead.
Silence. Dunbar and Nunez stare at him.    Mueller jerks a
hand towards Kendall and Childs.
                      MUELLER
          They found him. Poor fucker was
          Practically blown in half-
                      KENDALL
          Poor fucker my ass...
                      MUELLER
          You better watch it, faggot, I'm not
          Sure you and Childs didn't do him-
                      CHILDS
          What about you, wandering around
          Alone? At least we have an alibi-
                      DUNBAR
          What do you mean, alone?
                      MUELLER
          Pike and I got separated-
                      KENDALL
          Yeah and he doesn't know when-
                      MUELLER
          I remember now, it was before the
          Explosion-

                                                         39.
                      KENDALL
          Oh, you remember now-
                      MUELLER
          I'm about two seconds away from seeing
          If fairies really can fly-
                      NUNEZ
          What about Pike?
Mueller stops, as the others turn towards the big man.
Silence. They realize what the question means.
                      DUNBAR
          He wouldn't kill anybody. . .
                      MUELLER
          Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict.
          You know how much he hated West-
                      DUNBAR
          I hated West, Childs hated West,
          everyone with a goddamn brain hated
          West but that doesn't mean we killed
          him!
                      NUNEZ
          What if it wasn't one of us?    What
          if it was a local-
                      KENDALL
          He was blown up by a phosphorous
          grenade, they don't exactly sell
          those at 7-11.
                      MUELLER
          Look, here are the facts - Roberto
          was with Dunbar, Queen Kendall was
          with Childs, and Pike's the only one
          not here. He did it!
The others nod, becoming convinced.
                      CHILDS
          He is the only one unaccounted for.
                      KENDALL
          Maybe he's dead too.    Maybe you killed
          Them both, Mueller-
                      DUNBAR
          Shut up.
              (to Mueller)
          Let me see your grenades.
                      MUELLER
          Why?

                                                             40.
                      DUNBAR
          We were each given three so whoever
          killed West will be missing one.
Mueller angrily digs into his sack and pulls out his grenades.
                          MUELLER
          See?   Three.     Now can we please-
He stops. Hearing a SOUND outside.        Through the wind and
rain, FOOTSTEPS on the porch.
They all turn to the door.       Waiting...
The DOOR SWINGS OPEN.. Pike.       Covered in BLOOD.
                          PIKE
          Hey, guys.
They stare at him as he calmly closes the door and walks
over to the empty FIREPLACE. Finally:
                      DUNBAR
          Whose blood is that, Jay?       West's.
                      PIKE
          Any kindling for afire?
He looks around for kindling.       A beat.
                      DUNBAR
          What do you mean, West's?
                      PIKE
          I mean I killed him.
              (pause)
          Isn't that what we all wanted?
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                      HARDY
          He admitted it.
                      KENDALL
          Right in front of us. Mueller went
          after him but we held him back.
          Pike surrendered and volunteered to
          be tied up. So we roped him to a
          chair and tried to ride out the storm.
                      OSBORNE
          Why would he just surrender?
Kendall turns to her and smiles.
                      KENDALL
          Because he had a plan.

                                                        41.
INT. CABIN -- LIVING ROOM -- LAST NIGHT
Pike, tied to a chair by the fireplace while the others look
for, food in the KITCHEN. Alone, Kendall walks past Pike:
                      PIKE
          Hey, Kendall, talk to you for a sec?
Kendall looks around - there seems no harm in it.
                      PIKE
          You hated West as much as I did.
          I'm not saying what I did was right,
          but you can't tell me you're not
          glad the motherfucker's dead.
Kendall says nothing. Pike looks around, makes sure no one
is listening and then whispers:
                      PIKE
          The thing is, we've got a real
          opportunity here. You turn me in
          Tomorrow and we're both fucked-
                      KENOALL
          What are you talking about?
                      PIKE
          A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge
          get fragged on a training exercise?
          The press'll crucify you and your
          father. His career will be over and
          it'll be your fault. But we do this
          different and you come out a hero.
On Kendall, thinking about it.    A beat.
                        KENOALL
          How?
                        PIKE
          Mueller.    He's as bad as West and we
          both know   it. Now I can't do it,
          cause I'm   tied up, but we get the
          others to   go along-
                      KENDALL
          Don't think I want to hear this-
                      PIKE
          Someone else can do the deed, it
          doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez
          too, he's got a tendency to follow
          Mueller, but the rest of us can come
          out ahead - the guys who took out
          their Sergeant's killers!
                      (MORE)

                                                        42.
                        PIKE (CONT'D)
          We'll   move the bodies out to the
          creek   and say we came over the hill
          right   as they fragged West, all we
          gotta   do is tell the story right.
Kendall stares at him.   Disgusted.
                      KENDALL
          You're sick, Pike.
He turns and walks away.   Pike watches him go.
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          Later on I.saw him talking to Dunbar.
          They had been close. I was in another
          room when it happened.
INT. CABIN -- KITCHEN LAST NIGHT
Kendall, looking through the empty cabinets for food when
A GUNSHOT -- From the living room. As Kendall bolts towards
the noise, the air is filled with the sounds of SCREAMING
and SHOOTING! He pushes through the door...
INT. CABIN -- LIVING ROOM -- LAST NIGHT
Kendall, coming through the door as we SLO-MO...
Mueller, sprawled out on the floor, dead... Pike, tied to
the chair, bullethole in his forehead... Nunez, wounded,
stumbling out the front door into the hurricane...
And a badly wounded Childs, pistol out, TURNING towards the
SOUND OF THE DOOR and FIRING...
Kendall's arm, HIT with a SLUG, and he starts to go down...
FREEZE-FRAME -- On Kendall's form, falling.
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          I don't think he meant to do it. It
          was just reflex - he'd already been
          gutshot. I must have passed out
          cause next thing I knew...
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- DAWN
The sounds of RUNNING  and HEAVY BREATHING. Kendall's eyes
flutter open. He's on   Dunbar's back, being carried through
the woods. The sound   of GUNFIRE and a TREE BRANCH SHATTERS
next to them. Someone   is chasing them. Trying to kill them.
Nunez.

                                                        43.
Dunbar bobs and weaves as another volley of bullets comes
from behind and we can now hear ROTOR BLADES APPROACHING...
EXT. CLEARING -- DAWN
As Dunbar bursts into the sunlight, carrying Kendall.
The entire thing dreamlike, what we saw at the opening, but
from KENDALL'S VIEWPOINT -- the helicopter overhead, Nunez
behind, Dunbar turning and shooting, NUNEZ GOING DOWN...
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                       KENDALL
           And that's it.
Hardy is silent.    Staring at him.
                       OSBORNE
           Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
                       KENDALL
           Because he'd shot Mueller.
                       OSBORNE
           But you didn't see it, right?
                       KENDALL
           Like I said, I was in the kitchen.
           When I came out, Mueller and Pike
           were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit
           and Dunbar was gone.
                       HARDY
           Why did he come back for you?
                       KENDALL
           I honestly don't know. Maybe to
           have someone to cover for him. And
           I wish I could, but there's no doubt
           in my mind he killed those men.
Silence.   Kendall's got nothing more to say.
                       HARDY
           Okay. I think that's it.     He rises
           and walks to the door.
                        KENDALL
           Mr. Hardy?
Hardy turns back.
                       KENDALL
           What did Dunbar tell you?

                                                        44.
Hardy smiles and pushes out the door...

EXT. STYLES' OFFICE -- DAY

Hardy and Osborne stand before the Colonel, filling him in.

                      HARDY
          Pike killed West, Dunbar killed
          Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.

                      STYLES
          Who killed Pike?

                      HARDY
          Someone must have got a shot off.
          He wasn't exactly a moving target.

Styles turns to Osborne.

                      STYLES
          What do you think?

                      OSBORNE
          It's too neat.

                      HARDY
          "Too neat." How long have you been
          an investigator?

                      OSBORNE
          I don't think that has anything to
          do with-

                      HARDY
          That means under a year. Let me
          explain what ten years of police
          work has taught me - murder is basic.
          There are no conspiracies, no grand
          mysteries, and no evil puppet masters
          behind it all, pulling the strings;
          murder is shitty people doing a shitty
          thing to other shitty people - it
          doesn't always make sense but it's
          always neat. Dunbar's our guy.

Osborne struggles to put it into words.

                      OSBORNE
          I just... He came back for Kendall.
          I don't think he's capable of murder.

                      HARDY
          Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.

Osborne turns, making her case to Styles.

                                                 45.
                      OSBORNE
          Look, all we've got is what Kendall
          says, and he didn't actually witness
          any deaths except Nunez. He found
          West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but
          just their bodies - he didn't see
          any crime committed.
                      HARDY
          Well, I'm sure if he'd known this
          was all going to happen he'd have
          Tried harder to witness it for you-
                      STYLES
          West's body isn't in the creek bed.
They stop arguing, turning to look at him.
                      STYLES
          We've already been over the terrain
          twice. Nothing.
                      HARDY
          There was a hurricane, Bill, the
          wind probably moved it.
                      STYLES
          Habeas Corpus - you have to have a
          body to have a crime.
                      HARDY
          Okay, then let's widen the search
          'to include the endzone in Giants
          Stadium and the trunk of my car-
                      STYLES
          Without the body we have no physical
          proof. We need a confession.
                      HARDY
          From Dunbar? I hate to break this
          to you, but I don't think he's gonna
          be all that psyched to put himself
          in for the death penalty.
                      STYLES
          Nevertheless-
                      HARDY
          Nevertheless what'? Kendall will
          testify and that'll be enough.
                        STYLES
          Not for me.
A beat. Almost accusingly:

                                                   46.
                      HARDY
          You mean not enough to save you.
                      STYLES
          JAG gets here in three hours.   Try
          for the confession.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- DAY
Dunbar looks up as Hardy and Osborne enter.
                      HARDY
              (cheerfully)
          Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with
          your buddy. Kendall - seems you
          killed three people!
                      DUNBAR
          That son of a bitch.
                      HARDY
          That'd be my reaction too-
                         DUNBAR
          He's lying.
                      HARDY
          Well, why didn't you say so? We'll
          Just drop all your charges, then-
                         DUNBAR
          I'm serious-
Hardy leans across the table.
                      HARDY
          Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you
          got exactly zero truck with us; right
          now we'd take the word of a crackhead
          over yours, so if you've got something
          to say, say it.
                      DUNBAR
          Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
                      OSBORNE
          He said he worked there-
                      DUNBAR
          No, did he tell you about it?   About
          the business Childs ran?
                      OSBORNE
          What business?

                                                        47.
                      DUNBAR
          Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a
          lot easier when you don't feel pain-
                      HARDY
          So Childs made some side money, so
          what? People are dead, Ray, and the
          only one we have to blame is you-
                      DUNBAR
          Didn't shoot West-
                      HARDY
          Yeah, we know, Pike did.
Dunbar stares at him.
                      DUNBAR
          You think you know everything, don't
          you? You haven't even scratched the
          surface.
Hardy leans across the table, looks Dunbar dead in the eye.
                      HARDY
          I know enough to know you got two
          choices - you can sign a confession,
          in which case you'll probably spend
          the rest of your life in a military
          prison, or you can tell us to fuck
          off, in which case you'll probably
          get the gas chamber.
              (smiling)
          Am I scratching your surface yet?
Dunbar stares at him for a moment and then LAUNCHES HIMSELF
at Hardy, SCREAMING. Tackles him to the floor, CHOKING HIM...
Osborne, pulling her sidearm, and PISTOL WHIPPING Dunbar in
the head! Dunbar goes sprawling off Hardy as M.P.'s rush
into the room, RESTRAINING him.
Hardy gets up, gasping, and stumbles to the door.
                         OSBORNE
          Hardy!
But he's already gone.
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- DAY
Hardy, walking angrily towards the front entrance, wheezing
and massaging his neck. Osborne, runninq to catch up.
                      HARDY
          Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?

                                                          48.
                      OSBORNE
          I don't know.

Styles appears at the end of the hall.

                      STYLES
          Tom, where are you going-

                      HARDY
          Home, I'm done.

                      STYLES
          What about the confession?

Hardy stares at him. ..

                      HARDY
          You want a confession? Why don't
          you confess, Bill: people are dead
          and you don't give a shit about it!
          Only reason you called me is to
          protect your fucking job, you know
          this is your fault-

                      STYLES
          What the hell are you talking about-

                      HARDY
          I'm talking about West! We had him,
          Bill, we were there. You're the
          fucking Base Commander, you knew
          what he did to Cadets and you let
          him go on the way he always he has-
          Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a
          legend-

                      HARDY
          You knew what he was capable of and
          you just stood by. It was just a
          matter of time till somebody fragged
          his ass, and you know what? He
          deserved it. There's your confession.

He pushes past a shocked Styles and walks out the door.

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- DAY

Hardy storms across the grass.   Osborne, still following.

                      OSBORNE
          Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just
          leave-

                      HARDY
          Watch me.

                                                   49.
                       OSBORNE
           You said you owed Styles and now
           you're gonna turn your back on him?
Hardy whirls on her.
                       HARDY
           West was a monster! Fifteen years
           ago, I was here, I was Section Eight,
           I was Pike. Fuck being the knife
           dummy- that thing he did, stripping
           Pike down, making him stand outside
           all night? He did that every year,
           he did that to me. Fifteen years
           ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm
           supposed to care that somebody offed
           him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
                       OSBORNE
           You did more than try. You cracked
           Dunbar in less than three minutes,
           as an investigator you're phenomenal-
                       HARDY
           Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
A beat.   Osborne shakes her head.
                       OSBORNE
           I was starting to believe you, you
           know? That you weren't who everyone
           Said. I guess I was wrong-
                       HARDY
           Oh, spare me the reverse psychology
           bullshit! This isn't my "great second
           chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks
           I'm a piece of shit cop who took
           money and nothing is going to change
           that. Nobody will ever know what
           happens here-
                       OSBORNE
           But you will.
Hardy stares at her.
                       HARDY
           Why do you care?
                       OSBORNE
           Because it's my job. Because people
           are dead. Because of the whole honor
           and duty thing, make a difference in
           the world, crap like that.
               (pause)
           We can do this, Hardy.

                                                      50.
Hardy looks at the ground.
                      OSBORNE
          Two and a half hours. That's all
          I'm asking. Two and a half hours to
          maybe get the truth. Silence.
Hardy looks back up at her.     Speaking softly:
                      HARDY
          I didn't shoot West...
                       OSBORNE
          What?
                      HARDY
          Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot
          West. West wasn't shot, Kendall
          said he was blown apart by a
          phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never
          saw the body.
They stare at each other for a moment...
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- DAY
Hardy and Osborne enter to find Dunbar in SHACKLES.
                       DUNBAR
          Apologize-
                      HARDY
          You saw West's body.
                       DUNBAR
          Of course-
                       OSBORNE
          Where?
                      DUNBAR
          The creek bed-
                      HARDY
          And he'd been shot.
                       DUNBAR
          Yeah-
                      OSBORNE
          What about the phosphorous grenade?
                      DUNBAR
          One went off, yeah, but it didn't
          Touch him- I thought you knew this-

                                                         51.
                      HARDY
          Tell it to me.
INT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- LAST NIGHT
Dunbar and Nunez RUNNING towards the glow of phosphorous and
sound of GUNFIRE. They come over the hill to see Childs and
Kendall, standing over WEST'S BODY. Dunbar stops, shocked.
                      DUNBAR
          Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the
          fuck did you guys do?
                      CHILDS
          We found him like this...
Dunbar edges closer, looking at West.   With BULLET HOLES.
His chest, riddled.
                      KENDALL
          Somebody emptied a full clip into
          him-
                      HARDY (V.O.}
          Stop.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                      HARDY
          Kendall told us Mueller was the one
          who found them with West's body.
                      DUNBAR
          He's lying, then. We didn't see
          Mueller till we got to the cabin.
INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
Dunbar, Kendall, Childs, and Nunez push through the door to
find Mueller in his undershirt, a FIRE burning in the hearth.
                      MUELLER
          Jesus, what happened?
                      DUNBAR
              (breathing hard)
          West...he's dead.
                      OSBORNE (V.O.}
          Back up.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                      OSBORNE
          Mueller was alone in the cabin?

                                                        52.
                       DUNBAR
          Yeah.

INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

                      MUE:LLER
          Pike and I got separated... then I
          heard gunfire. Close.

                       DUNBAR
          So did we.   Why didn't you come?

Mueller looks down, scared.

                      MUELLER
          I was afraid... Mueller voice FADES
          OUT as he continues to talk.

                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          I didn't buy it. But Mueller had
          all three of his grenades.

Mueller shows his three grenades to the others.

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

                      OSBORNE
          At least you and Kendall agree on
          that.

                      HARDY
          What happened next?     Dunbar shudders.

                      DUNBAR
          Pike came back.

INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

Pike, staggering in through the door. The others get up
from where they are sitting - it's been awhile since they
arrived. Pike shouts at Mueller:

                      PIKE
          What the fuck happened to you-

                      MUELLER
          What the fuck happened to you? One
          minute you're next to me and the
          next you're gone and the sky lights
          up like fucking Christmas-

                      DUNBAR
          Where have you been, Jay?

                                                            53.
                       PIKE
           Wandering through a hurricane trying
           to find this place. It's gettin'
           bad out there-
               (looking around)
           Where's West?
                       CHILDS
           Yeah, right. . .
                        DUNBAR
           Shut up.
               (to Pike)
           West's dead.
A beat.
                       PIKE
           What?
Silence.   All of them staring at Pike.
                       DUNBAR
           Where have you been, Jay?
Pike, suddenly understanding.      Fear creeping into his face.
                       PIKE
           Oh, no. . . no, fuck that-
He moves to the door, but. . .
                       NUNEZ
           Hey!
Nunez, with his PISTOL out.      Trained on Pike.
                       PIKE
           Roberto, what the fuck?
                       DUNBAR
           We just want to check your pack-
                       PIKE
           Why?
                       MUELLER
           Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade
           first-
                       PIKE
           Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone
           turns up dead, you just look for the
           Darkest face in the crowd-
                       DUNBAR
           You know it's not like that-

                                                         54.
                          PIKE
            Do I?
The CLICK as Nunez pulls back the pistol's hammer.
                        NUNEZ
            Let him check your pack.
Pike stares at them and then throws his pack down, angrily.
Dunbar goes to it, opens it, and reaches in. Pulls his hand
out. Only TWO GRENADES. Looks at Pike. Sadly.
                          DUNBAR
            Tie him up.
INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
Later. The fury of the storm has increased. Kendall, Childs,
Nunez, and Mueller, in the KITCHEN looking for food.
IN THE LIVING ROOM
Pike, tied to the chair. Dunbar sitting in a corner,
listening to the hurricane rage outside. Pike watches him.
                        PIKE
            Just like the first day, huh?    You
            standing guard on me.
A CREAKING as the cabin SHIFTS on it's foundation.   Dunbar
looks up at the roof, scared. It holds.
                        PIKE
            This place ain't gonna hold much
            longer.
Dunbar doesn't reply. Still staring nervously at the roof.
Pike looks to make sure the others out of earshot, then:
                        PIKE
            You and me are friends, right?
No reply.
                          PIKE
            Right?
                          DUNBAR
            Yeah...
Pike takes a deep breath.
                        PIKE
            You gotta untie me.
                (off Dunbar's look)
            I didn't do this thing, Ray.

                                                    55.
                      DUNBAR
          You hated West more than any of us.
                      PIKE
          Maybe, but that don't make me a killer-
                      DUNBAR
          You're the only one missing a grenade.
                      PIKE
          Which anyone coulda taken out of my
          gear on the chopper. Were you
          watching your pack on the ride in?
Dunbar starts to get up.
                      PIKE
          Ray, this is my life    here. I ain't
          gonna pretend I'm not    happy West is
          gone, but you know I    couldn't have
          done this. It's not     in me.
                      DUNBAR
          If not you, then who?
                         PIKE
          Mueller.
                         DUNBAR
          Oh, come on-
                      PIKE
          We're sweeping our area and suddenly
          he's gone. Couple minutes later,
          phosphorous grenade pops off about a
          third of a click away-
                      DUNBAR
          That's exactly what he says about
          you.
                       PIKE
          Who you gonna trust, Ray?    Him or
          your friend?
Dunbar stares at him.
                      DUNBAR
          You hated West, Mueller loved him-
                      PIKE
          Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX
          Scam, Mueller was in on it-
                         DUNBAR
          Bullshit.

                                                          56.
                      PIKE
          Look in my pack.
                       DUNBAR
          Why?
                       PIKE
          Just look.   Little pocket.
Dunbar walks over to Pike's pack and unzips it.    Checks the
little pocket. Pulls out a VIAL and a SYRINGE.
                      PIKE
          Combat grade morphine.    Mueller sold
          it to me. .
                      DUNBAR
          You're lying-
                      PIKE
          Pull up my sleeve.    Right arm.
Dunbar does to reveal a cluster of TRACK MARKS.
                      PIKE
          That look like a lie to you? I been
          using solid for the last eight weeks.
Dunbar sits down.   Not knowing what to say.
                      PIKE
          After that first night on the parade
          Grounds with you, I was bad -
          Exposure, malnutrition, the works.
          I needed something to keep me from
          crashing. Mueller found me.
INT. CADET SHOWERS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO
Empty except for Pike. He sits, nude, curled up on the tile,
as the nozzles blast STEAMING WATER down onto his shivering
form. FOOTSTEPS approaching. Mueller. He leans down next
to Pike, speaking to him. Kindly.
                      PIKE (V.O.)
          He said he knew guy who had an in at
          the PX, could hook me up. This is
          before I knew what a dick he was.
As Mueller produces a SYRINGE from his pocket...
INT. BASE PX -- BACKROOM -- SIX WEEKS AGO
A covert meeting among stacks of supplies. Childs stands
with Mueller, talking to a gaunt Pike. Behind Pike are a
group of other SICKLY LOOKING CADETS, all jonesing.

                                                        57.
                       PIKE
           Later on Childs got assigned there,
           started running the shit out to every
           cadet who needed it. But I was our
           class's first customer.. .
Pike hands the smiling Mueller a WAD OF CASH...
INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
Dunbar staring open mouthed at Pike.    Shocked.
                       DUNBAR
           Why... why didn't you tell me?
                        PIKE
           Becoming a morphine addict during
           Basic ain't exactly something you
           want to broadcast. Only Mueller and
           Childs know.
A beat.   Dunbar gets to his feet.
                       DUNBAR
           That still doesn't mean you didn't
           kill him.
                       PIKE
           You saw West, right?   How was he
           killed?
                       DUNBAR
           Full clip to the body-
                       PIKE
           From up close or far away?
                       DUNBAR
           His chest was hamburger-
                       PIKE
           That's close range. You go full
           auto on a guy from close range, you're
           gonna be swimming in blood. Look at
           my uniform. Nothing.
Dunbar looks.   Not a speck of blood on it.
                       PIKE
           And where's Mueller's? When I came
           in, he was only wearing a t-shirt.
Dunbar looks over to fireplace, where ashes are smoldering...
FLASHCUT TO - When Dunbar first entered the Cabin: Mueller,
standing there in a T-SHIRT, a FIRE burning in the hearth.

                                                           58.
                      PIKE
          Way I figure it, West must have found
          out about their little business and
          was gonna bust them, so they decided
          to get rid of him first...
                         DUNBAR
              (softly)
          They?
                      PIKE
          Mueller and Childs. One of them
          must've taken the grenade from my
          pack on the chopper...
INT. TRANSPORT HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
The Sectioners sit, stonefaced, staring out the window.
CLOSE ON - Mueller's hand as it snakes into Pike's pack and
extracts a phosphorous grenade.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
Mueller and Pike, twenty feet apart, scouring the brush for
targets. Mueller looks to Pike and then slips away...
                      PIKE (V.O.)
          Then Mueller ditches me during the
          exercise and heads for the creek.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED,-- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
Mueller stands on the hill and pulls the grenades pin, tossing
it down the embankment. ..
                      PIKE (V.O.)
          He blows the grenade to frame me and
          gets West to come running... .
The grenade BLOWS, setting the entire area AGLOW...
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
Kendall and Childs, turning towards the sound...
Note: Each shot of Kendall and Childs in this sequence should
correspond exactly to Kendall's Flashback.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- NIGHT
West emerges from the bush at a sprint.
                      WEST
          What the fuck is going on?!
Mueller runs down the embankment toward him.

                                                          59.
                      MUELLER
          Don't know, sir, I-
Six feet away from West, Mueller suddenly raises his rifle
and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
Kendall and Childs, running in the direction of the grenade...
                       PIKE
          Childs' job is easy, he only has to
          delay Kendall long enough for Mueller
          to get away.
Suddenly MACHINE GUNFIRE shatters the night!
                      CHILDS
          GET DOWN!
He tackles Kendall into the mud.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
Mueller, smoking rifle in hand, uniform covered in blood
stands over WEST'S DEAD BODY. He turns and runs off INTO
THE BRUSH. A moment later, Childs and Kendall come into
view at the top of the embankment...
                      PIKE (V.O.)
          Now all Mueller has to do is get rid
          of the evidence...
INT. CABIN -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT
Mueller, still covered in blood, enters the dark cabin. He
strips of his shirt and throws it in the fireplace. Striking
a match, igniting the bloody rag... .
                      PIKE (V.O.)
          And wait for everyone else to arrive.
Mueller, watching the evidence burn...
INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
Pike sighs, finished with his story.
                      DUNBAR
          I... I don't know...
                      PIKE
          What don't you know?
                      DUNBAR
          This is a lot of information to be
          Getting... I have to think-

                                                          60.
The hurricane outside GROWING LOUDER as the Cabin ROCKS again.
The sound of WOOD SNAPPING. Pike stares up at the roof.
                      PIKE
          There's no time to think, Ray, we
          gotta get out of here! You untie
          me, we grab the guns, get Kendall
          and Nunez, and make a run for it-
                      DUNBAR
          No... no, we can just wait till we
          get back and then tell the M.P.'s-
                      PIKE
          We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a
          black face, a criminal record, and
          over a hundred other cadets who'll
          testify how much I hated West - my
          court martial will take six minutes.
          It's either me or them, Ray, and you
          gotta decide right now.
The cabin SHIFTS again.     Dunbar stares at him.
                       PIKE
          Untie me.
Dunbar doesn't move.
                      PIKE
          Untie me, Ray.
A long beat.   The two men stare at each other.
And then Dunbar pulls his knife from his boot and leans down
to cut Pike's bonds.
                      PIKE
          Thank God. . .
                      MUELLER (O.S.)
          What the fuck are you doing?
Dunbar freezes.   Caught.
He looks to the open kitchen door where Mueller stands.
                      MUELLER
          Guys, get out here!
The others enter the room. Dunbar, kneeling there, knife
inches away from severing Pike's ropes.
                      PIKE
          This place is going, Mueller.     We
          gotta move-

                                                        61.
                      MUELLER
          Shut the fuck up.
              (to the others)
          He was gonna cut him loose.
The others stare at Dunbar.
                        NUNEZ
          Why?
                      PIKE
          Cause I didn't do it.
Childs motions to Dunbar.
                      CHILDS
          Get away from there.
He's serious.    Dunbar moves away from Pike.
                      MUELLER
          We all know what you did, Pike. I
          don't know what kind of nigger voodoo
          You been working in here, but-
                      PIKE
          Where's your shirt, Mueller?
                      MUELLER
          Used it to start the fire-
                      PIKE
          Still got mine on, not a speck of
          blood on it. Not a bad trick for a
          murderer- you said you burned yours?
The others begin to look at Mueller with new eyes.
                      MUELLER
          Was freezing from the hurricane-
                      KENDALL
          So you took off your shirt?
                      MUELLER
          To start a fire, goddammit!
              (pointing to Pike)
          What about him, huh? Maybe he offed
          the Sarge and changed shirts, brought
          an extra one in his pack. Y'ever
          think of that? Go ahead, cut him
          loose! First chance he gets, he'll
          waste the rest of us, that's how
          they work-
The hurricane, reaching FEVER PITCH outside as WATER begins
leaking in through the roof.

                                                   62.
                      PIKE
          Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of
          Here-
                      MUELLER
          We're not going anywhere.
PIKE TURNS TO MUELLER:
                      PIKE
          Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place
          you under military arrest for the
          Murder of Sergeant Nathan West-
                      MUELLER
          The fuck are you talking about-
                      PIKE
          You are to be stripped of all weapons
          And placed under guard-
                         MUELLER
          Bullshit-
                      PIKE
          Until we return to base, and
          ballistics can match your weapon to
          the slugs in Sergeant West's body-
                         MUELLER
          Shut up!
Mueller pulls his SIDEARM and POINTS IT AT PIKE.
                      KENDALL
          Mueller, what the fuck-
                      DUNBAR
          Don't do this-
Pike, EYES LOCKED with Mueller.    Continuing:
                      PIKE
          A test will no doubt link you to the
          Killing-
                         DUNBAR
          Put it down!
                      MUELLER
          Tell him to shut up-
                      PIKE
          -failure to comply with this arrest
          is a court martialable offense in
          and of itself-

                                                             63.
                      KENDALL
          Pike, please-
                      PIKE
          Although that won't matter much when
          Coupled with the murder charge-
                      MUELLER
          SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU FUCKING NIGGER-
Pike leans forward.
                      PIKE
          You stupid white trash motherfucker,
          I saw you do it-
And Mueller FIRES.
Pike's head SNAPS BACK.
The gunshot, DEAFENING.    Then, for an eternity, SILENCE.
Nobody moves.   Nobody breathes.   As if time has stopped.
                      KENDALL
          Oh.. . my God...
Mueller lowers his arm, the pistol clattering to the floor.
His face, as shocked as the others.
                      MUELLER
          He wouldn't... stop talking...
He takes a step forward towards Pike.    A hole in the middle
of the black man's forehead.
                       DUNBAR
              (softly)
          So you killed him?
                        MUELLER
          I. . .
Almost mechanically, Dunbar begins to reach for his own gun...
The unmistakable sound of a two rifles' magazines being RACKED
simultaneously. Dunbar turns to see Childs and Nunez, their
M-16's in hand. Levelled at him.
                      CHILDS
          Get that hand away.
Dunbar does.    Looks to Nunez.
                        DUNBAR
          You too?

                                                           64.
                      CHILDS
          We can still come out of this okay.
          Pike got free, he got a gun, he came
          after us. That's the story.
Mueller collapses on the ground.   Head in hands.
                      MUELLER
          West was one thing, but this-
                      CHILDS
          Shut up, Mueller.
                      KENDALL
          You framed-him...
                      CHILDS
          None of that matters now. We got
          two dead bodies and a story that
          explains them. You're either with
          us, or against us - which is it?
Dunbar and Kendall, looking at each other. It's clear what
the wrong answer will mean. A long beat, until
                      KENDALL
          Okay-
He is cut off as the WIND outside ROARS - the HURRICANE
mounting to it's FULL FORCE - and the WINDOWS BLOW INWARDS,
showering Childs, Mueller, and Nunez with glass!
Dunbar's hand flies to his pistol, PULLING IT...
Mueller, SCREAMING, trying to claw the glass from his EYES...
Childs, seeing Dunbar move, PULLS THE TRIGGER. .. .
And the cabin is filled with the THUNDER OF GUNFIRE as Kendall
goes down, clutching his ARM...
DUNBAR FIRES, hitting Childs directly in the chest...
Childs, still shooting, falls back, his random spray of
bullets PUNCHING INTO MUELLER who jerks like a marionette...
Nunez, drawing a bead on Dunbar, about to shoot, when...
A great CRESCENDO of WOOD SPLINTERING and SUPPORTS BUCKLING
overtakes them and the CABIN'S ROOF COMES DOWN ON THEIR HEADS.
EXT. DEMOLISHED CABIN -- FIRST LIGHT
Hours later. The rain has lessened and the Hurricane has
begun to lift as Dunbar pulls himself from the debris.
Hearing a FAINT CRY from his left.

                                                        65.
Kendall.   Half conscious, his arm, bloody.
Dunbar slings the man across his shoulders as the rising sun
begins to peak through the clouds overhead.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- SUNRISE
Dunbar, carrying Kendall towards the clearing when GUNFIRE
comes from behind. He turns to look...
Nunez. The only other survivor from the Cabin. A hundred
yards back, rifle in hand, coming after them with a vengeance.
Dunbar, sprinting towards the clearing, bullets at his heels
and as he bursts from the tree line he looks up to see a
HELICOPTER OVERHEAD
                       DUNBAR (V.O.)
           And then I killed the last of them.
FLASHCUT TO - Nunez, chest blown open, going down...
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
And we're back to the interrogation. Dunbar, stubbing out a
cigarette and looking up at Hardy and Osborne.
                       DUNBAR
           Can I have some coffee?
Osborne blinks, like a trance has been broken.
                       OSBORNE
           Yeah... yeah, sure.
She goes over to the machine and pours a cup.
                       HARDY
           You shot Childs and Nunez.
                       DUNBAR
           They would have killed us both. You
           want me to write a confession, I'll
           write a confession.
                       HARDY
           You saved Kendall's life-
                       DUNBAR
           But not Pike's.
Osborne hands him the coffee.
                       OSBORNE
           Why didn't you tell us all this in
           the first place?

                                                         66.
                      DUNBAR
          Would you have believed me?
Their faces say "no".   Osborne spreads a MAP out on the table.
                      OSBORNE
          Where's the cabin?
                      DUNBAR
          Don't know on a map. West told us
          it was there, we just found it.
          Maybe the hurricane took it away.
                      HARDY
          Raymond, for you to have any chance
          of coming out of this, we need to
          locate the other bodies and examine
          them to corroborate your testimony.
          Otherwise this is just another story-
                      DUNBAR
          Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for
          college money. I didn't ask for any
          of this - I tried to do the right
          thing out there and people got killed.
          You say finding those bodies'll help
          me, then go find them. I don't want
          to die.
EXT. FOR MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- DAY
Hardy and Osborne, walking and talking.
                      OSBORNE
          Talk it through: Childs, Mueller,
          and Nunez know they're going out on
          the regular Tuesday Night drill,
          hurricane or ho hurricane, so they
          plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
                      HARDY
          And they're smart about it. They
          know when you commit a crime you
          know is going to be investigated,
          you need a fall guy and for that to
          work, you have to have a witness.
                        OSBORNE
          Dunbar.
                      HARDY
          Exactly, someone who's not involved,
          who's word can't be questioned. You
          only let them see what you want them
          to see, you make them believe, so
          when the time comes, they've totally
          bought into your version of events.

                                                        67.
                      OSBORNE
          They believe the innocent are guilty
          and the guilty are innocent.
                      HARDY
          And if they're asked, that's what
          they'll tell the, world.
                       OSBORNE
          So it's a good plan but it goes wrong;
          Mueller flips out and shoots their
          fall guy, which means they have to
          bring Dunbar and Kendall into the
          Cover story-
                      HARDY
          Kendall maybe would have agreed, but
          The hurricane buttfucks the cabin-
                      OSBORNE
          Buttfucks the cabin?
                      HARDY
          And all hell breaks loose. A lot of
          Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys
          and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
                      OSBORNE
          So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall
          out from under a house, does the
          Senator's son try and get us to put
          his savior in the gas chamber?
                      HARDY
          That bugs you too?
                        OSBORNE
          Little bit.
                      HARDY
          Let's go talk to Bill...
INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- DAY
Hardy and Osborne stand in front of an agitated Styles. He
tries to take a hit off his asthma inhaler and gets nothing.
Frustrated, he tosses it away.
                      STYLES
          Fucking asthma... This whole thing's
          driving it nuts.
A beat.
                      HARDY
          What I said before-

                                                             68.
                      STYLES
          Was dead right. You think Dunbar's
          on the level?
                        HARDY
          Yeah.
                      STYLES
          Does Osborne agree?
                      OSBORNE
          Yes, sir, I do.
Hardy lays a piece of paper on Styles' desk.
                      HARDY
          Dunbar's confession. It should be
          enough to get you out of trouble.
Styles looks at it and then slowly up to Hardy.
                      STYLES
          You want Kendall, don't you?
                      OSBORNE
          He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You
          don't do that if you're not involved.
Hardy nods, agreeing.   Styles stares at them.
                      STYLES
          You both know if you do this, if you
          go after a Senator's son and you're
          wrong... it's not just me in the hot
          seat anymore.
                        OSBORNE
          We know.
                      STYLES
              (to Hardy)
          I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
                        HARDY
          We know.
Styles nods and looks to his desk.      Almost to himself:
                      STYLES
          You don't get to be a Colonel without
          compromising. Without getting out
          of the way of the bigger dogs. You
          politic, play it safe, think of the
          career first. And when things get
          dirty, you just look the other way...
He looks back up at Hardy.      His eyes, steeled.

                                                          69.
                      STYLES
          Four of my men are dead. You think
          Kendall had something to do with it,
          then you go get the son of a bitch.

INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

Kendall lies in his bed, looking worse than before.   Hardy
and Osborne enter.

                      OSBORNE
          Pike never confessed.

                      KENDALL
          We've been making progress, I see.

Osborne looks to her watch.   Kendall notices.

                      KENDALL
          Running out of time, are we? Tick-
          Tock, tick-tock, how long till your
          witnesses fly the coop?

                      OSBORNE
          Fifty minutes.

                      KENDALL
          Not much time to solve the crime.
          Tell me, detective, how did it feel
          taking blood money from Guissepe
          Torres? Did it weigh on your
          conscience or did you just not think
          about it?

                      HARDY
          You tried to pin three stone murders
          on Dunbar-

                      KENDALL
          How many murders did you cover up?
          One? Five? Maybe an even ten.

                      HARDY
              (to Osborne)
          Can I go to jail for punching a guy
          who's been shot?

Kendall begins coughing.

                      KENDALL
          I think they're giving me the wrong
          medicine. This isn't a very good
          Hospital, you know-

Hardy sighs and goes to the sink to get him some water.

                                                        70.
                      KENDALL
          Epileptic attacks are murder on your
          system. Rattle your internal organs
          like a paint mixer.
                      HARDY
          My heart weeps.
He returns with a GLASS OF WATER and hands it to Kendall.
                      OSBORNE
          Pike never confessed.
                      KENDALL
          No, but it got you interested, didn't
          it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray
          to tell you terribly sordid tales
          about drugs and creek beds and dead
          little sergeants who stuck their
          noses where they didn't belong.
                      HARDY
          Is it the truth?
                      KENDALL
          There's that word again.
              (smiling)
          As I told you, I wasn't in the room
          when everyone started shooting.
                      OSBORNE
          Dunbar says you were.
                      KENDALL
          Then he's mistaken. You know, I
          really don't think my father would
          approve of this line of questioning-
                      HARDY
          Why did you tell us he shot everybody,
          Levi? You put him in for three
          murders, the man saved your life-
                      KENDALL
          So I should stay silent about his
          misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran
          in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller
          were dead, and Dunbar was running
          out the door with the smoking gun-
                      HARDY
          Dunbar was running out the door?
          Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was
          confused, because I thought you said
          Nunez was running out the door.

                                                           71.
                       KENDALL
          No.   I said Dunbar.
                      HARDY
          Huh. You know, I really thought you
          said Nunez. I thought you said
          "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta
          check the tape on that.
              (off Kendall's look)
          Oh, yeah we taped the last interview.
          This one too. Cause it'd be a real
          break for us to catch you in a lie.
Silence. They wait for Kendall's reaction. He looks
momentarily flustered by this... and then he smiles.
                      KENDALL
          I believe your next line is "What
          are you trying to hide?"
                       HARDY
          Well?
                      KENDALL
          Sorry to disappoint. I'm on
          painkillers for the injury - they
          cloud the mind. You're right, it
          was Nunez. Any more questions?
Hardy doesn't know what to say.   That was his ace card.
                      KENDALL
          Don't get me wrong, Mueller and Childs
          were quite the pair, the type of
          guys you didn't feel comfortable
          going to sleep around. Completely
          capable of murder. But as I said, I
          didn't hear the exchange before the
          shooting. I wasn't in the room.
Osborne furrows her brow at this as Hardy continues.
                      HARDY
          Dunbar will testify that you were.
                      KENDALL
          Then we'll leave it up to the courts -
          His word against mine. What does
          his father do again? Steelworker?
              (smiling)
          Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice
          will be served. In any case, my
          father will definitely want to talk
          to you about all these questions,
          these accusations on his son. He's
          quite protective.

                                                             72.
Osborne turns to Hardy.
                         OSBORNE
             I need to talk to you outside.
EXT. BASE HOSPITAL -- CORRIDOR -- DAY
Osborne and Hardy, exiting the room.      Whispering:
                         HARDY
             We're fucked, I know-
                         OSBORNE
             They got their stories straight.
                           HARDY
             What?
                         OSBORNE
             What Kendall said - "the type of
             guys you don't feel comfortable going
             to sleep around." That's what Dunbar
             said about Childs to the letter.
                         HARDY
             Are you sure?
                           OSBORNE
             Positive.    Hardy, they planned this.
She grins.    He grins back.
                         OSBORNE
             Not bad for hostile and uncooperative,
             eh?
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY
Hardy and Osborne reenter, smiling.      Kendall chuckles.
                         HARDY
             Something funny, Levi?
                         KENDALL
             I was just thinking of what's going
             to happen to your careers when my
             father gets through with you.
Hardy pulls the out MICRORECORDER and hands it to Osborne.
                         HARDY
             Why don't you talk to Levi off the
             record for a second?
                           OSBORNE
             Good idea.

                                                         73.
Smiling, she stops the tape.    Then turns to Kendall.

                      OSBORNE
          You and Dunbar got your stories
          straight. Little details, little
          inconsistencies, designed to bounce
          us back from one of you to the other,
          asking questions, killing time, until
          the transport arrives and whisks you
          away to where Senator Daddy can
          protect you. You think you're just
          going to slide out of this? You're
          an accessory to murder, Levi, you're
          Going to jail-

                      KENDALL
          You can't threaten me-

                       HARDY
          Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber
          if he's not-

                      KENDALL
          Didn't do anything-

Osborne laughs.

                       OSBORNE
          It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going
          to find those bodies and when we do,
          I'm going to make sure one of them
          has a bullet in them that matches
          your weapon-

                      KENDALL
          What?

                      HARDY
          That's a fantastic idea-

                      OSBORNE
          See, I just take your gun to the
          morgue and fire it into one of their
          skulls; then I call every newspaper
          in the country with the story about
          how Senator Kendall's gay son went
          nuts on a training mission-

                      KENDALL
              (beginning to panic)
          It won't work-

                      OSBORNE
          It will and you know why?
              (MORE)

                                                        74.
                       OSBORNE
           Because you're not a person anymore,
           you're a cadet in the United States
           Army; you have no identity, no Miranda
           warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna
           throw you to the wolves, and unlike
           you I'm gonna get away with it,
           because you're pissing me off!
She finishes, breathing hard. Kendall, totally cowed. Hardy,
trying to suppress a smile. Osborne rises for the door.
                       OSBORNE
           Enjoy your flight to Washington-
                        KENDALL
           Wait-
                        OSBORNE
           What.
Silence.   Kendall takes a deep breath.
                       KENDALL
           Dunbar's telling the truth.
                       OSBORNE
           Wrong answer-
                       KENDALL
           We did get our stories straight, but
           not because we killed anyone.
               (pause)
           It was because I threatened him.
                        HARDY
           Why?
                       KENDALL
           Because of what I saw.
               (pause)
           Who really killed West.
Osborne holds up the microrecorder and starts the tape again.
                       OSBORNE
           Who killed Sergeant West?
Kendall stares at the recorder.   A long pause.
                        OSBORNE
           Who, Levi-
                        KENDALL
           Childs.

                                                           75.
                      HARDY
          How do you know?
                      KENDALL
          Because I was standing next to him.
He pauses, taking a shaky sip of water.
                      KENDALL
          I was in on the PX thing. He and
          Mueller and me, we were making
          thousands. West found out. Childs
          said we were just gonna scare him -
          Use my Dad's clout. I had this whole
          speech prepared about how if he ratted
          us, his career was over. We met him
          in the creek bed but before I said
          anything...
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- LAST NIGHT
West stands in front of Childs and Kendall, facing them.
Kendall opens his mouth to speak, but Childs steps forward
and raises his rifle, FIRING...
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                      KENDALL
          I swear, I didn't know he was gonna
          do it. After, he told me we were
          gonna pin it on Pike, one of our
          biggest customers.
INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
As they TIE PIKE to the, chair.
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          Nobody'd believe the word of a black
          junkie ex-con against ours.
Childs gives Kendall a look that says "Stay quiet".
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          He told me I'd better keep quiet, or
          I'd end up the same as West.
Pan over to Dunbar, who binds his friend, sadly.
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          Dunbar didn't know anything about
          any of it. Everything he told you
          was true, except after...

                                                       76.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT
Dunbar pulls Kendall from the cabin's wreckage. As Kendall
begins to talk to him, Dunbar's eyes widen in shock. ..
                      KENDALL (V.O.)
          I told him what had really happened
          to West. Told him to keep quiet
          about it or I'd destroy him. Because
          if it came out that I was involved
          with the whole PX scam, my father
          would be finished.
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                      KENDALL
          I scared Dunbar into silence.  He's
          been trying to cover for me the whole
          time. We got here, you came to  see
          me... I didn't know if I could trust
          him with that kind of secret-
                      OSBORNE
          So you framed him. The same way
          Childs was going to frame Pike.
Kendall nods.   Crying a little.
                      HARDY
          Little advice, Levi, next time you
          frame a guy, pick someone who can't
          defend themselves.
Kendall says nothing.
                      OSBORNE
          What happened with Nunez?
                      KENDALL
          He came after us. And I told Dunbar
          he had to kill him...
EXT. CLEARING -- EARLIER THAT MORNING
The helicopter, hovering overhead. Dunbar, carrying Kendall,
spinning his rifle to face Nunez, sixty yards away. Dunbar
hesitates before firing, not wanting to...
                        KENDALL
          Do it!
Dunbar's rifle ERUPTS...
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY
                        KENDALL
          And he did.

                                                          77.
Kendall finishes, wiping his face.    Osborne turns to Hardy.
                      OSBORNE
          That's how you do good cop/bad cop.
Hardy smiles and gets up.   Walking slowly to Kendall's bed.
                      HARDY
          Childs did it, huh?
Kendall nods, still a little teary.
                      HARDY
          First Pike, then Mueller, now Childs?
          When are we getting to the others?
          When are we gonna hear about Nunez?
FLASHCUT TO - NUNEZ, in the creek bed, SHOOTING WEST.
                        HARDY
          Or Dunbar?
FLASHCUT TO - Now DUNBAR, SHOOTING WEST.
                      HARDY
          Or you, Levi? When is it finally
          going to come out that you were the
          one who killed him?
FLASHCUT TO - KENDALL, SHOOTING WEST.
                        KENDALL
          I didn't-
                      HARDY
          But you can't prove it! You can't
          prove anything until we find the
          bodies!
Kendall, crying harder now, beginning to shake.
                      HARDY
          You lied to us, Levi, you're going
          to the gas chamber unless you tell
          us where to find them!
                      KENDALL
          I don't know-
                      HARDY
          Where are they!
                        KENDALL
          Maybe-
                        HARDY
          MAYBE WHAT-

                                                        78.
                      KENDALL
          MAYBE HE-

And then. His mouth SLAMS SHUT. Teeth cracking together
over and over again like a metronome on speed, and his body
JERKS HORRIBLY, going horizontal, SHAKING VIOLENTLY!

Osborne, leaping to her feet.

                      OSBORNE
          Get something between his teeth!

Hardy grabs a fork from the bedside table and tries to shove
it into Kendall's chattering mouth. His teeth, CLAMPING
DOWN on the metal and Hardy's hand, drawing blood.

                      HARDY
          Shit!

The Nurse bursts into the room.

                      NURSE
          What is-

                      OSBORNE
          He's an epileptic!

The Nurse runs to the bed, pushing Hardy aside. As more
MEDICAL PERSONNEL runs into the room, they usher Hardy and
Osborne to the door.

                      DOCTOR
          You're going to have to wait outside-

                      OSBORNE
          He's a witness!

                      DOCTOR
          It doesn't matter, outside-

                      KENDALL
          F-F-F-F-F-F-Fuh-

Osborne tries to move to him, but the Doctor blocks her path.

                      OSBORNE
          He's trying to say something-

                      DOCTOR
          Out, NOW.

                      KENDALL
          Fuh-Fuh-Fuh-Fuh-Fuh-

Osborne knocks the Doctor down and runs to Kendall's side.

                                                            79.
                        DOCTOR
           SECURITY!
Kendall looks up, focusing on Osborne, a slight moment of
clarity in his eyes.
                       KENDALL
           Fuh-Fucking Pike.
And relapses into ANOTHER FIT as SECURITY GUARDS drag Hardy
and Osborne from the room.
INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- WAITING ROOM -- DAY
Later.   Hardy and Osborne sit in silence, eyes downcast.
Waiting. Hardy pulls his last cigarette from the pack, lights
it, crumples the pack and tosses it into a garbage can.
                       HARDY
           I pushed him too hard.
                       OSBORNE
           You couldn't have known-
                       HARDY
           Yeah, I could've.      Should've.
                       OSBORNE
           You wanted to get the truth.
                       HARDY
           No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate
           him. For what he did to Dunbar.
           For fucking over the little guy.
                       OSBORNE
           You mean the falsely accused?
Hardy looks up at her and nods.
                       OSBORNE
           You wanted to break him.
                        HARDY
           Yeah.
                        OSBORNE
           So did I.
She looks back to the floor. Hardy takes a drag from the
cigarette, and then tosses that away too.
The door opens and Styles walks into the room.    Somber.
                        STYLES
           It's over.   Time of death was 4:42.
                        (MORE)

                                                         80.
                      STYLES (CONT'D)
          JAG's been notified and I called the
          Senator myself. My report will
          reflect that his medical condition
          made this unavoidable... you two had
          no culpability in the matter.
                      HARDY
          That's horseshit and you know it.
                     STYLES
          Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll
          carry it.
He sighs and takes a seat next to them.
                      STYLES
          We found the cabin. Demolished,
          like they said. No bodies. Hurricane
          like that coulda scooped 'em up,
          dropped them down two counties over.
          We'll find them.
Hardy says nothing.
                      STYLES
          You think you could explain all this
          to me?
                      HARDY
          I wouldn't know where to start.
              (pause)
          I guess it was about one man framing
          another. He thought if the other
          guy got blamed, people would over
          look his own wrong doings.
Styles nods, understanding.
                      OSBORNE
          What happens to Dunbar now?
                      STYLES
          Gets on his plane in ten minutes,
          which means you two are done.
          You'll understand if I don't walk
          you out.
Hardy gets up to go and then stops.   Realizing something.
                      HARDY
          They're taking your command, aren't
          they?
                      STYLES
          The Senator...
He points to Kendall's hospital room.

                                                          81.
                      HARDY
          I'm sorry, Bill.
                      STYLES
          Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal
          with the West's of the world.
                      HARDY
          You're a good soldier, Bill.
                      STYLES
          I thought you said that wasn't a
          compliment.
Hardy smiles.
                      HARDY
          This time it is.
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- EVENING
The sun, beginning to dip in the sky, as Hardy and Osborne
exit the hospital.
                      OSBORNE
          Your car's in the motor pool.     I'll
          walk you over.
They walk in silence, for a bit.
                         OSBORNE
          So what now?
                      HARDY
          Now I go home, get drunk, and try
          and forget this ever happened.
                      OSBORNE
          Think it'll work?
                         HARDY
          Nah.
They pass a GROUP OF CADETS doing drills.    Hardy, watching
them. Almost looking wistful.
                      OSBORNE
          You know, you never told me why you
          left the army.
                      HARDY
          It dawned on me one day that we were
          supposed to be a nation founded on
          the principle of questioning
          authority... and all I did here was
          follow orders. It didn't add up.

                                                        82.
                      HARDY [CONT'D)
          Plus, I got kicked out.
                      OSBORNE
          For what?
                      HARDY
          That's gonna stay my secret.
INT. MOTOR POOL -- EVENING
Hardy and Osborne make their way towards Hardy's car.
                      OSBORNE
          We were close to something with
          Kendall.
                      HARDY
          Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near.
Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.
                       (pause)
          I haven't by any chance grown on
          you, have I?
                      OSBORNE
          No.
                      HARDY
          Good, just making sure.
Osborne turns to the DUTY SERGEANT.
                      OSBORNE
          We're going need a vehicle release.
The Sergeant nods, walking up with a clipboard.
                      SERGEANT
          Sign here and here.
              (recognizing them)
          Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on
          that whole hulabaloo from last night?
                      OSBORNE
          Yeah.
                      SERGEANT
          Terrible tragedy. One of those
          Section Eight boys worked in here.
          Pike. Heard he got out okay.
Hardy signs the clipboard and hands it back.
                      HARDY
          Hate to be the bearer of bad news,
          Sergeant, but he didn't make it.

                                                        83.
The Sergeant scratches his head.
                      SERGEANT
          Funny. I swear I saw them bring him
          and the smaller guy in this morning.
                      OSBORNE
          No, no that was Cadet Dunbar-
                       SERGEANT
          You mean Ray Dunbar?     Well, that
          ain't right.
                      HARDY
          Why not?
                      SERGEANT
          I saw 'em get off the chopper.     White
          guys, right? Two
                      OSBORNE
          So?
                      SERGEANT
          Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
Hardy and Osborne stare at him.    Shocked
A beat.
                      SERGEANT
          Did I say something wrong-
                      HARDY
              (to Osborne)
          What runway's that transport leaving
          from?
                      OSBORNE
          Four-
                      HARDY
          Get in.
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- EVENING
CADETS SCATTER as Hardy's car ROARS OUT OF THE MOTOR POOL,
PEELING across the grass towards the far side of the base!
Hardy, white knuckling the wheel, doing his best to steer
around anyone who can't get out of the way in time.
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY RUNWAY FOUR -- EVENING
A Large TRANSPORT PLANE sits on the runway waiting as three
M.P.'s and a JAG LAWYER lead Dunbar/Pike (who, for purposes
0£ continuity, we will continue to call DUNBAR) out to it.

                                                           84.
The SQUEAL OF TIRES as Hardy's car SLIDES around the corner
of the nearest building and SCREECHES to a halt by the plane.
Hardy and Osborne, leaping out, running towards Dunbar and
the M.P.s.
                      OSBORNE
          We need to talk to him-
                      JAG LAWYER
          Sorry, Officer, we have a schedule
          To keep-
                      OSBORNE
          We need to talk to him now.
Hardy grabs Dunbar by the arm.
                      HARDY
          We're not finished yet-
                      DUNBAR
          You wanna bet?
                      JAG LAWYER
          M.P.'s, escort this man off the base!
                      DUNBAR
              (smiling)
          Sorry, detectives.     Time's up.
As the M.P.'s grab Hardy, dragging him away. Osborne, trying
to stop them. Dunbar, climbing the stairs onto the plane...
Osborne pulls her SIDEARM, levelling it at him as Hardy yells:
                      HARDY
          James Randall Pike, COME ON DOWN!
Dunbar stops at the hatchway. Slowly turning back to them.
Seeing the gun. The M.P.'s release Hardy. Nobody moves.
                      OSBORNE
          Let's go have a talk.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- EVENING
Hardy and Osborne roughly lead Dunbar into the room, the JAG
Lawyer trailing behind, shouting:
                      JAG LAWYER
          This is your entire career here-
                      OSBORNE
          Fuck off.
She slams the door and BARRICADES it.    Turns to Hardy.

                                                           85.
                      OSBORNE
          We got maybe three minutes till they
          break it down.

                      HARDY
          Right back where we started.

                      DUNBAR
          You want to talk about baseball now?

Hardy practically throws Dunbar into a chair.

                      HARDY
          No more games, right, Pike?    It was
          you who West singled out...

FLASHCUT TO - WEST on the parade grounds, now strangling
DUNBAR on the first day...

                      HARDY
          You who got hooked by Mueller's
          morphine...

FLASHCUT TO - Now DUNBAR in the showers as MUELLER hands him
a syringe...

                      HARDY
          You who did it all.

Hardy steps forward and RIPS OPEN Dunbar's right sleeve,
revealing the TRACK MARKS.

                      HARDY
          You wanted revenge on West, revenge
          on them all, so you killed them.

INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

Dunbar standing in the Cabin; Mueller, Childs, and Pike,
dead at his feet.

                      HARDY (V.O.)
          But that wasn't enough. You needed
          a new identity, because no one was
          going to believe James Randall Pike,
          convicted felon, had acted so nobly
          in the face of danger - you needed a
          name people could trust, one that
          hadn't been to jail, one that hadn't
          publicly been West's bitch boy.

He stares down at the bodies in the cabin, his eyes focusing
on the black man's uniform. The name on it reads - "DUNBAR".

As he reaches for it...

                                                        86.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING
                      OSBORNE
          You kept Kendall alive to corroborate
          your story and he did it all they
          way up to the end. You even gave
          him his own motive in case we decided
          to burn him, too.
                      DUNBAR
          Can't do that now, though, can you?
                      HARDY
          You walked into the army a convicted
          felon with a sentence of five years
          in a uniform and were going walk out
          eight weeks later with a different
          name, a clean record, and an honorable
          discharge - a guy who did "everything
          he could" to save his friends.
Dunbar looks at them.   One to the other.   Slowly.
                      DUNBAR
          Is that what I did, now? And of
          course, you can prove all of it.
                      OSBORNE
          We can prove that you're not Ray
          Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet
          is a court-martial in and of itself-
                      DUNBAR
          Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar?
          Was I ever told to state my name
          rank and serial number for the record?
          No. You assumed who I was, because
          I was wearing this uniform. Don't
          believe me?
He reaches under the table and rips out the HIDDEN MICROPHONE.
                      DUNBAR
          Check your tapes.
Hardy and Osborne exchange an uneasy glance.
                      HARDY
          We don't need the tapes-
                      DUNBAR
          Oh, you don't? What else do you
          have on me? You haven't found any
          bodies yet, have you?
                      HARDY
          We've found all of them.

                                                       87.
Dunbar chuckles at the bluff.

                      DUNBAR
          Ohhhh, I don't think so...

                      OSBORNE
          How do you know that?

                      DUNBAR
          Just a guess. Maybe they're not
          where they're supposed to be. Maybe
          somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -
          no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still
          plays as self defense. Face it
          detectives ... you have nothing.

Hardy, knowing he's right. In a flash he reaches down PULLS
OSBORNE'S GUN and grabs Dunbar, SLAMMING him up against the
wall, pressing the weapon TO HIS TEMPLE!

                      HARDY
          Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun-

                      DUNBAR
              (terrified)
          Jesus!

                      OSBORNE
          Hardy, what are you doing-

                      HARDY
          Isn't this how your story goes?
          Pike annoys someone so much he gets
          shot in the head-

                      DUNBAR
          Please, please don't-

A POUNDING on the locked door.    Hardy ignores it.

                      HARDY
          We can tie you to the chair if it'll
          work better for you-

                      OSBORNE
          Hardy, for Chrissakes-

                      HARDY
          WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?

                      DUNBAR
              (practically in tears)
          You'll never find it-

Hardy COCKS the pistol as Dunbar screams:

                                                           88.
                      DUNBAR
          You'll never find it cause HE'S NOT
          DEAD!
A CRASH as the door's lock SNAPS and M.P.'s POUR into the
room! Styles and the JAG Lawyer behind, taking in the scene.
                      STYLES
          What in God's name is going on?
Hardy releases Dunbar, who slides to the floor, gasping.
                      DUNBAR
          He- He made me do it-
                       HARDY
          Do what?
                      DUNBAR
          Hunting- we had to hunt him-
                      JAG LAWYER
          Sergeant, arrest these men!
                      OSBORNE
          You mean the exercise?
                      DUNBAR
          There never was an exercise! Never
          targets, never teams, I don't even
          know if there's a creek bed out there-
As the M.P.'s grab Hardy and Osborne, pulling them away...
                      HARDY
          What did you do?
                      JAG LAWYER
          That's enough-
                      HARDY
          Goddammit, what did you DO?!
                      DUNBAR
          I COULDN'T KILL HIM!
He breaks down sobbing.   Styles holds up a hand to the M.P.'s.
                       STYLES
          Hang on.
                       JAG LAWYER
          Colonel-
                       STYLES
          No.   I want to hear this.

                                                            89.
The JAG Lawyer glowers as the M.P.'s stand down.   Dunbar
tries to pull himself together. To Hardy:
                      DUNBAR
          You're right. I was the one he
          singled out. Beat me morning, noon,
          and night, ran me ragged. When
          Mueller found me, I was gone. He
          gave me a little taste...
INT. CADET SHOWERS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO
Mueller showing the syringe to the naked Dunbar.   Dunbar's
voice over speaks in unison with Mueller:
                      MUELLER AND DUNBAR (V.O.)
          I got a friend with an in at the PX,
          can hook you up...
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING
                      DUNBAR
          What I didn't know, was his friend
          was West. He ran the whole thing.
                      STYLES
          You're lying, son.
                      DUNBAR
          You think it's easy to have all that
          morphine just disappear without a
          higher up authorizing it? Check the
          requisition orders, I'll lay money
          it's his signature on them.
INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO
Dunbar, alone, sleeve rolled up, arm tied off: Sliding the
needle into his vein...
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          That was his game, see? Ride the
          cadets so hard they'd need something
          to stay on their feet. Then he'd
          send Mueller or Kendall to them,
          waving around their magic needle
          promising to make it all go away.
He hits the plunger, injecting.   His face goes tranquil.
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING
                      DUNBAR
          It wasn't a new thing either.   He'd
          been doing this for years.
              (MORE)

                                                          90.
                      DUNBAR
          Every nine weeks, a new class of
          cadets, new potential customers.
          The amount of money involved over
          that period of time... this was some
          high stakes shit.
He takes a deep breath, looking at them.
                      DUNBAR
          Dunbar moved his through the kitchen.
          I worked in the motor pool and hooked
          all the mechanics. By the time the
          hurricane hit, we were all in. Some
          using, some pushing, some both. But
          then something happened. West heard
          one of us was about to talk, to blow
          his whole operation. He figured
          he'd made enough money, had enough
          of the army, maybe it was time to
          disappear. But first he was gonna
          teach us one last thing.
INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- LAST NIGHT
West, entering the,barracks, shouting the cadets awake.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          The Tuesday Night drill was the
          perfect cover. The hurricane made
          it even better.
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- TARMAC -- LAST NIGHT
The cadets, climbing aboard the chopper.
                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          He put us on the chopper and flew us
          to his cabin. And then he told us.
INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
The six men stand in rigid formation, eyes on West.
                      WEST
          Gentlemen! It has come to my
          attention that there is a traitor in
          our midst. Someone who was going to
          break the code of fraternal
          brotherhood that I have endeavored
          to create in all of you. Perhaps
          that failure is mine. But we take
          care of our own. And this traitor
          must be made to pay.
He walks down the line of the six men, eyeing each of them.
Finally stopping at one. Putting a hand on his shoulder.

                                                        91.
Nunez.
                         WEST
             Run.
                         NUNEZ
             Sir, I wasn't-
                         WEST
             I know you were. Cadet  Mueller found
             the letter you'd written to the
             Colonel in your locker.  You were
             going to betray us all.  Now, run.
He points to the door. The hurricane, RAGING outside.   Nunez
looks to the others, then the door, and understands.
He takes off running out the door.       Gone.
West walks over to a table covered with a tarp. Pulls the
cloth aside to reveal M-16's, PISTOLS, and GRENADES.
                         WEST
             Now we'll see whose training's paid
             off the most. You are to hunt Cadet
             Nunez down and bring his body back
             to me. If you fail and he escapes,
             we all go down together.
The remaining five cadets, understanding there is no place
for friendship or kindness here. This is life and death.
They walk to the table and gear up.
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT
Lightning, thunder, and rain as Nunez runs unarmed through
the thick brush.
SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM - The other five fan out, rifles up,
following his trail, ready to kill.
                         DUNBAR (V.O.)
             It was insanity. We were hunting a
             man down to kill him.
ON MUELLER
Making his way down embankment, M-l6 out, ready for anything.
From behind him, MOVEMENT...
                         DUNBAR (V.O.)
             He got Mueller first.
Nunez TACKLES HIM at full speed, feet SLIPPING on the wet
hill, and the two TUMBLE head first into a GULLY. Punching,
kicking, biting, anything to stop the other man.

                                                                 92.
Nunez, CHOKING Mueller as he strains to reach his gun...
                          MUELLER
            Roberto...
With a HEAVE, Nunez SNAPS HIS NECK.        Mueller lies still.
                        DUNBAR (V.O.)
            He took his gun. Used it on Childs.
Nunez spins, seeing CHILDS BEHIND HIM. He DIVES as Childs
fires! Hits the ground in a roll, comes up with Mueller's
rifle, and SHOOTS - BLOWING CHILDS BACK against the wet rocks.
                        DUNBAR (V.O.)
            I can't imagine what it was like.
            Having your friends try to kill you...
Nunez slumps against the gully's wall, breathing hard.          In
agony over what he's just had to do.
                        DUNBAR (V.O.)
            But you do what you have to survive.
Closing his eyes, Nunez steels himself. Wipes the blood
from his hands and climbs out of the gully.
ELSEWHERE
PIKE, creeping through the foliage. Trying to listen for
sounds of movement through the storm. His eyes narrow as he
hears a HIGH PITCHED WHINE...
The bullet hits his forehead dead center.        He crumples.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Nunez in a tree, thirty meters away.
Lowering his rifle.      He climbs down.
                        DUNBAR (V.O.)
            Kendall and I found Dunbar a couple
            minutes later.
TIME CUT TO:
Dunbar and Kendall come upon Pike's fallen form. They gaze
down at the uniform emblazoned with the name "DUNBAR".
                        DUNBAR (V.O.)
            It came to me in a split second.
            Change clothes, change identities.
            If James Pike gets discharged he
            goes right back to jail. But if I
            was Dunbar, I could walk away from
            all this with a new life. But then...
As he reaches down for the uniform, a SHOT RINGS OUT.

                                                           93.
KENDALL FALLS, wounded in the arm. Dunbar raises his rifle
to find Nunez, standing ten yards away, gun trained on him.
YELLING OVER THE HURRICANE:
                          NUNEZ
           Put it down!
A Mexican stand-off.   The rain continues to fall.
                       DUNBAR
           I just want to go!
Nunez shakes his head.
                       NUNEZ
           You were gonna kill me, Pike!    Thought
           you were my friend!
Dunbar, torn. He can't bring himself to shoot, but he can't
surrender either.
                       DUNBAR
           I have to get Kendall to a hospital!
                       NUNEZ
           He was gonna kill me too!
Silence.   The two men still facing each other.
                       NUNEZ {CONT'D)
           I snapped Mueller's neck! He was my
           best friend and I had to snap his
           neck because he was gonna shoot me
           for drugs! For West!
                       DUNBAR
           We don't have to do this! You go
           that way, I'll go this way!
Nunez laughs.
                       NUNEZ
           You'll shoot me in the back!
                       DUNBAR
           You killed three people!    Isn't that
           enough for one night?
More silence.   Neither moves.    The sky above, a maelstrom.
                       DUNBAR
           I don't want to die out here, Roberto!
           Do you?
Nunez, staring at him.     Deciding.

                                                              94.
                      NUNEZ
          If you even twitch...
Dunbar nods.
Nunez begins backing away, rifle still trained on him.
And then Dunbar spies something behind and to the left of
Nunez...
West.
Staring down at him from behind some brush.       Watching.
Nunez, slowly backing away. He pauses as his foot catches
on a fallen branch. Looks away from Dunbar for a split second
to step over it...
West nods to Dunbar as if to say "Go on. . . "
                      DUNBAR
          Forgive me. ..
And Dunbar FIRES.
Nunez, caught by the burst, GOES DOWN. The echo of the
gunshots, swallowed by the storm. Dunbar lowers his head in
agony. West walks down.
                      WEST
          Congratulations, Cadet Pike.      You
          get the gold star.
Dunbar stares at his Sergeant through the rain.
                        DUN BAR
          Fuck you.
West smiles.   Tilts his head to Kendall.
                      WEST
          You'd best get him out of here.
          Don't worry about the bodies, they'll
          be taken care of.
Dunbar doesn't move.
                      WEST
          This is where we part ways, Cadet.
          You tell them I died out here, or
          I'll come back for you. Tell them
          one of the others did me. Mueller,
          Childs, I don't care who. You and
          Kendall, you tell them a story.
              (smiling)
          You can tell a story, can't you?
Dunbar doesn't reply.   West laughs and flips him a salute.

                                                         95.
                       WEST
          Dismissed.

And West turns and walks away, stepping over Nunez.   Giving
Dunbar a clear shot at his back.

Dunbar raises his rifle, wanting, needing, dying to shoot
the old man...

But he can't.   West disappears into the bayou.

A GROAN from the ground. Kendall. Dunbar's reverie broken,
he leans down, beginning to unbutton the Dunbar Uniform...

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING

Dunbar stubs out a cigarette, finished. Hardy, Osborne,
Styles, and the JAG Lawyer gaping at what he has just said.

                      DUNBAR
          I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all.
          He came after us with a vengeance.
              (to Styles)
          You know the rest.

                      HARDY
          And the bodies?

                      DUNBAR
          You won't find them. Won't find
          West, either. He's too good.

                      OSBORNE
          No bodies, no West...

                      HARDY
          No death certificates.    No crime.

                      DUNBAR
          Just four people MIA.    Silence.

The JAG Lawyer steps forward.

                      JAG LAWYER
          You'll testify to this, the
          corruption, the drug scam?

Dunbar says nothing.

                      JAG LAWYER
          We can cut a deal for you on the
          Nunez killing.

                      DUNBAR
          I don't want any deals.

                                                            96.
                       JAG LAWYER
           If you're telling the truth, the PX
           requisition records will prove it-
                       DUNBAR
           All the proof you need will be when
           West comes back and puts a bullet in
           my brain. But I'll do it. I'm a
           dead man, anyway. Like Kendall.
               (looking at Hardy)
           We both should have died out there
           with our brothers. I know that now.
Silence.   The JAG Lawyer looks to Hardy, all anger gone.
                       JAG LAWYER
           I'll take him now if you don't mind.
Hardy nods. Dunbar rises and slowly walks to the door.
Turning back to Hardy.
                       DUNBAR
           Tell me, detective.   Did you get
           what you wanted?
Hardy shakes his head, sadly.
                       HARDY
           Not even close.
They leave.   Styles walks over to Hardy.
                       STYLES
           Tom-
Hardy holds up a hand, cutting him off. Styles nods,
understanding, and leaves, closing the door behind him.
Hardy and Osborne stand there.   Not speaking.    It's done.
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- OFFICER'S CLUB -- NIGHT
Several hours and bourbons later, Hardy sits at the bar,
drunk and alone. Out of place, the only one not in uniform.
Osborne walks in, locates Hardy, and strides over to the
bar, a sheaf of papers under her arm. Her face, stoic.
                       OSBORNE
           We need to talk-
                       HARDY
           Seven.
He takes a slug of his drink.
                       OSBORNE
           What?

                                                       97.
                      HARDY
          Seven guys. What was it you said?
          You were "just starting to believe I
          wasn't the guy people said".
He chuckles.
                     HARDY {CONT'D)
          Seven. That's the answer to Kendall's
          question. How many? Seven.
Osborne looks at him.    Realizing what he's saying.
                      OSBORNE
          This isn't the time-
                      HARDY
          This is the perfect time. You know
          what makes a good detective? The
          number of confessions they get.
          You're a good detective, Osborne.
          So now you get mine.
                      OSBORNE
          What if I don't want it?
                         HARDY
          Tough.
He pours himself another drink.
                         HARDY
          Thing about    taking money is, you
          don't have    to do anything.  You just
          sit there.     Maybe you don't return a
          phone call.     Maybe you don't follow
          up a lead.     But that's it.  Keep the
          money, your    work's done.
Osborne stares at him.
                      HARDY
          Seven unsolved murders. And you
          know what? It didn't weigh on my
          conscience. Not one goddamn bit.
He takes a slug from his glass and grimaces.
                      OSBORNE
          That's not true.
                      HARDY
          There are degrees of truth, officer.
          Always degrees.

                                                          98.
                      OSBORNE
          You're a good man, Hardy.
                        HARDY
          Really.
                      OSBORNE
          Far as I'm concerned, whatever you
          did in the past can stay in the past.
Hardy stares at her.
                      HARDY
          I may not be growing on you, but
          you're sure as hell growing on me.
He motions to the bartender for another glass, but Osborne
takes his hand, stopping him.
                      OSBORNE
          And because you're a good man, I
          know you'll do the right thing.
Hardy looks at her, questioning.   Osborne takes a deep breath.
                      OSBORNE
          Pike never made it to D.C.. Somebody
          took him off the plane before it
          left. My guess is he's already dead.
Hardy stares at her.
                        HARDY
          West?
                        OSBORNE
          Nobody saw.    But I don't think so.
She puts the papers on the bar.
                      OSBORNE
          These are the requisitions from the
          PX, the ones used to release the
          drugs to Mueller. West signed half
          of them - Pike was telling the truth.
          Look who signed the other half.
She taps the bottom of the paper. Hardy, not wanting to
believe it. He looks up at her, pained.
                      HARDY
          Do I have a choice in this?
                      OSBORNE
          Yeah. I can wait till you're off
          the base and do it myself.

                                                       99.
Hardy stares at his glass.   Deciding.
                       HARDY
          Fuck it.   Let's go finish this.
INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- NIGHT
Styles, finishing his paperwork. He rises and turns off his
desk light, bathing the office in DARKNESS. He's about to
leave when he notices a SILHOUETTE in the doorway.
                      HARDY
          "You have to get out of the way of
          the bigger dogs". That was good.
Styles squints at the figure.
                      STYLES
          Tom, is that you?
Hardy steps forward, into the office.
                      HARDY
          It was so good, I actually forgot
          you're one of the bigger dogs now.
          The Base Commander. The one in
          control.
You couldn't let him testify, could you?
                      STYLES
          What are you talking about?
                      HARDY
          If you let him testify then it would
          have all come out. West was supposed
          to take care of it out there, shut
          Nunez up and then disappear. But it
          got messy and people got killed. So
          you called your old pal Tom Hardy,
          figuring if worse came to worse,
          he'd cover for you.
                      STYLES
          You're drunk-
                      HARDY
          I'm not going to cover for you, Bill.
          Not for this.
Styles, realizing what Hardy's talking about.
                       STYLES
          Look-
He begins to move from behind his desk.

                                                   100.
                      HARDY
          Stay where you are.

                       STYLES
          Or what?   You've gone round the bend-

                      HARDY
          West had a partner. Someone who
          knew how to get things done.

Hardy throws the papers onto Styles' desk.

                      HARDY
          What I can't understand is why you
          signed these. If you'd just let
          West take care of the paperwork, no
          one would have known, but you got
          careless. So when Pike finally told
          the truth you had to get rid of him,
          too.

                      STYLES
          That's preposterous-

                      HARDY
          Toxicology report came back.
          Kendall's attack was caused by a
          drug known as anephadrine, maybe
          you've heard of it. It's for
          asthmatics. If an epileptic takes
          enough, it kills them. I checked
          with the nurses at the hospital -
          you're the only other person who
          visited Kendall.

                      STYLES
          Wanted to see if he was okay-

                      HARDY
          You poisoned him, Bill. You heard
          our interrogation, you knew he was
          ready to crack, so you killed him,
          just like Pike.

                      STYLES
          I'm not even going to dignify that-

                      HARDY
          No!  You will stand there and you
          will listen! What happened to you,
          Bill?  You were the one who joined
          up to do good in the world. You
          were the one who believed in it-

                                                      101.
                      STYLES
          You want to get into a finger pointing
          contest about character? The army
          kicked you out for drugs, the cops
          fired you for taking bribes from a
          mobster, and you think you can stand
          there and lecture me on codes of
          conduct? There's only one criminal
          standing in this room and it's you.
                      HARDY
          Not for long.
He walks towards the desk.
                      HARDY
          No more witnesses. West's a ghost.
          But it doesn't matter because we
          have your signature, the hospital
          log, and Kendall's toxicology report.
          And that'll be enough.
                      STYLES
          You're crazy-
                      HARDY
          You can't duck this, Bill. I may
          have done every goddamn thing in my
          life wrong but I won't let this
          happen.
                      STYLES
          For the last time, I have no idea
          what you're talking about-
                      HARDY
              (squinting)
          Get your hands away from the desk!
In the darkness we see Styles MOVE SUDDENLY...
                      HARDY
          Osborne, gun!
Hardy DIVES to the floor - Osborne in the doorway, PISTOL
raised, FIRES TWO SHOTS! Muzzle flare lighting the room for
a split second as Styles is BLOWN BACK against the wall!
Hardy gets to his feet and flicks on the LIGHT. Styles lies
slumped in the corner, two holes in his chest. Dead.
Osborne lowers her weapon, shaking.
Hardy points to the top desk drawer, which is open. Inside
it sits an IVORY HANDLED PISTOL. Fully loaded, safety off.
It's presence tells them everything they need to know.

                                                          102.
                      OSBORNE
          It's West's, isn't it?
Hardy nods and then turns to look down at Styles' body.
                      HARDY
          Now it's over.
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- NIGHT
The aftermath. Flashing blue and red lights from parked
Military Police vehicles illuminate the grounds as M.P. 'S
string crime scene tape around the front entrance of the
building, securing the site for investigation.
Hardy takes in the entire scene from afar. Standing by his
GTO, watching as several M.P.'s finish questioning Osborne.
When she's done she spies Hardy and walks over to him.
                      OSBORNE
          What are you doing out here?
                      HARDY
          Leaving without saying goodbye.
          What are you gonna do?
                      OSBORNE
          Go home, get drunk, and try and forget
          this ever happened.
                      HARDY
          Think it'll work?
                      OSBORNE
          Nah.
                      HARDY
          Want company?
Osborne smiles.
                      OSBORNE
          A word of advice about women - that
          first hour or so after they kill
          their boss? Probably not the best
          time to hit on them.
                      HARDY
          I should probably write that down.
                      OSBORNE
          Yeah. .
Hardy pulls a card from his pocket and hands it to her.
                      OSBORNE
          Your phone number?

                                                      103.
                        HARDY
            In case you need me to testify about
            the shooting. They'll clear you.
A beat.
                        OSBORNE
            He was your friend.
                        HARDY
            Yeah. But he was a lot of other
            things, too. Thanks.
She nods.   An awkward moment.      Finally:
                        HARDY
            I'll see you.
He turns away.   Walking towards his car.
                          OSBORNE
            Hey, Hardy!
He turns back. She walks up and holds something out to him.
A ten dollar bill.
                        OSBORNE
            I owe you this.
He looks down at the money.
                        HARDY
            You saved my life tonight. Keep it.
                (pause)
            Actually, don't keep it, I need the
            money.
He takes the bill and Osborne laughs. He climbs into his
car and starts it. Grinning at her through the open window.
                        HARDY
            You're one of the good ones, Osborne.
            Don't sweat the details.
He puts the GTO in gear and drives off. She watches him go,
then looks down at his card. Smiling. Maybe she will call.
INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
A bottle of Scotch at her side, Osborne slips a tape marked
"BASIC TRAINING INTRO - SGT. N. WEST" into her VCR. Settles
back to watch it. West's face fills the screen.
                        WEST
            Welcome, Cadets. The art of warfare
            is simple and complex. Simple in
            its goal, complex in its execution.

                                                         104.
INT. HARDY'S GTO (MOVING) -- NIGHT
It's started to rain.    Hardy drives in silence.
                      WEST
          As Sun Tzu writes, the true warfare
          is deception.
A HITCHHIKER up ahead.    Hardy pulls over for him.
INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Osborne, drinking and watching.
                      WEST
          At all times you must confuse your
          enemies, surrounding them with
          uncertainty, giving them false hope.
INT. HARDY'S GTO -- NIGHT
The Hitchhiker gets into the car.
                      WEST
          At all times, you must mask your
          true intentions.
Hardy, smiling at him, because the Hitchhiker is not a
Hitchhiker at all...
                      HARDY (V.O.)
          Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
The Hitchhiker is Dunbar.
                      OSBORNE (V.O.)
          They got their stories straight. . .
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- LAST NIGHT
24 hours ago. The hurricane rages. A HAND pulls the PIN on
a phosphorous grenade and CHUCKS IT.
It blows, frying brush and nothing more.
West comes over the hill, running to investigate. He stops
at what he sees. Nunez stands unarmed in the creek bed,
SURROUNDED by the other Section Eight Cadets. A prisoner.
                      WEST
          What the fuck is going on?
                      DUNBAR
          Your weapons, Sergeant.
West doesn't move. Kendall walks over and DISARMS West,
pushing him into the circle next to the terrified Nunez.

                                                        105.
                      WEST
          Is this about that little drug
          business you all are running? Yeah,
          I know about that, Roberto told me-
                        NUNEZ
          Shut up!    Look, we won't say anything-
                      WEST
          Fuck that. You little pissers really
          think you can throw a scare into me?
Dunbar raises his rifle and SHOOTS NUNEZ. He goes down,
twitches once and lies still. Dead. West looks at Dunbar.
                      WEST
          You're gonna have to do a lot better
          than that, son.
                      HARDY (O.S.)
          How about this?
And with that, Tom Hardy emerges from the brush carrying, a
COMBAT KNIFE. West's eyes sparkle with recognition.
                      WEST
          Didn't I kick your ass out for this
          drug thing fifteen years ago?
Hardy just smiles.
                      WEST
          Should've known you were involved in
          this. Come on then. Let's see you
          try and stick me-
Moving faster than   West thought imaginable, Hardy moves and
the knife FLASHES,   CUTTING WEST OPEN stem to sternum. Hardy
grips the older man   by the shoulders, lowering him to the
ground as he dies.    Whispering in his ear:
                      HARDY
          Stem to sternum. You taught me well,
          Sarge.
And WEST DIES. A moment of utter silence and then VOICES
FROM THE PAST begin coming back to us:
                      STYLES (V.O.)
          You think you could explain all this
          to me?
Kendall walks over to Hardy and hands him a PISTOL.
                      HARDY (V.O.)
          I wouldn't know where to start.
Kendall holds out his arm, gritting his teeth...

                                                          106.
                      HARDY (V.O.)
          I guess it was about one man framing
          another...

And Hardy SHOOTS Kendall once, THROUGH THE ARM.

EXT. CLEARING -- THIS MORNING

Mueller and Childs lay NUNEZ's DEAD BODY out in the brush.
The sound of the Helicopter approaching...

TIME CUT TO:

Dunbar raises his rifle and FIRES towards the tree line.
Aiming at nothing. The Helicopter comes into view overhead.

DUST KICKS UP around Dunbar and Kendall - bullet hits.

                       HARDY (V.O.)
          When you commit a crime you know is
          going to be investigated, you need a
          fall guy.. .

ON STYLES' FACE - Watching this through the windscreen.

                      STYLES (V.O.)
          The one who won't talk was trading
          live fire with the dead one as we
          reached the pick-up.

RACK FOCUS TO - Hardy, concealed in the woods, FIRING at
Dunbar and Kendall's feet to simulate Nunez shooting at them.
Dunbar, shooting towards where Nunez's body lies. Making it
look like he just killed Nunez.

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- THIS MORNING

Hardy arriving at the Fort, EMBRACING STYLES.

                      HARDY
          And for that to work, you have to
          have a witness...

PAN OVER to OSBORNE, watching.

                      HARDY (V.O.)
          Someone who's not involved, who's
          word can't be questioned...

VARIOUS SHOTS -- Of Hardy and Osborne, investigating the
case, talking to Dunbar, talking to Kendall...

                      HARDY
          You only let them see what you want
          them to see, you make them believe...

                                                           107.
INT. OFFICER'S CLUB -- EARLIER
Osborne, showing Hardy the requisition forms.
                      OSBORNE (V.O.)
          They believe the innocent are guilty
          and the guilty are innocent.
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- EARLIER
After shooting Styles, Osborne gives her story to the M.P.'s.
                      HARDY (V.O.)
          And if they're asked, that's what
          they'll tell the world.
INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- PRESENT NIGHT
Osborne, watching the taped West.
                       WEST
          Your greatest weapon will by your
          allies . . .
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- EARLIER
Hardy, taking a cigarette from Dunbar's pack.
                       HARDY
          My brand.   Must be my lucky day.
INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- EARLIER
Kendall, coughing fit.   Hardy, getting him a GLASS OF WATER.
                      WEST (V.O.)
          . . . some of which you may have to
          sacrifice for the greater good.
Hardy, secretly dissolving a POWDER into Kendall's water.
                      HARDY (V.O.)
          We got the toxicology report . . .
INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- EARLIER
Hardy, confronting Styles in the dark.
                      WEST (V.O.)
          Make no mistake, the innocent will
          die. . .
Osborne, FIRING TWICE into Styles.   As he hits the wall

                                                        108.
                       HARDY (V.O.)
           Next time you frame a guy, pick
           someone who can't defend themselves...
           But it will not be in vain.
           Sometimes, you can trick the enemy
           into doing your work for you. . .
Osborne, staring down at WEST'S PISTOL.
                       HARDY (V.O.)
           He still carry those guns?
INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- EARLIER
Earlier.   Alone, Hardy plants West's pistol in Styles' desk.
                       WEST (V.O.)
           ...if you engage in a clever enough
           subterfuge.
INT. BASE PX -- BACKROOM -- EARLIER
Hardy stands behind Kendall and Dunbar, overseeing them as
they fill out requisition forms. Kendall signs West's
signature, Dunbar signs Styles'.
                       HARDY (V.O.)
           What I can't understand is why you

As we move into a CLOSE UP on Hardy:
                       OSBORNE (V.O.)
           You never told me why you got kicked
           out of...
                       STYLES (V.O.)
           The army kicked you out for drugs...
                       MUELLER AND DUNBAR (V.O.)
           I got a friend with an in at the PX,
           can hook you up...
                       STYLES (V.O.)
           There's only one criminal standing
           in this room and it's you.
INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Osborne, watching the tape of West's speech.
                       WEST
           Which brings us to the simple goal.
           For the true warrior, the one and
           only objective is to emerge from
           conflict unscathed.

                                                         109.
EXT. ROADHOUSE PARKING LOT -- PRESENT NIGHT

The GTO pulls into a space and Hardy and Dunbar get out.

                      HARDY (V.O.)
          I promised them I'd ask you where
          West and the others are...

                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          Washout rejects, guys he said were
          "dumbfucks too stupid to know they
          dead"...

                      HARDY (V.O.)
          He's telling the truth up to a
          point...

They walk towards the bar's entrance.

                      HARDY (V.O.)
          You can't prove anything until we
          find the bodies...

                      PIKE
          All we gotta do is tell the story
          right...

                      DUNBAR (V.O.)
          You haven't found any bodies yet,
          have you...

As Hardy and Dunbar push through the doors into the bar...

                      HARDY (V.O.)
          WHERE ARE THEY?

INT. ROADHOUSE -- NIGHT

A table of FOUR MEN look up as Hardy and Dunbar enter.

Mueller, Childs, Pike, and the Motor Pool DUTY SERGEANT.
All drinking beer, having a grand old time.

                      STYLES (V.O.)
          Habeas Corpus - you have to have a
          body to have a crime.

Hardy and Dunbar smile and go to join them.

INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- PRESENT NIGHT

As the taped West concludes his speech.

                       WEST
          Thank you.

                                                          110.
The screen cuts to STATIC. Osborne turns off the TV,
extinguishing the last source of light. OVER THE DARKNESS:
                       WEST (V.O.)
           You can tell a story, can't you?
EXT. ROADHOUSE PARKING LOT -- NIGHT
Silence.   We slowly move towards Hardy's parked GTO...
                       HARDY (V.O.)
           Murder is basic.
Focusing on the TRUNK...
                       HARDY (V.O.)
           There are no conspiracies, no grand
           mysteries, no evil puppet masters
           behind it all, pulling the strings.
INT. GTO TRUNK -- NIGHT
WEST'S BODY, stuffed into the trunk of Hardy's car.
                       HARDY
           Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
EXT. CLEARING -- THIS MORNING
Dunbar lays the wounded Kendall down as the Helicopter
carrying Styles comes in for a landing. Dunbar wipes the
sweat from Kendall's brow and asks him seriously:
                       DUNBAR
           Are you ready for this?

          INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

          It is dark; we don't see clearly.  a man and woman make love 
          on a brass bed.  There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling.  
          On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine.  A 
          tape deck PLAYS the Stones "Sympathy for the Devil."

          Atop him... she straddles his chest... her breasts in his face.  
          He cups her breasts.  She leans down, kisses him...

          JOHNNY BOZ is in his late 40's, slim, good-looking.  We don't 
          see the woman's face.  She has long blonde hair.  The CAMERA 
          STAYS BEHIND and to the side of them.

          She leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth...  she 
          kisses him... she moves her hands up, holds both of his arms 
          above his head.

          She moves higher atop him... she reaches to the side of the 
          bed... a white silk scarf is in her hand... her hips above his 
          face now, moving... slightly, oh-so slightly... his face strains 
          towards her.

          The scarf in her hand... she ties his hands with it...  
          gently... to the brass bed... his eyes are closed...  tighter... 
          lowering hips into his face... lower... over his chest... his 
          navel.  The SONG plays.

          He is inside her... his head arches back... his throat white.

          She arches her back... her hips grind... her breasts are high...

          Her back arches back... back... her head tilts back... she 
          extends her arms... the right arm comes down suddenly...  the 
          steel flashes... his throat is white...

          He bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses...

          It flashes up... it flashes down... and up... and down...  and 
          up... and...

          EXT. A BROWNSTONE IN PACIFIC HEIGHTS - MORNING

          Winter in San Francisco cold, foggy.  Cop cars everywhere.  
          The lights play through the thick fog.  Two Homicide detectives 
          get out of the car, walk into the house.

          NICK CURRAN is 42.  Trim, good-looking, a nice suit; a face 
          urban, edged, shadowed.  GUS MORAN is 64.  Crew-cut, silver 
          beard, a suit rumpled and shiny, a hat out of the 50'sa face 
          worn and ruined the face of a backwoods philosopher.

          INT. THE BROWNSTONE

          There's money here -- deco, clean, hip -- That looks like a 
          Picasso on the wall.  They check it out.

                                    GUS
                        Who was this fuckin' guy?

                                    NICK
                        Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.

                                    GUS
                        I never heard of him.

                                    NICK
                               (grins)
                        Before your time, pop.
                               (a beat)
                        Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits.
                        He's got a club down in the Fillmore 
                        now.

                                    GUS
                        Not now he don't.

          Past the uniformed guys... nods... waves... past the forensic 
          men... past the coroner's investigators... they get to the 
          bedroom.

          INT. THE BEDROOM

          They walk in, stare -- it's messy.

          It's like a convention in here.  LT. PHIL WALKER, in his 50's, 
          silver-haired, the Homicide guys; JIM HARRIGAN, late 40's, 
          puffy, affable;  SAM ANDREWS, 30's, black.  A CORONER'S MAN is 
          working the bed.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick and Gus)
                        You guys know Captain Talcott?

          They nod.

                                    GUS
                        What's the Chief's office doin' 
                        here.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                        Observing.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to the Coroner's 
                               Guy)
                        What do you think, Doc?

                                    THE CORONER'S GUY
                        The skin blanches when I press it --
                        this kind of color is about right 
                        for six or eight hours.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Nobody say anything.  The maid 
                        came in an hour ago and found him.
                        She's not a live-in.

                                    GUS
                        Maybe the maid did it.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        She's 54 years old and weighs 240 
                        pounds.

                                    THE CORONER'S GUY
                               (deadpan)
                        There are no bruises on his body.

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        It ain't the maid.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        He left the club with his girlfriend 
                        about midnight.  That's the last 
                        time anybody saw him.

                                    NICK
                               (looks at body)
                        What was it?

                                    THE CORONER'S GUY
                        Ice pick.  Left on the coffee table 
                        in the living room.  Thin steel 
                        handle.  Forensics took it downtown.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        There's come all over the sheets --
                        he got off before he got offed.

                                    GUS
                               (deadpan)
                        That rules the maid out for sure.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                        This is sensitive.  Mr. Boz was a 
                        major contributor to the mayor's 
                        campaign.  He was Chairman of the 
                        Board of the Palace of Fine Arts --

                                    GUS
                               (to Nick)
                        I thought you said he was a rock 
                        and roll star.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        He was a retired rock and roll 
                        star.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                        A civic-minded, very respectable 
                        rock and roll star.

                                    GUS
                        What's that over there?

          We see the white powder laid out in lines on the small mirror 
          on the side table.

                                    NICK
                               (deadpan)
                        It looks like some civic-minded, 
                        very respectable cocaine to me, 
                        Gus.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                               (evenly, to Nick)
                        Listen to me, Curran.  I'm going 
                        to get a lot of heat on this.  I 
                        don't want any... mistakes.

          Nick and Talcott look at each other a beat, then --

                                    NICK
                        Who's the girlfriend?

          Lt. Walker looks at the notepad in his hand.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Catherine Tramell, 162 Divisadero.

          Nick writes it down.  He and Gus turn, leave.  Captain Talcott 
          watches them.  He looks disturbed.

          INT. THE LIVING ROOM

          As they head out --

                                    NICK
                        Talcott doesn't usually show up at 
                        the office 'till after his 18 holes.  
                        What are they nervous about?

                                    GUS
                        They're executives.  They're nervous 
                        about everything.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Nick!

          He stops, turns, sees Walker behind them.  Walker comes up to 
          them.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick)
                        Keep your three o'clock.

                                    NICK
                        Do you want me to work the case, 
                        Phil, or do you want me to --

                                    LT. WALKER
                        I said keep it.

          EXT. A VICTORIAN ON DIVISADERO - DAY

          It is more a mansion than a house.  They ring the bell.  An 
          Hispanic MAID answers.  They flash their badges.

                                    NICK
                        I'm Detective Curran, this is 
                        Detective Moran.  We're with the 
                        San Francisco Police Department.

          We'd like to speak to Ms. Catherine Tramell.

                                    THE MAID
                               (after a beat, an 
                               accent)
                        Just moment.  Come in.

          She leads them into a lavish, beautifully done living room 
          that offers a sweeping view of the Bay.

                                    THE MAID
                        Sit, please.  Just moment.

          They look around, impressed.  There is a Picasso on the wall 
          here, too.

                                    GUS
                        Ain't that cute?  They got his and 
                        her Pig-assos, son.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        I didn't know you knew who Picasso 
                        was, Gus.

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just 
                        hide it.

          Nick smiles -- and at that moment a beautiful BLONDE walks 
          into the room.  She looks like she has been asleep.  She is in

                        Why do you think he's dead?

                        Who are you?

                        I'm her -- friend.

          She looks at them a beat.

                                    ROXY
                        She's out at the beach house at 
                        Stinson.  Seadrift.  1402.

                                    NICK
                        Thanks.

          They start to head out.

                                    ROXY
                        You're wasting your time. Catherine 
                        didn't kill him.

          A beat, they look at her, and go...

          EXT. SEADRIFT - STINSON BEACH - DAY

          Foggy.  Cold.  It is an expensive spit of land on the ocean.  
          Multi-million dollar "beach houses" with gardens and swimming 
          pools.  There are two Ferraris in the driveway -- one black, 
          one white.

          They get out of the car in front of the house.  They see a 
          woman in back of the house, sitting on a deck chair, staring 
          at the sea, a blanket around her.  As they get to her --

                                    NICK
                        Ms. Tramell?

          She takes a long look a Nick, then looks away.

          CATHERINE TRAMELL is 30 years old.  She has long blonde hair 
          and a refined, classically beautiful face.  She is not knockout 
          gorgeous like Roxy; there is a smoky kind of sensuousness about 
          her.

                                    NICK
                        I'm De...

                                    CATHERINE
                               (evenly)
                        I know who you are.

          She doesn't look at them.  She looks at the water.

                                    CATHERINE
                        How did he die?

                                    GUS
                        He was murdered.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Really.  Maybe that's why you're 
                        from Homicide.  How?

          Nick glances at Gus.

                                    NICK
                        With an ice pick.

          She closes her eyes a beat and then, still staring out, we see 
          a thin smile.  They see it, too, and glance at each other.

                                    NICK
                        How long were you dating him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking 
                        him.

          They glance at each other again.

                                    GUS
                        What are you -- a pro?

          Catherine looks at him -- that thin smile again.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  I'm an amateur.

          She looks away.

                        About a year and a half.

                        Were you with him last night?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.

                                    NICK
                        Did you go home with him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  We had a drink at the club.
                        We left together.  I came here.  
                        He went home.

                                    NICK
                        Was there anyone with you last 
                        night?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (looks at Nick)
                        No.  I wasn't in the mood to have 
                        sex with anyone last night.

          They look at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Let me ask you something, Ms.
                        Tramell?  Are you sorry he's dead?

          Catherine looks at him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.  I liked fucking him.

          They stare at her.  She looks out at the water.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I don't really feel like talking 
                        anymore.

                                    GUS
                        Listen, lady, we can do this 
                        downtown if you --

                                    CATHERINE
                        Read me my rights and arrest me 
                        and I'll go downtown.

          She doesn't even look at them.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        Otherwise, get the fuck out of 
                        here.  Please.

          A long beat as they look at her.

          INT. A CORRIDOR - POLICE HEADQUARTERS

          The door says Dr. Elizabeth Gardner, Counseling.  Nick opens 
          the door, peeks in.  The receptionist is not there.  A clock 
          says 3.

          INT. THE COUNSELING OFFICE

          He walks in -- sees the inner door open, walks in.

                                    NICK
                        It's bullshit.  You know it is.

                        so we can get it over with, okay?

          He sits down.

                                    BETH
                        So -- how are things?

                        you -- maybe I should think about 
                        my Electrolux again.

          That embarrassed her; she looks away from him.

          And he starts heading out.

                        girls, and he liked rock and roll.

                        He liked the mayor, too, right?

          Talcott gives him a look.

                                    GUS
                        What about his girlfriend?

                                    TALCOTT
                        Is she relevant here?  I didn't 
                        know she was a suspect.

          INT. NICK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          His apartment is very bare -- very few things -- with wide 
          open spaces.  There is a lot of chrome.

          He sits on the couch, reading a book.  It is a paperback.

          We see the title -- Love Hurts, by Catherine Adams.  He puts 
          the book down a beat, then picks the phone up, dials.

                        does the boyfriend?  With an

          INT. A POLICE DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Nick, Gus, Lt. Walker, Harrigan, Andrews, Captain Talcott --
          and Beth Gardner.  With them is an older, white-haired man, 
          DR. ANDREW LAMOTT.  There are copies of "Love Hurts" around 
          the table.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Dr. Gardner?

                                    BETH
                        I've asked Dr. Lamott to consult 
                        with us.  This isn't really my 
                        turf.  Dr. Lamott teaches the psycho-
                        pathology of psychopathic behavior 
                        at Stanford and is also a member 
                        of the Justice Department's 
                        Psychological Profile team.  Dr.  
                        Lamott?

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        There are two possibilities.  One.  
                        The person who wrote this book is 
                        your murderer and acted out the 
                        killing described in ritualistic, 
                        literal detail.  Two.  Someone who 
                        wants to do the person who wrote 
                        this book harm read the book and 
                        enacted the killing described to 
                        incriminate the writer.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        What if the writer did it?  What 
                        are we dealing with?

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        You're dealing with a devious, 
                        diabolical mind.  This book must 
                        have been written at least six 
                        months, maybe years before it was 
                        published.  That means the writer 
                        planned the crime, at least in the 
                        subconscious, back then.  The fact 
                        that the writer carried it out 
                        indicates psychopathic obsessive 
                        behavior in terms not only of the 
                        killing itself but in terms of 
                        applied advance defense mechanism.

          A long beat.

                        Most times I can't tell shit from 
                        shinola, Doc.  What was all that 
                        you just said?

          Some grins, titters.

                                    BETH
                        She anticipates the book to be her 
                        best alibi.

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        Correct.

                                    BETH
                        She's going to say Do you think 
                        I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone 
                        in the exact way I've described in 
                        my book?  I wouldn't do that because 
                        I'd know I'd be a suspect.

          A long beat -- as they think about it.

                                    NICK
                        What if it's not the writer?  What 
                        if it's someone who read the book?

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        You're dealing then with someone 
                        so obsessed that he or she is 
                        willing to kill an irrelevant and 
                        innocent victim to place the blame 
                        on the person who wrote this book.  
                        We are talking about deep-seated, 
                        obsessional hatred; an utter lack 
                        of sense of proportion or 
                        perspective.

                                    GUS
                        We've got a top-of-the-line, once-
                        in-a-lifetime loony-tune either 
                        way you cut it -- that's what you're 
                        saying, right, Doc?

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        You're dealing with someone very 
                        dangerous and very ill.

          INT. THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

          PROSECUTOR JOHN CORRIGAN, a big man in his 50's, with Captain 
          Talcott, Lt. Walker, Nick, and Gus.

          Corrigan is reading a file.  He gets up, yawns, goes to his 
          window, looks out.

                        Come on, you know there's no case 
                        here.  There's no physical evidence -- 
                        okay, she doesn't have an alibi 
                        but there's no motive.  Her defense 
                        would just beat us to death with 
                        the copycat thing.  Anybody who 
                        read the book could have done it.

                        We bring her in for questioning.

                        She's got enough money to burn 
                        this whole department down.

                        She was the last person seen with 
                        the guy -- I'll take the 
                        responsibility.

                        It's yours.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        It won't do any good.  She'll come 
                        in with Lee Bailey and Mel Belli 
                        trailing behind her on a solid 
                        gold chain from Tiffanys.

                                    TALCOTT
                        Yes she will.

                        I don't think she's going to hide 
                        behind anybody.  I don't think 
                        she's going to hide at all.

                        I think you're as crazy as she 
                        probably is, Curran.

          EXT. HER HOUSE IN STINSON - DAY

          They walk from the car to the door of the big beach house.

          They ring the bell.  They hear typing inside.  The typing stops.  
          She comes to the door in jeans and a tight-fitting sweatshirt.

                                    NICK
                        Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come 
                        downtown and answer some questions 
                        for us.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Are you arresting me?

                                    NICK
                        If that's the way you want to play 
                        it.

          They look at each other a beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Can I change into something more 
                        appropriate?  It'll just take a 
                        minute.

          He nods.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Come in.

          INT. THE HOUSE

          It is beautifully done in a Santa Fe motif.  She goes to a 
          bedroom of the living room.

          Nick sits down on a couch facing the bedroom she's walked into.  
          Gus sits across from him, his back to the bedroom.

          There is a coffee table between them.  She leaves the bedroom 
          door halfway open.

          An old newspaper is on the coffee table.  Nick reaches for it.  
          The headline says VICE COP CLEARED IN TOURIST SHOOTINGS.  A 
          headline underneath says GRAND JURY SAYS SHOOTINGS ACCIDENTAL.  
          There is a photograph of Nick.

          He stares at the paper.

                                    CATHERINE
                        How long will this take?

          Nick puts the paper down on the coffee table.  He is lost in 
          his thoughts.  Gus picks the paper up.

                                    NICK
                               (looks up)
                        I don't know.

          Nick, facing the half open bedroom door, sees a mirror near 
          the wall of the bedroom.  The mirror reflects her in the other 
          corner of the bedroom.  She is taking her clothes off.  He 
          stares.  She strips down.  He sees her back. She has a beautiful 
          body.  Naked, she puts a dress on.  She doesn't put any 
          underwear on.

                                    NICK
                        Do you always keep old newspapers 
                        around?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Only when they make interesting 
                        reading.

          And she is suddenly out of the bedroom.  She stands there, 
          smiles.  They look at each other a long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (finally)
                        I'm ready.

          They get up, head out.

                                    GUS
                        You have the right to an attorney.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Why would I need an attorney?

          INT. THE CAR - DAY

          They sit in the front; she is in the back.  The car goes over 
          the winding, two-lane Mt. Tamalpais road.

          The fog is heavy.  It's starting to rain.  We see the beach 
          far below.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Do you have a cigarette?

                                    NICK
                        I don't smoke.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes, you do.

                                    NICK
                        I quit.

          She smiles, looks at him.  A beat, and he turns away.  Another 
          beat, and she lights a cigarette up.

                                    NICK
                        I thought you were out of 
                        cigarettes.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I found some in my purse; would 
                        you like one?

          He turns back to her.

                                    NICK
                        I told you -- I quit.

                                    CATHERINE
                        It won't last.

          A beat, as she looks at him, and then he turns away.

                                    GUS
                        You workin' on another book?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes I am.

                                    GUS
                        It must really be somehtin' --makin' 
                        stuff up all the time.

          He watches her in the rearview mirror.

                                    CATHERINE
                        It teaches you to lie.

                                    GUS
                        How's that?

                                    CATHERINE
                        You make it up, but it has to be 
                        believable.  They call it suspension 
                        of disbelief.

                                    GUS
                        I like that.  "Suspension of 
                        Disbelief."

          He smiles at her in the mirror.

                                    NICK
                        What's your new book about?

                                    CATHERINE
                        A detective.  He falls for the 
                        wrong woman.

          He turns back to her.

                                    NICK
                        What happens to him?

          She looks right into his eye.

                                    CATHERINE
                        She kills him.

          A beat, as they look at each other, and then he turns away 
          from her.  Gus watcher her in the rearview mirror.

          INT. A POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

          It is large, fluorescent-lighted, antiseptic.

          She walks in with Nick and Gus.  In the room are prosecutor 
          John Corrigan, Lt. Walker, Captain Talcott, Harrigan, and 
          Andrews.  There is a police stenographer a plain young woman 
          in her 20's.

          As soon as she comes in --

                                    CORRIGAN
                        I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant 
                        district attorney, Ms.  Tramell.  
                        Can we get you anything?  Would 
                        you like some coffee?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No thank you.

                                    TALCOTT
                        Are your attorneys --

                                    NICK
                               (hiding a smile)
                        Ms. Tramell waived her right to an 
                        attorney.

          Corrigan and Talcott glance at Nick.  She sees the look.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Did I miss something?

                                    NICK
                        I told them you wouldn't want an 
                        attorney present.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Why have you waived your right to 
                        an attorney, Ms. Tramell?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (to Nick)
                        Why did you think I wouldn't want 
                        one?

                                    NICK
                        I told them you wouldn't want to 
                        hide.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I have nothing to hide.

          The two of them keep their eyes on each other.

          She sits down.  They sit around her.  Nick sits directly across 
          from her.  She lights up a cigarette.  They watch her.  

          She is poised, cool, in complete command of herself.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        There is no smoking in this 
                        building, Ms. Tramell.

                                    CATHERINE
                        What are you going to do?  Charge 
                        me with smoking?

          Ever so casually, she blows her smoke across at Nick.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                                    CORRIGAN
                        Would you tell us the nature of 
                        your relationship with Mr. Boz?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I had sex with him for about a 
                        year and a half.  I liked having 
                        sex with him.

          She has control of the room; she looks from one man to the 
          other as she speaks.

                                    CATHERINE
                        He wasn't afraid of experimenting.  
                        I like men like that.  I like men 
                        who give me pleasure.  He gave me 
                        a lot of pleasure.

          A beat, as they watch her.  She is so matter-of-fact.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        Did you ever engage in sado-
                        masochistic activity with him?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Exactly what do you have in mind, 
                        Mr. Corrigan.

                                    CORRIGAN
                               (after a beat, little 
                               flustered)
                        Did you ever tie him up?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.

                                    ANDREWS
                        You never tied him up.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No. Johnny liked to use his hands 
                        too much.  I like hands and fingers.

          They stare at her.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                        You describe a white silk scarf in

                                    CATHERINE
                        I've always had a fondness for 
                        white silk scarves.
                               (she smiles)
                        I have a very vivid imagination.

                                    NICK
                        But you said you liked men to use 
                        their hands.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  I said I liked Johnny to use 
                        his hands.
                               (she smiles)
                        I don't give any rules, Nick.  I 
                        go with the flow.

          They have their eyes on each other.

                        Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'd have to be pretty stupid to 
                        write a book about a killing and 
                        then kill him the way I described 
                        in my book. I'd be announcing myself 
                        as the killer.  I'm not stupid.

          She smiles.

                                    TALCOTT
                        We know you're not stupid, Ms.

                        Maybe that's what you're counting 
                        on to get you off the hook.

                                    NICK
                        Writing a book about it gives you 
                        an alibi for not killing him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes it does, doesn't it?

          She holds his eyes a second, then --

                                    CATHERINE
                        The answer is no.  I didn't kill 
                        him.

                        I loved him.  I hurt.

          Their eyes are still on each other.

                                    NICK
                        How did you feel when I told you 
                        Johnny Boz had died -- that day at 
                        the beach.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I felt somebody had read my book 
                        and was playing a game.

                                    NICK
                        But you didn't hurt --

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.

                                    NICK
                        Because you didn't love him --

                                    CATHERINE
                        That's right.

          Their eyes are digging into each other.

                                    NICK
                        Even though you were fucking him.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        You still get the pleasure.  Didn't 
                        you ever fuck anybody else while 
                        you were married, Nick?

          A beat; he stares at her, expressionless.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        How did you know he was married?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (watching Nick)
                        Maybe I was guessing.  What 
                        difference does it make?

          She lights a cigarette.  He stares at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Would you like a cigarette, Nick?

          He just stares at her, expressionless.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        Do you two know each other?

                                    NICK
                        No.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.

          INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

                                    ANDREWS
                        How did you meet Mr. Boz?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I wanted to write a book about the 
                        murder of a retired rock star.  I 
                        went down to his club and picked 
                        him up.  Then I had sex with him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You didn't feel anything for him.
                        You just had sex with him for your 
                        book.

          She looks at Nick.

                                    CATHERINE
                        In the beginning.  Then I got to 
                        like what he did for me.

                                    GUS
                        That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'm a writer,  I use people for 
                        what I write.  You write what you 
                        know.  Let the world beware.

          She and Nick have their eyes on each other, then --

                                    CATHERINE
                               (to Corrigan, smiles)
                        Would you like me to take a lie 
                        detector test?

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. THE POLICE BUILDING - NIGHT

          We see her in a glass-enclosed cubicle with a polygraph 
          EXAMINER.  Nick stands outside watching her with Gus and Lt. 
          Walker.  Her back is to them.  The Examiner shuts the machine 
          down, gathers rolls of papers, and comes out of the cubicle.

                                    THE EXAMINER
                        No blips, no blood pressure 
                        variations, no pulse variance.  
                        Either she's telling the truth or 
                        I've never met anyone like her.

          A long beat, then --

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Well, I guess that's it.

          A long beat, Nick watches her as she sits inside.

                                    NICK
                        How does somebody beat this machine?

                                    THE EXAMINER
                        Ninety-nine point nine percent of 
                        the cases, they don't.  You'd have 
                        to be able to mask the truth from 
                        your own central nervous system, 
                        your circulatory system, your 
                        adrenal glands.  In my opinion, 
                        this woman is telling the truth.

          The Examiner walks away.  They stand there. Catherine stands 
          at the door of the cubicle behind them --

                                    CATHERINE
                        Can I go now?

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a beat)
                        Yes.  Thanks for coming in, Ms.
                        Tramell.  I'm sorry to inconvenience 
                        you.

          She says nothing, has a thin smile.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Can I ask one of you for a ride?

          They look at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Sure.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Thanks.

          And he and Catherine walk away.  Gus and Walker watch them.

          INT. HIS CAR - NIGHT

          It is an old, mint-condition silver Porsche.  It is pouring 
          rain; the wind is blowing a San Francisco winter storm.  Nothing 
          is said a long beat as he drives.  She yawns.  Stretches.  He 
          looks at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        I'm tired.

                                    NICK
                        It's got to be tiring to beat that 
                        machine.

          She looks at him and looks away.  A beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                        If I were guilty, and if I wanted 
                        to beat that machine, it wouldn't 
                        be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring 
                        at all.

                                    NICK
                        Why not?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Because I'm a professional liar.  
                        I spend most of my waking hours 
                        dwelling on my lies.
                               (a beat)
                        For my writing.

          He looks at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        I love the rain, don't you?

          He says nothing, doesn't look at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You took a polygraph after you 
                        shot those two people, didn't you?

          He looks at her now.

                                    NICK
                        I passed.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You see?  We're both innocent, 
                        Nick.

          He pulls up in front of her house on Divisadero, stops.  He 
          sees the white Ferrari in the driveway.

                                    NICK
                        How do you know all this stuff 
                        about me?

                                    CATHERINE
                        You know all about me.

                                    NICK
                        I don't know anything that isn't 
                        police business.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        You know I don't like to wear any 
                        underwear, don't you, Nick?

          They look at each other a beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Thanks for the ride.

          And she's out of the car.  He watches her as she hurries in 
          the rain -- his eyes on her until the moment she opens the 
          door and is inside.

          INT. THE TEN-FOUR - NIGHT

          It is a police bar, San Francisco style.  Ferns  Joe Montana 
          and Will Clark posters.  The jukebox has a lot of Tony Bennett.

          He walks in.  He sees Lt. Walker at a back booth with Gus, 
          goes to them, sits down.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        What is all this "Nick" stuff --
                        Nick would you like a cigarette.
                        Nick can you give me a ride.

                                    NICK
                        She didn't ask me for the ride.
                        She asked anybody.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        And you volunteered.

          A BARTENDER stays behind the bar, but yells to him.

                                    THE BARTENDER
                        Perrier, Nick?

                                    NICK
                        Double Black Jack rocks, Harry.

                                    GUS
                               (with concern)
                        What you doin', son?

                                    NICK
                        It's my first drink in three months.  
                        That okay with you, pop?
                               (to Lt. Walker)
                        She doesn't know me.  I never saw 
                        her before Gus and I talked to 
                        her.

                                    THE BARTENDER
                        Here you go, Nick.

          He gets up, gets his drink --

                                    NICK
                        Thanks, Harry.

          He sits back down.  He takes a big slug.  They watch him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You sure?

                                    NICK
                        I'm sure.

          He takes another big slug.

                                    NICK
                        Now what?

                                    LT. WALKER
                        What now what? Now nothing.  She 
                        passed the polygraph.  That's it.

                                    NICK
                        She knew she could beat it.  That's 
                        why she asked to take it.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        How the fuck do you know?  What is 
                        it with you and this broad anyway?

                                    NICK
                        Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna 
                        let this slide.  What about her 
                        parents?  What about what else 
                        she's published?  At least we should 
                        get the stuff to see if we find 
                        anything else that's an amazing 
                        real-life coincidence.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Her parents died in an accident.  
                        I don't care what else she's 
                        written.  What are you -- a book 
                        critic?

                                    NICK
                        How did they die?  Was there an 
                        investigation?

                                    LT. WALKER
                        How you're saying she killed her 
                        parents?  Did she kill Bobby 
                        Vasquez, too?

                                    GUS
                        Not unless she got up in the ring 
                        and turned into one mean

                        Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she 
                        grew herself an Afro and learned a 
                        left hook and put shoe polish on 
                        her face.  Let's polygraph her 
                        again and ask her about it.

                                    NICK
                               (casually)
                        Fuck you, Phil.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Fuck you, too Nick.

          A beat, then --

                                    NICK
                               (calls to the 
                               Bartender)
                        Can you get me another double Black 
                        Jack, Harry.

          Gus looks at him with concern.  A man in his 50's -- LT. MARTIN 
          NILSEN  is suddenly there.  He is overweight, florid.

                                    NILSEN
                               (to Nick)
                        Hey, shooter -- You back on the 
                        Black Jack, Shooter?

          He grins.  Nick doesn't look at him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        We're discussing a case, Marty.

                                    NILSEN
                        I know that.  I had no doubt of 
                        that.

                                    THE BARTENDER
                        Here you go, Nick.

          Nilsen takes the drink, hands it to Nick.

                                    NILSEN
                               (grins)
                        Double, huh, Shooter?

          Nick turns to him.  He's sitting in the booth; Nilsen is 
          standing there.  Nick looks like he's barely restraining 
          himself.

                                    NICK
                        I'm off-duty, Nilsen.  You hear 
                        me?  I'm off-duty discussing a 
                        case.  Internal Affairs shouldn't 
                        have any trouble with that.  Maybe 
                        I should put in for overtime.

                                    NILSEN
                               (grins)
                        You do that, Shooter.  Why don't 
                        you send it to me?  I'll give it 
                        special attention.

          A beat, and then Nick gets up, faces him.

                                    NICK
                        I'm gonna tell you once more, Nilsen --

          Lt. Walker and Gus get up and hold Nick back.

          Beth Gardner, the police psychologist, is suddenly there.

                                    BETH
                        What's the problem?

                                    NILSEN
                               (grins)
                        No problem, Doctor.  Here comes 
                        the Doctor just in time to save 
                        her patient.  Take care, Shooter.

          And he walks away.  Nick still looks like he wants to go after 
          him.  Beth pulls him away from the booth.

                                    BETH
                        You okay?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Yeah.

                                    BETH
                               (smiles)
                        You don't look so okay.

          Nick looks at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        What are you doing here?

                                    BETH
                               (smiles)
                        Baby-sitting.
                               (she shrugs)
                        Rookie cop.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        What else is new?

          A beat.  He looks at her again.

                                    NICK
                        You want to get out of here?

          She looks at him a beat.

                                    BETH
                               (smiles)
                        Yes.

          At the booth, Gus and Lt. Walker watch the two of them leave.

                                    GUS
                        Maybe it's for old-time's sake.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (watches them go 
                               out)
                        Sometimes I think he started banging 
                        her just to get himself off the 
                        hook with Internal Affairs.

                                    GUS
                               (after a beat, smiles)
                        He ain't that way.  He's got heart.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (smiles)
                        Yeah.  I know.

          INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          He is kissing her -- hard, rough.  He forces her against the 
          wall.

                                    BETH
                        Don't -- please, Nick --

          We hear her dress RIP.  He kisses her harder -- we hear her 
          panties RIP.  He gets the dress off, pushes his hands under 
          her bra --

                                    BETH
                        Please don't -- don't --

          He puts his mouth to her shoulder, bites it -- as they move 
          down to the floor.

          INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

          It is dark.  The are still partially dressed.  They are on the 
          floor.  He lies on his back, staring at the ceiling.

          She lies next to him -- the torn dress wound around her.

          There is a bite mark on her shoulder.  A long beat, silence -- 
          then --

                                    BETH
                        What was she like?

                                    NICK
                        Who?

                                    BETH
                        Catherine Tramell.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        She said what you said she'd say.

          She sits up, looks away.  He looks at her, puts his finger on 
          the bite mark idly, gently.  A beat, and he kisses her shoulder 
          gently, then lies back down.

                                    BETH
                        I met her at Berkeley.

          He looks at her.

                                    BETH
                        We were in some of the same classes.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Why didn't you tell me?

          She looks at him.

                                    BETH
                        I'm telling you.

          They look at each other a long beat.

                                    BETH
                               (with difficulty)
                        You've never been... like that...  
                        before.

          He says nothing, looks away from her.

                                    BETH
                        Why?

          He doesn't look at her a long beat, says nothing.

                                    NICK
                        You're the shrink.

          She keeps looking at him.  He won't look at her.

                                    BETH
                        You weren't making love to me.

          A beat; he looks at her.

                                    NICK
                        Who was I making love to?

          She looks at him a long beat.

                                    BETH
                        You weren't making love.

          They look at each other, a long beat, then away.  He lies back 
          down.  Beth doesn't look at him, keeps sitting up.

                                    NICK
                               (finally)
                        I need a cigarette.

                                    BETH
                               (after a beat)
                        I thought you quit.

          He says nothing.

                                    BETH
                        Top drawer in the foyer.
                               (a beat)
                        Get it on your way out.

          He looks at her; she won't look at him.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - MORNING

          He walks in.  He looks hung-over.  He sees Gus with Harrigan 
          and Andrews and Lt. Walker in Lt. Walker's glass-enclosed office 
          at the end of this big room.

          They look at him when they see him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You look like dogshit.

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        He looks a little shrunk, that's 
                        all.

                                    ANDREWS
                               (after a beat)
                        We got a call from Berkeley P.D.
                        There was a killing.  A professor.
                        Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple 
                        stab wounds.  1977.

                                    NICK
                               (a thin smile)
                        She was there, wasn't she?

                                    LT. WALKER
                        University records say she was 
                        there.

          He and Nick look at each other a long beat, then --

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (suddenly)
                        Gus -- go over to Berkeley.
                        Harrigan -- find out what else 
                        she's published.  Andrews -- get 
                        the files on her parents' accident.
                        Carbon Beth on everything.  I want 
                        some psychological input on this 
                        Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is 
                        left there with Gus.

                                    NICK
                        What about me?

                                    GUS
                        You're already gettin' psychological 
                        input, son.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick)
                        Go stick your head in a tub of ice 
                        water.
                               (a beat; then 
                               seriously)
                        See where she leads.

          EXT. THE BEACH HOUSE AT STINSON - DAY

          The black Ferrari is in the driveway.  He sits in an unmarked 
          police car on a hillside above the house, watching.  It is a 
          bleak, leaden gray day.

          Catherine comes out of the house.  She is dressed casually.

          She gets into the Ferrari.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR

          He stays behind her at a safe distance on the winding panoramic 
          highway -- a two-lane mountain road which leads from Stinson 
          Beach into Marin County.

          She suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road, cutting 
          in and out, passing cars very fast.

          He has to start cutting around cars to keep up.  This woman 
          really drives.

          He cuts out and can barely pass a car without hitting a Grey 
          Lines Tour Bus head-on.  Close call: sheer drops on either 
          side.

          He looks frazzled.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR

          He is behind her at a distance on a hilly Mill Valley road -- 
          little streets, terraced hillsides, sharp turns.

          He goes slowly, looks around, thinks he's lost her.  And then 
          he sees the black Ferrari parked in front of a house obscured 
          by hedges.

          He parks the car a distance behind the Ferrari, sits there a 
          long beat.  He gets out, goes carefully up to the hedges, looks.  
          A small, nondescript house.  He watches.  He can't see anything 
          inside the house.

          A beat, he reaches over to the mailbox and opens it.  He takes 
          an envelope out, looks at the name Hazel Dobkins.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT

          He watches as she comes out of the house.  A frail old woman 
          in her 70's is with her.  She hugs the old woman, gets into 
          the Ferrari, STARTS it up.

          He waits a beat and then STARTS after her.  He stays behind 
          her at a distance -- she is going slowly.  And then she suddenly 
          GUNS it, cuts her lights -- her wheels SCREECH.

          He GUNS his car after her.  He makes a turn.  She is gone.

          There is a fork in the road.  He turns one way, goes a few 
          hundred feet.

          Nothing.  Blackness.  He stops.

                                    NICK
                               (quietly)
                        Shit.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT

          He pulls his car up to her house at Stinson Beach.  The black 
          Ferrari is in the driveway.

          A light goes on in an upstairs bedroom.  The curtain is drawn.  
          He sees the outline of her body now.

          She starts to take her clothes off -- there in the window, 
          behind the curtain.  He watches her body as she does an almost 
          languorous strip.  His eyes are intense... ravishing.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT

          He is alone, nobody else in the big room.

          He sits in front of a computer.  We see the screen.  He has 
          punched in

          HAZEL DOBKINS, WF, 145 ALBION RD., MILL VALLEY.

          He is waiting for a response.  We see it come on screen

          NOTHING CURRENT.

          A long beat, as he stares at the screen, and then we see these 
          words

          RELEASED, SAN QUENTIN, JULY 7, 1965.

          We see him type in the words

          PRIOR ARREST RECORD.

          A long beat, and then it comes up

          HOMICIDE, JANUARY 10, 1956 - SAN FRANCISCO

          He stares at the screen a long beat.

                                    GUS
                               (behind him)
                        Ain't you go nothin' better to do 
                        than to come in here and jack off 
                        the damn machine?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; lost 
                               in his thoughts)
                        What are you doing here, Pop?

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        I came in here to jack off the 
                        damn machine.
                               (a beat)
                        One dead psychology professor.
                        Noah Goldstein.  Dr. Noah Goldstein.  
                        And guess what?  He was her 
                        counselor.

          Nick looks at him a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Was she ever suspect?

                                    GUS
                        No, sir.  They never even got a 
                        statement from her.

          Nick sits back a long beat, his eyes off somewhere.

                                    NICK
                               (slowly)
                        Do you remember a case -- 1956 --
                        Hazel Dobkins?

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta 
                        my head for years.  Still can't.  
                        Nice little kids -- nice husband, 
                        wasn't porkin' around -- no 
                        financial problems.  One day -- 
                        outta the clear blue sky -- she 
                        does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a 
                        knife. He got for a wedding present.  
                        Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as 
                        honey.  Said she didn't know why 
                        she done it.

          Nick just stares at him.

          EXT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - NEXT DAY

          He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car.  
          He stands there a beat, thinking.  He walks down to the beach 
          entrance of the house.  He hears a Rolling Stones SONG playing 
          inside.  He stands there.  The door suddenly opens.  Catherine 
          stands there, smiles.  She wears very tight-fitting spandex 
          leotards.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Hi.

          He looks at her a beat, then --

                                    NICK
                        Am I... disturbing you?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  Come in.

          They have their eyes on each other.  A beat, and she turns to 
          go in.

          INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE

          She goes in ahead of him -- he follows her inside.  He watches 
          her body.  His movements are tentative, off-balance.  She turns 
          the Stones DOWN.

          On a table by the window, he sees a word processor.  Spread 
          around it are newspaper clippings.  They are all about him.

          We see the headline on one KILLER COP TO FACE POLICE REVIEW.  
          She sees him glancing at the clips.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'm using you for my detective.  
                        In my book.  You don't mind, do 
                        you?

          She smiles.  He looks at her, expressionless.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Would you like a drink?  I was 
                        just going to have one.

                                    NICK
                        No, thanks.

          She goes to the bar.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        That's right.  You're off the Jack 
                        Daniels too, aren't you?

          She is making herself a drink.  She takes the ice out and then 
          opens a drawer and gets an icepick.  It has a fat wooden end.  
          She uses the icepick on the ice, her back to him.  He watches 
          her.

                                    NICK
                        I'd like to ask you a few more 
                        questions.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'd like to ask you some, too.

          She turns to him, icepick in hand, smiles.

                                    CATHERINE
                        For my book.

          She turns back to the ice, works on it with the pick.  She 
          raises her arm, plunges it.  Raises it, plunges it.  He watches 
          her.

                                    NICK
                               (wary)
                        What kind of questions?

          She puts the icepick down, pours herself a drink, turns to 
          him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        How does it feel to kill someone?

          He looks at her a long beat.

                                    NICK
                               (finally)
                        You tell me.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I don't know.  But you do.

          Their eyes are on each other.

                                    NICK
                               (finally)
                        It was an accident.  They got in 
                        the line of fire.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Four shootings in five years.  All 
                        accidents.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        They were drug buys.  I was a vice 
                        cop.

          A long beat, as they look at each other.

                                    NICK
                        Tell me about Professor Goldstein.

          BEAT.

                                    CATHERINE
                        There's a name from the past.

                                    NICK
                        You want a name from the present?
                        How about Hazel Dobkins?

          She looks at him a long beat, sips her drink, never takes her 
          eyes off him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Noah was my counselor in my freshman 
                        year.
                               (she smiles)
                        That's probably where I got the 
                        idea for the icepick.  For my book.
                        Funny how the subconscious works.
                               (a beat)
                        Hazel is my friend.

                                    NICK
                        She wiped out her whole family.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.  She's helped me understand 
                        homicidal impulse.

                                    NICK
                        Didn't you study it in school?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Only in theory.
                               (she smiles)
                        You know all about homicidal 
                        impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not 
                        in theory -- in practice.

          He stares at her a long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        What happened, Nick?  Did you get 
                        sucked into it? Did you like it 
                        too much?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        No.

          He stares at her, almost horrified.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        Tell me about the coke, Nick.  The 
                        day you shot those two tourists --
                        how much coke did you do?

          She steps closer to him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Tell me, Nick.

          She puts her hand softly on his cheek,  He grabs her hand 
          roughly, holds it.

                                    NICK
                        I didn't.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes, you did.  They never tested 
                        you, did they?  But Internal Affairs 
                        knew.

          They are face to face.  He is still holding her roughly by the 
          hand.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Your wife knew, didn't she?  She 
                        knew what was going on.  Nicky got 
                        too close to the flame.  Nicky 
                        liked it.

          He twists her arm back behind her -- their bodies are pressed 
          against each other -- their eyes digging into each other.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (in a whisper)
                        That's why she killed herself?

          He is twisting her arm, staring at her, pulling her against 
          him.  We hear the DOOR behind them.  A beat, and he lets her 
          go, turns away from her.

          Roxy stands there, staring at them.  Her hair is up.  She wears 
          a black motorcycle jacket, a black T-shirt, and black jeans 
          and cowboy boots.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (brightly)
                        Hiya, hon.  You two have met, 
                        haven't you?

          Roxy looks at Nick.  Catherine goes to her, kisses her briefly 
          on the lips, stands there with her arm around her --both of 
          them looking at Nick.

          He walks by them, opens the door to go, his face a mask.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You're going to make a terrific 
                        character, Nick.

          He doesn't look at her; he's gone.

          INT. BETH GARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY

          He comes in.  He looks like he's going to kill someone.  A 
          RECEPTIONIST sits there.

                                    RECEPTIONIST
                        She's on the phone -- she'll be 
                        right with you, detective --He 
                        sweeps by her into Beth's inner 
                        office.  She hangs up when she 
                        sees the look on his face.

                                    NICK
                        Who has access to my file?

                                    BETH
                        What are you talking about, Nick --
                        what's wrong with you?

                                    NICK
                        Who's got access to my goddamn 
                        file?

          She gets up -- he goes closer to her; she backs away from him.

                                    BETH
                        Nobody.

          He goes closer to her; she backs away.

                                    BETH
                        It's a confidential psychiatric 
                        record, it'd be illegal --She backs 
                        into a wall.  She looks very scared.  
                        He comes very close to her -- puts 
                        an arm behind her to the wall.

                        Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.

          She says nothing, looks scared.

                        No, Nick, please --

                        Who?

                                    BETH
                               (blurts it)
                        Nilsen.

          INT. THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DIVISION - DAY

          He storms into the big room.  He sees MARTY NILSEN.  He is 
          sitting behind his desk in his glass-enclosed office inside 
          this big room.  About a dozen plainclothes policemen are in 
          the big room.  He goes by them into Nilsen's office.

          INT. MARTIN NILSEN'S OFFICE

          He closes the door.  Nilsen sees the look on his face, backs 
          his chair away towards the wall.

                                    NILSEN
                        What do you want, Curran?                                                                     

          He goes to him, picks him up by his lapels, slams him against 
          the wall.

                                    NICK
                               (out of control)
                        You sold her the file, didn't you?

                                    NILSEN
                               (scared)
                        What are you talking about?

                                    NICK
                               (out of control)
                        What'd she pay you?

          He slams him against the wall again.  The glass EXPLODES behind 
          them -- a chair comes into the room.  Nick is frozen, holding 
          Nilsen by the throat against the wall.

                                    ONE OF THE I.A. GUYS
                        Let him go, Curran.  Nice and easy.

          He looks back, sees two Internal Affairs men with their guns 
          drawn, pointed at him.  A beat, and he lets Nilsen go.  He 
          turns calmly and starts to walk out.

                                    NILSEN
                        You're on sick leave, Shooter.  As 
                        of right now.  Pending the outcome

          EXT. THE POLICE PARKING LOT - DUSK

          He gets into his old Porsche.  He STARTS the car up.  Gus Moran 
          comes up to the window.  They look at each other a

                                    GUS

          They look at each other a long beat.

                        No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke 
                        off yonder on the horizon.  They're 
                        gonna want your badge.

                        You sure got real conclusive ways 
                        of demonstrating that.

          They almost smile at each other, then --

                               (almost to himself)

          A beat, and then Nick looks at him.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He sits in front of the TV, watching a lame sitcom.  A bottle 
          of Jack Daniels is half-empty in front of him.  He is smoking 
          a cigarette.

                                    BETH
                               (behind him)
                        I still have my key.

          He looks at her, looks away at the sitcom.

                                    NICK
                        I don't want to see you, Beth.

          He keeps watching the sitcom.  A long beat.

                                    BETH
                               (suddenly angry)
                        Damnit!  Don't shut me out!  You 
                        owe me more than that?

          He goes to the TV, shuts it off.

                                    NICK
                        I don't owe you anything; you don't 
                        owe me anything.
                               (he looks at her)
                        We went to bed -- what was it? --
                        ten or fifteen times?
                               (he smiles)
                        It wasn't memorable enough to carry 
                        any obligations.

                                    BETH
                               (after a long beat)
                        Sometimes I really hate you.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        Yeah?  Well why don't you find 
                        some friendly therapist and work 
                        some of that hostility out.

                        But take my advice.  Put a little 
                        more life into it than you usually 
                        do.

          A beat, and she suddenly hurls herself at him in absolute fury, 
          trying to claw at his face.  He grabs her, blocks her.  They 
          look at each other a long beat and then he lets her go.

          The emotion of the moment is gone now -- they turn away from 
          each other.

                                    BETH
                               (finally)

                        act like that.

          Nick looks at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                        How could you let him have my file, 
                        Beth?

          A long beat, then --

                                    BETH
                               (not looking at him)
                        He was going to recommend your 
                        discharge a behavioral disability.  
                        I made a deal with him.  He could 
                        review the session notes himself.  
                        It was the only way I could keep 
                        you on the force.

          She looks at him.  He looks away from her.

                                    NICK
                        You did it for me.

                                    BETH
                        Yes.  I care about you.  I did it 
                        for you.

          He turns away from her.

                                    NICK
                               (quietly)

                               (a beat)
                        Please?

          He goes to the Jack Daniel's, pours some more.  She looks at 
          him pour it and turns to go.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He is asleep on the couch -- the TV is on to a blank screen.  
          The Jack Daniel's is mostly gone.  The phone on the coffee 
          table RINGS.  It RINGS again.  He wakes, picks it up, listens.

                                    NICK
                        Yeah.
                               (a beat)
                        Okay.

          He hangs it up.  He sits there a long beat, staring.  He looks 
          disturbed.

          EXT. THE ALLEY BEHIND THE TEN-FOUR BAR - NIGHT

          He walks down the alley.  There are lots of police cars, 
          flashing lights, uniformed men, coroner's men.

          As he walks down the alley, he sees Lt. Walker, Gus, and several 
          of the Internal Affairs men we saw earlier in Nilsen's office.  
          They are standing around a Lincoln Town Car.

          They look at him as he comes closer to them -- then move aside.

          He can see into the car now.  Martin Nilsen lies against the 
          front seat.  He has been shot in the head.  Nick stares.

                                    GUS
                        One shot.  Close range.  Probably 
                        a .38 caliber revolver.

          Nick stares at Nilsen's body.  They watch him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Give me your gun, Nick.

          A beat, and then Nick gives him his gun.  Walker smells it, 
          shakes his head, gives it to one of the Internal Affairs men.

                                    NICK
                               (to Walker)
                        You think I --

                                    GUS
                        I don't son, but I got the minority 
                        opinion.

          INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          He sits in the same room that Catherine sat in --surrounded by 
          four or five Internal Affairs men, Lt.

          Walker, Gus, and Captain Talcott.  Lt. Walker and Gus sort of 
          sit back -- I.A. is running the investigation.  The same police 
          stenographer -- the same plain young woman -- is sitting in 
          the room who was there with Catherine.

                                    NICK
                        Okay.  I went after him.  I lost 
                        my temper.

                        Do you have any evidence that he 
                        showed your psychiatric file to 
                        anyone?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        No.

          Beth Gardner comes into the room.  They look at her.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        We'll speak to you afterwards, Dr.
                        Gardner.

          Nick gives her a look.

                                    BETH
                        I'd like to sit-in if you don't 
                        mind.

                                    THE I.A. MAN
                        I'd really rather --

                                    TALCOTT
                        I don't see anything wrong with 
                        Dr. Gardner sitting-in if Detective 
                        Curran doesn't object.

          Nick looks at her, shrugs.

                        I saw Detective Curran at his 
                        apartment around ten o'clock.  He 
                        was sober and lucid.  I asked him 
                        in my capacity as his departmental 
                        therapist about his altercation 
                        with Lt. Nilsen.  He expressed 
                        regret and displayed no hostility.

                        About fifteen minutes.  I saw there 
                        was no reason for my concern and 
                        left.

          She and Nick look at each other.  He looks away and lights a 
          cigarette.

                        There's no smoking in this building.

                        What are you gonna do -- charge me 
                        with smoking?

          It is the exact line that Catherine used.  A long beat.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the 
                        record did you kill him?

                                    NICK
                        No.

          They look at him a beat.

                        in the afternoon and then that 
                        night I'm going to kill him?  I'd 
                        have to be really dumb to do that.

                        Going after him before gets you

                        your alibi.

                        a guy gets you off the hook for 
                        killing him.

          She stops.  He catches up to her.  They walk down the flights 
          together.  They speak quietly.

                                    NICK
                        Thank you.

          She looks at him, smiles.  They keep walking down the steps.

          Only Andrews is in the room.  We see Lt. Walker sitting in his 
          glass-enclosed office.

          He closes the duffel bag, looks at the place a long beat.

          Andrews is watching him.  He goes up to Andrews

                        previous repairs.  There was a

          Lt. Walker looks at him a long beat.

          It is in the Marina District; on a street like Cervantes.

          She is sitting on the front stoop.  She wears an Indian jacket, 
          jeans and a T-shirt.  He goes up to her. She looks at him a

          They start walking inside.  She walks ahead of him.  He watches 
          her.  She turns suddenly.

          They walk in.  She looks at the bareness of the place.

                        You should put some warmth into

                        on your personality.

          She turns, smiles at him.  He looks at the bottle of Jack 
          Daniel's; there's not much left.

          There is a palpable tension between them.

          He takes the ice out, opens a drawer, takes out an icepick.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Let me do that.  You like to watch 
                        me doing it, don't you?

          She smiles; a beat and he hands her the icepick.  She takes 
          it, starts to us the icepick, her back to him.  He lights a 
          cigarette.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Can I have a cigarette, please?  I 
                        told you you'd start smoking again.

          He watches her working on the ice.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Light it for me, will you?

          He does, steps to her.  She parts her lips -- he puts it on 
          her lip, watches it.  Their eyes are on each other.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Thank you.

          She works on the ice again, opens the cabinets for glasses.

          They look at each other a long beat, their eyes very involved.

          A beat, and she suddenly turns away.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (brightly)
                        I brought you something.

          She goes to her purse, takes a paperback book out of it.  We 
          see it -- The First Time, by Catherine Smith.  He looks at it.

                                    CATHERINE

                        like an accident.

          He stares at her.  A long beat, then --

                        No.  I wrote it years afterwards.

          He watches her; she has turned away from him -- and then she 
          turns back to him in a different mood.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY

          As she is going down the stairs, Gus Moran is coming up.

          He does a real double-take as he goes by her.

          He looks at him a long beat, and he goes upstairs, into Nick's 
          apartment.

          INT. NICK'S APARTMENT

          Nick stands at the window, watching her outside.  A long beat, 
          and he looks at Gus.

                                    GUS

                        but why is it that you've got your

                        I know what that's like.

          INT. JOHNNY BOZ'S CLUB - NIGHT

          It is dark, cavernous there are a thousand people in here.  
          The MUSIC is ear-splitting, pulsing.  Lights flash.

          The floor is huge.  At one time, this club was a church.

          He walks around the sides, a drink in his hand, looking for 
          her.  He doesn't see her.

          The he catches a glimpse of Roxy.  She is dancing with another 
          woman.  He watches her.  She is wearing pants and a jacket, 
          her hair off to the side.  She looks very masculine tonight.

          Roxy laughs at the other woman, leaves her on the floor, starts 
          moving through the sea of dancers.  He follows her through the 
          press of bodies.  She goes towards the men's room.  She walks 
          in.

          INT. THE MEN'S ROOM

          It is large, dark, shadowy It was once the sacristy.

          A crowd scene men and women. Roxy presses through them.

          A haze of crack smoke; we see people doing poppers.

          She opens the door to a toilet stall, walks in.  Nick is behind 
          her.  As the door opens, he sees Catherine.

          She wears a black motorcycle jacket, a very short skirt, 
          stiletto heels.  Her hair is up.  He make-up is severe,  In 
          the darkness, in the shadows she looks about 19.  A hot 19.

          A hot flash-trash 19.

          She is in there with two men -- one of them is a big, body-
          built black guy.  She has a vial of something near her face.

          She sees Nick watching her.  She whispers something to the 
          tall black guy.  He looks at Nick, smiles a condescending smile.  
          The door to the stall closes

          INT. THE CLUB

          He is walking along the side, watching the floor, a drink in 
          his hand.  The song ends and it seques right into the Stones's 
          "Miss You."

          He sees her.  Her black leather jacket is off.

          She wears a very tight, flimsy top, the short skirt, the heels.  
          She is dancing with Roxy and the black guy.  He watches her 
          move... watches her body.

          She turns, sees him, dances, watches him... gets between Roxy 
          and the black guy... they sandwich her with their bodies... 
          keeps moving, turning... eyes on him... playing to him with 
          her body.  He watches.

          A long beat, and he goes up to them.  His movements are

          almost trance-like.  They look at each other.  A long beat.

          Catherine stops dancing.  he reaches for her.  She moves away.  
          A beat their eyes are on each other.  She moves a step towards 
          her.  A beat, as they look at each other...  and they start to 
          move together.

          Their eyes are on each other as they move, the eyes burning... 
          the movements tighter, hotter... and he suddenly grabs her and 
          kisses her... as they keep moving... the song seques into the 
          Stones's "Gimme Shelter."

          She is melting into him now, kissing him... Tex watches, 
          expressionless... the black guy is gone... he holds her by the 
          back of the neck, kissing her... their bodies pressed into 
          each other... his hands are on her butt now, pulling her into 
          him now, almost holding her up now... and then under her skirt, 
          under her panties... as he kisses her neck.

          People around them stare... he moves his hands under her top 
          as she keeps moving with the song, her head back, her back 
          almost arching... cups her breasts now... she keeps moving...  
          the song sweeping them into its rhythm "it's just a shot away, 
          it's just a kiss away, a kiss away..."

          They devour each other.  Right there on the floor.  Barely 
          able to hold it back.  As Tex watches expressionless.  As people 
          stop dancing and stare.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM

          It is dark.  We can't see clearly.  A side table, lines of 
          cocaine on a small mirror.  A CD player The Stones play "Love 
          In Vain."

          There are mirrors all over the walls and ceiling.  They are in 
          bed.  The bed is big and brass.

          Atop her... he kisses her neck... his hands under her, raising 
          her... he moves down, kisses her breasts... puts his mouth 
          around  a breast... she arches, moves... he kisses her 
          shoulder... biting into it... she opens her mouth... we hear 
          no cry... we hear the Stones.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Monkey Man."

          Atop him... she kisses his chest, licks it, lowers her head... 
          lower... lower... he arches his back... her mouth comes up... 
          her mouth on his lips again... he turns her.

          Atop her... he moves her legs apart... (the CAMERA is behind 
          them)... she holds his back... digs in her nails...  rakes his 
          back with them... digs in again... his back bleeds... he moves 
          inside her... harder... the nails dig...  blood trickles down 
          his back.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Wild Horses."

          He is behind her... she is on her stomach... he rises her by 
          her hips... kisses her back... races her spine with his 
          tongue... traces her lower back... he kneels... moves into 
          her... kisses her neck... his fingers are in her mouth...  as 
          he moves.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Sympathy for the Devil."

          Atop him... she leans close over his face, her tongue in his 
          mouth... kneeling over him... she moves his arms above his 
          head... moves higher atop him... her breasts in his face... 
          she reaches over to the side... a white silk scarf is in her 
          hand... she moves higher above him... kneeling over his face... 
          moving oh-so-slightly... his face strains towards her.

          The scarf in both hands now... she starts to tie his hands 
          with it... his eyes are open, watching her... she ties it 
          loosely, gently... it isn't tight... but his hands are tied to 
          the brass bed.

          She kisses him... moving her hips lower now... over his chest... 
          lower...

          And he is inside her... her arms above him... his eyes open... 
          she kisses his neck... bites but not hard...  moves... grinding 
          hard against him now.. she is on her knees... head arches back.. 
          her breasts high.. still grinding.

          Her back arches, strains... he strains toward her... she holds 
          her arms high... she comes out of the arch...  shivering... 
          falling over him... the scarf loosens... his arms come forward 
          and hold her close.. closer... closer...  as she moves with 
          slight... shivery... movements.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          It is dark, quiet.  Pindrop quiet.  He is sitting on the side 
          of the bed, his head down... his back a line tracing of dried 
          blood.  She is asleep nest to him, naked.

          He looks around the room.  The white scarf around the bedpost... 
          the coke on the side-table... clothes all over the floor.

          He gets up, walks into the bathroom.

          INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          The light is too bright.  He looks at himself in the mirror.  
          He pours the water, lowers his head, puts cold water on his 
          face.  A long beat, he comes back up, opens his eyes.  Roxy is 
          in the mirror behind him.  She startles him.

          He looks at her in the mirror a long beat, doesn't turn.

          She is expressionless; she wears the same thing she wore at 
          the club.

          He lowers down into the basin again, puts more water on his 
          face, comes back up, uses a towel this time, finishes with the 
          towel.  She is still looking at him in the mirror the same 
          way.  He looks at her in the mirror, doesn't turn.

                                    ROXY
                               (quietly)
                        If you don't leave her alone, I'll 
                        kill you.

          He looks at her a beat, then turns --

                                    NICK
                        Tell me something, Rocki.  Man-to-
                        man.
                               (he smiles)
                        I think she's the fuck of the 
                        century, don't you?

          For a second, she looks like she's going to spring at him, 
          then controls it and turns to go.

                                    NICK
                        How long you been here, Rock?  You 
                        like to watch, do you?

                                    ROXY
                               (after a beat, looks 
                               at him)
                        She likes me to watch.

          And she turns and she is gone.

          INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          He lies on the bed in the dark, quiet room.  He is on his back, 
          his eyes open.  He has his arm around her.  She is asleep.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (murmurs)
                        Nicky.

          He looks at her.

          INT. HER BEDROOM - MORNING

          He wakes up.  She is not there.  He looks around.  The white 
          scarf is gone.  The coke on the side table is gone.

          In its place, a scrawled note "The Beach -- C."

          EXT. HER STINSON BEACH HOUSE - DAY

          A cold and foggy day.  He gets out of his old Porsche, walks 
          down the driveway.  He sees her out on the beach by the water.  
          A small bonfire is near her.  He walks towards her.

          Roxy watches him, expressionless, from an upstairs window of 
          the house.  He doesn't see her.

          He walks up to Catherine.  She has an Indian blanket over her 
          and is wearing a black felt English derby hat, her hair loose 
          underneath.

                                    NICK

                        'Morning.

          She doesn't look at him -- he smiles slowly.  She doesn't smile 
          and she doesn't seem to like his smile, either.  She walks 
          along the beach.  He walks with her.  A long beat.

                                    NICK
                        I think Roxy got jealous.

          She looks at him.  He looks like he is trying to hide a smile.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        She's seen me fuck plenty of other 
                        guys.

          That wipes the hidden smile off his face.  He looks at her, 
          walks with her.  A long beat.

                                    NICK
                        Maybe she saw something she didn't 
                        see before.

                                    CATHERINE
                        She's seen everything before.

          She looks at him; he's smiling now.

                                    NICK
                        She's never seen us before.

          He's serious.  She looks at him.  She smiles slowly.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Did you think it was so special?

                        I told her it was the fuck of the 
                        century.

          He can't hide his smile anymore.  She says nothing, keeps 
          walking.

                        I thought it was a pretty good 
                        beginning.

          They look at each other.  They keep walking.  A long beat.

                                    NICK
                        How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to 
                        the century, too?

          He looks at her: she's serious.

                        I didn't mean for me -- I meant 
                        for you.

          She looks at him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'm not as judgmental about women 
                        as I am about men.

                        It hurts.

          She stops, looks at him.  A long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Not unless you confuse my character

                        see you around, Shooter.

          A beat, and she walks away towards the house.  He watches her.

          INT. A COUNTRY AND WESTERN BAR - NIGHT

          Nick walks in.  Waylon Jennings is on the JUKEBOX.  Gus is 
          sitting at the bar wearing jeans, a cowboy shirt, and a cowboy 
          hat.

          Nick goes, sits next to him.

          It gets some looks from the other people in her -- Nick shushes 
          him, pours him more coffee.  He drinks it.

                        goddamn tourists where they goddamn 
                        came from.

          Some people here really give him the looks now.  Gus looks 
          angrily away from them, drinks more coffee.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; 
                               quietly)
                        I'm not afraid of her.

                                    GUS
                               (loud)
                        Why the hell not?

                                    NICK
                        I don't know.  I'm just not.

                                    GUS
                               (loud)
                        That's her pussy talkin' --He gets 
                        a real nasty look from a very fat 
                        woman eating a cheeseburger.  He 
                        winks at her.  The woman looks 
                        away from him, shaking her head.

                                    GUS
                               (smiles; to Nick)
                        It ain't your brain.

          They look at each other a long beat.  Gus drinks more coffee.  
          He sits back, pulls his cowboy hat over his eyes.

          A long beat.

                                    GUS
                               (quietly)
                        I.A. done did a track on Lt. Martin 
                        D for Dickhead Nilsen.  They found 
                        a safety deposit box with fifty-
                        thousand dollars in it, taken out 
                        three months ago, used that one 
                        time.

          He looks at the fat woman again -- leers at her obscenely.

          She looks away.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        It doesn't make sense.  She didn't 
                        know me three months ago.

                                    GUS
                        Maybe it wasn't her that paid him.
                        Maybe the money was for somethin' 
                        else.  How the fuck do I know?  
                        I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' 
                        not to fall outta his saddle.

          Nick looks at him and smiles a thin smile; he's not there, 
          he's completely preoccupied.

          INT. A CAR - NIGHT

          Someone is watching as he and Gus come out of the diner.

          EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

          He stands by Gus as Gus gets into his battered, rusted, vintage 
          Cadillac.

                                    NICK
                        You all right, pop?  You want me 
                        to drive you?

                                    GUS
                        In that little pissant car of yours?  
                        Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back 
                        pain disability retirement -- I'm 
                        gettin' me a full pension and a 
                        real gold-plate Seiko watch.

                                    NICK
                        Come on, I'll drive you in this 
                        thing.                                                                     

                                    GUS
                        You think I'd let you drive my 
                        Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no 
                        hear-up-his-ass person drive my 
                        Cadillac car.

          And he steps on the gas and ROARS out of there, forcing Nick 
          to get out of the way.  Nick looks after him a long beat, shakes 
          his head.

          INT. A CAR - NIGHT

          Someone is following him slowly as he walks down the street.  
          He turns a corner, walks down the alley towards his Porsche, 
          parked behind the country and western bar.

          The car suddenly speeds up -- ROARS down on him from the back, 
          full bore.

          EXT. THE ALLEY

          He hurls himself across the Porsche's hood... barely avoiding 
          the car.  He sees the car at the end of the alley, turning out 
          It is a black Ferrari.

          INT. HIS PORSCHE

          He GUNS it down the alley, makes a wild turn in the direction 
          the Ferrari turned.

          EXT. THE STREET

          The Porsche dodges around cars very fast, almost side-swiping 
          them, looking almost out of control, its MOTOR screaming.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          He sees the Ferrari turn ahead.  When he gets to where it 
          turned, he turns wildly.

          EXT. THE STREET

          The Ferrari is making fast, wild turns into little streets in 
          North Beach, its MOTOR screaming -- the Porsche is gaining 
          ground behind it, making turns.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          The Ferrari is up ahead and makes a wild right turn onto a 
          road going up a hillside.  He yanks the wheel hard.

          EXT. THE STEPS

          The Porsche rockets up the steps -- bouncing high into the 
          air, almost out of control.                                                                     

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          As it crests the steps and gets to the street.  Nick GUNS it 
          and it looks like it flies high down the hill-side into 
          blackness.

          EXT. THE STREET

          But it lands on more steps -- heading downward -- bucking, 
          almost spinning, it bounces onto the next street.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          Another set of steps leading up he GUNS it, it rockets up, 
          ROARS, bucking --

          EXT. THE STREET

          And lands on the next street.  Nick makes a wild right turn 
          onto the street.  And the black Ferrari appears from around a 
          curve to the right, heading right for him.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          Nick steps on the GAS and heads head-on for the Ferrari.

          The Ferrari SCREAMS head-on for him.

          EXT. THE STREET

          And at the last moment, in the game of chicken, the Ferrari 
          tries to swerve around him on this narrow road, goes out of 
          control and over the side, turning over and over as it rolls 
          down the hillside.

          EXT. THE HILLSIDE

          The Ferrari has landed right-side up.

          He runs down the hillside and gets to it.  A beat, and he opens 
          the car door.

          Roxy lies hunched over the wheel, her eyes open.  Her neck is 
          broken.  She is dead.

          EXT. THE HILLSIDE - NIGHT

          Police lights have been set up.  He stands there with Lt.  
          Walker and several of the Internal Affairs men.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Tell me again.  I want to hear you 
                        say it again.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; 
                               sheepish)
                        It was an accident.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You're driving around North Beach 
                        for no particular reason and this 
                        car won't get out of the way --

                                    NICK
                        I don't think she meant to go off 
                        the hill, do you?

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (quietly)
                        Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't 
                        need a reason to put your ass in a 
                        sling.

          He and Nick look at each other a long beat.  Andrews comes up 
          to them with a piece of paper in his hand.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Full name, Roxanne Hardy.  Last 
                        address -- Cloverdale, California.  
                        No priors, no convictions.  The 
                        car is registered to Catherine 
                        Tramell.

          Lt. Walker looks at Nick like he's going to kill him.  Nick 
          looks calmly away.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You knew her, didn't you?

                                    NICK
                        Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's 
                        house.  All we did was write her 
                        name down.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a beat)
                        I told you to stay away from 
                        Tramell.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; smiles)
                        Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to 
                        stay away from her car.

          Walker looks at him in absolute disbelief.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        I want you in Dr. Gardner's office 
                        at nine o'clock.  You're out of 
                        control, Curran.

                                    NICK
                               (to the I.A. Man)
                        Who are you guys gonna sell my 
                        file to this time?

          They stare at him.  He watches as Roxy's body is taken away.

          INT. A POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM -DAY

          He walks in.  He looks good, in control.  Beth Gardner is 
          sitting there with two middle-aged MEN, both of them wearing 
          suits, who smile and scrutinize him the instant he walks in 
          the door.

                                    BETH
                        Hello, Nick.  This is Dr. Myron 
                        and R. McElwaine.  They've been 
                        asked to consult with me on this 
                        evaluation.

          They shake hands with him.

                                    DR. MYRON
                        Sit down, Nick.

          Nick gives him a look: What did he think he was going to do -- 
          stand there?

          He sits down, looks at them.  A beat, as they look at him, 
          then --

                                    DR. MCELWAINE
                               (courtly)
                        Nick -- when you recollect your 
                        childhood, are your recollections 
                        pleasing to you?

          Nick looks at them a long beat in disbelief.

                                    NICK
                               (calmly, directly)
                        Number one I don't remember how 
                        often I used to jack off, but it 
                        was a lot.  Number two I didn't 
                        get pissed off at my dad -- even 
                        after I was old enough to know 
                        what he and mom were doing in the 
                        bedroom.  Number three I don't 
                        look in the toilet before I flush 
                        it.  Number four I don't wet the 
                        bed and haven't for some time.
                        Number five You can go fuck 
                        yourselves because I'm out of here.

          INT. THE CORRIDOR

          He is walking away quickly.  Beth is with him, trying to keep 
          up.  She is very angry.

                                    BETH
                        What is your problem?  I'm trying 
                        to help you.  Why won't you let me 
                        help you?

                                    NICK
                        I don't need any help.

                                    BETH
                        Yes you do.  Something's on with 
                        you.
                               (a beat)
                        You're sleeping with her, aren't 
                        you?

          A beat, he stops looks at her, then keeps walking.

                                    NICK
                        What is this interest you've got 
                        in her?

                                    BETH
                        My interest is in you, not in her.
                        She seduces people, she manipulates --

                                    NICK
                        I thought you hardly know her.

                                    BETH
                        I know the type.  I'm a 
                        psychologist.

          He stops, looks at her.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        That means you manipulate people 
                        too, doesn't it, Beth?  You're a 
                        practicing psychologist -- that 
                        means you're better at it than she 
                        is.

          She looks at him a long beat.

                                    BETH
                               (quietly)
                        I feel sorry for you, Nick.

          A beat, and she turns and walks away.

          EXT. ROAD TO STINSON HOUSE - DAY

          Nick is driving down winding road to Stinson house.  He is 
          driving very fast, passing other cars on the winding and 
          twisting road.

          INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - DAY

          Nick enters and shuts door.  Looking around, he does not see

                        I should have known.  I came into 
                        the house when you were down on

          Nick looks at him.

          INT. THE REGISTRAR'S OFFICE - U.C. BERKELEY

          A young woman is checking a computer.  Nick is with her.

                                    THE WOMAN
                        Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm 
                        sorry.  No Lisa.

                                    NICK
                        Did you check all four years?

                                    THE WOMAN
                        Yes I did.

                                    NICK
                               (in disbelief)
                        Can you check again?

          She gives him a look, but punches it in again.

                                    THE WOMAN
                        No Lisa Anderson, detective.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Can there be some mistake?

                        Only if you're making it.

          He looks at her.

          EXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE ON DIVISADERO - DAY

          He gets out of the Porsche, starts to go in.  He looks disturbed 
          Catherine comes out of the house with Hazel Dobkins, the old 
          woman we saw with her in Mill Valley.  Nick watches them a 
          beat, then goes up to them.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Hazel , this is Nick.  I told you 
                        all about him.  This is Hazel 
                        Dobkins.

                        You're the Shooter, aren't you?
                        How are you?

          He looks at her a long beat.

                                    NICK
                        Fine.  Thank you.

          He looks at her sort of warily.

                                    NICK
                               ( to Catherine)
                        Can I talk to you a minute?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (to Hazel)
                        Honey, why don't you go in the 
                        car?  I'll be right there.

          The old woman starts going to the Ferrari.

                                    HAZEL
                               (brightly)
                        Goodbye, Shooter.

          Nick looks at Hazel a beat, then at Catherine.

                                    NICK
                        You like to hang out with murderers 
                        or what?  Did you know Roxy --

                                    CATHERINE
                        Of course I knew.

          He looks at her a long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (casually)
                        Look.  Sometimes when I do my 
                        research, I get involved with 
                        people.  It happened with you, 
                        too.

          She smiles.  He looks at her, doesn't know what to say.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Killing isn't like smoking.  You 
                        can quit.

          He looks at her What did she say?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (preoccupied)
                        I've go to go.  I promised to get 
                        her home by six o'clock.  She just 
                        loves "America's Most Wanted."

          America's Most Wanted?  She turns to go.

                                    NICK
                        There was no Lisa Anderson at 
                        Berkeley when you were there.

          She stops, looks at him a beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                        What were you doing, checking up 
                        on me?  What for?

          He says nothing.  A long beat, she looks hurt.

                                    CATHERINE

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT

          He sits in front of a computer screen with Andrews.

                                    ANDREWS
                        I can get my butt kicked for this.

                        It's not gonna take long, Sam.

          We see the computer screen.  The screen says LISA HENDERSON  
          DMV LICENSE CHECK We wait and then we see the words 1983 RENEWAL -- 
          ELIZABETH GARDNER, 147 QUEENSTON DRIVE, SALINAS, CAL.

          Nick stares at the screen.

                                    NICK
                        Bring it up, will you, Sam?

          A beat, and then we see the license itself It is Beth Gardner 
          on the photo.  Nick stares.

                                    ANDREWS

          A beat, and the license comes up.  We see a young Beth Gardner 
          on the photo.  She has blonde hair.

          Nick stares.

                        You shouldn't leave your door open.

                        my lock.

          A beat, she looks at him.

                                    BETH

                        I slept with her once in school.

                        I was just a kid.  I was 
                        experimenting.  It was just that 
                        one time.

                        She developed a... fixation... on 
                        me.  She styled her hair like mine.  
                        She wore the same kind of clothes 
                        I did.  It scared me.

          She looks at him, sees his look.

                                    BETH
                        Isn't that what she told you?

                        She told me it was you.  You wore

                        dyed your hair blonde.

          A long beat as they look at each other.

                                    BETH
                        I did dye my hair.  It didn't have 
                        anything to do with her.  I was a 
                        redhead for a while, too.

                        knows I knew Noah.  She makes up 
                        that story about me.  She's handing 
                        you somebody who's obsessed with

                        She didn't hand you to me.  She

                        She knew you'd find out who Lisa 
                        Henderson is.  You're a good cop --
                        what did she do?  Tell you casually 
                        and make it seem irrelevant?
                               (she smiles)
                        Did she tell you in bed, Nick?
                        That's how I'd do it.

                        She told me it was backwards -- 
                        she said you even styled your hair 
                        the way she did.

          Catherine looks at him a beat, then smiles.

                        And you believed her?  I even went 
                        down to the campus  police and 
                        made out a report about her.

          He just looks at her.

          EXT. HER HOUSE IN STINSON - AFTERNOON

          He walks around the house; he sees her sitting out on the deck, 
          a portable word-processor in front of her.  She is smoking.

          He goes up to her.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        Hi.  I missed you.  I finished my 
                        research.

          He moves toward her.  She moves away, kills her cigarette.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I finished my book.

                                    NICK
                        How did it end?

                               (after a beat)
                        I told you.  She kills him.

          They look at each other a long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        Goodbye, Nick.

          He stares at her.  A long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I finished my book.

                        What do you want, Nick?  Flowers?  
                        I'll send you some flowers.

                        Are we playing games again?

                        The games are over.  You were right.  
                        It was the fuck of the century, 
                        Shooter.

          He stares at her.

                                    A VOICE INSIDE
                        Catherine?

          Nick looks -- Hazel Dobkins is there.

          Catherine still has her eyes on him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Right there.

          A beat, and then she turns to go inside.  Hazel Dobkins smiles 
          slowly at him.

          EXT. THE POLICE PARKING LOT - DUSK

          He sits in his Porsche, staring ahead.  He is parked next to 
          Gus' Cadillac.  Gus is suddenly there, onway to his car.

                                    GUS
                               (excited)
                        Catherine Tramell's roommate her 
                        freshman year.  I got a call from 
                        her.  I've been calling people who 
                        were in her dorm all day.  She 
                        must've heard I was trying to talk 
                        to her.  She says she knows all 
                        about Catherine and Lisa Henderson.  
                        She's over in Oakland.  You wanna 
                        come with me?

          Nick just stares ahead.

                                    GUS
                        You look like you seen a ghost, 
                        son?

          Nick looks at him.

          INT. GUS' CADILLAC - NIGHT

          Gus drives.

                                    GUS
                               (excited)
                        Johnny Boz's psychiatrist has an 
                        office on Van Ness.  Guess who he 
                        shares office space with?  Dr.  
                        Elizabeth Gardner.

          Nick doesn't even respond.  Gus looks at him.

                                    GUS
                        What in hell's the matter with 
                        you?

          Nick doesn't say anything, stares ahead.

          EXT. AN OFFICE BUILDING - OAKLAND - NIGHT

          Gus gets out with Nick.  It is an old building.

                                    GUS
                        Where the hell you goin'?

                               (after a beat)
                        I'm going with you.

                                    GUS
                        She said alone -- suite 405.  It 
                        ain't gonna take long.

          A beat, and Nick gets back in the car.

          INT. THE OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

          Gus is on the first floor.  There is no one around.  He hits 
          the elevator button.  A beat, and it comes.  He steps in.

          INT. THE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          He hits the button for the fourth floor.

          The elevator rises a floor, stops.  The door opens.  There is 
          no one there.  Then it starts going up again.  It rises to the 
          third floor.  It stops.  The door opens.  There is no one there.  
          Then it starts to rise again.

          EXT. GUS' CADILLAC - NIGHT

          Nick sits there, staring ahead.

                                    NICK
                               (suddenly, screaming)
                        Gus!

          INT. THE ELEVATOR

          As it goes up.  It stops.  The door starts to open.  As it 
          does -- a figure in a hooded raincoat sweeps into the elevator.  
          It happens very fast.  We see blonde hair around the face.

          But we don't see the face itself -- the head is down, the hood 
          up.  There is an icepick in the figure's hand.  The figure 
          explodes into Gus.  The icepick goes into his neck.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY

          Nick tears desperately up the stairway -- he hits the fourth 
          floor door.  It explodes open.

          INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR

          He stands there a beat, sees the elevator door open.  He runs 
          there,  He sees Gus, crumpled into the corner of the elevator.

          INT. THE ELEVATOR

          He goes into the elevator -- holds Gus.  He is dead.  A long 
          beat.  He sees the gun in Gus' hand -- he takes the gun out of 
          his hand.  He runs out of the elevator.

          INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR

          He hears something.  Gun in hand, he runs towards the SOUND.  
          He stops, gun in hand, listens again.  He runs again, hears 
          nothing.

          Behind him, we see a figure.

          He spins suddenly, gun, in hand.  Beth Gardner is there.

          She wears a windbreaker.  She has her hands in the pockets.

                                    BETH
                        What are you doing here?

                                    NICK
                               (screaming)
                        Put your hands up!

          She stares at him.

                                    NICK
                               (screams)
                        Put your fucking hands up!  Don't 
                        move.

                                    BETH
                        I got a message on my machine to 
                        meet Gus here.  Where is he?

          She smiles a strange smile.  She takes a step toward him.

                                    NICK
                               (screams)
                        Don't!
                               (a beat)
                        I know about your husband.  You 
                        still like girls, Beth?

                                    BETH
                        What?

          She smiles strangely again, takes a step toward him.

                                    NICK
                               (screams)
                        Take your hands out of your pockets!

          She moves a hand in a pocket and moves towards him fast --

                                    BETH
                        What is wrong with you?

          And he FIRES the gun.  She is hit in the chest, goes down.

          A long beat, and then he goes to her.  He gets down on the 
          ground.  Her eyes are open.  He empties the pockets of the 
          windbreaker -- first one, then the other the pockets are empty.

                                    BETH
                               (in a whisper)
                        I loved you.

          And she dies.

          INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR - LATER

          A lot of policemen, coroner's guys, photos being taken.

          Nick stands there with Lt. Walker, Harrigan, and some of the 
          Internal Affairs guys.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (upset)
                        What made you think she had a gun?

          Nick says nothing; he looks like a zombie.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        What the hell was she doing here?  
                        What was Gus doing here?  

          Andrews yells to them from the stairway door.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Lieutenant.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY

          A FORENSICS MAN very carefully handles a hooded rain coat in a 
          stair landing.  He wears gloves.

          Nick is there with Lt. Walker.

          The Forensics Man picks the raincoat up -- a long blonde wig 
          falls out of it.  There are flecks of blood on it.

          He reaches into the pocket and pulls out an  icepick.  It has 
          a thin steel handle and is bloody.  He hands the icepick to an 
          assistant.

          He looks at the raincoat.  It has blood on it.

                                    THE FORENSICS MAN
                        It's departmental issue.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (quietly)
                        Jesus.

          INT. BETH GARDNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Nick with Lt. Walker.  Nick looks like a zombie.  Andrews comes 
          up to them.  He has a gun in his hands.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Thirty-eight caliber revolver.

          Bottom drawer, bureau in the bedroom.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Have  ballistics check it for 
                        Nilsen.

          Harrigan comes out.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        Lieutenant, you'd better come in 
                        here.

          Lt. Walker goes into the kitchen.  Nick follows him.

          There are several cops around a kitchen cabinet.  A drawer is 
          open.

          Walker looks -- we look with him.  We see a copy of Love hurts, 
          Catherine's paperback book, and a stack of photos of Catherine.

          Walker picks the photos up, goes through them -- we see shots 
          of Catherine in college -- Catherine at a fight --Catherine 
          with Johnny Boz -- Catherine with Roxy.

          He hands the photos to Nick.

          Nick stares at them.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        I guess that's it.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT

          Nick sits, his feet up.  He looks like a zombie.  With him are 
          Lt. Walker, Andrews, and Captain Talcott.  We see other 
          plainclothesmen in the b.g. -- a flurry of activity, people on 
          phones.  A long beat.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        She must've heard you on the 
                        stairway and dumped the stuff.

          Nick says nothing, stares off.

          A DETECTIVE comes over to them.

                                    DETECTIVE
                        There was no suite 405 in that 
                        building.  Catherine Tramell's 
                        roommate in her freshman year is 
                        dead.  She died of leukemia two 
                        years ago.

          An INTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN comes over to them.

                                    INTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN
                        Our files on Dr. Gardner show 
                        nothing about a police report in 
                        Berkeley -- nothing related to 
                        Salinas, either.

          A long beat -- the phone RINGS.  Andrews picks it up, listens.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Thanks.

          He hangs up.

                        in her apartment matches Nilsen.  
                        No registration.  They're checking 
                        with Salinas.  The icepick is the 
                        same brand and model as the Boz 
                        weapon.

          A long beat -- Nick just stares.

          Harrigan comes up to them.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        We checked the tape machines at 
                        Dr.  Gardner's apartment and at 
                        her office -- both here and the 
                        one on Van Ness.  No message from 
                        Gus on any of 'em.  The one at her 
                        apartment was broken.
                               (a beat)
                        Johnny Boz's psychiatrist says he 
                        thinks he remembers Dr. Gardner 
                        and Boz meeting at a Christmas 
                        party at his house a year ago.

          A long beat.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a long beat, 
                               sadly)
                        You just can't tell about people, 
                        can you.  Even the ones you think 
                        you know inside-out.

          He and Nick look at each other a beat.

                                    CAPTAIN TALCOTT
                        Congratulations, Curran.

          Nick looks at him, expressionless.

          EXT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He parks his car.  It is dark.  Foggy.

          He starts heading inside.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He goes in.  He starts to walk up the dark stairway, we see 
          him walking up several flights of steps.

          INT. THE CORRIDOR TO HIS APARTMENT

          He opens his door with his key.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT

          He walks in.  The apartment is dark.

                                    A VOICE
                               (behind him)
                        Hi.

          It is a whisper, almost a hiss.  He spins, fast.  Catherine 
          stands there, pressing herself against a wall.  They look at 
          each other a long beat.  She looks like she is almost in a 
          trance.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I heard about it... on TV.

          He looks at her, expressionless.  A long beat, their eyes are 
          into each other.  She looks like she is almost shivering.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I can't allow myself to care about 
                        you -- I can't allow myself to 
                        care -- I can't -- I can't --

          She looks very emotional.  He moves towards her, puts his arms 
          around her, holds her very close.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (in a whisper)
                        I don't want to do this -- please --
                        I don't want to do this -- I lose 
                        everybody -- I don't want to lose 
                        you -- I don't want to --

          He presses her closer and closer to himself, holds her.

          INT. HIS BEDROOM - NIGHT

          It is dark; we can't see clearly.

          Atop her... he makes love to her... gently... tenderly...  
          hardly moving inside her... there are tears in her eyes...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER

          Atop him... she is on her knees, straddling him... he is on 
          his back, his eyes are closed... her head arches back...  her 
          breasts high... he strains toward her with his body...  she 
          holds her arms high... her right hand is in a fist...

          (we only see the back of her hand and arm)... it comes down 
          suddenly... he bucks... writhes... then her whole body falls 
          on top of him.

          A very long beat...

          We can't see him... her body completely covers him...

          And then finally he moves... turns her to the side...  kisses 
          her.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Sympathy For The Devil"  in the b.g.; the 
          MUSIC is low.

          They lie next to each other on the bed.  The CAMERA faces them.  
          He lies, staring at the ceiling, on the left side of the bed, 
          smoking a cigarette.  She is curled away from him toward the 
          right side of the bed.  A long beat, then --

                                    CATHERINE
                        What do we do now, Nick?

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        We fuck like minks.  We raise 
                        rugrats.  We live happily ever 
                        after.

          We see her right arm go to the side of the bed and then over.  
          He stares at the ceiling.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I hate rugrats.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        We fuck like minks.  We forget the 
                        rugrats.  We live happily ever 
                        after.

          We see from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now Her face 
          is expressionless.  Her right arm dangles over the right side 
          of the bed.  Her right hand is clenched.  Is she holding 
          something in it against her arm?

          We see them from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now: He 
          turns his body away from her to put out his cigarette.

          We see her behind him slowly turning towards him and the CAMERA.  
          A beat, and he turns towards her.

          They look at each other.  A long beat as the SONG gets louder.  
          We see them in CLOSEUP.  We don't see her right arm.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (in a whisper)
                        I love you.

          A beat, and he kisses her.  The CAMERA BACKS AWAY from them 
          slowly to the right side of the bedroom as they kiss, and we --

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

          ... A long beat, as the SONG keeps playing... and we...

          FADE IN:

          We see them from the right side of the bedroom.  And then the 
          CAMERA LOWERS SLOWLY as they kiss with more and more passion.

          It keeps going LOWER.

          There is something under the bed.  The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER 
          towards it as "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" plays louder.  We see 
          it now in CLOSEUP as the bed rustles above...

          It is a thin, steel-handled icepick.

          The SONG plays LOUDER and LOUDER, and we --

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                     THE END

          INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

          It is dark; we don't see clearly.  a man and woman make love 
          on a brass bed.  There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling.  
          On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine.  A 
          tape deck PLAYS the Stones "Sympathy for the Devil."

          Atop him... she straddles his chest... her breasts in his face.  
          He cups her breasts.  She leans down, kisses him...

          JOHNNY BOZ is in his late 40's, slim, good-looking.  We don't 
          see the woman's face.  She has long blonde hair.  The CAMERA 
          STAYS BEHIND and to the side of them.

          She leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth...  she 
          kisses him... she moves her hands up, holds both of his arms 
          above his head.

          She moves higher atop him... she reaches to the side of the 
          bed... a white silk scarf is in her hand... her hips above his 
          face now, moving... slightly, oh-so slightly... his face strains 
          towards her.

          The scarf in her hand... she ties his hands with it...  
          gently... to the brass bed... his eyes are closed...  tighter... 
          lowering hips into his face... lower... over his chest... his 
          navel.  The SONG plays.

          He is inside her... his head arches back... his throat white.

          She arches her back... her hips grind... her breasts are high...

          Her back arches back... back... her head tilts back... she 
          extends her arms... the right arm comes down suddenly...  the 
          steel flashes... his throat is white...

          He bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses...

          It flashes up... it flashes down... and up... and down...  and 
          up... and...

          EXT. A BROWNSTONE IN PACIFIC HEIGHTS - MORNING

          Winter in San Francisco cold, foggy.  Cop cars everywhere.  
          The lights play through the thick fog.  Two Homicide detectives 
          get out of the car, walk into the house.

          NICK CURRAN is 42.  Trim, good-looking, a nice suit; a face 
          urban, edged, shadowed.  GUS MORAN is 64.  Crew-cut, silver 
          beard, a suit rumpled and shiny, a hat out of the 50'sa face 
          worn and ruined the face of a backwoods philosopher.

          INT. THE BROWNSTONE

          There's money here -- deco, clean, hip -- That looks like a 
          Picasso on the wall.  They check it out.

                                    GUS
                        Who was this fuckin' guy?

                                    NICK
                        Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.

                                    GUS
                        I never heard of him.

                                    NICK
                               (grins)
                        Before your time, pop.
                               (a beat)
                        Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits.
                        He's got a club down in the Fillmore 
                        now.

                                    GUS
                        Not now he don't.

          Past the uniformed guys... nods... waves... past the forensic 
          men... past the coroner's investigators... they get to the 
          bedroom.

          INT. THE BEDROOM

          They walk in, stare -- it's messy.

          It's like a convention in here.  LT. PHIL WALKER, in his 50's, 
          silver-haired, the Homicide guys; JIM HARRIGAN, late 40's, 
          puffy, affable;  SAM ANDREWS, 30's, black.  A CORONER'S MAN is 
          working the bed.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick and Gus)
                        You guys know Captain Talcott?

          They nod.

                                    GUS
                        What's the Chief's office doin' 
                        here.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                        Observing.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to the Coroner's 
                               Guy)
                        What do you think, Doc?

                                    THE CORONER'S GUY
                        The skin blanches when I press it --
                        this kind of color is about right 
                        for six or eight hours.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Nobody say anything.  The maid 
                        came in an hour ago and found him.
                        She's not a live-in.

                                    GUS
                        Maybe the maid did it.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        She's 54 years old and weighs 240 
                        pounds.

                                    THE CORONER'S GUY
                               (deadpan)
                        There are no bruises on his body.

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        It ain't the maid.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        He left the club with his girlfriend 
                        about midnight.  That's the last 
                        time anybody saw him.

                                    NICK
                               (looks at body)
                        What was it?

                                    THE CORONER'S GUY
                        Ice pick.  Left on the coffee table 
                        in the living room.  Thin steel 
                        handle.  Forensics took it downtown.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        There's come all over the sheets --
                        he got off before he got offed.

                                    GUS
                               (deadpan)
                        That rules the maid out for sure.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                        This is sensitive.  Mr. Boz was a 
                        major contributor to the mayor's 
                        campaign.  He was Chairman of the 
                        Board of the Palace of Fine Arts --

                                    GUS
                               (to Nick)
                        I thought you said he was a rock 
                        and roll star.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        He was a retired rock and roll 
                        star.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                        A civic-minded, very respectable 
                        rock and roll star.

                                    GUS
                        What's that over there?

          We see the white powder laid out in lines on the small mirror 
          on the side table.

                        It looks like some civic-minded, 
                        very respectable cocaine to me, 
                        Gus.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                               (evenly, to Nick)
                        Listen to me, Curran.  I'm going 
                        to get a lot of heat on this.  I 
                        don't want any... mistakes.

          Nick and Talcott look at each other a beat, then --

                                    NICK
                        Who's the girlfriend?

          Lt. Walker looks at the notepad in his hand.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Catherine Tramell, 162 Divisadero.

          Nick writes it down.  He and Gus turn, leave.  Captain Talcott 
          watches them.  He looks disturbed.

          INT. THE LIVING ROOM

          As they head out --

                                    NICK
                        Talcott doesn't usually show up at 
                        the office 'till after his 18 holes.  
                        What are they nervous about?

                                    GUS
                        They're executives.  They're nervous 
                        about everything.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Nick!

          He stops, turns, sees Walker behind them.  Walker comes up to 
          them.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick)
                        Keep your three o'clock.

                                    NICK
                        Do you want me to work the case, 
                        Phil, or do you want me to --

                                    LT. WALKER
                        I said keep it.

          EXT. A VICTORIAN ON DIVISADERO - DAY

          It is more a mansion than a house.  They ring the bell.  An 
          Hispanic MAID answers.  They flash their badges.

                                    NICK
                        I'm Detective Curran, this is 
                        Detective Moran.  We're with the 
                        San Francisco Police Department.

          We'd like to speak to Ms. Catherine Tramell.

                                    THE MAID
                               (after a beat, an 
                               accent)
                        Just moment.  Come in.

          She leads them into a lavish, beautifully done living room 
          that offers a sweeping view of the Bay.

                                    THE MAID
                        Sit, please.  Just moment.

          They look around, impressed.  There is a Picasso on the wall 
          here, too.

                                    GUS
                        Ain't that cute?  They got his and 
                        her Pig-assos, son.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        I didn't know you knew who Picasso 
                        was, Gus.

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just 
                        hide it.

          Nick smiles -- and at that moment a beautiful BLONDE walks 
          into the room.  She looks like she has been asleep.  She is in 
          her early 20's.  She wears a very sheer robe.

                                    NICK
                        We're sorry to disturb you, we'd 
                        like to ask you some --

                                    THE WOMAN
                        Are you vice?

                                    GUS
                               (after a beat)
                        Homicide.

                                    THE WOMAN
                        What do you want?

                                    GUS
                        When was the last time you saw 
                        John Boz? 

                                    THE WOMAN
                        Is he dead?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Why do you think he's dead?

                                    THE WOMAN
                        You wouldn't be here otherwise, 
                        would you?

                                    GUS
                        Were you with him last night?

                                    THE WOMAN
                        You're looking for Catherine, not 
                        me.

                                    NICK
                        Who are you?

                                    THE WOMAN
                        I'm Roxy.
                               (a beat)
                        I'm her -- friend.

          She looks at them a beat.

                                    ROXY
                        She's out at the beach house at 
                        Stinson.  Seadrift.  1402.

                                    NICK
                        Thanks.

          They start to head out.

                                    ROXY
                        You're wasting your time. Catherine 
                        didn't kill him.

          A beat, they look at her, and go...

          EXT. SEADRIFT - STINSON BEACH - DAY

          Foggy.  Cold.  It is an expensive spit of land on the ocean.  
          Multi-million dollar "beach houses" with gardens and swimming 
          pools.  There are two Ferraris in the driveway -- one black, 
          one white.

          They get out of the car in front of the house.  They see a 
          woman in back of the house, sitting on a deck chair, staring 
          at the sea, a blanket around her.  As they get to her --

                                    NICK
                        Ms. Tramell?

          She takes a long look a Nick, then looks away.

          CATHERINE TRAMELL is 30 years old.  She has long blonde hair 
          and a refined, classically beautiful face.  She is not knockout 
          gorgeous like Roxy; there is a smoky kind of sensuousness about 
          her.

                                    NICK
                        I'm De...

                                    CATHERINE
                               (evenly)
                        I know who you are.

          She doesn't look at them.  She looks at the water.

                                    CATHERINE
                        How did he die?

                                    GUS
                        He was murdered.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Really.  Maybe that's why you're 
                        from Homicide.  How?

          Nick glances at Gus.

                                    NICK
                        With an ice pick.

          She closes her eyes a beat and then, still staring out, we see 
          a thin smile.  They see it, too, and glance at each other.

                                    NICK
                        How long were you dating him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking 
                        him.

          They glance at each other again.

                                    GUS
                        What are you -- a pro?

          Catherine looks at him -- that thin smile again.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  I'm an amateur.

          She looks away.

                                    NICK
                        How long were you having sex with 
                        him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        About a year and a half.

                                    NICK
                        Were you with him last night?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.

                                    NICK
                        Did you leave the club with him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.

                                    NICK
                        Did you go home with him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  We had a drink at the club.
                        We left together.  I came here.  
                        He went home.

                                    NICK
                        Was there anyone with you last 
                        night?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (looks at Nick)
                        No.  I wasn't in the mood to have 
                        sex with anyone last night.

          They look at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Let me ask you something, Ms.
                        Tramell?  Are you sorry he's dead?

          Catherine looks at him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.  I liked fucking him.

          They stare at her.  She looks out at the water.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I don't really feel like talking 
                        anymore.

                                    GUS
                        Listen, lady, we can do this 
                        downtown if you --

                                    CATHERINE
                        Read me my rights and arrest me 
                        and I'll go downtown.

          She doesn't even look at them.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        Otherwise, get the fuck out of 
                        here.  Please.

          A long beat as they look at her.

          INT. A CORRIDOR - POLICE HEADQUARTERS

          The door says Dr. Elizabeth Gardner, Counseling.  Nick opens 
          the door, peeks in.  The receptionist is not there.  A clock 
          says 3.

          INT. THE COUNSELING OFFICE

          He walks in -- sees the inner door open, walks in.

                                    NICK
                        I'm sorry, Beth.  I -- I got hung 
                        up in Stinson.

          DR. ELIZABETH GARDNER, the police psychologist, is a very good-
          looking, dark-haired woman.  She is 30.

                        you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.

                                    NICK
                        It's bullshit.  You know it is.

                        so we can get it over with, okay?

          He sits down.

                                    BETH
                        So -- how are things?

                               (after a beat)
                        Things are fine.  I told you.
                        They're fine.

          She watches him closely.

                                    BETH
                               (after a beat)
                        How is your -- personal life?

                        My sex life is pretty shitty 
                        actually since I stopped seeing 
                        you -- maybe I should think about

                        The powder was cocaine, high-
                        quality, high-content.  He inhaled 
                        it; there were minute quantities

                        He liked his coke, he liked his

          and Beth Gardner.  With them is an older, white-haired man, 
          DR. ANDREW LAMOTT.  There are copies of "Love Hurts" around

                        Dr. Gardner?

                                    BETH
                        I've asked Dr. Lamott to consult 
                        with us.  This isn't really my 
                        turf.  Dr. Lamott teaches the psycho-
                        pathology of psychopathic behavior 
                        at Stanford and is also a member 
                        of the Justice Department's 
                        Psychological Profile team.  Dr.  
                        Lamott?

                        There are two possibilities.  One.  
                        The person who wrote this book is 
                        your murderer and acted out the 
                        killing described in ritualistic, 
                        literal detail.  Two.  Someone who 
                        wants to do the person who wrote 
                        this book harm read the book and 
                        enacted the killing described to 
                        incriminate the writer.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        What if the writer did it?  What 
                        are we dealing with?

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        You're dealing with a devious, 
                        diabolical mind.  This book must 
                        have been written at least six 
                        months, maybe years before it was 
                        published.  That means the writer 
                        planned the crime, at least in the 
                        subconscious, back then.  The fact 
                        that the writer carried it out 
                        indicates psychopathic obsessive 
                        behavior in terms not only of the 
                        killing itself but in terms of 
                        applied advance defense mechanism.

                        She anticipates the book to be her 
                        best alibi.

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        Correct.

                        I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone 
                        in the exact way I've described in 
                        my book?  I wouldn't do that because 
                        I'd know I'd be a suspect.

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        You're dealing then with someone 
                        so obsessed that he or she is 
                        willing to kill an irrelevant and 
                        innocent victim to place the blame 
                        on the person who wrote this book.  
                        We are talking about deep-seated, 
                        obsessional hatred; an utter lack 
                        of sense of proportion or 
                        perspective.

                        way you cut it -- that's what you're

                        but there's no motive.  Her defense 
                        would just beat us to death with

                        It won't do any good.  She'll come 
                        in with Lee Bailey and Mel Belli 
                        trailing behind her on a solid 
                        gold chain from Tiffanys.

                                    TALCOTT
                        Yes she will.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        No she won't.

          They look at him.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        I don't think she's going to hide 
                        behind anybody.  I don't think 
                        she's going to hide at all.

                                    TALCOTT
                               (after a beat)
                        I think you're as crazy as she 
                        probably is, Curran.

          Nicks says nothing.

                                    GUS
                        You know what they say: It takes 
                        one to know one.

          Nick looks a Gus, grins.

          EXT. HER HOUSE IN STINSON - DAY

          They walk from the car to the door of the big beach house.

          They ring the bell.  They hear typing inside.  The typing stops.  
          She comes to the door in jeans and a tight-fitting sweatshirt.

                                    NICK
                        Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come 
                        downtown and answer some questions 
                        for us.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Are you arresting me?

                                    NICK
                        If that's the way you want to play 
                        it.

          They look at each other a beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Can I change into something more 
                        appropriate?  It'll just take a 
                        minute.

          He nods.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Come in.

          INT. THE HOUSE

          It is beautifully done in a Santa Fe motif.  She goes to a 
          bedroom of the living room.

          Nick sits down on a couch facing the bedroom she's walked into.  
          Gus sits across from him, his back to the bedroom.

          There is a coffee table between them.  She leaves the bedroom 
          door halfway open.

          An old newspaper is on the coffee table.  Nick reaches for it.  
          The headline says VICE COP CLEARED IN TOURIST SHOOTINGS.  A 
          headline underneath says GRAND JURY SAYS SHOOTINGS ACCIDENTAL.  
          There is a photograph of Nick.

          He stares at the paper.

                                    CATHERINE
                        How long will this take?

          Nick puts the paper down on the coffee table.  He is lost in 
          his thoughts.  Gus picks the paper up.

                                    NICK
                               (looks up)
                        I don't know.

          Nick, facing the half open bedroom door, sees a mirror near 
          the wall of the bedroom.  The mirror reflects her in the other 
          corner of the bedroom.  She is taking her clothes off.  He 
          stares.  She strips down.  He sees her back. She has a beautiful 
          body.  Naked, she puts a dress on.  She doesn't put any 
          underwear on.

                                    NICK
                        Do you always keep old newspapers 
                        around?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Only when they make interesting 
                        reading.

          And she is suddenly out of the bedroom.  She stands there, 
          smiles.  They look at each other a long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (finally)
                        I'm ready.

          They get up, head out.

                                    GUS
                        You have the right to an attorney.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Why would I need an attorney?

          INT. THE CAR - DAY

          They sit in the front; she is in the back.  The car goes over 
          the winding, two-lane Mt. Tamalpais road.

          The fog is heavy.  It's starting to rain.  We see the beach 
          far below.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Do you have a cigarette?

                                    NICK
                        I don't smoke.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes, you do.

                                    NICK
                        I quit.

          She smiles, looks at him.  A beat, and he turns away.  Another 
          beat, and she lights a cigarette up.

                                    NICK
                        I thought you were out of 
                        cigarettes.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I found some in my purse; would 
                        you like one?

          He turns back to her.

                                    NICK
                        I told you -- I quit.

                                    CATHERINE
                        It won't last.

          A beat, as she looks at him, and then he turns away.

                                    GUS
                        You workin' on another book?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes I am.

                                    GUS
                        It must really be somehtin' --makin' 
                        stuff up all the time.

          He watches her in the rearview mirror.

                                    CATHERINE
                        It teaches you to lie.

                                    GUS
                        How's that?

                                    CATHERINE
                        You make it up, but it has to be 
                        believable.  They call it suspension 
                        of disbelief.

                                    GUS
                        I like that.  "Suspension of 
                        Disbelief."

          He smiles at her in the mirror.

                                    NICK
                        What's your new book about?

                                    CATHERINE
                        A detective.  He falls for the 
                        wrong woman.

          He turns back to her.

                                    NICK
                        What happens to him?

          She looks right into his eye.

                                    CATHERINE
                        She kills him.

          A beat, as they look at each other, and then he turns away 
          from her.  Gus watcher her in the rearview mirror.

          INT. A POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

          It is large, fluorescent-lighted, antiseptic.

          She walks in with Nick and Gus.  In the room are prosecutor 
          John Corrigan, Lt. Walker, Captain Talcott, Harrigan, and 
          Andrews.  There is a police stenographer a plain young woman 
          in her 20's.

          As soon as she comes in --

                                    CORRIGAN
                        I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant 
                        district attorney, Ms.  Tramell.  
                        Can we get you anything?  Would 
                        you like some coffee?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No thank you.

                                    TALCOTT
                        Are your attorneys --

                                    NICK
                               (hiding a smile)
                        Ms. Tramell waived her right to an 
                        attorney.

          Corrigan and Talcott glance at Nick.  She sees the look.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Did I miss something?

                                    NICK
                        I told them you wouldn't want an 
                        attorney present.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Why have you waived your right to 
                        an attorney, Ms. Tramell?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (to Nick)
                        Why did you think I wouldn't want 
                        one?

                                    NICK
                        I told them you wouldn't want to 
                        hide.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I have nothing to hide.

          The two of them keep their eyes on each other.

          She sits down.  They sit around her.  Nick sits directly across 
          from her.  She lights up a cigarette.  They watch her.  

          She is poised, cool, in complete command of herself.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        There is no smoking in this 
                        building, Ms. Tramell.

                                    CATHERINE
                        What are you going to do?  Charge 
                        me with smoking?

          Ever so casually, she blows her smoke across at Nick.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

                                    CORRIGAN
                        Would you tell us the nature of 
                        your relationship with Mr. Boz?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I had sex with him for about a 
                        year and a half.  I liked having 
                        sex with him.

          She has control of the room; she looks from one man to the 
          other as she speaks.

                                    CATHERINE
                        He wasn't afraid of experimenting.  
                        I like men like that.  I like men 
                        who give me pleasure.  He gave me 
                        a lot of pleasure.

          A beat, as they watch her.  She is so matter-of-fact.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        Did you ever engage in sado-
                        masochistic activity with him?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Exactly what do you have in mind, 
                        Mr. Corrigan.

                                    CORRIGAN
                               (after a beat, little 
                               flustered)
                        Did you ever tie him up?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.

                                    ANDREWS
                        You never tied him up.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No. Johnny liked to use his hands 
                        too much.  I like hands and fingers.

          They stare at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I've always had a fondness for 
                        white silk scarves.
                               (she smiles)
                        I have a very vivid imagination.

                                    NICK
                        But you said you liked men to use 
                        their hands.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  I said I liked Johnny to use 
                        his hands.
                               (she smiles)
                        I don't give any rules, Nick.  I 
                        go with the flow.

          They have their eyes on each other.

                        Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'd have to be pretty stupid to 
                        write a book about a killing and 
                        then kill him the way I described 
                        in my book. I'd be announcing myself 
                        as the killer.  I'm not stupid.

          She smiles.

                                    TALCOTT
                        We know you're not stupid, Ms.
                        Tramell.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Maybe that's what you're counting 
                        on to get you off the hook.

                                    NICK
                        Writing a book about it gives you 
                        an alibi for not killing him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes it does, doesn't it?

          She holds his eyes a second, then --

                                    CATHERINE
                        The answer is no.  I didn't kill 
                        him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Sometimes.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        Did you ever do drugs with Mr. 
                        Boz?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Sure.

                                    GUS
                        What kind of drugs?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Cocaine.

          She looks directly at Nick.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Have you ever fucked on cocaine?
                               (she smiles)
                        It's nice.

          He watches her.

                        You like playing games, don't you?

                               (smiles)
                        I've got a degree in psych.  It 
                        goes with the turf.  Games are 
                        fun.

          They are holding each other's eyes.

                                    NICK
                        How about boxing?  That's a game.
                        Was that fun for you?

          They don't take their eyes off each other for a second.

                                    TALCOTT
                        I think that's irrelevant to this 
                        inquiry.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (to Nick)
                        Yes it was.  Bobby died.

                                    NICK
                        How did you feel when he died?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I loved him.  I hurt.

          Their eyes are still on each other.

                                    NICK
                        How did you feel when I told you 
                        Johnny Boz had died -- that day at 
                        the beach.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I felt somebody had read my book 
                        and was playing a game.

                                    NICK
                        But you didn't hurt --

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.

                                    NICK
                        Because you didn't love him --

                                    CATHERINE
                        That's right.

          Their eyes are digging into each other.

                                    NICK
                        Even though you were fucking him.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        You still get the pleasure.  Didn't 
                        you ever fuck anybody else while 
                        you were married, Nick?

          A beat; he stares at her, expressionless.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        How did you know he was married?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (watching Nick)
                        Maybe I was guessing.  What 
                        difference does it make?

          She lights a cigarette.  He stares at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Would you like a cigarette, Nick?

          He just stares at her, expressionless.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        Do you two know each other?

                                    NICK
                        No.

                                    CATHERINE

                        How did you meet Mr. Boz?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I wanted to write a book about the 
                        murder of a retired rock star.  I 
                        went down to his club and picked 
                        him up.  Then I had sex with him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You didn't feel anything for him.
                        You just had sex with him for your 
                        book.

          She looks at Nick.

                                    CATHERINE
                        In the beginning.  Then I got to 
                        like what he did for me.

                                    GUS
                        That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'm a writer,  I use people for 
                        what I write.  You write what you 
                        know.  Let the world beware.

          She and Nick have their eyes on each other, then --

                                    CATHERINE
                               (to Corrigan, smiles)
                        Would you like me to take a lie 
                        detector test?

          INT. THE POLICE BUILDING - NIGHT

          We see her in a glass-enclosed cubicle with a polygraph 
          EXAMINER.  Nick stands outside watching her with Gus and Lt. 
          Walker.  Her back is to them.  The Examiner shuts the machine 
          down, gathers rolls of papers, and comes out of the cubicle.

                                    THE EXAMINER
                        No blips, no blood pressure 
                        variations, no pulse variance.  
                        Either she's telling the truth or 
                        I've never met anyone like her.

          A long beat, then --

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Well, I guess that's it.

          A long beat, Nick watches her as she sits inside.

                                    NICK
                        How does somebody beat this machine?

                                    THE EXAMINER
                        Ninety-nine point nine percent of 
                        the cases, they don't.  You'd have 
                        to be able to mask the truth from 
                        your own central nervous system, 
                        your circulatory system, your 
                        adrenal glands.  In my opinion, 
                        this woman is telling the truth.

          The Examiner walks away.  They stand there. Catherine stands 
          at the door of the cubicle behind them --

                                    CATHERINE
                        Can I go now?

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a beat)
                        Yes.  Thanks for coming in, Ms.
                        Tramell.  I'm sorry to inconvenience 
                        you.

          She says nothing, has a thin smile.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Can I ask one of you for a ride?

          They look at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Sure.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Thanks.

          And he and Catherine walk away.  Gus and Walker watch them.

          INT. HIS CAR - NIGHT

          It is an old, mint-condition silver Porsche.  It is pouring 
          rain; the wind is blowing a San Francisco winter storm.  Nothing 
          is said a long beat as he drives.  She yawns.  Stretches.  He 
          looks at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        I'm tired.

                                    NICK
                        It's got to be tiring to beat that 
                        machine.

          She looks at him and looks away.  A beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                        If I were guilty, and if I wanted 
                        to beat that machine, it wouldn't 
                        be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring 
                        at all.

                                    NICK
                        Why not?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Because I'm a professional liar.  
                        I spend most of my waking hours 
                        dwelling on my lies.
                               (a beat)
                        For my writing.

          He looks at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        I love the rain, don't you?

          He says nothing, doesn't look at her.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You took a polygraph after you 
                        shot those two people, didn't you?

          He looks at her now.

                                    NICK
                        I passed.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You see?  We're both innocent, 
                        Nick.

          He pulls up in front of her house on Divisadero, stops.  He 
          sees the white Ferrari in the driveway.

                                    NICK
                        How do you know all this stuff 
                        about me?

                                    CATHERINE
                        You know all about me.

                                    NICK
                        I don't know anything that isn't 
                        police business.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        You know I don't like to wear any 
                        underwear, don't you, Nick?

          They look at each other a beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        Thanks for the ride.

          And she's out of the car.  He watches her as she hurries in 
          the rain -- his eyes on her until the moment she opens the 
          door and is inside.

          INT. THE TEN-FOUR - NIGHT

          It is a police bar, San Francisco style.  Ferns  Joe Montana 
          and Will Clark posters.  The jukebox has a lot of Tony Bennett.

          He walks in.  He sees Lt. Walker at a back booth with Gus, 
          goes to them, sits down.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        What is all this "Nick" stuff --
                        Nick would you like a cigarette.
                        Nick can you give me a ride.

                                    NICK
                        She didn't ask me for the ride.
                        She asked anybody.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        And you volunteered.

          A BARTENDER stays behind the bar, but yells to him.

                                    THE BARTENDER
                        Perrier, Nick?

                                    NICK
                        Double Black Jack rocks, Harry.

                                    GUS
                               (with concern)
                        What you doin', son?

                                    NICK
                        It's my first drink in three months.  
                        That okay with you, pop?
                               (to Lt. Walker)
                        She doesn't know me.  I never saw 
                        her before Gus and I talked to 
                        her.

                                    THE BARTENDER
                        Here you go, Nick.

          He gets up, gets his drink --

                                    NICK
                        Thanks, Harry.

          He sits back down.  He takes a big slug.  They watch him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You sure?

                                    NICK
                        I'm sure.

          He takes another big slug.

                                    NICK
                        Now what?

                                    LT. WALKER
                        What now what? Now nothing.  She 
                        passed the polygraph.  That's it.

                                    NICK
                        She knew she could beat it.  That's 
                        why she asked to take it.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        How the fuck do you know?  What is 
                        it with you and this broad anyway?

                                    NICK
                        Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna 
                        let this slide.  What about her 
                        parents?  What about what else 
                        she's published?  At least we should 
                        get the stuff to see if we find 
                        anything else that's an amazing 
                        real-life coincidence.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Her parents died in an accident.  
                        I don't care what else she's 
                        written.  What are you -- a book 
                        critic?

                                    NICK
                        How did they die?  Was there an 
                        investigation?

                                    LT. WALKER
                        How you're saying she killed her 
                        parents?  Did she kill Bobby 
                        Vasquez, too?

                                    GUS
                        Not unless she got up in the ring 
                        and turned into one mean 
                        sonofabitch.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she 
                        grew herself an Afro and learned a 
                        left hook and put shoe polish on 
                        her face.  Let's polygraph her 
                        again and ask her about it.

                                    NICK
                               (casually)
                        Fuck you, Phil.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Fuck you, too Nick.

          A beat, then --

                                    NICK
                               (calls to the 
                               Bartender)
                        Can you get me another double Black 
                        Jack, Harry.

          Gus looks at him with concern.  A man in his 50's -- LT. MARTIN 
          NILSEN  is suddenly there.  He is overweight, florid.

                                    NILSEN
                               (to Nick)
                        Hey, shooter -- You back on the 
                        Black Jack, Shooter?

          He grins.  Nick doesn't look at him.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        We're discussing a case, Marty.

                                    NILSEN
                        I know that.  I had no doubt of 
                        that.

                                    THE BARTENDER
                        Here you go, Nick.

          Nilsen takes the drink, hands it to Nick.

                                    NILSEN
                               (grins)
                        Double, huh, Shooter?

          Nick turns to him.  He's sitting in the booth; Nilsen is 
          standing there.  Nick looks like he's barely restraining 
          himself.

                                    NICK
                        I'm off-duty, Nilsen.  You hear 
                        me?  I'm off-duty discussing a 
                        case.  Internal Affairs shouldn't 
                        have any trouble with that.  Maybe 
                        I should put in for overtime.

                                    NILSEN
                               (grins)
                        You do that, Shooter.  Why don't 
                        you send it to me?  I'll give it 
                        special attention.

          A beat, and then Nick gets up, faces him.

                                    NICK
                        I'm gonna tell you once more, Nilsen --

          Lt. Walker and Gus get up and hold Nick back.

          Beth Gardner, the police psychologist, is suddenly there.

                                    BETH
                        What's the problem?

                                    NILSEN
                               (grins)
                        No problem, Doctor.  Here comes 
                        the Doctor just in time to save 
                        her patient.  Take care, Shooter.

          And he walks away.  Nick still looks like he wants to go after 
          him.  Beth pulls him away from the booth.

                                    BETH
                        You okay?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Yeah.

                                    BETH
                               (smiles)
                        You don't look so okay.

          Nick looks at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        What are you doing here?

                                    BETH
                               (smiles)
                        Baby-sitting.
                               (she shrugs)
                        Rookie cop.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        What else is new?

          A beat.  He looks at her again.

                                    NICK
                        You want to get out of here?

          She looks at him a beat.

                                    BETH
                               (smiles)
                        Yes.

          At the booth, Gus and Lt. Walker watch the two of them leave.

                                    GUS
                        Maybe it's for old-time's sake.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (watches them go 
                               out)
                        Sometimes I think he started banging 
                        her just to get himself off the 
                        hook with Internal Affairs.

                                    GUS
                               (after a beat, smiles)
                        He ain't that way.  He's got heart.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (smiles)
                        Yeah.  I know.

          INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          He is kissing her -- hard, rough.  He forces her against the 
          wall.

                                    BETH
                        Don't -- please, Nick --

          We hear her dress RIP.  He kisses her harder -- we hear her 
          panties RIP.  He gets the dress off, pushes his hands under 
          her bra --

                                    BETH
                        Please don't -- don't --

          He puts his mouth to her shoulder, bites it -- as they move 
          down to the floor.

          INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

          It is dark.  The are still partially dressed.  They are on the 
          floor.  He lies on his back, staring at the ceiling.

          She lies next to him -- the torn dress wound around her.

          There is a bite mark on her shoulder.  A long beat, silence -- 
          then --

                                    BETH
                        What was she like?

                                    NICK
                        Who?

                                    BETH
                        Catherine Tramell.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        She said what you said she'd say.

          She sits up, looks away.  He looks at her, puts his finger on 
          the bite mark idly, gently.  A beat, and he kisses her shoulder 
          gently, then lies back down.

                                    BETH
                        I met her at Berkeley.

          He looks at her.

                                    BETH
                        We were in some of the same classes.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Why didn't you tell me?

          She looks at him.

                                    BETH
                        I'm telling you.

          They look at each other a long beat.

                                    BETH
                               (with difficulty)
                        You've never been... like that...  
                        before.

          He says nothing, looks away from her.

                                    BETH
                        Why?

          He doesn't look at her a long beat, says nothing.

                                    NICK
                        You're the shrink.

          She keeps looking at him.  He won't look at her.

                                    BETH
                        You weren't making love to me.

          A beat; he looks at her.

                                    NICK
                        Who was I making love to?

          She looks at him a long beat.

                                    BETH
                        You weren't making love.

          They look at each other, a long beat, then away.  He lies back 
          down.  Beth doesn't look at him, keeps sitting up.

                                    NICK
                               (finally)
                        I need a cigarette.

                                    BETH
                               (after a beat)
                        I thought you quit.

          He says nothing.

                                    BETH
                        Top drawer in the foyer.
                               (a beat)
                        Get it on your way out.

          He looks at her; she won't look at him.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - MORNING

          He walks in.  He looks hung-over.  He sees Gus with Harrigan 
          and Andrews and Lt. Walker in Lt. Walker's glass-enclosed office 
          at the end of this big room.

          They look at him when they see him.

                        You look like dogshit.

                        He looks a little shrunk, that's 
                        all.

                               (after a beat)
                        We got a call from Berkeley P.D.
                        There was a killing.  A professor.
                        Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple

                               (a thin smile)
                        She was there, wasn't she?

                                    LT. WALKER
                        University records say she was 
                        there.

          He and Nick look at each other a long beat, then --

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (suddenly)
                        Gus -- go over to Berkeley.
                        Harrigan -- find out what else 
                        she's published.  Andrews -- get 
                        the files on her parents' accident.
                        Carbon Beth on everything.  I want 
                        some psychological input on this 
                        Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is 
                        left there with Gus.

                                    NICK
                        What about me?

                                    GUS
                        You're already gettin' psychological 
                        input, son.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick)
                        Go stick your head in a tub of ice 
                        water.
                               (a beat; then 
                               seriously)
                        See where she leads.

          EXT. THE BEACH HOUSE AT STINSON - DAY

          The black Ferrari is in the driveway.  He sits in an unmarked 
          police car on a hillside above the house, watching.  It is a 
          bleak, leaden gray day.

          Catherine comes out of the house.  She is dressed casually.

          She gets into the Ferrari.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR

          He stays behind her at a safe distance on the winding panoramic 
          highway -- a two-lane mountain road which leads from Stinson 
          Beach into Marin County.

          She suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road, cutting 
          in and out, passing cars very fast.

          He has to start cutting around cars to keep up.  This woman 
          really drives.

          He cuts out and can barely pass a car without hitting a Grey 
          Lines Tour Bus head-on.  Close call: sheer drops on either 
          side.

          He looks frazzled.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR

          He is behind her at a distance on a hilly Mill Valley road -- 
          little streets, terraced hillsides, sharp turns.

          He goes slowly, looks around, thinks he's lost her.  And then 
          he sees the black Ferrari parked in front of a house obscured 
          by hedges.

          He parks the car a distance behind the Ferrari, sits there a 
          long beat.  He gets out, goes carefully up to the hedges, looks.  
          A small, nondescript house.  He watches.  He can't see anything 
          inside the house.

          A beat, he reaches over to the mailbox and opens it.  He takes 
          an envelope out, looks at the name Hazel Dobkins.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT

          He watches as she comes out of the house.  A frail old woman 
          in her 70's is with her.  She hugs the old woman, gets into 
          the Ferrari, STARTS it up.

          He waits a beat and then STARTS after her.  He stays behind 
          her at a distance -- she is going slowly.  And then she suddenly 
          GUNS it, cuts her lights -- her wheels SCREECH.

          He GUNS his car after her.  He makes a turn.  She is gone.

          There is a fork in the road.  He turns one way, goes a few 
          hundred feet.

          Nothing.  Blackness.  He stops.

                                    NICK
                               (quietly)
                        Shit.

          INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT

          He pulls his car up to her house at Stinson Beach.  The black 
          Ferrari is in the driveway.

          A light goes on in an upstairs bedroom.  The curtain is drawn.  
          He sees the outline of her body now.

          She starts to take her clothes off -- there in the window, 
          behind the curtain.  He watches her body as she does an almost 
          languorous strip.  His eyes are intense... ravishing.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT

          He is alone, nobody else in the big room.

          He sits in front of a computer.  We see the screen.  He has 
          punched in

          HAZEL DOBKINS, WF, 145 ALBION RD., MILL VALLEY.

          He is waiting for a response.  We see it come on screen

          NOTHING CURRENT.

          A long beat, as he stares at the screen, and then we see these 
          words

          RELEASED, SAN QUENTIN, JULY 7, 1965.

          We see him type in the words

          PRIOR ARREST RECORD.

          A long beat, and then it comes up

          HOMICIDE, JANUARY 10, 1956 - SAN FRANCISCO

          He stares at the screen a long beat.

                                    GUS

                               in his thoughts)

                        And guess what?  He was her 
                        counselor.

          Nick looks at him a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Was she ever suspect?

                                    GUS
                        No, sir.  They never even got a 
                        statement from her.

          Nick sits back a long beat, his eyes off somewhere.

                                    NICK
                               (slowly)
                        Do you remember a case -- 1956 --
                        Hazel Dobkins?

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta 
                        my head for years.  Still can't.  
                        Nice little kids -- nice husband, 
                        wasn't porkin' around -- no 
                        financial problems.  One day -- 
                        outta the clear blue sky -- she 
                        does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a 
                        knife. He got for a wedding present.  
                        Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as 
                        honey.  Said she didn't know why 
                        she done it.

          Nick just stares at him.

          EXT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - NEXT DAY

          He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car.  
          He stands there a beat, thinking.  He walks down to the beach 
          entrance of the house.  He hears a Rolling Stones SONG playing 
          inside.  He stands there.  The door suddenly opens.  Catherine 
          stands there, smiles.  She wears very tight-fitting spandex 
          leotards.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Hi.

          He looks at her a beat, then --

                                    NICK
                        Am I... disturbing you?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  Come in.

          They have their eyes on each other.  A beat, and she turns to 
          go in.

          INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE

          She goes in ahead of him -- he follows her inside.  He watches 
          her body.  His movements are tentative, off-balance.  She turns 
          the Stones DOWN.

          On a table by the window, he sees a word processor.  Spread 
          around it are newspaper clippings.  They are all about him.

          We see the headline on one KILLER COP TO FACE POLICE REVIEW.  
          She sees him glancing at the clips.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'm using you for my detective.  
                        In my book.  You don't mind, do 
                        you?

          She smiles.  He looks at her, expressionless.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Would you like a drink?  I was 
                        just going to have one.

                                    NICK
                        No, thanks.

          She goes to the bar.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (smiles)
                        That's right.  You're off the Jack 
                        Daniels too, aren't you?

          She is making herself a drink.  She takes the ice out and then 
          opens a drawer and gets an icepick.  It has a fat wooden end.  
          She uses the icepick on the ice, her back to him.  He watches 
          her.

                                    NICK
                        I'd like to ask you a few more 
                        questions.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'd like to ask you some, too.

          She turns to him, icepick in hand, smiles.

                                    CATHERINE
                        For my book.

          She turns back to the ice, works on it with the pick.  She 
          raises her arm, plunges it.  Raises it, plunges it.  He watches 
          her.

                                    NICK
                               (wary)
                        What kind of questions?

          She puts the icepick down, pours herself a drink, turns to 
          him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        How does it feel to kill someone?

          He looks at her a long beat.

                                    NICK
                               (finally)
                        You tell me.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I don't know.  But you do.

          Their eyes are on each other.

                                    NICK
                               (finally)
                        It was an accident.  They got in 
                        the line of fire.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Four shootings in five years.  All 
                        accidents.

                        They were drug buys.  I was a vice 
                        cop.

          A long beat, as they look at each other.

                                    NICK
                        Tell me about Professor Goldstein.

          BEAT.

                                    CATHERINE
                        There's a name from the past.

                                    NICK
                        You want a name from the present?
                        How about Hazel Dobkins?

          She looks at him a long beat, sips her drink, never takes her 
          eyes off him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Noah was my counselor in my freshman 
                        year.
                               (she smiles)
                        That's probably where I got the 
                        idea for the icepick.  For my book.
                        Funny how the subconscious works.
                               (a beat)
                        Hazel is my friend.

                                    NICK
                        She wiped out her whole family.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.  She's helped me understand 
                        homicidal impulse.

                                    NICK
                        Didn't you study it in school?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Only in theory.
                               (she smiles)
                        You know all about homicidal 
                        impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not 
                        in theory -- in practice.

          He stares at her a long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        What happened, Nick?  Did you get 
                        sucked into it? Did you like it 
                        too much?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        No.

          He stares at her, almost horrified.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        Tell me about the coke, Nick.  The 
                        day you shot those two tourists --
                        how much coke did you do?

          She steps closer to him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Tell me, Nick.

          She puts her hand softly on his cheek,  He grabs her hand 
          roughly, holds it.

                                    NICK
                        I didn't.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes, you did.  They never tested 
                        you, did they?  But Internal Affairs 
                        knew.

          They are face to face.  He is still holding her roughly by the 
          hand.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Your wife knew, didn't she?  She 
                        knew what was going on.  Nicky got 
                        too close to the flame.  Nicky 
                        liked it.

          He twists her arm back behind her -- their bodies are pressed 
          against each other -- their eyes digging into each other.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (in a whisper)
                        That's why she killed herself?

          He is twisting her arm, staring at her, pulling her against 
          him.  We hear the DOOR behind them.  A beat, and he lets her 
          go, turns away from her.

          Roxy stands there, staring at them.  Her hair is up.  She wears 
          a black motorcycle jacket, a black T-shirt, and black jeans 
          and cowboy boots.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (brightly)
                        Hiya, hon.  You two have met, 
                        haven't you?

          Roxy looks at Nick.  Catherine goes to her, kisses her briefly 
          on the lips, stands there with her arm around her --both of 
          them looking at Nick.

          He walks by them, opens the door to go, his face a mask.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You're going to make a terrific 
                        character, Nick.

          He doesn't look at her; he's gone.

          INT. BETH GARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY

          He comes in.  He looks like he's going to kill someone.  A 
          RECEPTIONIST sits there.

                                    RECEPTIONIST
                        She's on the phone -- she'll be 
                        right with you, detective --He 
                        sweeps by her into Beth's inner 
                        office.  She hangs up when she 
                        sees the look on his face.

                                    NICK
                        Who has access to my file?

                                    BETH
                        What are you talking about, Nick --
                        what's wrong with you?

                                    NICK
                        Who's got access to my goddamn 
                        file?

          She gets up -- he goes closer to her; she backs away from him.

                                    BETH
                        Nobody.

          He goes closer to her; she backs away.

                                    BETH
                        It's a confidential psychiatric 
                        record, it'd be illegal --She backs 
                        into a wall.  She looks very scared.  
                        He comes very close to her -- puts 
                        an arm behind her to the wall.

                                    NICK
                        Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.

          She says nothing, looks scared.

                                    NICK
                               (suddenly)
                        It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?

                                    BETH
                        No, Nick, please --

                                    NICK
                               (loud, hard)
                        Who?

                                    BETH
                               (blurts it)
                        Nilsen.

          INT. THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DIVISION - DAY

          He storms into the big room.  He sees MARTY NILSEN.  He is 
          sitting behind his desk in his glass-enclosed office inside 
          this big room.  About a dozen plainclothes policemen are in 
          the big room.  He goes by them into Nilsen's office.

          INT. MARTIN NILSEN'S OFFICE

          He closes the door.  Nilsen sees the look on his face, backs 
          his chair away towards the wall.

                                    NILSEN
                        What do you want, Curran?                                                                     

          He goes to him, picks him up by his lapels, slams him against 
          the wall.

                                    NICK
                               (out of control)
                        You sold her the file, didn't you?

                                    NILSEN
                               (scared)
                        What are you talking about?

                                    NICK
                               (out of control)
                        What'd she pay you?

          He slams him against the wall again.  The glass EXPLODES behind 
          them -- a chair comes into the room.  Nick is frozen, holding 
          Nilsen by the throat against the wall.

                                    ONE OF THE I.A. GUYS
                        Let him go, Curran.  Nice and easy.

          He looks back, sees two Internal Affairs men with their guns 
          drawn, pointed at him.  A beat, and he lets Nilsen go.  He 
          turns calmly and starts to walk out.

                                    NILSEN
                        You're on sick leave, Shooter.  As 
                        of right now.  Pending the outcome 
                        of a psychiatric evaluation.

          EXT. THE POLICE PARKING LOT - DUSK

          He gets into his old Porsche.  He STARTS the car up.  Gus Moran 
          comes up to the window.  They look at each other a

                                    GUS
                        What's goin' down, son?

                                    NICK
                        Nothin'
                               (a beat)
                        I'll be okay, pop.

          They look at each other a long beat.

                                    GUS
                        No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke 
                        off yonder on the horizon.  They're 
                        gonna want your badge.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        I got tired of being played with.

                                    GUS
                               (after a beat)
                        You sure got real conclusive ways 
                        of demonstrating that.

          They almost smile at each other, then --

                                    NICK
                               (almost to himself)
                        She knows where I live and breathe.  
                        She's coming after me.

                                    GUS
                               (after a long beat)
                        What is it you got between you?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; to 
                               himself)
                        I don't know.

                                    GUS
                        Somethin', though.

          A beat, and then Nick looks at him.

                                    NICK
                        Yeah.
                               (a beat)
                        Somethin'.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He sits in front of the TV, watching a lame sitcom.  A bottle 
          of Jack Daniels is half-empty in front of him.  He is smoking 
          a cigarette.

                                    BETH
                               (behind him)
                        I still have my key.

          He looks at her, looks away at the sitcom.

                                    NICK
                        I don't want to see you, Beth.

          He keeps watching the sitcom.  A long beat.

                                    BETH
                               (suddenly angry)
                        Damnit!  Don't shut me out!  You 
                        owe me more than that?

          He goes to the TV, shuts it off.

                                    NICK
                        I don't owe you anything; you don't 
                        owe me anything.
                               (he looks at her)
                        We went to bed -- what was it? --
                        ten or fifteen times?
                               (he smiles)
                        It wasn't memorable enough to carry 
                        any obligations.

                                    BETH
                               (after a long beat)
                        Sometimes I really hate you.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        Yeah?  Well why don't you find 
                        some friendly therapist and work 
                        some of that hostility out.
                               (a beat)
                        But take my advice.  Put a little 
                        more life into it than you usually 
                        do.

          A beat, and she suddenly hurls herself at him in absolute fury, 
          trying to claw at his face.  He grabs her, blocks her.  They 
          look at each other a long beat and then he lets her go.

          The emotion of the moment is gone now -- they turn away from 
          each other.

                                    BETH
                               (finally)
                        I'm sorry... I don't usually... 
                        act like that.

          Nick looks at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                        How could you let him have my file, 
                        Beth?

          A long beat, then --

                                    BETH
                               (not looking at him)
                        He was going to recommend your 
                        discharge a behavioral disability.  
                        I made a deal with him.  He could 
                        review the session notes himself.  
                        It was the only way I could keep 
                        you on the force.

          She looks at him.  He looks away from her.

                                    NICK
                        You did it for me.

                                    BETH
                        Yes.  I care about you.  I did it 
                        for you.

          He turns away from her.

                                    NICK
                               (quietly)
                        Get out of here, Beth.
                               (a beat)
                        Please?

          He goes to the Jack Daniel's, pours some more.  She looks at 
          him pour it and turns to go.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He is asleep on the couch -- the TV is on to a blank screen.  
          The Jack Daniel's is mostly gone.  The phone on the coffee 
          table RINGS.  It RINGS again.  He wakes, picks it up, listens.

                                    NICK
                        Yeah.
                               (a beat)
                        Okay.

          He hangs it up.  He sits there a long beat, staring.  He looks 
          disturbed.

          EXT. THE ALLEY BEHIND THE TEN-FOUR BAR - NIGHT

          He walks down the alley.  There are lots of police cars, 
          flashing lights, uniformed men, coroner's men.

          As he walks down the alley, he sees Lt. Walker, Gus, and several 
          of the Internal Affairs men we saw earlier in Nilsen's office.  
          They are standing around a Lincoln Town Car.

          They look at him as he comes closer to them -- then move aside.

          He can see into the car now.  Martin Nilsen lies against the 
          front seat.  He has been shot in the head.  Nick stares.

                                    GUS
                        One shot.  Close range.  Probably 
                        a .38 caliber revolver.

          Nick stares at Nilsen's body.  They watch him.

                        Give me your gun, Nick.

          A beat, and then Nick gives him his gun.  Walker smells it, 
          shakes his head, gives it to one of the Internal Affairs men.

                        I don't son, but I got the minority 
                        opinion.

          INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          He sits in the same room that Catherine sat in --surrounded by 
          four or five Internal Affairs men, Lt.

          Walker, Gus, and Captain Talcott.  Lt. Walker and Gus sort of 
          sit back -- I.A. is running the investigation.  The same police 
          stenographer -- the same plain young woman -- is sitting in 
          the room who was there with Catherine.

                                    NICK
                        Okay.  I went after him.  I lost 
                        my temper.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        Do you have any evidence that he 
                        showed your psychiatric file to 
                        anyone?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        No.

          Beth Gardner comes into the room.  They look at her.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        We'll speak to you afterwards, Dr.
                        Gardner.

          Nick gives her a look.

                                    BETH
                        I'd like to sit-in if you don't 
                        mind.

                                    THE I.A. MAN
                        I'd really rather --

                                    TALCOTT
                        I don't see anything wrong with 
                        Dr. Gardner sitting-in if Detective 
                        Curran doesn't object.

          Nick looks at her, shrugs.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        Where were you tonight?

                        Yeah.

                        Were you drinking?

          He looks at Beth.

                                    NICK
                        Yeah, I was drinking.

                        When did you start drinking again?

                        A couple days ago.

                                    BETH
                        I saw Detective Curran at his 
                        apartment around ten o'clock.  He 
                        was sober and lucid.  I asked him 
                        in my capacity as his departmental 
                        therapist about his altercation 
                        with Lt. Nilsen.  He expressed 
                        regret and displayed no hostility.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                               (to Beth)
                        How long were you at his apartment?

                                    BETH
                        About fifteen minutes.  I saw there 
                        was no reason for my concern and 
                        left.

          She and Nick look at each other.  He looks away and lights a 
          cigarette.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        There's no smoking in this building.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        What are you gonna do -- charge me 
                        with smoking?

          It is the exact line that Catherine used.  A long beat.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the 
                        record did you kill him?

                                    NICK
                        No.

          They look at him a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Come on -- I'm going to storm into 
                        his office in front of everybody 
                        in the afternoon and then that 
                        night I'm going to kill him?  I'd 
                        have to be really dumb to do that.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        Going after him before gets you 
                        off the hook for killing him that's 
                        your alibi.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Like writing a book about killing 
                        a guy gets you off the hook for 
                        killing him.

                        I don't understand.  What are you 
                        talking about?  What book?

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick)
                        Private joke.

                        I don't think it's funny.

                        Well, hell, son, it's got a certain 
                        ring to it, I'll say that.

          INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

          He is by the elevators with Gus and Lt. Andrews.  He spots 
          Beth going for the stairway.

                        Beth.

          She stops.  He catches up to her.  They walk down the flights 
          together.  They speak quietly.

                                    NICK
                        Thank you.

          She looks at him, smiles.  They keep walking down the steps.

                        It's the least I could do...  
                        considering I got you into this 
                        mess with those reports.

                        How do you know Catherine Tramell 
                        saw my reports?

                        She must really be something.
                               (she smiles)
                        From a clinical point of view.

                        I hardly knew her.  She gave me 
                        the creeps, though.  I don't know 
                        why.

          EXT. THE BUILDING - NIGHT

          They get outside.  Beth kisses him quickly, softly on the cheek.

                                    BETH
                        Get some rest.  Promise?

          He nods.  She starts walking toward her car.

                        can handle it.

          She goes to her car.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NEXT DAY

          He is cleaning his desk out, putting things into a duffel bag.  
          Only Andrews is in the room.  We see Lt. Walker sitting in his 
          glass-enclosed office.

          He closes the duffel bag, looks at the place a long beat.

          Andrews is watching him.  He goes up to Andrews

                                    ANDREWS

                        The boat blew.  There was a leak 
                        in the gas line.  There were two 
                        previous repairs.  There was a 
                        five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A 
                        real heavy investigation.  Zilch.

                        She knew I'd say she did it.  And 
                        she knew nobody would buy it.

          Lt. Walker looks at him a long beat.

                        She's screwing with your head,

          EXT. HIS APARTMENT

          It is in the Marina District; on a street like Cervantes.

          He gets out of his old Porsche; he sees her black Ferrari there.  
          She is sitting on the front stoop.  She wears an Indian jacket, 
          jeans and a T-shirt.  He goes up to her. She looks at him a 
          beat.

                        I heard about what happened.  What

          her.  She turns suddenly.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - DAY

          They walk in.  She looks at the bareness of the place.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You should put some warmth into

                        on your personality.

          She turns, smiles at him.  He looks at the bottle of Jack 
          Daniel's; there's not much left.

          There is a palpable tension between them.

          He takes the ice out, opens a drawer, takes out an icepick.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Let me do that.  You like to watch 
                        me doing it, don't you?

          She smiles; a beat and he hands her the icepick.  She takes 
          it, starts to us the icepick, her back to him.  He lights a 
          cigarette.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Can I have a cigarette, please?  I

          He watches her working on the ice.

                        Light it for me, will you?

          He does, steps to her.  She parts her lips -- he puts it on 
          her lip, watches it.  Their eyes are on each other.

                                    CATHERINE

          It is dark, cavernous there are a thousand people in here.  
          The MUSIC is ear-splitting, pulsing.  Lights flash.

          The floor is huge.  At one time, this club was a church.

          He walks around the sides, a drink in his hand, looking for 
          her.  He doesn't see her.

          The he catches a glimpse of Roxy.  She is dancing with another 
          woman.  He watches her.  She is wearing pants and a jacket, 
          her hair off to the side.  She looks very masculine tonight.

          Roxy laughs at the other woman, leaves her on the floor, starts 
          moving through the sea of dancers.  He follows her through the 
          press of bodies.  She goes towards the men's room.  She walks 
          in.

          INT. THE MEN'S ROOM

          It is large, dark, shadowy It was once the sacristy.

          A crowd scene men and women. Roxy presses through them.

          A haze of crack smoke; we see people doing poppers.

          She opens the door to a toilet stall, walks in.  Nick is behind 
          her.  As the door opens, he sees Catherine.

          She wears a black motorcycle jacket, a very short skirt, 
          stiletto heels.  Her hair is up.  He make-up is severe,  In 
          the darkness, in the shadows she looks about 19.  A hot 19.

          A hot flash-trash 19.

          She is in there with two men -- one of them is a big, body-
          built black guy.  She has a vial of something near her face.

          She sees Nick watching her.  She whispers something to the 
          tall black guy.  He looks at Nick, smiles a condescending smile.  
          The door to the stall closes

          INT. THE CLUB

          He is walking along the side, watching the floor, a drink in 
          his hand.  The song ends and it seques right into the Stones's 
          "Miss You."

          He sees her.  Her black leather jacket is off.

          She wears a very tight, flimsy top, the short skirt, the heels.  
          She is dancing with Roxy and the black guy.  He watches her 
          move... watches her body.

          She turns, sees him, dances, watches him... gets between Roxy 
          and the black guy... they sandwich her with their bodies... 
          keeps moving, turning... eyes on him... playing to him with 
          her body.  He watches.

          A long beat, and he goes up to them.  His movements are

          almost trance-like.  They look at each other.  A long beat.

          Catherine stops dancing.  he reaches for her.  She moves away.  
          A beat their eyes are on each other.  She moves a step towards 
          her.  A beat, as they look at each other...  and they start to 
          move together.

          Their eyes are on each other as they move, the eyes burning... 
          the movements tighter, hotter... and he suddenly grabs her and 
          kisses her... as they keep moving... the song seques into the 
          Stones's "Gimme Shelter."

          She is melting into him now, kissing him... Tex watches, 
          expressionless... the black guy is gone... he holds her by the 
          back of the neck, kissing her... their bodies pressed into 
          each other... his hands are on her butt now, pulling her into 
          him now, almost holding her up now... and then under her skirt, 
          under her panties... as he kisses her neck.

          People around them stare... he moves his hands under her top 
          as she keeps moving with the song, her head back, her back 
          almost arching... cups her breasts now... she keeps moving...  
          the song sweeping them into its rhythm "it's just a shot away, 
          it's just a kiss away, a kiss away..."

          They devour each other.  Right there on the floor.  Barely 
          able to hold it back.  As Tex watches expressionless.  As people 
          stop dancing and stare.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM

          It is dark.  We can't see clearly.  A side table, lines of 
          cocaine on a small mirror.  A CD player The Stones play "Love 
          In Vain."

          There are mirrors all over the walls and ceiling.  They are in 
          bed.  The bed is big and brass.

          Atop her... he kisses her neck... his hands under her, raising 
          her... he moves down, kisses her breasts... puts his mouth 
          around  a breast... she arches, moves... he kisses her 
          shoulder... biting into it... she opens her mouth... we hear 
          no cry... we hear the Stones.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Monkey Man."

          Atop him... she kisses his chest, licks it, lowers her head... 
          lower... lower... he arches his back... her mouth comes up... 
          her mouth on his lips again... he turns her.

          Atop her... he moves her legs apart... (the CAMERA is behind 
          them)... she holds his back... digs in her nails...  rakes his 
          back with them... digs in again... his back bleeds... he moves 
          inside her... harder... the nails dig...  blood trickles down 
          his back.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Wild Horses."

          He is behind her... she is on her stomach... he rises her by 
          her hips... kisses her back... races her spine with his 
          tongue... traces her lower back... he kneels... moves into 
          her... kisses her neck... his fingers are in her mouth...  as 
          he moves.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Sympathy for the Devil."

          Atop him... she leans close over his face, her tongue in his 
          mouth... kneeling over him... she moves his arms above his 
          head... moves higher atop him... her breasts in his face... 
          she reaches over to the side... a white silk scarf is in her 
          hand... she moves higher above him... kneeling over his face... 
          moving oh-so-slightly... his face strains towards her.

          The scarf in both hands now... she starts to tie his hands 
          with it... his eyes are open, watching her... she ties it 
          loosely, gently... it isn't tight... but his hands are tied to 
          the brass bed.

          She kisses him... moving her hips lower now... over his chest... 
          lower...

          And he is inside her... her arms above him... his eyes open... 
          she kisses his neck... bites but not hard...  moves... grinding 
          hard against him now.. she is on her knees... head arches back.. 
          her breasts high.. still grinding.

          Her back arches, strains... he strains toward her... she holds 
          her arms high... she comes out of the arch...  shivering... 
          falling over him... the scarf loosens... his arms come forward 
          and hold her close.. closer... closer...  as she moves with 
          slight... shivery... movements.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          It is dark, quiet.  Pindrop quiet.  He is sitting on the side 
          of the bed, his head down... his back a line tracing of dried 
          blood.  She is asleep nest to him, naked.

          He looks around the room.  The white scarf around the bedpost... 
          the coke on the side-table... clothes all over the floor.

          He gets up, walks into the bathroom.

          INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          The light is too bright.  He looks at himself in the mirror.  
          He pours the water, lowers his head, puts cold water on his 
          face.  A long beat, he comes back up, opens his eyes.  Roxy is 
          in the mirror behind him.  She startles him.

          He looks at her in the mirror a long beat, doesn't turn.

          She is expressionless; she wears the same thing she wore at 
          the club.

          He lowers down into the basin again, puts more water on his 
          face, comes back up, uses a towel this time, finishes with the 
          towel.  She is still looking at him in the mirror the same 
          way.  He looks at her in the mirror, doesn't turn.

                                    ROXY
                               (quietly)
                        If you don't leave her alone, I'll 
                        kill you.

          He looks at her a beat, then turns --

                                    NICK
                        Tell me something, Rocki.  Man-to-
                        man.
                               (he smiles)
                        I think she's the fuck of the 
                        century, don't you?

          For a second, she looks like she's going to spring at him, 
          then controls it and turns to go.

                                    NICK
                        How long you been here, Rock?  You 
                        like to watch, do you?

                                    ROXY
                               (after a beat, looks 
                               at him)
                        She likes me to watch.

          And she turns and she is gone.

          INT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          He lies on the bed in the dark, quiet room.  He is on his back, 
          his eyes open.  He has his arm around her.  She is asleep.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (murmurs)
                        Nicky.

          He looks at her.

          INT. HER BEDROOM - MORNING

          He wakes up.  She is not there.  He looks around.  The white 
          scarf is gone.  The coke on the side table is gone.

          In its place, a scrawled note "The Beach -- C."

          EXT. HER STINSON BEACH HOUSE - DAY

          A cold and foggy day.  He gets out of his old Porsche, walks 
          down the driveway.  He sees her out on the beach by the water.  
          A small bonfire is near her.  He walks towards her.

          Roxy watches him, expressionless, from an upstairs window of 
          the house.  He doesn't see her.

          He walks up to Catherine.  She has an Indian blanket over her 
          and is wearing a black felt English derby hat, her hair loose 
          underneath.

                                    NICK
                               (expressionless)
                        'Morning.

          She doesn't look at him -- he smiles slowly.  She doesn't smile 
          and she doesn't seem to like his smile, either.  She walks 
          along the beach.  He walks with her.  A long beat.

                                    NICK
                        I think Roxy got jealous.

          She looks at him.  He looks like he is trying to hide a smile.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        She's seen me fuck plenty of other 
                        guys.

          That wipes the hidden smile off his face.  He looks at her, 
          walks with her.  A long beat.

                                    NICK
                        Maybe she saw something she didn't 
                        see before.

                                    CATHERINE
                        She's seen everything before.

          She looks at him; he's smiling now.

                                    NICK
                        She's never seen us before.

          He's serious.  She looks at him.  She smiles slowly.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Did you think it was so special?

                        I told her it was the fuck of the 
                        century.

          He can't hide his smile anymore.  She says nothing, keeps 
          walking.

                        beginning.

          They look at each other.  They keep walking.  A long beat.

                        How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to

          She looks at him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I'm not as judgmental about women

                        see you around, Shooter.

          A beat, and she walks away towards the house.  He watches her.

          INT. A COUNTRY AND WESTERN BAR - NIGHT

          Nick walks in.  Waylon Jennings is on the JUKEBOX.  Gus is 
          sitting at the bar wearing jeans, a cowboy shirt, and a cowboy 
          hat.

          Nick goes, sits next to him.

                                    NICK

                        heaven?

          He glances around.

                        went over to your place.

          He is drunk, slurring.  Nick sees it.

                                    NICK
                        Easy there, partner -- I wasn't 
                        there.

                                    GUS
                        I went over last night, too.

                                    NICK
                               (grins)
                        I wasn't there last night, either.

          Gus takes a long, drunken look at him.

                                    GUS
                        You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb

                        really should.

          INT. A DINER - NIGHT

          Gus is eating chili, drinking coffee.  Hick keeps pouring him 
          more coffee.

                                    NICK
                               (grins)
                        You feeling better?

                                    GUS
                               (loud)
                        I feel fine!

          Nick pours him more coffee; Gus guzzles it.

                                    GUS
                               (loud)
                        How could you fuck her?

          It gets some looks from the other people in her -- Nick shushes 
          him, pours him more coffee.  He drinks it.

                                    GUS
                               (quietly)
                        You wanna die, son?  What is it --
                        those goddamn tourists -- you still 
                        feel so bad about that you're 
                        wigglin' your way into an icepi --
                               (suddenly louder)
                        We got too many goddamn tourists 
                        comin' here anyway -- plenty more 
                        goddamn tourists where they goddamn 
                        came from.

          Some people here really give him the looks now.  Gus looks 
          angrily away from them, drinks more coffee.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; 
                               quietly)
                        I'm not afraid of her.

                                    GUS
                               (loud)
                        Why the hell not?

                                    NICK
                        I don't know.  I'm just not.

                                    GUS
                               (loud)
                        That's her pussy talkin' --He gets 
                        a real nasty look from a very fat 
                        woman eating a cheeseburger.  He 
                        winks at her.  The woman looks 
                        away from him, shaking her head.

                                    GUS
                               (smiles; to Nick)
                        It ain't your brain.

          They look at each other a long beat.  Gus drinks more coffee.  
          He sits back, pulls his cowboy hat over his eyes.

          A long beat.

                                    GUS
                               (quietly)
                        I.A. done did a track on Lt. Martin 
                        D for Dickhead Nilsen.  They found 
                        a safety deposit box with fifty-
                        thousand dollars in it, taken out 
                        three months ago, used that one 
                        time.

          He looks at the fat woman again -- leers at her obscenely.

          She looks away.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        It doesn't make sense.  She didn't 
                        know me three months ago.

                                    GUS
                        Maybe it wasn't her that paid him.
                        Maybe the money was for somethin' 
                        else.  How the fuck do I know?  
                        I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' 
                        not to fall outta his saddle.

          Nick looks at him and smiles a thin smile; he's not there, 
          he's completely preoccupied.

          INT. A CAR - NIGHT

          Someone is watching as he and Gus come out of the diner.

          EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

          He stands by Gus as Gus gets into his battered, rusted, vintage 
          Cadillac.

                                    NICK
                        You all right, pop?  You want me 
                        to drive you?

                                    GUS
                        In that little pissant car of yours?  
                        Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back 
                        pain disability retirement -- I'm 
                        gettin' me a full pension and a 
                        real gold-plate Seiko watch.

                                    NICK
                        Come on, I'll drive you in this 
                        thing.                                                                     

                                    GUS
                        You think I'd let you drive my 
                        Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no 
                        hear-up-his-ass person drive my 
                        Cadillac car.

          And he steps on the gas and ROARS out of there, forcing Nick 
          to get out of the way.  Nick looks after him a long beat, shakes 
          his head.

          INT. A CAR - NIGHT

          Someone is following him slowly as he walks down the street.  
          He turns a corner, walks down the alley towards his Porsche, 
          parked behind the country and western bar.

          The car suddenly speeds up -- ROARS down on him from the back, 
          full bore.

          EXT. THE ALLEY

          He hurls himself across the Porsche's hood... barely avoiding 
          the car.  He sees the car at the end of the alley, turning out 
          It is a black Ferrari.

          INT. HIS PORSCHE

          He GUNS it down the alley, makes a wild turn in the direction 
          the Ferrari turned.

          EXT. THE STREET

          The Porsche dodges around cars very fast, almost side-swiping 
          them, looking almost out of control, its MOTOR screaming.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          He sees the Ferrari turn ahead.  When he gets to where it 
          turned, he turns wildly.

          EXT. THE STREET

          The Ferrari is making fast, wild turns into little streets in 
          North Beach, its MOTOR screaming -- the Porsche is gaining 
          ground behind it, making turns.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          The Ferrari is up ahead and makes a wild right turn onto a 
          road going up a hillside.  He yanks the wheel hard.

          EXT. THE STEPS

          The Porsche rockets up the steps -- bouncing high into the 
          air, almost out of control.                                                                     

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          As it crests the steps and gets to the street.  Nick GUNS it 
          and it looks like it flies high down the hill-side into 
          blackness.

          EXT. THE STREET

          But it lands on more steps -- heading downward -- bucking, 
          almost spinning, it bounces onto the next street.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          Another set of steps leading up he GUNS it, it rockets up, 
          ROARS, bucking --

          EXT. THE STREET

          And lands on the next street.  Nick makes a wild right turn 
          onto the street.  And the black Ferrari appears from around a 
          curve to the right, heading right for him.

          INT. THE PORSCHE

          Nick steps on the GAS and heads head-on for the Ferrari.

          The Ferrari SCREAMS head-on for him.

          EXT. THE STREET

          And at the last moment, in the game of chicken, the Ferrari 
          tries to swerve around him on this narrow road, goes out of 
          control and over the side, turning over and over as it rolls 
          down the hillside.

          EXT. THE HILLSIDE

          The Ferrari has landed right-side up.

          He runs down the hillside and gets to it.  A beat, and he opens 
          the car door.

          Roxy lies hunched over the wheel, her eyes open.  Her neck is 
          broken.  She is dead.

          EXT. THE HILLSIDE - NIGHT

          Police lights have been set up.  He stands there with Lt.  
          Walker and several of the Internal Affairs men.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Tell me again.  I want to hear you 
                        say it again.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; 
                               sheepish)
                        It was an accident.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You're driving around North Beach 
                        for no particular reason and this 
                        car won't get out of the way --

                                    NICK
                        I don't think she meant to go off 
                        the hill, do you?

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (quietly)
                        Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't 
                        need a reason to put your ass in a 
                        sling.

          He and Nick look at each other a long beat.  Andrews comes up 
          to them with a piece of paper in his hand.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Full name, Roxanne Hardy.  Last 
                        address -- Cloverdale, California.  
                        No priors, no convictions.  The 
                        car is registered to Catherine 
                        Tramell.

          Lt. Walker looks at Nick like he's going to kill him.  Nick 
          looks calmly away.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        You knew her, didn't you?

                                    NICK
                        Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's 
                        house.  All we did was write her 
                        name down.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a beat)
                        I told you to stay away from 
                        Tramell.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat; smiles)
                        Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to 
                        stay away from her car.

          Walker looks at him in absolute disbelief.

                                    AN I.A. MAN
                        I want you in Dr. Gardner's office 
                        at nine o'clock.  You're out of 
                        control, Curran.

                                    NICK
                               (to the I.A. Man)
                        Who are you guys gonna sell my 
                        file to this time?

          They stare at him.  He watches as Roxy's body is taken away.

          INT. A POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM -DAY

          He walks in.  He looks good, in control.  Beth Gardner is 
          sitting there with two middle-aged MEN, both of them wearing 
          suits, who smile and scrutinize him the instant he walks in 
          the door.

                                    BETH
                        Hello, Nick.  This is Dr. Myron 
                        and R. McElwaine.  They've been 
                        asked to consult with me on this 
                        evaluation.

          They shake hands with him.

                        Sit down, Nick.

          Nick gives him a look: What did he think he was going to do -- 
          stand there?

          He sits down, looks at them.  A beat, as they look at him, 
          then --

                                    DR. MCELWAINE
                               (courtly)
                        Nick -- when you recollect your 
                        childhood, are your recollections 
                        pleasing to you?

          Nick looks at them a long beat in disbelief.

                                    NICK
                               (calmly, directly)
                        Number one I don't remember how 
                        often I used to jack off, but it 
                        was a lot.  Number two I didn't 
                        get pissed off at my dad -- even 
                        after I was old enough to know 
                        what he and mom were doing in the 
                        bedroom.  Number three I don't 
                        look in the toilet before I flush 
                        it.  Number four I don't wet the 
                        bed and haven't for some time.
                        Number five You can go fuck 
                        yourselves because I'm out of here.

          INT. THE CORRIDOR

          He is walking away quickly.  Beth is with him, trying to keep 
          up.  She is very angry.

                                    BETH
                        What is your problem?  I'm trying 
                        to help you.  Why won't you let me 
                        help you?

                                    NICK
                        I don't need any help.

                                    BETH
                        Yes you do.  Something's on with 
                        you.
                               (a beat)
                        You're sleeping with her, aren't 
                        you?

          A beat, he stops looks at her, then keeps walking.

                                    NICK
                        What is this interest you've got 
                        in her?

                                    BETH
                        My interest is in you, not in her.
                        She seduces people, she manipulates --

                                    NICK
                        I thought you hardly know her.

                                    BETH
                        I know the type.  I'm a 
                        psychologist.

          He stops, looks at her.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        That means you manipulate people 
                        too, doesn't it, Beth?  You're a 
                        practicing psychologist -- that 
                        means you're better at it than she 
                        is.

          She looks at him a long beat.

                                    BETH
                               (quietly)
                        I feel sorry for you, Nick.

          A beat, and she turns and walks away.

          EXT. ROAD TO STINSON HOUSE - DAY

          Nick is driving down winding road to Stinson house.  He is 
          driving very fast, passing other cars on the winding and 
          twisting road.

          INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - DAY

          Nick enters and shuts door.  Looking around, he does not see 
          her.

                                    NICK
                        Catherine!
                               (after a beat)
                        Catherine!

          Finally he sees her sitting by the window.  He walks over to 
          her.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (near tears)
                        I should have known.  I came into 
                        the house when you were down on 
                        the beach.  She looked at me so 
                        strangely.  She left right after 
                        you.
                               (a beat)
                        I shouldn't have let her watch us.  
                        She wanted to watch me all the 
                        time.  She tried to kill you, didn't 
                        she?

                                    NICK

                               (a long beat)
                        Do you think I told her to kill 
                        You?

                        No.

                        Everybody that I care about dies.

          She is about to break into uncontrolable sobbing.  Nick puts 
          his arms around her.

                                    NICK
                               (soothing)
                        It's OK.  It's OK.

                               (quietly, almost 
                               begging)
                        Make love to me.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          They are seen rolling and turning around on each other.

          Their love making is sensual, sincere.

          Later in bed.

                                    NICK
                               (calmly, but 
                               seriously)
                        Do you think she killed Johnny 
                        Boz?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (surprised, startled)
                        For what... to set me up?  She 
                        loved me she wouldn't frame me.

                                    NICK
                               (a beat)
                        Maybe she got jealous of Johnny 
                        Boz, too.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (after a beat)
                        No, she didn't... she never got 
                        jealous before... she got excited.

                        I don't have luck with women.
                        There was this girl I met while I 
                        was in college.  I slept with her 
                        once.  She started following me 
                        around, taking my picture.  She 
                        dyed her hair, copied my clothes.
                        Lisa something... Oberman.  It was 
                        awful.

          A long beat, he looks at her.

                                    NICK
                        I thought you didn't do adolescent 
                        secrets.

                        I never have before.

          EXT. THE DECK - MORNING

          It is a bright, sunshiny day.  He is out there looking at the 
          water.  She comes up behind him, hugs him.

                                    CATHERINE

                        it here like this.

          He looks at her.

                        we?

          She looks hurt.

                        No.

                        No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of 
                        playing games!

          They have their eyes on each other.

                                    NICK
                        Then tell me about Nilsen.

          She turns away from him.  He watches her.

                                    CATHERINE
                        You won't believe me.

          A beat, she looks at him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I paid him $50,000 in cash for 
                        your psychiatric file.

                        About three months before I met 
                        you.

                                    NICK
                        Why?

          She turns away from him.

                        I'd read about your shootings in 
                        the papers.  I decided to write a 
                        book about a detective.  I wanted 
                        to know my character.

                                    NICK
                        You paid $50,000 for your character?

                        I would've paid more.  I wanted to 
                        know everything about you.  Then 
                        you came down here after Johnny 
                        got killed... it gave me a chance 
                        to get to know my character better.

                        What about the other night. What 
                        about last night?  Was that to get 
                        to know your character?

                        Maybe I'm losing interest in my 
                        book.

          Their eyes are on each other.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Do you believe me?

                        I'll convince you.

          And she kisses him slowly, with more and more heat, on the 
          lips.

          The cordless phone on the deck table goes off.  It keeps 
          RINGING.  She breaks finally from the kiss, picks it up.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Hello?

          She looks about thirteen.  She has braces in her teeth.

          He sits there with Gus in front of a woman juvenile officer.

                        She wore the same kind of clothes 
                        I did.  It scared me.

                        you know what she's doing?  She

                        knows I knew Noah.  She makes up 
                        that story about me.  She's handing

                        Henderson is.  You're a good cop --
                        what did she do?  Tell you casually 
                        and make it seem irrelevant?
                               (she smiles)

                        Somebody always does.

          EXT. THE SALINAS CLINIC - DAY

          He walks in; it is a small valley hospital.  He goes up to the 
          desk.  There are two women there.

                                    NICK
                        Hi, I'm looking for a Dr. Gardner?

                                    ONE WOMAN
                               (after a beat)
                        We don't have a Dr. Gardner on 
                        staff here.

                                    THE OTHER WOMAN
                        Dr. Joseph Gardner?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Yeah.

                                    THE WOMAN
                        He died -- about five or six years 
                        ago.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        He was shot.

          INT. SALINAS SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

          Nick sits with a sheriff's DETECTIVE.

                                    DETECTIVE
                        He was walking home from work.
                        They only lived a coupla blocks 
                        from the clinic.  Somebody drove 
                        by and shot him.

                                    NICK
                        What was the weapon?

                                    DETECTIVE
                        .38 revolver.  Never recovered.

                        Were there ever any suspects?

                        No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.

                        I had another one of you guys down 
                        here from Frisco -- about a year 
                        ago -- he asked me the same 
                        question.  What's this about anyway?

                                    NICK
                        Routine.

                                    DETECTIVE
                        Yeah, he said it was routine too.
                        Now it's two guys saying it's 
                        routine.

                                    NICK
                        Do you remember his name?

                               (after a long beat)
                        Nope, can't say that I do.

                                    DETECTIVE
                        The usual -- a girlfriend.

                        He had a girlfriend?

          EXT. HER HOUSE IN STINSON - AFTERNOON

          He walks around the house; he sees her sitting out on the deck, 
          a portable word-processor in front of her.  She is smoking.

          He goes up to her.

                                    NICK
                               (smiles)
                        Hi.  I missed you.  I finished my 
                        research.

          He moves toward her.  She moves away, kills her cigarette.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I finished my book.

                        How did it end?

                               (after a beat)
                        I told you.  She kills him.

          They look at each other a long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        Goodbye, Nick.

          He stares at her.  A long beat.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I finished my book.

                        Goodbye.

          He stares at her.  He can't believe what she is saying.

                                    CATHERINE
                        What do you want, Nick?  Flowers?  
                        I'll send you some flowers.

                               smiles)
                        Are we playing games again?

                        The games are over.  You were right.  
                        It was the fuck of the century, 
                        Shooter.

          He stares at her.

                                    A VOICE INSIDE
                        Catherine?

          Nick looks -- Hazel Dobkins is there.

          Catherine still has her eyes on him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Right there.

          A beat, and then she turns to go inside.  Hazel Dobkins smiles 
          slowly at him.

          EXT. THE POLICE PARKING LOT - DUSK

          He sits in his Porsche, staring ahead.  He is parked next to 
          Gus' Cadillac.  Gus is suddenly there, onway to his car.

                                    GUS
                               (excited)
                        Catherine Tramell's roommate her 
                        freshman year.  I got a call from 
                        her.  I've been calling people who 
                        were in her dorm all day.  She 
                        must've heard I was trying to talk 
                        to her.  She says she knows all 
                        about Catherine and Lisa Henderson.  
                        She's over in Oakland.  You wanna 
                        come with me?

          Nick just stares ahead.

                                    GUS
                        You look like you seen a ghost, 
                        son?

          Nick looks at him.

          INT. GUS' CADILLAC - NIGHT

          Gus drives.

                                    GUS
                               (excited)
                        Johnny Boz's psychiatrist has an 
                        office on Van Ness.  Guess who he 
                        shares office space with?  Dr.  
                        Elizabeth Gardner.

          Nick doesn't even respond.  Gus looks at him.

                                    GUS
                        What in hell's the matter with 
                        you?

          Nick doesn't say anything, stares ahead.

          EXT. AN OFFICE BUILDING - OAKLAND - NIGHT

          Gus gets out with Nick.  It is an old building.

                                    GUS
                        Where the hell you goin'?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        I'm going with you.

                                    GUS
                        She said alone -- suite 405.  It 
                        ain't gonna take long.

          A beat, and Nick gets back in the car.

          INT. THE OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

          Gus is on the first floor.  There is no one around.  He hits 
          the elevator button.  A beat, and it comes.  He steps in.

          INT. THE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          He hits the button for the fourth floor.

          The elevator rises a floor, stops.  The door opens.  There is 
          no one there.  Then it starts going up again.  It rises to the 
          third floor.  It stops.  The door opens.  There is no one there.  
          Then it starts to rise again.

          EXT. GUS' CADILLAC - NIGHT

          Nick sits there, staring ahead.

                                    NICK
                               (suddenly, screaming)
                        Gus!

          INT. THE ELEVATOR

          As it goes up.  It stops.  The door starts to open.  As it 
          does -- a figure in a hooded raincoat sweeps into the elevator.  
          It happens very fast.  We see blonde hair around the face.

          But we don't see the face itself -- the head is down, the hood 
          up.  There is an icepick in the figure's hand.  The figure 
          explodes into Gus.  The icepick goes into his neck.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY

          Nick tears desperately up the stairway -- he hits the fourth 
          floor door.  It explodes open.

          INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR

          He stands there a beat, sees the elevator door open.  He runs 
          there,  He sees Gus, crumpled into the corner of the elevator.

          INT. THE ELEVATOR

          He goes into the elevator -- holds Gus.  He is dead.  A long 
          beat.  He sees the gun in Gus' hand -- he takes the gun out of 
          his hand.  He runs out of the elevator.

          INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR

          He hears something.  Gun in hand, he runs towards the SOUND.  
          He stops, gun in hand, listens again.  He runs again, hears 
          nothing.

          Behind him, we see a figure.

          He spins suddenly, gun, in hand.  Beth Gardner is there.

          She wears a windbreaker.  She has her hands in the pockets.

                                    BETH
                        What are you doing here?

                                    NICK
                               (screaming)
                        Put your hands up!

          She stares at him.

                                    NICK
                               (screams)
                        Put your fucking hands up!  Don't 
                        move.

                                    BETH
                        I got a message on my machine to 
                        meet Gus here.  Where is he?

          She smiles a strange smile.  She takes a step toward him.

                                    NICK
                               (screams)
                        Don't!
                               (a beat)
                        I know about your husband.  You 
                        still like girls, Beth?

                                    BETH
                        What?

          She smiles strangely again, takes a step toward him.

                                    NICK
                               (screams)
                        Take your hands out of your pockets!

          She moves a hand in a pocket and moves towards him fast --

                                    BETH
                        What is wrong with you?

          And he FIRES the gun.  She is hit in the chest, goes down.

          A long beat, and then he goes to her.  He gets down on the 
          ground.  Her eyes are open.  He empties the pockets of the 
          windbreaker -- first one, then the other the pockets are empty.

                                    BETH
                               (in a whisper)
                        I loved you.

          And she dies.

          INT. THE FOURTH FLOOR - LATER

          A lot of policemen, coroner's guys, photos being taken.

          Nick stands there with Lt. Walker, Harrigan, and some of the 
          Internal Affairs guys.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (upset)
                        What made you think she had a gun?

          Nick says nothing; he looks like a zombie.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        What the hell was she doing here?  
                        What was Gus doing here?  

          Andrews yells to them from the stairway door.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Lieutenant.

          INT. THE STAIRWAY

          A FORENSICS MAN very carefully handles a hooded rain coat in a 
          stair landing.  He wears gloves.

          Nick is there with Lt. Walker.

          The Forensics Man picks the raincoat up -- a long blonde wig 
          falls out of it.  There are flecks of blood on it.

          He reaches into the pocket and pulls out an  icepick.  It has 
          a thin steel handle and is bloody.  He hands the icepick to an 
          assistant.

          He looks at the raincoat.  It has blood on it.

                                    THE FORENSICS MAN
                        It's departmental issue.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (quietly)
                        Jesus.

          INT. BETH GARDNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Nick with Lt. Walker.  Nick looks like a zombie.  Andrews comes 
          up to them.  He has a gun in his hands.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Thirty-eight caliber revolver.

          Bottom drawer, bureau in the bedroom.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Have  ballistics check it for 
                        Nilsen.

          Harrigan comes out.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        Lieutenant, you'd better come in 
                        here.

          Lt. Walker goes into the kitchen.  Nick follows him.

          There are several cops around a kitchen cabinet.  A drawer is 
          open.

          Walker looks -- we look with him.  We see a copy of Love hurts, 
          Catherine's paperback book, and a stack of photos of Catherine.

          Walker picks the photos up, goes through them -- we see shots 
          of Catherine in college -- Catherine at a fight --Catherine 
          with Johnny Boz -- Catherine with Roxy.

          He hands the photos to Nick.

          Nick stares at them.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        I guess that's it.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT

          Nick sits, his feet up.  He looks like a zombie.  With him are 
          Lt. Walker, Andrews, and Captain Talcott.  We see other 
          plainclothesmen in the b.g. -- a flurry of activity, people on 
          phones.  A long beat.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        She must've heard you on the 
                        stairway and dumped the stuff.

          Nick says nothing, stares off.

          A DETECTIVE comes over to them.

                                    DETECTIVE
                        There was no suite 405 in that 
                        building.  Catherine Tramell's 
                        roommate in her freshman year is 
                        dead.  She died of leukemia two 
                        years ago.

          An INTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN comes over to them.

                                    INTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN
                        Our files on Dr. Gardner show 
                        nothing about a police report in 
                        Berkeley -- nothing related to 
                        Salinas, either.

          A long beat -- the phone RINGS.  Andrews picks it up, listens.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Thanks.

          He hangs up.

                                    ANDREWS
                        Ballistics says the .38 we found 
                        in her apartment matches Nilsen.  
                        No registration.  They're checking 
                        with Salinas.  The icepick is the 
                        same brand and model as the Boz 
                        weapon.

          A long beat -- Nick just stares.

          Harrigan comes up to them.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        We checked the tape machines at 
                        Dr.  Gardner's apartment and at 
                        her office -- both here and the 
                        one on Van Ness.  No message from 
                        Gus on any of 'em.  The one at her 
                        apartment was broken.
                               (a beat)
                        Johnny Boz's psychiatrist says he 
                        thinks he remembers Dr. Gardner 
                        and Boz meeting at a Christmas 
                        party at his house a year ago.

          A long beat.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (after a long beat, 
                               sadly)
                        You just can't tell about people, 
                        can you.  Even the ones you think 
                        you know inside-out.

          He and Nick look at each other a beat.

                                    CAPTAIN TALCOTT
                        Congratulations, Curran.

          Nick looks at him, expressionless.

          EXT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He parks his car.  It is dark.  Foggy.

          He starts heading inside.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT

          He goes in.  He starts to walk up the dark stairway, we see 
          him walking up several flights of steps.

          INT. THE CORRIDOR TO HIS APARTMENT

          He opens his door with his key.

          INT. HIS APARTMENT

          He walks in.  The apartment is dark.

                                    A VOICE
                               (behind him)
                        Hi.

          It is a whisper, almost a hiss.  He spins, fast.  Catherine 
          stands there, pressing herself against a wall.  They look at 
          each other a long beat.  She looks like she is almost in a 
          trance.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I heard about it... on TV.

          He looks at her, expressionless.  A long beat, their eyes are 
          into each other.  She looks like she is almost shivering.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I can't allow myself to care about 
                        you -- I can't allow myself to 
                        care -- I can't -- I can't --

          She looks very emotional.  He moves towards her, puts his arms 
          around her, holds her very close.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (in a whisper)
                        I don't want to do this -- please --
                        I don't want to do this -- I lose 
                        everybody -- I don't want to lose 
                        you -- I don't want to --

          He presses her closer and closer to himself, holds her.

          INT. HIS BEDROOM - NIGHT

          It is dark; we can't see clearly.

          Atop her... he makes love to her... gently... tenderly...  
          hardly moving inside her... there are tears in her eyes...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER

          Atop him... she is on her knees, straddling him... he is on 
          his back, his eyes are closed... her head arches back...  her 
          breasts high... he strains toward her with his body...  she 
          holds her arms high... her right hand is in a fist...

          (we only see the back of her hand and arm)... it comes down 
          suddenly... he bucks... writhes... then her whole body falls 
          on top of him.

          A very long beat...

          We can't see him... her body completely covers him...

          And then finally he moves... turns her to the side...  kisses 
          her.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER

          The Stones play "Sympathy For The Devil"  in the b.g.; the 
          MUSIC is low.

          They lie next to each other on the bed.  The CAMERA faces them.  
          He lies, staring at the ceiling, on the left side of the bed, 
          smoking a cigarette.  She is curled away from him toward the 
          right side of the bed.  A long beat, then --

                                    CATHERINE
                        What do we do now, Nick?

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        We fuck like minks.  We raise 
                        rugrats.  We live happily ever 
                        after.

          We see her right arm go to the side of the bed and then over.  
          He stares at the ceiling.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I hate rugrats.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        We fuck like minks.  We forget the 
                        rugrats.  We live happily ever 
                        after.

          We see from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now Her face 
          is expressionless.  Her right arm dangles over the right side 
          of the bed.  Her right hand is clenched.  Is she holding 
          something in it against her arm?

          We see them from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now: He 
          turns his body away from her to put out his cigarette.

          We see her behind him slowly turning towards him and the CAMERA.  
          A beat, and he turns towards her.

          They look at each other.  A long beat as the SONG gets louder.  
          We see them in CLOSEUP.  We don't see her right arm.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (in a whisper)
                        I love you.

          A beat, and he kisses her.  The CAMERA BACKS AWAY from them 
          slowly to the right side of the bedroom as they kiss, and we --

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

          ... A long beat, as the SONG keeps playing... and we...

          FADE IN:

          We see them from the right side of the bedroom.  And then the 
          CAMERA LOWERS SLOWLY as they kiss with more and more passion.

          It keeps going LOWER.

          There is something under the bed.  The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER 
          towards it as "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" plays louder.  We see 
          it now in CLOSEUP as the bed rustles above...

          It is a thin, steel-handled icepick.

          The SONG plays LOUDER and LOUDER, and we --

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                     THE END
THE BIG LEBOWSKI

 

			THE BIG LEBOWSKI

We are floating up a steep scrubby slope.  We hear male voices 
gently singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and a deep, affable, 
Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps:

				VOICE-OVER
		A way out west there was a fella, 
		fella I want to tell you about, fella 
		by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At 
		least, that was the handle his lovin' 
		parents gave him, but he never had 
		much use for it himself.  This 
		Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.  
		Now, Dude, that's a name no one would 
		self-apply where I come from.  But 
		then, there was a lot about the Dude 
		that didn't make a whole lot of sense 
		to me.  And a lot about where he 
		lived, like- wise.  But then again, 
		maybe that's why I found the place 
		s'durned innarestin'.

We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at 
twilight stretches out before us.

				VOICE-OVER
		They call Los Angeles the City of 
		Angels.  I didn't find it to be that 
		exactly, but I'll allow as there are 
		some nice folks there.  'Course, I 
		can't say I seen London, and I never 
		been to France, and I ain't never 
		seen no queen in her damn undies as 
		the fella says.  But I'll tell you 
		what, after seeing Los Angeles and 
		thisahere story I'm about to unfold--
		wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' 
		bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any 
		a those other places, and in English 
		too, so I can die with a smile on my 
		face without feelin' like the good 
		Lord gypped me.

INTERIOR   RALPH'S

It is late, the supermarket all but deserted.  We are tracking 
in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the 
dairy case.  He is the Dude.  His rumpled look and relaxed 
manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep.

He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their 
expiration dates.

				VOICE-OVER
		Now this story I'm about to unfold 
		took place back in the early nineties--
		just about the time of our conflict 
		with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I 
		only mention it 'cause some- times 
		there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro, 
		'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes 
		there's a man.

The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of 
milk.  He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs.

				VOICE-OVER
		And I'm talkin' about the Dude here-- 
		sometimes there's a man who, wal, 
		he's the man for his time'n place, 
		he fits right in there--and that's 
		the Dude, in Los Angeles.

CHECKOUT GIRL

She waits, arms folded.  A small black-and white TV next to 
her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with 
helicopter rotors spinning behind him.

				GEORGE BUSH
		This aggression will not stand. . . 
		This will not stand!

The Dude, peeking over his shades, scribbles something at 
the little customer's lectern.  Milk beads his mustache.

				VOICE-OVER
		...and even if he's a lazy man, and 
		the Dude was certainly that--quite 
		possibly the laziest in Los Angeles 
		County.

The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and 
is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents.

				VOICE-OVER
		...which would place him high in the 
		runnin' for laziest worldwide--but 
		sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes 
		there's a man.

EXTERIOR  RALPH'S

Long shot of the glowing Ralph's.  There are only two or 
three cars parked in the huge lot.

				VOICE-OVER
		Wal, I lost m'train of thought here.  
		But--aw hell, I done innerduced him 
		enough.

The Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot.  
Next to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and 
cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk.  
The two men's footsteps echo in the still of the night.

After a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points.

				DUDE
		It's the LeBaron.

DUDE'S HOUSE

The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow 
court.  He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small 
leatherette satchel in the other.  He awkwardly hugs the 
grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door.

INSIDE

The Dude enters and flicks on a light.

His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit.  
We track with him as he is rushed through the living room, 
his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body.  
Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece 
of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a 
hole.

The Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small 
bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of 
doorframe.  His head is plunged into the toilet.  The paper 
bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet 
rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the 
floor.

The Dude blows bubbles.

				VOICE
		We want that money, Lebowski.  Bunny 
		said you were good for it.

Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and 
gasps for air.

				VOICE
		Where's the money, Lebowski!

His head is plunged back into the toilet.

				VOICE
		Where's the money, Lebowski!

The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping.

				VOICE
		WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!

				DUDE
		It's uh, it's down there somewhere.  
		Lemme take another look.

His head is plunged back in.

				VOICE
		Don't fuck with us.  If your wife 
		owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that 
		means you owe money to Jackie 
		Treehorn.

The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and 
flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against 
the toilet.

The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand.

Looming over him is a strapping blond man.

Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly 
and walks over to a rug.

				CHINESE MAN
		Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.

He starts peeing on the rug.

The Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his 
sunglasses.

				DUDE
		Oh, man.  Don't do--

				BLOND MAN
		You see what happens?  You see what 
		happens, Lebowski?

The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses.

				DUDE
		Look, nobody calls me Lebowski.  You 
		got the wrong guy.  I'm the Dude, 
		man.

				BLOND MAN
		Your name is Lebowski.  Your wife is 
		Bunny.

				DUDE
		Bunny?  Look, moron.

He holds up his hands.

				DUDE
		You see a wedding ring?  Does this 
		place look like I'm fucking married?   
		All my plants are dead!

The blond man stoops to unzip the satchel.  He pulls out a 
bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious 
native.

				BLOND MAN
		The fuck is this?

The Dude pats at his pockets, takes out a joint and lights 
it.

				DUDE
		Obviously you're not a golfer.

The blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile.

				BLOND MAN
		Woo?

The Chinese man is zipping his fly.

				WOO
		Yeah?

				BLOND MAN
		Wasn't this guy supposed to be a 
		millionaire?

				WOO
		Uh?

They both look around.

				WOO
		Fuck.

				BLOND MAN
		What do you think?

				WOO
		He looks like a fuckin' loser.

The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger 
and peeks over them.

				DUDE
		Hey.  At least I'm housebroken.

The two men look at each other.  They turn to leave.

				WOO
		Fuckin' waste of time.

The blond man turns testily at the door.

				BLOND MAN
		Thanks a lot, asshole.

						 ON THE DOOR SLAM WE CUT TO:

BOWLING PINS

Scattered by a strike.

Music and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins 
flying, bowlers hoisting balls, balls gliding down lanes, 
sliding feet, graceful releases, ball return spinning up a 
ball, fingers sliding into fingerholes, etc.

The music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant 
jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike.

A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail 
turns from the strike to walk back to the bench.

				MAN
		Hot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight.  
		Mark it, Dude.

We are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man 
nursing a large plastic cup of Bud.  He has dark worried 
eyes and a goatee.  Hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts.  
He also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves 
cut off over an old bowling shirt.  This is Walter.  He 
squints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he 
addresses the Dude at the scoring table.

The Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, wears 
some of its foam on his mustache.

				WALTER
		This was a valued rug.

He elaborately clears his throat.

				WALTER
		This was, uh--

				DUDE
		Yeah man, it really tied the room 
		together--

				WALTER
		This was a valued, uh.

Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next Walter.

				DONNY
		What tied the room together, Dude?

				WALTER
		Were you listening to the story, 
		Donny?

				DONNY
		What--

				WALTER
		Were you listening to the Dude's 
		story?

				DONNY
		I was bowling--

				WALTER
		So you have no frame of reference, 
		Donny.  You're like a child who 
		wanders in in the middle of a movie 
		and wants to know--

				DUDE
		What's your point, Walter?

				WALTER
		There's no fucking reason--here's my 
		point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--

				DONNY
		Yeah Walter, what's your point?

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		What's the point of--we all know who 
		was at fault, so what the fuck are 
		you talking about?

				WALTER
		Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you 
		talking--I'm not--we're talking about 
		unchecked aggression here--

				DONNY
		What the fuck is he talking about?

				DUDE
		My rug.

				WALTER
		Forget it, Donny.  You're out of 
		your element.

				DUDE
		This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I 
		can't go give him a bill so what the 
		fuck are you talking about?

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you talking about?!  
		This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm 
		talking about drawing a line in the 
		sand, Dude.  Across this line you do 
		not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is 
		not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- 
		American.  Please.

				DUDE
		Walter, this is not a guy who built 
		the rail- roads, here, this is a guy 
		who peed on my--

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you--

				DUDE
		Walter, he peed on my rug--

				DONNY
		He peed on the Dude's rug--

				WALTER
		YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This 
		Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.

				DUDE
		So who--

				WALTER
		Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other 
		Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire.  
		He's gonna be easier to find anyway 
		than these two, uh. these two  . . . 
		And he has the wealth, uh, the 
		resources obviously, and there is no 
		reason, no FUCKING reason, why his 
		wife should go out and owe money and 
		they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?

				DUDE
		No, but--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong!

				DUDE
		Yeah, but--

				WALTER
		Okay. That, uh.

He elaborately clears his throat.

That rap really tied the room together, did it not?

				DUDE
		Fuckin' A.

				DONNY
		And this guy peed on it.

				WALTER
		Donny!  Please!

				DUDE
		Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--

				DONNY
		His name is Lebowski?  That's your 
		name, Dude!

				DUDE
		Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should 
		compensate me for the fucking rug.  
		I mean his wife goes out and owes 
		money and they pee on my rug.

				WALTER
		Thaaat's right Dude; they pee on 
		your fucking Rug.

CLOSE ON A PLAQUE

We pull back from the name JEFFREY LEBOWSKI engraved in silver 
to reveal that the plaque, from Variety Clubs International, 
honors Lebowski as ACHIEVER OF THE YEAR.

Reflected in the plaque we see the Dude entering the room 
with a YOUNG MAN.  We hear the two men talk:

				YOUNG MAN
		And this is the study.  You can see 
		the various commendations, honorary 
		degrees, et cetera.

				DUDE
		Yes, uh, very impressive.

				YOUNG MAN
		Please, feel free to inspect them.

				DUDE
		I'm not really, uh.

				YOUNG MAN
		Please!  Please!

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

We are panning the walls, looking at various citations and

certificates unrelated to the ones being discussed offscreen:

				YOUNG MAN
		That's the key to the city of 
		Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was 
		given two years ago in recognition 
		of his various civic, uh.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				YOUNG MAN
		That's a Los Angeles Chamber of 
		Commerce Business Achiever award, 
		which is given--not necessarily given 
		every year!  Given only when there's 
		a worthy, somebody especially--

				DUDE
		Hey, is this him with Nancy?

				YOUNG MAN
		That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the 
		first lady, yes, taken when--

				DUDE
		Lebowski on the right?

				YOUNG MAN
		Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, 
		Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--

				DUDE
		He's handicapped, huh?

				YOUNG MAN
		Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And 
		this picture was taken when Mrs. 
		Reagan was first lady of the nation, 
		yes, yes? Not of California.

				DUDE
		Far out.

				YOUNG MAN
		And in fact he met privately with 
		the President, though unfortunately 
		there wasn't time for a photo 
		opportunity.

				DUDE
		Nancy's pretty good.

				YOUNG MAN
		Wonderful woman.  We were very--

				DUDE
		Are these.

				YOUNG MAN
		These are Mr. Lebowski's children, 
		so to speak--

				DUDE
		Different mothers, huh?

				YOUNG MAN
		No, they--

				DUDE
		I guess he's pretty, uh, racially 
		pretty cool--

				YOUNG MAN
		They're not his, heh-heh, they're 
		not literally his children; they're 
		the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, 
		inner-city children of promise but 
		without the--

				DUDE
		I see.

				YOUNG MAN
		--without  the means  for higher  
		education, so Mr. Lebowski  has 
		committed  to sending  all of them 
		to college.

				DUDE
		Jeez.  Think he's got room for one 
		more?

				YOUNG MAN
		One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went 
		to college?

				DUDE
		Well, yeah I did, but I spent most 
		of my time occupying various, um, 
		administration buildings--

				YOUNG MAN
		Heh-heh--

				DUDE
		--smoking thai-stick, breaking into 
		the ROTC--

				YOUNG MAN
		Yes, heh--

				DUDE
		--and bowling.  I'll tell you the 
		truth, Brandt, I don't remember most 
		of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!

Our continuing track and pan have brought us onto a framed 
Life Magazine cover which is headlined ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI 
ACHIEVER?  Oddly, the Dude's sunglassed face is on it; we 
realize that, under the magazine's logo and headline, the 
display is mirrored.

We hear the door open and the whine of a motor.  The Dude, 
wearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look.

So does Brandt, the young man we've been listening to.  He 
wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin.

Entering the room is a fat sixtyish man in a motorized 
wheelchair--Jeff Lebowski.

				LEBOWSKI
		Okay sir, you're a Lebowski, I'm a 
		Lebowski, that's terrific, I'm very 
		busy so what can I do for you?

He wheels himself behind a desk.  The Dude sits facing him 
as Brandt withdraws.

				DUDE
		Well sir, it's this rug I have, really 
		tied the room together-

				LEBOWSKI
		You told Brandt on the phone, he 
		told me.  So where do I fit in?

				DUDE
		Well they were looking for you, these 
		two guys, they were trying to--

				LEBOWSKI
		I'll say it again, all right?  You 
		told Brandt.  He told me.  I know 
		what happened. Yes?  Yes?

				DUDE
		So you know they were trying to piss 
		on your rug--

				LEBOWSKI
		Did I urinate on your rug?

				DUDE
		You mean, did you personally come 
		and pee on my--

				LEBOWSKI
		Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla 
		usted Inglese?  I'll say it again.  
		Did I urinate on your rug?

				DUDE
		Well no, like I said, Woo peed on 
		the rug--

				LEBOWSKI
		Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I 
		just want to understand this, sir--
		every time a rug is micturated upon 
		in this fair city, I have to 
		compensate the--

				DUDE
		Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam 
		anybody here, I'm just--

				LEBOWSKI
		You're just looking for a handout 
		like every other--are you employed, 
		Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Look, let me explain something.   
		I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. 
		Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's  
		what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. 
		His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if,  
		you know, you're not into the whole 
		brevity thing--

				LEBOWSKI
		Are you employed, sir?

				DUDE
		Employed?

				LEBOWSKI
		You don't go out and make a living 
		dressed like that in the middle of a 
		weekday.

				DUDE
		Is this a--what day is this?

				LEBOWSKI
		But I do work, so if you don't mind--

				DUDE
		No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds.  
		This will not stand, ya know, this 
		will not stand, man.  I mean, if 
		your wife owes--

				LEBOWSKI
		My wife is not the issue here. I 
		hope that my wife will someday learn 
		to live on her allowance, which is 
		ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that 
		will be her problem, not mine, just 
		as your rug is your problem, just as 
		every bum's lot in life is his own 
		responsibility regardless of whom he 
		chooses to blame.  I didn't blame 
		anyone for the loss of my legs, some 
		chinaman in Korea took them from me 
		but I went out and achieved anyway.  
		I can't solve your problems, sir, 
		only you can.

The Dude rises.

				DUDE
		Ah fuck it.

				LEBOWSKI
		Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer!  
		Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your 
		answer to everything!

The Dude is heading for the door.

				LEBOWSKI
		Your "revolution" is over, Mr.  
		Lebowski!  Condolences!  The bums 
		lost!

As the Dude opens the door.

				LEBOWSKI
		...My advice is, do what your parents 
		did!  Get a job, sir!  The bums will 
		always lose-- do you hear me, 
		Lebowski?  THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS--

The Dude shuts the door on the old man's bellowing to find 
himself--

				HALLWAY
		--in a high coffered hallway.  Brandt 
		is approaching.

				BRANDT
		How was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Okay.  The old man told me to take 
		any rug in the house.

WALKWAY

A houseman with a rolled-up carpet on one shoulder goes down 
a stone walk that winds through the back lawn, past a swimming 
pool to a garage.  Brandt and the Dude follow.

				BRANDT
		Manolo will load it into your car 
		for you, uh, Dude.

				DUDE
		It's the LeBaron.

DUDE'S POINT OF VIEW

Tracking toward the pool.  A young woman sits facing it, her 
back to us, leaning forward to paint her toenails.

Beyond her a black form floats in an inflatable chair in the 
pool.

				BRANDT
		Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see 
		you again some time, Dude.

				DUDE
		Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the 
		neighborhood, need to use the john.

CLOSER TRACK

Arcing around the woman's foot as she finishes painting the 
nails emerald green.

THE DUDE

Looking.

WIDER

The young woman looks up at him.  She is in her early 
twenties.

She leans back and extends her leg toward the Dude.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Blow on them.

The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose and peeks over 
them.

				DUDE
		Huh?

She waggles her foot and giggles.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		G'ahead.  Blow.

The Dude tentatively grabs hold of her extended foot.

				DUDE
		You want me to blow on your toes?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Uh-huh. . . I can't blow that far.

The Dude looks over at the pool.

				DUDE
		You sure he won't mind?

The man bobbing in the inflatable chair is passed out.  He 
is thin, in his thirties, with long stringy blond hair.  He 
wears black leather pants and a black leather jacket, open, 
shirtless, exposing fine blond chest hair and pale skin.  
One arm trails off into the water; next to it, an empty 
whiskey bottle bobs.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Dieter doesn't care about anything.  
		He's a nihilist.

				DUDE
		Practicing?

The young woman smiles.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		You're not blowing.

Brandt nervously takes the Dude by the elbow.

				BRANDT
		Our guest has to be getting along, 
		Mrs.  Lebowski.

The Dude grudgingly allows himself to be led away, still 
looking at the young woman.

				DUDE
		You're Bunny?

				BUNNY
		I'll suck your cock for a thousand 
		dollars.

Brandt releases a gale of forced laughter:

				BRANDT
		Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Wonderful woman.  Very 
		free-spirited.  We're all very fond 
		of her.

				BUNNY
		Brandt can't watch though.  Or he 
		has to pay a hundred.

				BRANDT
		Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  That's marvelous.

He continues to lead away the Dude, who looks back over his

SHOULDER:

				DUDE
		I'm just gonna find a cash machine.

BOWLING PINS

Scattered by a strike.

THE BOWLERS

Donny calls out from the bench:

				DONNY
		Grasshopper Dude--They're dead in 
		the water!!

As the Dude walks back to the scoring table he turns to 
another team in black bowling shirts--the Cavaliers--that 
shares the lane.

				DUDE
		Your maples, Carl.

Walter, just arriving, is carrying a leatherette satchel in 
one hand and a large plastic carrier in the other.

				WALTER
		Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it 
		is no dream.

				DUDE
		You're fucking twenty minutes late.  
		What the fuck is that?

				WALTER
		Theodore Herzel.

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		State of Israel.  If you will it, 
		Dude, it is no--

				DUDE
		What the fuck're you talking about?  
		The carrier.  What's in the fucking 
		carrier?

				WALTER
		Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian.  
		Can't leave him home alone or he 
		eats the furniture.

				DUDE
		What the fuck are you--

				WALTER
		I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian.  
		I'm looking after it while Cynthia 
		and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.

				DUDE
		You brought a fucking Pomeranian 
		bowling?

				WALTER
		What do you mean "brought it bowling"?  
		I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not 
		buying it a fucking beer.  He's not 
		gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.

He lets the small yapping dog out of the carrier.  It scoots 
around the bowling table, sniffing at bowlers and wagging 
its tail.

				DUDE
		Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked 
		me to take care of her fucking dog 
		while she and her boyfriend went to 
		Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck 
		herself.  Why can't she board it?

				WALTER
		First of all, Dude, you don't have 
		an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show 
		dog with fucking papers.  You can't 
		board it.  It gets upset, its hair 
		falls out.

				DUDE
		Hey man--

				WALTER
		Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over 
		the line!

Smokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter.

				WALTER
		Smokey Huh?

				WALTER
		Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry.  
		That's a foul.

				SMOKEY
		Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.

				WALTER
		Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.

				SMOKEY
		Bullshit. Walter!

				WALTER
		This is not Nam.  This is bowling.  
		There are rules.

				DUDE
		Come on Walter, it's just--it's 
		Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a 
		little, it's just a game.

				WALTER
		This is a league game.  This 
		determines who enters the next round-
		robin, am I wrong?

				SMOKEY
		Yeah, but--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong!?

				SMOKEY
		Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the 
		marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an 
		eight.

Walter takes out a gun.

				WALTER
		Smokey my friend, you're entering a 
		world of pain.

				DUDE
		Hey Walter--

				WALTER
		Mark that frame an eight, you're 
		entering a world of pain.

				SMOKEY
		I'm not--

				WALTER
		A world of pain.

A manager in a bowling-shirt style uniform is running for a 
phone.

				SMOKEY
		Look Dude, I don't hold with this.  
		This guy is your partner, you should--

Walter primes the gun and points it at his head.

				WALTER
		HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY?  AM 
		I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT 
		ABOUT THE RULES?  MARK IT ZERO!

The Pomeranian is excitedly yapping at Walter's elbow, making 
high body-twisting tail-wagging leaps.

				DUDE
		Walter, they're calling the cops, 
		put the piece away.

				WALTER
		MARK IT ZERO!

				SMOKEY
		Walter--

				WALTER
		YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE?  
		MARK IT ZERO!!

				SMOKEY
		All right!  There it is!  It's fucking 
		zero!

He points frantically at the score projected above the lane.

				SMOKEY
		You happy, you crazy fuck?

				WALTER
		This is a league game, Smokey!

PARKING LOT

Walter and the Dude walk to the Dude's car.  The Pomeranian 
trots happily behind Walter who totes the empty carrier.

				DUDE
		Walter, you can't do that.  These 
		guys're like me, they're pacificists.  
		Smokey was a conscientious objector.

				WALTER
		You know Dude, I myself dabbled with 
		pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, 
		of course--

				DUDE
		And you know Smokey has emotional 
		problems!

				WALTER
		You mean--beyond pacifism?

				DUDE
		He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!

As the two men get into the car:

				WALTER
		Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, 
		it's water under the bridge.  And we 
		do enter the next round-robin, am I 
		wrong?

				DUDE
		No, you're not wrong--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong!

				DUDE
		You're not wrong, Walter, you're 
		just an asshole.

They watch a squad car take a squealing turn into the lot.

				WALTER
		Okay then.  We play Quintana and 
		O'Brien next week.  They'll be 
		pushovers.

				DUDE
		Just, just take it easy, Walter.

				WALTER
		That's your answer to everything, 
		Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism 
		is not--look at our current situation 
		with that camelfucker in Iraq--
		pacifism is not something to hide 
		behind.

				DUDE
		Well, just take 't easy, man.

				WALTER
		I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

				DUDE
		Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!

				WALTER
			(smugly)
		Calmer than you are.

-his irritates the Dude further.

				DUDE
		Just take it easy, man!

Walter is still smug.

				WALTER
		Calmer than you are.

DUDE'S HOUSE

A large, brilliant Persian rug lies beneath the Dude's beat-
up old furniture.

At the table next to the answering machine the Dude is mixing 
kalhua, rum and milk.

				VOICE
		Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't 
		wanna be a hard-on about this, and I 
		know it wasn't your fault, but I 
		just thought it was fair to tell you 
		that Gene and I will be submitting 
		this to the League and asking them 
		to set aside the round.  Or maybe 
		forfeit it to us--

				DUDE
		Shit!

				VOICE
		--so, like I say, just thought, you 
		know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.

A beep.

				ANOTHER VOICE
		Mr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh, 
		well--at Mr. Lebowski's office.  
		Please call us as soon as is 
		convenient.

Beep.

				ANOTHER VOICE
		Mr. Lebowski, this is Fred Dynarski 
		with the Southern Cal Bowling League.  
		I just got a, an informal report, 
		uh, that a uh, a member of your team, 
		uh, Walter Sobchak, drew a loaded 
		weapon during league play--

We hear the doorbell.

THE DOOR

It swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding 
middle-aged man in a black T-shirt and black cut-off jeans.

				DUDE
		Hiya Allan.

				ALLAN
		Dude, I finally got the venue I 
		wanted.  I'm Performing my dance 
		quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane 
		Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on 
		Tuesday night, and I'd love it if 
		you came and gave me notes.

The Dude takes a swig of his kalhua.

				DUDE
		Sure Allan, I'll be there.

				ALLAN
		Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the 
		tenth.

				DUDE
		Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.

				ALLAN
		Just, uh, just slip the rent under 
		my door.

				DUDE
		Yeah, okay.

BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM

The  voice continues on the machine.

				VOICE
		--serious infraction, and examine 
		your standing.  Thank you.  Beep.

				VOICE
		Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again.  Please 
		do call us when you get in and I'll 
		send the limo.  Let me assure you--I 
		hope you're not avoiding this call 
		because of the rug, which, I assure 
		you, is not a problem.  We need your 
		help and, uh--well we would very 
		much like to see you.  Thank you.  
		It's Brandt.

TRACKING

We are pushing Brandt down the high-ceilinged hallway.  
Distantly, we hear a dolorous soprano.  Brandt talks back 
over

HIS SHOULDER:

				BRANDT
		We've had some terrible news.  Mr. 
		Lebowski is in seclusion in the West 
		Wing.

				DUDE
		Huh.

Brandt throws open a pair of heavy double doors.  The music 
washes over us as we enter a great study where Jeffrey 
Lebowski, a blanket thrown over his knees, stares hauntedly 
into a fire, listening to Lohengrin.

BRANDT ANNOUNCES, AMBIGUOUSLY:

				BRANDT
		Mr. Lebowski.

Jeffrey Lebowski waves the Dude in without looking around.

				LEBOWSKI
		It's funny.  I can look back on a 
		life of achievement, on challenges 
		met, competitors bested, obstacles 
		overcome.  I've accomplished more 
		than most men, and without the use 
		of my legs.  What. . . What makes a 
		man, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		Huh?

				DUDE
		I don't know, sir.

				LEBOWSKI
		Is it. . . is it, being prepared to 
		do the right thing?  Whatever the 
		price?  Isn't that what makes a man?

				DUDE
		Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.

Lebowski turns away from the Dude with a haunted stare, lost 
in thought.

				LEBOWSKI
		You're joking.  But perhaps you're 
		right.

The Dude thumps at his chest pocket.

				DUDE
		Mind if I smoke a jay?

				LEBOWSKI
		Bunny.

He turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on 
his cheeks.

				DUDE
		'Scuse me?

				LEBOWSKI
		Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light 
		of my life.  Are you surprised at my 
		tears, sir?

				DUDE
		Fuckin' A.

				LEBOWSKI
		Strong men also cry. . . Strong men 
		also cry.

He clears his throat.

				LEBOWSKI
		I received this fax this morning.

Brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and 
hands it to the Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		As you can see, it is a ransom note.  
		Sent by cowards.  Men who are unable 
		to achieve on a level field of play.  
		Men who will not sign their names.  
		Weaklings.  Bums.

THE DUDE EXAMINES THE FAX:

WE HAVE BUNNY.  GATHER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN UNMARKED NON-
CONSECUTIVE TWENTIES.  AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.  NO FUNNY STUFF.

				DUDE
		Bummer.

Lebowski looks soulfully at the Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		Brandt will fill you in on the 
		details.

He wheels his chair around to once again gaze into the fire.  
Brandt tugs at the Dude's shirt and points him back to the 
hall.

HALLWAY

The soprano's singing is once again faint.  Brandt's voice 
is hushed:

				BRANDT
		Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a 
		generous offer to you to act as 
		courier once we get instructions for 
		the money.

				DUDE
		Why me, man?

				BRANDT
		He suspects that the culprits might 
		be the very people who, uh, soiled 
		your rug, and you're in a unique 
		position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm 
		that suspicion.

				DUDE
		So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, 
		huh?

				BRANDT
		Well Dude, we just don't know.

BOWLING PINS

CRASH--scattered by a strike, in slow motion.

WIDER

Still in slow motion.  We are looking across the length of 
the bowling alley at a tall, thin, Hispanic bowler displaying 
perfect form.  He wears an all-in-one dacron-polyester stretch 
bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side.

FAST TRACK IN

On the Dude, sitting next to Walter in the molded plastic 
chairs. The Dude is staring off towards the bowler.

				DUDE
		Fucking Quintana--that creep can 
		roll, man--

BACK TO THE BOWLER

Displaying great slow-motion form as the Dude and Walter's 
conversation continues over.

				WALTER
		Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, 
		Dude.

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		The man is a sex offender.  With a 
		record.  Spent six months in Chino 
		for exposing himself to an eight-
		year-old.

FLASHBACK

We see Quintana, in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater,  
walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging 
the bell.

The VOICE-OVER conversation continues.

				DUDE
		Huh.

				WALTER
		When he moved down to Venice he had 
		to go door-to-door to tell everyone 
		he's a pederast.

The door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man 
looks dully out at Quintana, who looks hesitantly up.

				DONNY
		What's a pederast, Walter?

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.

PINS

scattered by a strike.

QUINTANA

wheeling and thrusting a black gloved fist into the air.

Stitched above the breast pocket of his all-in-one is his 
first name, "Jesus".

BACK TO WALTER AND THE DUDE

They have been joined by Donny.

				WALTER
		Anyway.  How much they offer you?

				DUDE
		Twenty grand.  And of course I still 
		keep the rug.

				WALTER
		Just for making the hand-off?

				DUDE
		Yeah.

He slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket.

				DUDE
		...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so  
		whenever these guys call--

				WALTER
		What if it's during a game?

				DUDE
		I told him if it was during league 
		play--

Donny has been watching Quintana.

				DONNY
		If what's during league play?

				WALTER
		Life does not stop and start at your 
		convenience, you miserable piece of 
		shit.

				DONNY
		What's wrong with Walter, Dude?

				DUDE
		I figure it's easy money, it's all 
		pretty harmless.  I mean she probably 
		kidnapped herself.

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DONNY
		What do you mean, Dude?

				DUDE
		Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean 
		look at it.  Young trophy wife.  
		Marries a guy for money but figures 
		he isn't giving her enough.  She 
		owes money all over town--

				WALTER
		That...fucking...bitch!

				DUDE
		It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin 
		said, look for the person who will 
		benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, 
		you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying 
		to say--

				DONNY
		I am the Walrus.

				WALTER
		That fucking bitch!

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				DONNY
		I am the Walrus.

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin!  
		Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

				DONNY
		What the fuck is he talking about?

				WALTER
		That's fucking exactly what happened, 
		Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!

				DUDE
		Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?

				DONNY
		Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed 
		off?

				WALTER
		Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking 
		thing-- I did not watch my buddies 
		die face down in the muck so that 
		this fucking strumpet--

				DUDE
		I don't see any connection to Vietnam, 
		Walter.

				WALTER
		Well, there isn't a literal 
		connection, Dude.

				DUDE
		Walter, face it, there isn't any 
		connection.  It's your roll.

				WALTER
		Have it your way.  The point is--

				DUDE
		It's your roll--

				WALTER
		The fucking point is--

				DUDE
		It's your roll.

				VOICE
		Are you ready to be fucked, man?

They both look up.

Quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of 
the lanes.  Over his polyester all-in-one he now wears a 
windbreaker with a racing stripe and "Jesus" stitched on the 
breast.  He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball 
satchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein).  Behind him stands his 
partner, O'Brien, a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair.

				QUINTANA
		I see you rolled your way into the 
		semis.  Deos mio, man.  Seamus and 
		me, we're gonna fuck you up.

				DUDE
		Yeah well, that's just, ya know, 
		like, your opinion, man.

Quintana looks at Walter.

				QUINTANA
		Let me tell you something, bendeco.  
		You pull any your crazy shit with 
		us, you flash a piece out on the 
		lanes, I'll take it away from you 
		and stick it up your ass and pull 
		the fucking trigger til it goes 
		"click".

				DUDE
		Jesus.

				QUINTANA
		You said it, man.  Nobody fucks with 
		the Jesus.

Jesus walks away.  Walter nods sadly.

				WALTER
		Eight-year-olds, Dude.

DUDE'S BUNGALOW

We are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug.  
His eyes are closed.  He wears a Walkman headset.  Leaking 
tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an 
intermittent clatter.

In his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled VENICE 
BEACH LEAGUE PLAYOFFS 1987.

The Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall 
rumbling down the lane.  On its impact with the pins, the 
Dude opens his eyes.

He screams.

A blonde woman looms over him.  Next to  her a  young man  
in paint-spattered denims stoops and swings something towards 
the carrier.

The sap catches the Dude on the chin and sends  his head 
thunking back onto the rug.

A million stars explode against a field of black.  We hear 
the "La-la-la-la" of The Man in Me.

The black field  dissolves into  the pattern  of the  rug.   
The rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of  the city  of 
Los  Angeles at twilight, moving below us at great speed.

The Dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in 
front of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his 
bowling shirt. He looks up.

Ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the 
Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet.  She is outpacing 
us, growing smaller.

The Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices 
that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand.  
His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic 
implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its 
weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. He 
is falling. From a high angle we see the Dude hurtling down 
toward the city, dragged by the ball.

A  reverse  looking  up shows  the Dude  hurtling toward  us 
out  of the inky  sky,  his eyes  wide with  horror.  Led by  
the bowling  ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in 
black.

We hear a distant rumble, like thunder.  Dull reflections 
materialize in the darkness.  They are glints off the shiny 
surface of an oncoming bowling ball.

We pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of 
a ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being 
regurgitated up at us, overtaking us.

The Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass 
rolling a huge shadow across his face.

The gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward 
us --finger holes.

The largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us, engulfing 
us once again in black..

The black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a 
bowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in 
the thumbhole of the rolling ball.

We see the receding bowler spinning away.  It is the blonde 
woman, performing her follow-through.

Floor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and 
away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor; 
ceiling; approaching pins; again and again.

We hit the pins and clatter into blackness.  We hear pins 
spin, hit each other and drop.

We hear an irritating, insistent beeping.

FADE IN

We are close on the Dude, upside down.  As the picture fades 
in the bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint.  
They come from the Dude's Walkman, the headset of which is 
now askew, with one arm off his ear.

As the Dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put 
him right side around.  His head is now resting against 
hardwood floor, not rug.

				DUDE
		Oh man.

He  raises  himself  onto  his  elbows  and  massages  the  
red   lump  on his  jaw.  The  beeper  on his  belt is  
blinking red  in sync  with the continuing irritating beeps.

WIDE ON THE ROOM

An  end  table  is  upset,  but  otherwise the  furniture is  
in place. The rug is gone.

The  Dude  looks  around.    The  bowling sounds  continue.   
The beeps continue.

The phone starts to jangle.

TRACK

We  push  Brandt  down  the  familiar  marble  hallway.   
Again  there is a  distant  aria.    Brandt  throws  out a  
wrist to  look at  his watch.

				BRANDT
		They called about eighty minutes 
		ago.  They want you to take the money 
		and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll 
		call you on the portable phone with 
		instructions in about forty minutes.  
		One person only or I'd go with you.  
		They were very clear on that: one 
		person only.  What happened to your 
		jaw?

				DUDE
		Oh, nothin', you know.

They have reached the little desk outside of the big 
Lebowski's office; Brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key 
and takes out an attache case.  He hands this to the Dude 
along with a cellular phone in a battery-pack carrying case.

				BRANDT
		Here's the money, and the phone.  
		Please, Dude, follow whatever 
		instructions they give.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				BRANDT
		Her life is in your hands.

				DUDE
		Oh, man, don't say that..

				BRANDT
		Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that:  
		Her life is in your hands.

				DUDE
		Shit.

				BRANDT
		Her life is in your hands, Dude.  
		And report back to us as soon as 
		it's done.

DUDE'S CAR

We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through 
the front windshield.  The headlights play over Walter 
standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK 
SECURITY.  Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the 
fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look 
oddly like a commuter.  He also holds an irregular shape 
bundled in brown wrapping paper.

The car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude's door 
and hands in the briefcase.

				WALTER
		Take the ringer.  I'll drive.

The Dude takes the briefcase and slides over.

				DUDE
		The what?

				WALTER
		The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have 
		they called yet?

The Dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through it 
as the car starts rolling.

				DUDE
		What the hell is this?

				WALTER
		My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude.  
		The whites.

				DUDE
		Agh--

He closes the briefcase.

				DUDE
		Walter, I'm sure there's a reason 
		you brought your dirty undies--

				WALTER
		Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight.  
		The ringer can't look empty.

				DUDE
		Walter--what the fuck are you 
		thinking?

				WALTER
		Well you're right, Dude, I got to 
		thinking.  I got to thinking why 
		should we settle for a measly fucking 
		twenty grand--

				DUDE
		We?  What the fuck we?  You said you 
		just wanted to come along--

				WALTER
		My point, Dude, is why should we 
		settle for twenty grand when we can 
		keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?

				DUDE
		Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a 
		fucking game, Walter--

				WALTER
		It is a fucking game.  You said so 
		yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--

				DUDE '
		Yeah, but--

The phone chirps.  Dude grabs it.

				DUDE
		Dude here.

				VOICE
			(German accent)
		Who is this?

				DUDE
		Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want 
		us to go?

				VOICE
		...Us?
		DUDE

Shit. . . Uh, yeah, you know, me and the driver.  I'm not 
handling the money and driving the car and talking on the 
phone all by my fucking--

				VOICE
		Shut the fuck up.
			(Beat)
		Hello?

				DUDE
		Yeah?

				VOICE
		Okay, listen--

Walter looks over at the Dude and bellows:

				WALTER
		Dude, are you fucking this up?

				VOICE
		Who is that?

				DUDE
		The driver man, I told you--

Click.  Dial tone.

				DUDE
		Oh shit.  Walter.

				WALTER
		What the fuck is going on there?

				DUDE
		They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it 
		up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was 
		in our hands!

				WALTER
		Easy, Dude.

				DUDE
		We're screwed now!  We don't get 
		shit and they're gonna kill her!  
		We're fucked, Walter!

				WALTER
		Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on.  
		You're being very unDude.  They'll 
		call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--

The phone chirps.

				WALTER
		Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, 
		Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These  
		guys are fucking amateurs--

				DUDE
		Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say 
		peep when I'm doing business here.

				WALTER
			(patronizing)
		Okay Dude.  Have it your way.

The Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack.

				WALTER
		But they're amateurs.

The Dude glares at Walter.  Into the phone:

				DUDE
		Dude here.

				VOICE
		Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there 
		is no funny stuff.

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				VOICE
		So no funny stuff.  Okay?

				DUDE
		Hey, just tell me where the fuck you 
		want us to go.

A HIGHWAY SIGN:  SIMI VALLEY ROAD

It flashes by in the headlights of the roaring car.

				DUDE
		That was the sign.

Walter wrestles the car onto the two-lane road.

				WALTER
		Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, 
		nobody's in a position to complain.  
		And we keep the baksheesh.

				DUDE
		Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't 
		told me how we get her back.  Where 
		is she?

				WALTER
		That's the simple part, Dude.  When  
		we make the handoff, I grab the guy 
		and beat  it out of him.

He looks at the Dude.

				WALTER
		...Huh?

				DUDE
		Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter.  
		That's fucking ingenious, if I 
		understand it correctly.  That's a 
		Swiss fucking watch.

				WALTER
		Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of 
		this is its simplicity. If the plan 
		gets too complex something always 
		goes wrong.  If there's one thing I 
		learned in Nam--

The phone chirps.

				DUDE
		Dude.

				VOICE
		You are approaching a vooden britch.  
		When you cross it you srow ze bag 
		from ze left vindow of ze moving 
		kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch 
		you.

Click.  Dial tone.

				DUDE
		FUCK.

				WALTER
		What'd he say?  Where's the hand-
		off?

				DUDE
		There is no fucking hand-off, Walter!   
		At a wooden bridge we throw the money 
		out  of the car!

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		We throw the money out of the moving 
		car!

Walter stares dumbly for a beat.

				WALTER
		We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks 
		up our plan.

				DUDE
		Well call them up and explain it to 
		'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking 
		simple, I'm sure they'd fucking 
		understand it!  That's the beauty of 
		it Walter!

				WALTER
		Wooden bridge, huh?

				DUDE
		I'm throwing the money, Walter!  
		We're not fucking around!

				WALTER
		The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the 
		ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!

				DUDE
		Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but 
		sooner or later you're gonna have to 
		face the fact that you're a goddamn 
		moron.

				WALTER
		Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's 
		the bridge--

There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge.  
The Dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from 
the back seat.  Walter reaches one arm across Dude's body to 
grab the laundry.

And there goes the ringer.

He flings it out the window.

				DUDE
		Walter!

				WALTER
		Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!

				DUDE
		What the fuck?

				WALTER
		Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch 
		I roll out!  I double back, grab one 
		of 'em and beat it out of him!  The 
		uzi!

				DUDE
		Uzi?

Walter points across the seat at the paper-wrapped bundle.

				WALTER
		You didn't think I was rolling out 
		of here naked!

				DUDE
		Walter, please--

Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out 
over the road.

				WALTER
		Fifteen!  This is it, Dude!  Let's 
		take that hill!

Walter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he 
hits the pavement.  The car swerves and lurches and the Dude, 
cursing, takes the wheel.

OUTSIDE

Walter tumbles onto the shoulder and--RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!--muzzle 
flashes tear open the wrapping paper.

INSIDE THE CAR

The car rocks and the Dude wrestles with the wheel.

OUTSIDE

The car clunks and screams around in a skid.

INSIDE

The Dude is thrown forward as the car hits something.

OUTSIDE

As the Dude struggles out holding the satchel of money. The 
front of his car is crumpled into a tree.  The car body saps 
back to the left, where the rear wheel has been shot out.

WALTER  is  just  rising  from  the  ground  massaging an  
injured knee.

The  Dude  runs  up  the  road  toward  the bridge,  
frantically waving the satchel in the air.

				DUDE
		WE HAVE IT!  WE HAVE IT!!

There is a distant engine roar.  A motorcycle bumps up onto 
the road from the ravine under the bridge and, tires 
squealing, skids around to speed away in the opposite 
direction.  It is closely followed by two more roaring 
motorcycles.

				DUDE
		WE HAVE IT!!. . . We have it!

The Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road, watching 
the three red tail lights fishtail away.

AFTER A LONG STARING SILENCE:

				WALTER
		Ahh fuck it, let's go bowling.

BOWLING LANE

A ball rumbles in to scatter ten pins.

WALTER.

He turns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the nook of 
molded plastic chairs.  The Dude listlessly holds the portable 
phone in his lap.  It is ringing.

				WALTER
		Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used 
		to say.

				DUDE
		What the fuck is that supposed to 
		mean?  What the fuck're we gonna 
		tell Lebowski?

				WALTER
		Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't 
		see, um-- what exactly is the problem?

The portable phone stops ringing.

				DUDE
		Huh?  The problem is--what do you 
		mean what's the--there's no--we didn't--
		they're gonna kill that poor woman--

				WALTER
		What the fuck're you talking about?  
		That poor woman--that poor slut--
		kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said 
		so yourself--

				DUDE
		No, Walter!  I said I thought she 
		kidnapped herself!  You're the one 
		who's so fucking certain--

				WALTER
		That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--

Donny is trotting excitedly up.

				DONNY
		They posted the next round of the 
		tournament--

				WALTER
		Donny, shut the f--when do we play?

				DONNY
		This Saturday.  Quintana and--

				WALTER
		Saturday!  Well they'll have to 
		reschedule.

				DUDE
		Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?

				WALTER
		I told that fuck down at the league 
		office-- who's in charge of 
		scheduling?

				DUDE
		Walter--

				DONNY
		Burkhalter.

				WALTER
		I told that kraut a fucking thousand 
		times I don't roll on shabbas.

				DONNY
		It's already posted.

				WALTER
		WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!

				DUDE
		Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about 
		that poor woman?  What do we tell--

				WALTER
		C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get 
		sick of her little game and, you 
		know, wander back--

				DONNY
		How come you don't roll on Saturday, 
		Walter?

				WALTER
		I'm shomer shabbas.

				DONNY
		What's that, Walter?

				DUDE
		Yeah, and in the meantime what do I 
		tell Lebowski?

				WALTER
		Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of 
		rest.  Means I don't work, I don't 
		drive a car, I don't fucking ride in 
		a car, I don't handle money, I don't 
		turn on the oven, and I sure as shit 
		don't fucking roll!

				DONNY
		Sheesh.

				DUDE
		Walter, how--

				WALTER
		Shomer shabbas.

The Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone.

				DUDE
		That's it.  I'm out of here.

				WALTER
		For Christ's sake, Dude.

Walter and Donny join the Dude as he walks out of the bowling 
alley.

Hell, you just tell him--well, you tell him, uh, we made the 
hand-off, everything went, uh, you know--

				DONNY
		Oh yeah, how'd it go?

				WALTER
		Went alright.  Dude's car got a little 
		dinged up--

				DUDE
		But Walter, we didn't make the fucking 
		hand- off!  They didn't get, the 
		fucking money and they're gonna--
		they're gonna--

				WALTER
		Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."

He waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra.

				WALTER
		Kill that poor woman.

				DONNY
		Walter, if you can't ride in a car, 
		how d'you get around on Shammas--

				WALTER
		Really, Dude, you surprise me.  
		They're not gonna kill shit.  They're 
		not gonna do shit.  What can they 
		do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, 
		look at the bottom line.  Who's 
		sitting on a million fucking dollars?  
		Am I wrong?

				DUDE
		Walter--

				WALTER
		Who's got a fucking million fucking 
		dollars parked in the trunk of our 
		car out here?

				DUDE
		"Our" car, Walter?

				WALTER
		And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty 
		undies.  My fucking whites--Say, 
		where is  the car?

The three bowlers, stopped at the edge of the lot, stare out 
at an empty parking space.

				DONNY
		Who has your undies, Walter?

				WALTER
		Where's your car, Dude?

				DUDE
		You don't know, Walter?  You seem to 
		know the answer to everything else!

				WALTER
		Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped 
		spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.

				DUDE
		It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking 
		know it's been stolen!

				WALTER
		Well, certainly that's a possibility, 
		Dude--

				DUDE
		Aw, fuck it.

The Dude walks away across the lot.  The portable phone starts 
ringing again.

				DONNY
		Where you going, Dude?

				DUDE
		I'm going home, Donny.

				DONNY
		Your phone's ringing, Dude.

				DUDE
		Thank you, Donny.

DUDE'S LIVING ROOM

The Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair, 
fingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses.  Facing him 
on the couch are two uniformed policeman, one middle-aged, 
the other a fresh-faced rookie.

At the cut the portable phone, in the Dude's lap, is chirping.  
The Dude waits for the rings to end.  When they do:

				DUDE
		1972 Pontiac LeBaron.

				YOUNGER COP
		Color?

				DUDE
		Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, 
		coloration.

				YOUNGER COP
		And was there anything of value in  
		the car?

DULLY:

				DUDE
		Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple 
		of Creedence tapes.  And there was 
		a, uh. . . my briefcase.

				YOUNGER COP
		In the briefcase?

				DUDE
		Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my 
		papers.  Business papers.

				YOUNGER COP
		And what do you do, sir?

				DUDE
		I'm unemployed.

				OLDER COP
		...Most people, we're working nights, 
		they offer us coffee.

There is silence.  Dude continues to stare at a spot on the 
floor.  The older cop stares at him.

				DUDE
		...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But 
		it's nice when they offer.

AT LENGTH:

				DUDE
		...Also, my rug was stolen.

				YOUNGER COP
		Your rug was in the car.

The Dude taps the floor with his foot.

				DUDE
		No.  Here.

				YOUNGER COP
		Separate incidents?

The Dude stares at the floor.

Silence.

				OLDER COP
		Snap out of it, son.

The home phone starts ringing--a ring distinct  from the  
chirp of the portable.  The Dude makes no move to answer  
it.   Finally the rings stop as an answering machine kicks 
on.

				DUDE
		You find them much?  Stolen cars?

Dude's Voice on Machine The Dude's not in.  Leave a message 
after the beep.  It takes a minute.

				YOUNGER COP
		Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much 
		hope for the tape deck though.  Or 
		the Creedence tapes.

				DUDE
		And the, uh, the briefcase?

Beep.

				FEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE
		Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you.  
		Call when you get home and I'll send 
		a car for you.  My name is Maude 
		Lebowski.  I'm the woman who took 
		the rug.

Beep.  Dial tone.

				OLDER COP
		Well, I guess we can close the file 
		on that one.

TRACKING FORWARD

We are moving through the open living area of a large downtown 
L.A. loft.  A huge unfinished canvas,  lit by  standing 
industrial lights, dominates one wall.  The furnishings  are 
spare  given the space.  On the floor is the Dude's brilliant 
rug.

We hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball.  The Dude, 
standing in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky 
depths of the cavernous space.

Something huge and white hurtles towards the Dude's head.  
As it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass.

We see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended 
from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the 
floor.  She is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush 
in the other, with which she flicks paint down at the canvas.

The Dude turns again as he hears running footsteps.  Two 
young men in paint-spattered shorts, T-shirts and sneakers 
reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track 
and haul it back for another push.

				VOICE
		I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. 
		Lebowski.

She rumbles by in another pass.

All right, we'll do the blue tomorrow.  Elfranco.  Pedro.  
Help me down.

The  two  men  help Maude  out of  her sling.   She  is naked  
except for leather  harness  straps  which  ring  her  breasts  
and wrap  her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix 
look.

Does the female form make you uncomfor- table, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Is that what that's a picture of?

				MAUDE
		In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. 
		My art has been commended as being 
		strongly vaginal.  Which bothers 
		some men.  The word itself makes 
		some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.

				DUDE
		Oh yeah?

				MAUDE
		Yes, they don't like hearing it and 
		find it difficult to say.  Whereas 
		without batting an eye a man will 
		refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or 
		his "Johnson".

				DUDE
		"Johnson"?

				MAUDE
		Thank you.

This to Elfranco, who has handed her a robe.

All right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get down to cases.  My father 
told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a 
gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give.  
Now.  As for this. . . "kidnapping"--

				DUDE
		Huh?

				MAUDE
		Yes, I know about it.  And I know 
		that you acted as courier.  And let 
		me tell you something:  the whole 
		thing stinks to high heaven.

				DUDE
		Right, but let me explain something 
		about that rug--

				MAUDE
		Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Excuse me?

				MAUDE
		Sex.  The physical act of love.  
		Coitus.  Do you like it?

				DUDE
		I was talking about my rug.

				MAUDE
		You're not interested in sex?

				DUDE
		You mean coitus?

				MAUDE
		I like it too.  It's a male myth 
		about feminists that we hate sex.  
		It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. 
		But unfortunately there are some 
		people--it is called satyriasis in 
		men, nymphomania in women--who engage 
		in it compulsively and without joy.

				DUDE
		Oh, no.

				MAUDE
		Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate 
		souls cannot love in the true sense 
		of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance 
		Bunny is one of these.

				DUDE
		Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your 
		stepmother is a nympho, but I don't 
		see what it has to do with--do you 
		have any kalhua?

				MAUDE
		Take a look at this, sir.

She is aiming a remote at a projection TV.  The screen 
flickers to life.  A title card:

JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS

SECOND CARD:

KARL HUNGUS

AND

BUNNY LAJOYA

IN

A THIRD CARD:

LOGJAMMIN'

The Dude is at the bar, a bottle of kalhua frozen halfway  
to his glass.

From the television set we hear a doorbell ring, and then  a 
door opening.

On the TV screen the door opens to reveal a sallow-faced  
man in blue coyer-alls.  It is Dieter, the floater in  
Lebowski's pool.

				DIETER
		Hello.  Nein dizbatcher says zere 
		iss problem mit deine kable.

				DUDE
		Shit, I know that guy.  He's a 
		nihilist.

				MAUDE
		And you recognize her, of course.

The girl answering the door is Bunny Lebowski.

Bunny The TV is in here.

				DIETER
		Za, okay, I bring mein toolz.

Bunny This is my friend Shari.  She just came over to use 
the shower.

				MAUDE
			(grimly)
		The story is ludicrous.

				DIETER
		Mein nommen iss Karl.  Is hard to 
		verk in zese clozes--

Maude switches off the set.

				MAUDE
		Lord.  You can imagine where it goes 
		from here.

				DUDE
		He fixes the cable?

				MAUDE
		Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little 
		matter to me that this woman chose 
		to pursue a career

in pornography, nor that she has been "banging" Jackie 
Treehorn, to use the parlance of our times.  However.  I am 
one of two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation, the other 
being my father.  The Foundation takes youngsters from Watts 
and--

				DUDE
		Shit yeah, the achievers.

				MAUDE
		Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, 
		yes, and proud we are of all of them.  
		I asked my father about his withdrawal 
		of a million dollars from the 
		Foundation account and he told me 
		about this "abduction", but I tell 
		you it is preposterous.  This 
		compulsive

fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride.

				DUDE
		Yeah, but my-

				MAUDE
		I'm getting to your rug. My  father 
		and I don't get along; he doesn't 
		approve of my lifestyle and, needless 
		to say, I don't approve of his.  
		Still, I hardly wish to make my 
		father's embezzlement a police matter, 
		so I'm proposing that you try to 
		recover the money from the people 
		you delivered it to.

				DUDE
		Well--sure, I could do that--

				MAUDE
		If you successfully do so, I will 
		compensate you to the tune of 1% of 
		the recovered sum.

				DUDE
		A hundred.

				MAUDE
		Thousand, yes, bones or clams or 
		whatever you call them.

				DUDE
		Yeah, but what about--

				MAUDE
		--your rug, yes, well with that money 
		you can buy any number of rugs that 
		don't have sentimental value for me.  
		And I am sorry about that crack on 
		the jaw.

The Dude fingers his jaw, where the lump from the sap has 
all but disappeared.

				DUDE
		Oh that's okay, I hardly even--

				MAUDE
		Here's the name and number of a doctor 
		who will look at it for you.  You 
		will receive no bill.  He's a good 
		man, and thorough.

				DUDE
		That's really thoughtful but I--

				MAUDE
		Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a 
		good man, and thorough.

LIMO

The Dude sits in back holding a White Russian,  listening to 
the chauffeur, a man of about the same age from whose livery 
cap a ponytail emerges.

				DRIVER
		--So he says, "My son can't hold a 
		job, my daughter's married to a 
		fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on 
		my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown.  
		But you know me.  I can't complain."

THROUGH RASPING LAUGHTER:

				DUDE
		Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash.			 
		Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya 
		Tony.

He takes a sip of a freshly-mixed White Russian, which leaves 
milk on his mustache.

I was feeling really shitty earlier in the day, I'd lost  a 
little  money, I  was down in the dumps.

				TONY
		Aw, forget about it.

				DUDE
		Yeah, man!  Fuck it!  I can't be 
		worrying about that shit.  Life goes 
		on!

The limo has rolled to a stop.  The Dude gets out, still 
holding his drink.

				TONY
		Home sweet home, Mr. L.  Who's your 
		friend in the Volkswagon?

				DUDE
		Huh?

His eyes on the rearview mirror, Tony jerks a thumb over his 
shoulder.

He followed us here.

The Dude turns to look.

HIS POV

Halfway up the block a Volkswagon bug has pulled over to the 
curb.  In the driver's seat we see a fat man's shape.

THE DUDE

He scowls.

				DUDE
		When did he-

The Dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half-
nelson by another uniformed chauffeur.

				SECOND CHAUFFEUR
		Into the limo, you sonofabitch.  No 
		arguments.

As he is frog-marched towards another limo the Dude holds 
his drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath it.

				DUDE
		Fuck, man!  There's a beverage here!

The waiting limo's back door is flung open.

INSIDE

The Dude is shoved in and awkwardly takes a seat facing the 
rear. The door is slammed behind him.

				LEBOWSKI
		Start talking and talk fast you lousy 
		bum!

				BRANDT
		We've been frantically trying to 
		reach you, Dude.

Brandt sits catty-corner from the Dude; directly across from 
the Dude is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees.

				LEBOWSKI
		Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!

				DUDE
		Well we--I don't--

				LEBOWSKI
		They did not receive the money, you 
		nitwit!  They  did not receive the 
		goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR 
		HANDS!

				BRANDT
		This is our concern, Dude.

				DUDE
		No, man, nothing is fucked here--

				LEBOWSKI
		NOTHING IS FUCKED! THE GODDAMN PLANE 
		HAS CRASHED INTO THE MOUNTAIN!

The Dude takes a hurried sip from his drink.

				DUDE
		C'mon man, who're you gonna believe?  
		Those guys are--we dropped off the 
		damn money--

				LEBOWSKI
		WHAT?!

				DUDE
		I--the royal we, you know, the 
		editorial--I dropped off the money, 
		exactly as per--Look, I've got certain 
		information, certain things have 
		come to light, and uh, has it ever 
		occurred to you, man, that given the 
		nature of all this new shit, that, 
		uh, instead of running around blaming 
		me, that this whole thing might just 
		be, not, you know, not just such a 
		simple, but uh--you know?

				LEBOWSKI
		What in God's holy name are you 
		blathering about?

				DUDE
		I'll tell you what I'm blathering 
		about!  I got information--new shit 
		has come to light and--shit, man!  
		She kidnapped herself!

Lebowski stares at him, dumbstruck.  The Dude is encouraged.

				DUDE
		Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy 
		wife, I mean, in the parlance of our 
		times, owes money all over town, 
		including to known pornographers--
		and that's cool, that's cool-- but 
		I'm saying, she needs money, and of 
		course they're gonna say they didn't 
		get it 'cause she wants more, man, 
		she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean--
		hasn't that ever occurred to you...?  
		Sir?

				LEBOWSKI
			(quietly)
		No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not 
		occurred to me.

				BRANDT
		That had not occurred to us, Dude.

				DUDE
		Well, okay, you're not privy to all 
		the new shit, so uh, you know, but 
		that's what you pay me for.  Speaking 
		of which, would it be possible for 
		me to get my twenty grand in cash?  
		I gotta check this with my accountant 
		of course, but my concern is that, 
		you know, it could bump me into a 
		higher tax--

				LEBOWSKI
		Brandt, give him the envelope.

				DUDE
		Well, okay, if you've already made 
		out the check.  Brandt is handing 
		him a letter-sized envelope which is 
		distended by something inside.

				BRANDT
		We received it this morning.

The Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton 
wadding and unrolls it.

				LEBOWSKI
		Since you have failed to achieve, 
		even in the modest task that was 
		your charge, since you have stolen 
		my money, and since you have 
		unrepentantly betrayed my trust.

The wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up 
inside.  The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and 
starts to unroll the inner package.

				LEBOWSKI
		I have no choice but to tell these 
		bums that they should do whatever is 
		necessary to recover their money 
		from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And 
		with Brandt as my witness, tell you 
		this:  Any further harm visited upon 
		Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon 
		your head.

Between thumb and forefinger the Dude holds up the contents 
of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish.

				LEBOWSKI
		...By God sir.  I will not abide 
		another toe.

COFFEE SHOP

The Dude and Walter sit at the counter, both staring off 
into space, both absently stirring their coffee with little 
clinking noises.

AFTER A LONG BEAT:

				WALTER
		That wasn't her toe.

				DUDE
		Whose toe was it, Walter?

				WALTER
		How the fuck should I know?  I do 
		know that nothing about it indicates--

				DUDE
		The nail polish, Walter.

				WALTER
		Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible 
		to get some nail polish, apply it to 
		someone else's toe--

				DUDE
		Someone else's--where the fuck are 
		they gonna--

				WALTER
		You want a toe?  I can get you a 
		toe, believe me.  There are ways, 
		Dude.  You don't wanna know about 
		it, believe me.

				DUDE
		But Walter--

				WALTER
		I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this 
		afternoon--with nail  polish. These  
		fucking amateurs.   They send us a  
		toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- 
		selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My  
		point is--

				DUDE
		They're gonna kill her, Walter, and 
		then they're gonna kill me--

				WALTER
		Well that's just, that's the stress 
		talking, Dude.  So far we have what 
		looks to me like a series of 
		victimless crimes--

				DUDE
		What about the toe?

				WALTER
		FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!

A waitress enters.

				WAITRESS
		Could you please keep your voices 
		down--this is a family restaurant.

				WALTER
		Oh, please dear!  I've got news for 
		you: the Supreme Court has roundly 
		rejected prior restraint!

				DUDE
		Walter, this isn't a First Amendment 
		thing.

				WAITRESS
		Sir, if you don't calm down I'm going 
		to have to ask you to leave.

				WALTER
		Lady, I got buddies who died face-
		down in the muck so you and I could 
		enjoy this family restaurant!

THE DUDE GETS UP:

				DUDE
		All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry 
		ma'am.

				WALTER
		Don't run away from this, Dude!  
		Goddamnit, this affects all of us!

The Dude has left frame; Walter calls after him:

				WALTER
		Our basic freedoms!

He looks defiantly around.

				WALTER
		I'm staying.  Finishing my coffee.

He stirs the coffee, bopping his head in time to the Muzak, 
affecting nonchalance.

				WALTER
		Finishing my coffee.

DUDE'S BATHROOM

A dripping noise.

The Dude sits in the bathtub, staring stuporously, a joint 
pinched in one hand, a washcloth draped over his head.

We hear the phone ringing in the other roam.

The Dude is staring at his toes, which protrude from the 
soapy water, splayed against the far side of the tub.

After the Dude's outgoing message we hear:

				VOICE THROUGH MACHINE
		Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty Officer 
		Rolvaag of the L.A.P.D.

The Dude looks stuporously up, his head swaying.

				VOICE THROUGH MACHINE
		We've recovered your vehicle.  It 
		can be claimed at the North Hollywood 
		Auto Circus there on Victory.

				DUDE
		Far out.  Far fuckin' out.

				MESSAGE
		You'll just need to present a--

The message is interrupted by loud smashing sounds, as of 
someone applying a baseball bat to the answering machine.

				DUDE
		Hunh?

He looks blearily at the open doorway.

A tall man dressed in black leather with a cricket paddle is 
striding across the living room towards the bathroom.

				DUDE
		Hey!  This is a private residence, 
		man!

The man has entered the bathroom and, in stride, swings the 
cricket paddle up to smash the overhead light.  Two other 
men are entering behind him.

The room is dark now except for spill from the living room; 
the men are backlit shapes.

One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small 
animal skitters excitedly about the floor.

The Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal.

				DUDE
		Nice marmot.

The man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it, 
screaming, into the bathtub.

The Dude screams.

The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a 
frenzy of fearful aggression.

				FIRST MAN
		Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.

The Dude, screaming, grabs the lip of the tub and starts to 
hoist himself up but the first man lays a palm on top of his 
head and squishes him back into the water.

				SECOND MAN
		You think veer kidding und making 
		mit de funny stuff?

				THIRD MAN
		Vee could do things you only dreamed 
		of, Lebowski.

				SECOND MAN
		Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski.  
		Vee belief in nossing.

He scoops the marmot out of the water.  It shakes itself 
off, spraying the Dude.

				DUDE
		Jesus!

				DIETER
		Vee belief in nossing, Lebowski!  
		NOSSING!!

The marmot, back on the floor, is skittering around, shaking 
itself and convulsing in little sneezes.

				DUDE
		Jesus Christ!

				FIRST MAN
		Tomorrow vee come back und cut off 
		your chonson.

				DUDE
		Excuse me?

				FIRST MAN
		I SAY VEE CUT OFF YOUR CHONSON!

The three men turn to leave.  Over their retreating backs:

				SECOND MAN
		Just sink about zat, Lebowski.

				FIRST MAN
		Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski.

				SECOND MAN
		Ja, und maybe vee stamp on it und 
		skvush it, Lebowski!

NORTH HOLLYWOOD AUTO CIRCUS

A policeman with a clipboard is leading the Dude through a 
large parking lot.

				POLICEMAN
		You're lucky she wasn't chopped, Mr.  
		Lebowski. Must've been a joyride 
		situation; they abandoned the car 
		once they hit the retaining wall.

They have reached the Dude's car.  The  driver's side  
exterior has been scraped raw.  The policeman hands the Dude  
a door  handle and an exterior rear-view mirror.

				POLICEMAN
		These were on the road next to the 
		car.  You'll have to get in on the 
		other side.

The Dude climbs in the passenger side.

				DUDE
		My fucking briefcase!  It's not here!

				POLICEMAN
		Yeah, sorry, I saw that on the report.  
		You're lucky they left the tape deck 
		though.

				DUDE
		My fucking briefcase!  Jesus--what's 
		that smell?

				POLICEMAN
		Uh, yeah.  Probably a vagrant, slept 
		in the car.  Or perhaps just used it 
		as a toilet, and moved on.

The Dude tries to roll down the driver's window but it will 
not go; he bellows through the glass:

				DUDE
		When will you find these guys?  I 
		mean, do you have any promising leads?

The policeman laughs, agreeing broadly.

				POLICEMAN
		Leads, yeah.  I'll just check with 
		the boys down at the Crime Lab.  
		They've assigned four more detectives 
		to the case, got us working in shifts.

The Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman 
rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by 
the glass.

BOWLING ALLEY BAR

The Dude, Walter and Donny sit at the bar, the Dude with a 
White Russian, Walter with a beer, and Donny eating beer 
nuts.

				DONNY
		And then they're gonna stamp on it?!

				WALTER
		Oh for Christ--will you shut the 
		fuck up, Donny.

				DUDE
		I figure my only hope is that the 
		big Lebowski kills me before the 
		Germans can cut my dick off.

				WALTER
		Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No 
		one is going to cut your dick off.

				DUDE
		Thanks Walter.

				WALTER
		Not if I have anything to say about 
		it.

				DUDE
			(bitterly)
		Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me 
		a very secure feeling.

				WALTER
		Dude--

				DUDE
		That makes me feel all warm inside.

				WALTER
		Now Dude--

				DUDE
		This whole fucking thing--I  could 
		be sitting here with just pee-stains 
		on my rug.

Walter sadly shakes his head.

				WALTER
		Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes.  
		Fucking Nazis.

				DONNY
		They were Nazis, Dude?

				WALTER
		Come on, Donny, they were threatening 
		castration!

				DONNY
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		Are you gonna split hairs?

				DONNY
		No--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong?

				DONNY
		Well--

				DUDE
		They're nihilists.

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		They kept saying they believe in 
		nothing.

				WALTER
		Nihilists!  Jesus.

Walter looks haunted.

Say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, 
Dude, at least it's an ethos.

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				WALTER
		And let's also not forget--let's not 
		forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, 
		an amphibious rodent, for uh, 
		domestic, you know, within the city--
		that isn't legal either.

				DUDE
		What're you, a fucking park ranger 
		now?

				WALTER
		No, I'm--

				DUDE
		Who gives a shit about the fucking 
		marmot!

				WALTER
		--We're sympathizing here, Dude--

				DUDE
		Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need 
		your sympathy, man, I need my fucking 
		Johnson!

				DONNY
		What do you need that for, Dude?

				WALTER
		You gotta buck up, man, you can't go 
		into the tournament with this negative 
		attitude--

				DUDE
		Fuck the tournament!  Fuck you, 
		Walter!

There is a moment of stunned silence.

				WALTER
		Fuck the tournament?!

SAD; QUIET:

				WALTER
		Okay Dude.  I can see you don't want 
		to be cheered up.  C'mon Donny, let's 
		go get a lane.

They leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar.  As he stares

DOWN INTO HIS EMPTY GLASS:

				DUDE
		Another Caucasian, Gary.

				VOICE
		Right, Dude.

STILL STARING DOWN AT THE BAR:

				DUDE
		Friends like these, huh Gary.

				GARY
		That's right, Dude.

The pop song on the jukebox has ended; someone puts on 
"Tumbling Tumbleweeds."

A man saunters up to the bar to take the stool that Walter 
vacated.  He is middle-aged, amiable, craggily handsome--Sam 
Elliot, perhaps.  He has a large Western-style mustache and 
wears denims, a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat.

TO THE BARTENDER:

				MAN
		D'ya have a good sarsaparilla?

We recognize the voice of The Stranger whose narration opened 
the movie.

				BARTENDER
		Sioux City Sarsaparilla.

The Stranger nods.

				THE STRANGER
		That's a good one.

Waiting for his drink, he looks amiably around the bar.  His 
crinkled eyes settle on the Dude.

				THE STRANGER
		How ya doin' there, Dude?

The Dude, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head.

				DUDE
		Ahh, not so good, man.

				THE STRANGER
		One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser 
		fella than m'self once said, sometimes 
		you eat the bar and sometimes the 
		bar, wal, he eats you.

				DUDE
			(absently)
		Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern 
		thing?

				THE STRANGER
		Far from it.

				DUDE
		Mm.

The bartender puts a brown bottle and a frosted glass on the 
bar in front of The Stranger, who touches his hat brim.

				THE STRANGER
		Much obliged.

He looks back at the Dude.

				THE STRANGER
		I like your style, Dude.

THE DUDE LOOKS UP, ABSENTLY:

				DUDE
		Well I like your style too, man.  
		Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.

				THE STRANGER
		Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude.  
		D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?

The Dude looks at The Stranger as if just now noticing how 
out of place the cowpoke is.

				DUDE
		The fuck are you talking about?

The Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the 
bar.

				THE STRANGER
		Okay, have it your way.

He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip.

				THE STRANGER
		Take it easy, Dude.

				DUDE
		Yeah.  Thanks man.

He is gone.  "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" is ending as we hear an 
offscreen voice, breaking the spell:

				VOICE
		Dude!  Dude!

THE DUDE LOOKS:

Tony, the unformed limo driver, is at the door of the bar, 
beckoning.

MAUDE'S LOFT

She strides toward us, naked under a robe which she is just 
cinching shut.  Paint flecks her skin.

				MAUDE
		Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the 
		doctor.

				DUDE
		No it's fine, really, uh--

				MAUDE
		Do you have any news regarding my 
		father's money?

				DUDE
		I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta 
		respecfully, 69 you know, tender my 
		resignation on that matter, 'cause 
		it looks like your mother really was 
		kidnapped after all.

				MAUDE
		She most certainly was not!

				DUDE
		Hey man, why don't you fucking listen 
		occasionally?  You might learn 
		something.  Now I got--

				MAUDE
		And please don't call her my mother.

				DUDE
		Now I got--

				MAUDE
		She is most definitely the perpetrator 
		and not the victim.

				DUDE
		I'm telling you, I got definitive 
		evidence--

				MAUDE
		From who?

				DUDE
		The main guy, Dieter--

				MAUDE
		Dieter Hauff?

				DUDE
		Well--yeah, I guess--

				MAUDE
		Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?

				DUDE
		Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, 
		you know him?

				MAUDE
		Dieter has been on the fringes of--
		well, of everything in L.A., for 
		about twenty years.  Look at my LP's.  
		Under 'Autobahn.'

The Dude fingers through the albums filling one bookshelf.

				MAUDE
		That was his group--they released 
		one album in the mid-seventies.

The Dude stops between two albums.

				DUDE
		Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.

				MAUDE
		Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their 
		music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.

The Dude pulls out an album with a worn sleeve.  On it is 
the group's name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, and a 
picture

OF THREE YOUNG GERMANS, THEIR FOREHEADS LOOMING BELOW 
SLICKED-

back hair, gazing upward in thin-lipped epiphany.  They are 
wearing severe but modishly retro suits.  Each has his name 
under his picture--Dieter, Kieffer; and Franz.  A bed of 
nails is the only set dressing on the cyc.

				DUDE
		Jeez.  I miss vinyl.

				MAUDE
		Is he pretending to be the abductor?

				DUDE
		Well...yeah--

				MAUDE
		Look, Jeffrey, you don't really  
		kidnap someone that you're acquainted 
		with.  You can't get away with it if 
		the hostage knows who you are.

				DUDE
		Well yeah...I know that.

				MAUDE
		So Dieter has the money?

				DUDE
		Well, no, not exactly.  It's a 
		complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins.  
		Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to 
		keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands 
		in old Duder's--

				MAUDE
		Do you still have that doctor's 
		number?

				DUDE
		Huh?  No, really, I don't even have 
		the bruise any more, I--

She is scribbling.

				MAUDE
		Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be 
		responsible for any delayed after-
		effects.

				DUDE
		Delayed after-eff--

				MAUDE
		I want you to see him immediately.

She is picking up a telephone.

				MAUDE
		I'll see if he's available.  He's a 
		good man, and thorough.

CLOSE SHOT   THE DUDE

His eyes are closed, a headset on, his shirt off.  Leaking 
tinnily through the headset we hear the opening bars of 
"Comin' Up Around the Bend."

Behind him, cropped so that we see only a little of his torso, 
a white-smocked figure taps at the Dude's back.  After a 
moment the figure circles to one side, out of frame.  His 
hand reaches in to pull one arm of the headset away from the 
Dude's ear, and as he does so the music issues more strongly.

				VOICE
		Could you slide your shorts down 
		please, Mr.  Lebowski?

The Dude's eyes open.

				DUDE
		Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.

				VOICE
		I understand sir.  Could you slide 
		your shorts down please?

DUDE'S CAR

The Dude is driving home.  A Creedence tape plays.  The Dude 
is sucking down a joint.  He glances at the rear-view mirror--
and, noticing something, looks again.

HIS POV

A Volkswagon bug is following, a lone fat man driving.

THE DUDE

His eyes still on the mirror, he absently takes the joint 
between thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it 
out the driver's window--except that the window is not open.  
The butt bounces off the glass and around the car, showering 
sparks.

DUDE'S CROTCH

The glowing butt rolls down the car seat between his legs. 
The Dude screams.

THE STREET

The car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off 
to, make way, horns blaring.  The car finally spins and comes 
to rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone 
poll.

INSIDE THE CAR

The Dude frantically grabs at his door, which won't open, 
and then slides over to push at the passenger door, which 
also won't open.

				DUDE
		Fuck Me.

But he is sitting on the passenger  side now,  away from  
the lit butt.  He looks around for it.

Smoke is wisping up from between the Driver's seat cushion 
and back cushion.

				DUDE
		Fuckola, man.

He takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions.   
There is a hissing  sound.   But there is a piece of paper 
sticking out from between the cushions.

The Dude pulls it out.

It is lined spiral notebook paper, slightly singed and 
dripping beer, covered with handwriting.  In the upper right-
hand corner is the name Lawrence Sellers, and under that, 
Mrs. Jamtoss 5th Period.  The theme is titled "The Louisiana 
Purchase."  In red ink is a large circled D and some 
handwritten marginal comments; misspelled words are circled 
in red throughout.

CRANE JACKSON'S FOUNTAIN STREET THEATER

We are behind Walter, the Dude, and Donny, facing the stage 
in the background where Allan, the Dude's balding landlord, 
is performing a dance moderne.

As Walter talks to the Dude he leans in to him, his voice 
hushed, so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse 
audience.

				WALTER
		He lives in North Hollywood on 
		Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--

				DUDE
		The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.

				WALTER
		Near the In-and-Out Burger--

				DONNY
		Those are good burgers, Walter.

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid 
		is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his 
		father is--are you ready for this?--
		Arthur Digby Sellers.

				DUDE
		Who the fuck is that?

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?

				WALTER
		Who the f--have you ever heard of a 
		little show called Branded, Dude?

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				WALTER
		All but one man died?  There at Bitter 
		Creek?

				DUDE
		Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show 
		Walter, so what?

				WALTER
		Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 
		156 episodes, Dude.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		The bulk of the series.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		Not exactly a lightweight.

				DUDE
		No.

				WALTER
		And yet his son is a fucking dunce.

				DUDE
		Uh.

				WALTER
		Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out 
		there after the, uh, the.

He waves a hand vaguely toward the stage.

				WALTER
		What have you.  We'll, uh--

				DONNY
		We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, 
		brace the kid--he'll be a pushover.  
		We'll get that fucking money, if he 
		hasn't spent it already.  Million 
		fucking clams. And yes, we'll be 
		near the, uh--some burgers, some 
		beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking 
		troubles are over, Dude.

RESIDENTIAL AREA

The Dude and Walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated 
house sitting on a scrubby lot.  Parked incongruously in 
front of the house is a brand new red Corvette.

				DUDE
		Fuck me, man!  That kid's already 
		spent all the money!

				WALTER
		Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's 
		still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, 
		depending on the options.  Wait in 
		the car, Donny.

THE FRONT DOOR

Walter rings the bell.  It is opened by a matronly Spanish 
woman.

				WOMAN
		Jace?

				WALTER
		Hello, Pilar?  My name is Walter 
		Sobchak, we spoke on the phone, this 
		is my associate Jeffrey Lebowski.

				WOMAN
		Jace.

				WALTER
		May we uh, we wanted to talk about 
		little Larry.  May we come in?

				WOMAN
		Jace.

They enter a dim living room and stand, looking about, as 
Pilar

CALLS UP THE STAIRS:

				PILAR
		Larry!  Sweetie!  Dat mang is here!

There is a rhythmic compressor sound; Walter places it and 
nudges the Dude.  At the other end of the living room a man 
lies on something that looks like a hospital gurney with its 
midsection enclosed by a motorized stainless-steel bubble.  
It is an iron lung, artificially breathing with distinct 
hisses in and out.

				WALTER
		That's him, Dude.

				VIVA VOCE
		And a good day to you, sir.

				PILAR
		See down, please.

				WALTER
		Thank you, ma'am.

He and the Dude sit on a sagging green sofa.  In a lowered 
voice, to Pilar:

				WALTER
		Does he, uh. . . Is he still writing?

				PILAR
		No, no.  He has healt' problems.

				WALTER
		Uh-huh.

HE BELLOWS ACROSS THE ROOM:

				WALTER
		I just want to say, sir, that we're 
		both enormous--on a personal level, 
		Branded, especially the early 
		episodes, has been a source of, uh, 
		inspir---

There are footsteps on the stairs.  Larry, a fifteen-year-
old, looks at the two men.

				PILAR
		See down, Sweetie.  These are the 
		policeman--

				WALTER
		No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the 
		impression that we're police exactly.  
		We're hoping that it will not be 
		necessary to call the police.

He adopts his command voice in turning to Larry:

				WALTER
		But that is up to little Larry here.  
		Isn't it, Larry?

Walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out 
the homework, which is now in a ziploc bag.  He holds it out 
at arm's length, displaying it to Larry.

				WALTER
		Is this your homework, Larry?

Larry does not respond.

				WALTER
		Is this your homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		Look, man, did you--

				WALTER
		Dude, please!. . .  Is this your 
		homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		Just ask him if he--ask him about 
		the car, man!

Walter is still holding out the homework.

				WALTER
		Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your 
		homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		Is the car out front yours?

				WALTER
		Is this your homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		We know it's his fucking homework, 
		Walter!  Where's the fucking money, 
		you little brat?

Throughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework 
extended towards him.

				WALTER
		Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard 
		of Vietnam?

				DUDE
		Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!

				WALTER
		You're going to enter a world of 
		pain, son.  We know that this is 
		your homework.  We know you stole a 
		car--

				DUDE
		And the fucking money!

				WALTER
		And the fucking money.  And we know 
		that this is your homework, Larry.

No answer.

				WALTER
		You're gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!.

FINALLY, IN DISGUST:

				WALTER
		Ah, this is pointless.

As he shoves the homework back in the attache case:

				WALTER
		All right, Plan B.  You might want 
		to watch out the front window there, 
		Larry.

He is heading for the door.  The Dude, puzzled, rises to 
follow him.

				WALTER
		This is what happens when you FUCK a 
		STRANGER in the ASS, Larry.

OUTSIDE

Walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like 
an enraged encyclopedia salesman.  Without looking back at, 
the Dude, who follows:

				WALTER
		Fucking language problem, Dude.

He pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase and takes 
out a tire iron.

				WALTER
		Maybe he'll understand this.

He is walking over to the Corvette.

				WALTER
		YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!

CRASH!  He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which 
shatters.

				WALTER
		YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?!

CRASH!  He takes out the driver's window.

				WALTER
		THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A 
		STRANGER IN THE ASS!

Lights are going on in houses down the street.  Distant dogs 
bark.

				WALTER
		HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!

CRASH!

				WALTER
		HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS!  FUCK A STRANGER 
		IN THE ASS!

CRASH!

A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over 
behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of 
the crowbar.

				MAN
		WHAT THE FUCK JOO DOING, MANG?!

He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter.

				MAN
		I JUS' BAWDEEZ FUCKEEN CAR LASS WEEK!

Walter cringes before the enraged Mexican.

				WALTER
		Hunh?

The man looks about, wildly.

				MAN
		I KILL JOO, MANG!  I--I KILL JOR 
		FUCKEEN CAR!

He runs over to the Dude's car.

				DUDE
		No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--

CRASH!  CRASH!

				MAN
		I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

CRASH!

				MAN
		I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

INSIDE THE CAR

Glass rains in on a terrified, cringing, Donny.

				MAN
		I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

					  ON A DEAFENING CRASH WE CUT TO:

THE DUDE'S CAR

We are looking into the car through the broken windshield as 
it rattles down the freeway.  Wind whistles through the caved-
in windows.

The Dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the

road.  Walter, beside him, and Donny in the back seat, munch 
'on In-and-Out Burgers.

Creedence music plays above the bluster of wind.

DUDE'S BUNGALOW

As the Dude talks on the phone he is hammering a two-by-four 
into the floor just inside, and parallel to, the front door.

				DUDE
		I accept your apology. . . No I, I 
		just want to handle it myself from 
		now on. . . No.  That has nothing to 
		do with it. . . .Yes, it made it 
		home, I'm calling from home.  No, 
		Walter, it didn't look like Larry 
		was about to crack.

He finishes hammering, rises and grabs a straightbacked chair 
that stands nearby.

				DUDE
		Well that's your perception. . . 
		Well you're right, Walter, and the 
		unspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND 
		LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE. . . Yeah, 
		I'll be at practice.

He hangs up and has just finished sliding the chair into 
place with its top under the doorknob and its legs braced 
against the two-by-four, thus wedging the door closed, when 
the door is opened--outwards.  The chair clatters to the 
floor.

				DUDE
		Huh?

Woo and the blond man who earlier peed on the rug stride in, 
kicking the chair away.

				WOO
		Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie
		Treehorn wants to see you.

				BLOND MAN
		And we know which Lebowski you are, 
		Lebowski.

				WOO
		Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk 
		to the deadbeat Lebowski.

				BLOND MAN
		You're not dealing with morons here.

BLACKNESS

Out of the blackness something is falling toward us.  It is 
a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her 
mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy.  She is topless.  
She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a 
beat reappears, rising into the night sky.

MALIBU BEACH

A crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried 
hair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual 
attire, are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in 
nightmarish slow motion.

WIDER

It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing 
kerosene heaters.  1960's mainstream jazz, of the Mancini-
Brubeck school, has been piped down to speakers on the beach'.

In long shot now the woman rises, squealing, disappears  
into darkness, descends into light, rises again.

A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach 
light.  He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants 
and a Turnbull & Asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the 
neck.  Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and 
disappears.

				MAN
		Hello Dude, thanks for coming.  I'm 
		Jackie Treehorn.

INSIDE THE BEACH HOUSE

The Dude is looking around at the '60's modern decor.

				DUDE
		This is quite a pad you got here, 
		man.  Completely unspoiled.

				TREEHORN
		What's your drink, Dude?

				DUDE
		White Russian, thanks.  How's the 
		smut business, Jackie?

				TREEHORN
		I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in 
		publishing, entertainment, political 
		advocacy, and--

				DUDE
		Which one was Logjammin'?

				TREEHORN
		Regrettably, it's true, standards 
		have fallen in adult entertainment.  
		It's video, Dude.  Now that we're 
		competing with the amateurs, we can't 
		afford to invest that little extra 
		in story, production value, feeling.

He taps his forehead with one finger.

				TREEHORN
		People forget that the brain is the 
		biggest erogenous zone--

				DUDE
		On you, maybe.

He hands him the drink.

				TREEHORN
		Of course, you do get the good with 
		the bad.  The new technology permits 
		us to do exciting things with 
		interactive erotic software.  Wave 
		of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off 
		manually.

				TREEHORN
		Of course you do.  I can see you're 
		anxious for me to get to the point.  
		Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?

				DUDE
		I thought you might know, man.

				TREEHORN
		Me?  How would I know?  The only 
		reason she ran off was to get away 
		from her rather sizable debt to me.

				DUDE
		But she hasn't run off, she's been--

Treehorn waves this off.

				TREEHORN
		I've heard the kidnapping story, so 
		save it.  I know you're mixed up in 
		all this, Dude, and I don't care 
		what you're trying to take off her 
		husband.  That's your business.  All 
		I'm saying is, I want mine.

				DUDE
		Yeah, well, right man, there are 
		many facets to this, uh, you know, 
		many interested parties.  If I can 
		find your money, man-- what's in it 
		for the Dude?

				TREEHORN
		Of course, there's that to discuss.  
		Refill?

				DUDE
		Does the Pope shit in the woods?

				TREEHORN
		Let's say a 10% finder's fee?

				DUDE
		Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way 
		you do business.  Your money is being 
		held by a kid named Larry Sellers.  
		He lives in North Hollywood, on 
		Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger.  
		A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure 
		your goons'll be able to get it off 
		him, mean he's only fifteen and he's 
		flunking social studies.  So if you'll 
		just write me a check for my ten per 
		cent. . . of half a million. . . 
		fifty grand.

He is getting to his feet, but sways woozily.

				DUDE
		I'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you 
		mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.

The Dude shakes his head, tries to focus.

				TREEHORN
		A fifteen-year-old?  Is this your 
		idea of a joke?

Jackie Treehorn's image starts to swim.  He is joined on 
either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking 
grimly down at the Dude.

				DUDE
		No funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid's 
		got it.  Hiya, fellas. . . kid just 
		wanted a car.  All the Dude ever 
		wanted. . . was his rug back. . . 
		not greedy. . . it really.

He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus.  
Tied the room together.

He tips forward, spilling his drink off the table.

FROM UNDER THE GLASS COFFEE TABLE

Looking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and 
squishes.

FAST FADE OUT

BLACK

				THE STRANGER'S VOICE
		Darkness warshed over the Dude--
		darker'n a black steer's tookus on a 
		moonless prairie night.  There was 
		no bottom.

We hear a thundering bass.

SCRATCHY WHITE TITLE CARD:

JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS

ANOTHER TITLE CARD:

THE DUDE

AND

MAUDE LEBOWSKI

IN

THIRD TITLE CARD:

GUTTERBALLS

The title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked 
by a pair of  bowling balls.   The  bending bass sound turns  
into the lead-in to Kenny Rogers and the First Edition's  
"Just Dropped In."

The Dude is walking down a long corridor dressed as a cable 
repairman.  The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light 
as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley.

In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing 
operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song.  She wears an 
armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails, 
and holds a trident.

The Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps 
her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball.

The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini- 
skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs 
turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the 
end.

But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their 
legs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane, 
the tools from his utility belt swinging free.  He is face 
down, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides.

His point of view shows the lane rushing by below, the little 
ball-guide arrows zipping by.

The Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so 
that he is now gliding along the lane face-up.

Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing 
chorines.

The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so 
that he is once again gliding face-down.  He looks forward 
and his forward momentum blows back his hair.

Coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs, 
are the approaching pins.  We hit the pins, scattering them,  
and rush on into black.

A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless 
woman, squealing, her legs kicking.

As she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three 
men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool 
of light.  It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding 
oversized shears which they menacingly scissor.

The Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the 
advancing Germans.  He turns and runs, fists pumping.

The scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of 
car-bys.  The field of black is punctured by headlights.  
The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific 
Coast Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring.

With the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with 
flashing gumballs pulls up.

SQUAD CAR

The Dude sits in the back seat, his head lolling with the 
motion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of Branded:

				DUDE
		He was innocent.  Not a charge was 
		true.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay.

CHIEF'S OFFICE

The Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces 
off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair.

His wallet is tossed onto the desk.

The chief leans forward, takes the wallet and sorts through 
it with disgusted incredulity.

				CHIEF
		This is your only I.D.?

He is looking at the Ralph's Shopper's Club card.
				DUDE
		I know my rights.

				CHIEF
		You don't know shit, Lebowski.

				DUDE
		I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I 
		want Bill Kunstler.

				CHIEF
		What are you, some kind of sad-assed 
		refugee from the fucking sixties?

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				CHIEF
		Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to 
		eject you from his garden party, 
		that you were drunk and abusive.

				DUDE
		That guy treats women like objects, 
		man.

				CHIEF
		Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in 
		this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw 
		shit.  We got a nice quiet beach 
		community here, and I aim to keep it 
		nice and quiet.  So let me make 
		something plain.  I don't like you 
		sucking around bothering our citizens, 
		Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk-
		off name, I don't like your jerk-off 
		face, I don't like your jerk- off 
		behavior, and I don't like you, jerk-
		off --do I make myself clear?

The Dude stares.

				DUDE
		I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude.  It 
hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee 
splashing everywhere.

The Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk.

				DUDE
		--Ow!  Fucking fascist!

The Chief slaps him twice.

				CHIEF
		Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!

He kicks the chair out from under the Dude, and then starts 
kicking at him.

				CHIEF
		Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!  Keep 
		your ugly fucking goldbricking ass 
		out of my beach community!

CAB

The Dude, in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks 
with every bump, is gingerly touching at sore spots on his 
face and scalp.

"Peaceful Easy Feeling" is on the radio.

DUDE'S POV

The back of the driver, a large black man with rasta dreds 
under a knit cap.

				DUDE
		Jesus, man, can you change the 
		station?

				DRIVER
		Fuck you man!  You don't like my 
		fucking music, get your own fucking 
		cab!

				DUDE
		I've had a--

				DRIVER
		I pull over and kick your ass out, 
		man!

				DUDE
		--had a rough night, and I hate the 
		fucking Eagles, man--

				DRIVER
		That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!

THE STREET

The cab screeches over towards the curb.  Another car, 
oncoming, its radio blaring Metallica, speeds by.

INSIDE THE OTHER CAR

It is a red convertible.  The driver, singing loudly and 
badly along with the radio, her hair blowing in the wind, a 
dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along, higher than a 
kite, is Bunny Lebowski.

THE FOOTWELL

On the accelerator her right foot, in an open-toed bright 
red high-heeled shoe, has five painted toes.

When she downshifts her left foot enters to engage the clutch.

Five more toes.

DUDE'S BUNGALOW

The Dude staggers in the open front door, one hand pressed 
to a lump on his forehead, and looks around.

				DUDE
		Jesus.

The place is a wreck.  Furniture has been overturned, 
upholstery slashed, drawers dumped.

Quiet.

The door to the bedroom starts to creak open.

The Dude cringes.

Maude emerges from the bedroom.  She is wearing a bathrobe.

				MAUDE
		Jeffrey.

				DUDE
		Maude?

She pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches.

				MAUDE
		Love me.

The Dude is stupefied.

				DUDE
		That's my robe.

					 THOOMP!  ON THE EMBRACE WE CUT TO:

BLACK

After a beat, a long sigh, and then a voice from the 
blackness:

				MAUDE
		Tell me a little about yourself, 
		Jeffrey.

				DUDE
		Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.

A match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude is lighting 
himself a joint.  He shakes the match out to restore blackness 
except for the glowing tip of the joint.

				DUDE
		I was, uh, one of the authors of the 
		Port Huron Statement.--The original 
		Port Huron Statement.

				MAUDE
		Uh-huh.

				DUDE
		Not the compromised second draft.  
		And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the 
		Seattle Seven?

				MAUDE
		Mmnun.

Click--the Dude turns on a bedside lamp.  He and Maude lie 
next to each other in bed.

				DUDE
		And then. . . let's see, I uh--music 
		business briefly.

				MAUDE
		Oh?

				DUDE
		Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed 
		of Sound Tour.

				MAUDE
		Uh-huh.

				DUDE
		Bunch of assholes.  And then, you 
		know, little of this, little of that. 
		My career's, uh, slowed down a bit 
		lately.

				MAUDE
		What do you do for fun?

				DUDE
		Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl.  
		Drive around.  The occasional acid 
		flashback.

He climbs out of bed but Maude remains in it.  She wedges a 
pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each 
kneecap.  She pulls her knees in toward her chest to keep 
her pelvis raised.

				MAUDE
		What happened to your house?

				DUDE
		Jackie Treehorn trashed the place.  
		Wanted to save the finder's fee.

				MAUDE
		Finder's fee?

				DUDE
		He thought I had your father's money, 
		so he got me out of the way while he 
		looked for it.

				MAUDE
		It's not my father's money, it's the 
		Foundation's.  Why did he think you 
		had it?  And who does?

				DUDE
		Larry Sellers, a high-school kid.  
		Real fucking brat.

He picks a White Russian off the bedside table.

				MAUDE
		Jeffrey--

				DUDE
		It's a complicated case, Maude.  
		Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately 
		I've been adhering to a pretty strict, 
		uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, 
		you know, limber.  I'm real fucking 
		close to your father's money, real 
		fucking close.  It's just--

				MAUDE
		I keep telling you, it's the 
		Foundation's money.  Father doesn't 
		have any.

				DUDE
		Huh?  He's fucking loaded.

				MAUDE
		No no, the wealth was all Mother's.

				DUDE
		But your father--he runs stuff, he--

				MAUDE
		We did let Father run one of the 
		companies, briefly, but he didn't do 
		very well at it.

				DUDE
		But he's--

				MAUDE
		He helps administer the charities 
		now, and I give him a reasonable 
		allowance.  He has no money of his 
		own.  I know how he likes to present 
		himself; Father's weakness is vanity.  
		Hence the slut.

				DUDE
		Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is 
		that yoga?

Throughout, Maude has been lying on her back with her knees 
pulled in.

				MAUDE
		It increases the chances of 
		conception.

The Dude spits some White Russian.

				DUDE
		Increases?

				MAUDE
		Well yes, what did you think this 
		was all about?  Fun and games?

				DUDE
		Well...no, of course not--

				MAUDE
		I want a child.

				DUDE
		Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--

				MAUDE
		Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner.  
		In fact I don't want the father to 
		be someone I have to see socially, 
		or who'll have any interest in rearing 
		the child himself.

				DUDE
		Huh...

Something occurs to him.

				DUDE
		So...that doctor.

				MAUDE
		Exactly.  What happened to your face?  
		Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?

The Dude is staring off into space, thinking.  His answer is 
absent.

				DUDE
		No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu.  
		A real reactionary. . . So your 
		father. . . Oh man, I get it!

				MAUDE
		What?

The Dude is leaving the bedroom.

				DUDE
		Yeah, my thinking about the case, 
		man, it had become uptight.  Yeah.  
		Your father--

LIVING ROOM

The Dude finishes punching a number into the phone.

				PHONE VOICE
		This is Walter Sobchak.  I'm not in; 
		leave a message after the beep.

FROM THE BEDROOM:

				MAUDE'S VOICE
		What're you talking about?

Beep.

				DUDE
		Walter, if you're there, pick up the 
		fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, 
		this is an emergency.  I'm not--

				WALTER
		Dude?

				DUDE
		Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I 
		need you to come pick me up--

				WALTER
		I can't drive, Dude, it's erev 
		shabbas.

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm 
		not even supposed to pick up the 
		phone, unless it's an emergency.

				DUDE
		It is a fucking emergency.

				WALTER
		I understand.  That's why I picked 
		up the phone.

				DUDE
		THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, 
		just call Donny then, and ask him to--

				WALTER
		Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--

				DUDE
		WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA 
		GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR 
		I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!

				MAUDE'S VOICE
		Jeffrey?

THE DUDE

He emerges on his front stoop, pulling on a shirt. His 
attention is caught by something down the street.

HIS POV

A car is  parked halfway down the block.  We can see the 
shape of a fat man in the driver's seat.

THE DUDE

Striding purposefully down the street.

HIS POV

The fat man leans forward and we hear the sound of the car's 
ignition coughing, but the engine will not turn over.  More 
whines and coughs; no start.

The man hurriedly fumbles in front of him.  He brings up a 
newspaper, which he holds before his face.

THE DUDE

As he gets to the car.  He reaches through the open driver's 
window and grabs the newspaper and hurls it to the ground.  
He is revved with nervous energy.

				DUDE
		Get out of that fucking car, man!

The man nervously complies.  The Dude flinches at the man's 
movement as he gets out.

The man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch.

He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit.  He is bald with a 
short fringe and a mustache.

The Dude shouts to cover his fear:

				DUDE
		Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, 
		man!

				MAN
		Relax, man!  No physical harm 
		intended!

				DUDE
		Who the fuck are you?  Why've you 
		been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!

				MAN
		Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.

The Dude is stunned.

				DUDE
		Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?

				MAN
		Irish m--What the fuck are you talking 
		about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a 
		private snoop!  Like you, man!

				DUDE
		Huh?

				DA FINO
		A dick, man!  And let me tell you 
		something: I dig your work. Playing 
		one side against the other--in bed 
		with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.

				DUDE
		I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay 
		away from my fucking lady friend, 
		man.

				DA FINO
		Hey hey, I'm not messing with your 
		special lady--

				DUDE
		She's not my special lady, she's my 
		fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping 
		her conceive, man!

				DA FINO
		Hey, man, I'm not--

				DUDE
		Who're you working for?  Lebowski?  
		Jackie Treehorn?

				DA FINO
		The Gundersons.

				DUDE
		The?  Who the fff--

				DA FINO
		The Gundersons.  It's a wandering 
		daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man.  
		Her real name is Fawn Gunderson.  
		Her parents want her back.

He is fumbling in his wallet.

				DA FINO
		See?

The Dude looks at the picture.

It is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but 
fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and 
straight Partridge Family hair and bangs.

				DUDE
		Jesus fucking Christ.

				DA FINO
		Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.

He is holding out another picture.

The Gundersons told me to show her this when I found her.  
The family farm.

A bleak farmhouse and silo are the only features on a flat 
snow-swept landscape.

Outside of Moorhead, Minnesota.  They think it'll make her 
homesick.

				DUDE
		Boy.  How ya gonna keep 'em down on 
		the farm once they seen Karl Hungus.

He hands back the picture.

She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.  Or maybe not, but she's 
definitely not around.

				DA FINO
		Fuck, man!  That's terrible!

				DUDE
		Yeah, it sucks.

				DA FINO
		Well maybe you and me could pool our 
		resources--trade information--
		professional courtesy--compeers, you 
		know--

We hear distant yapping, growing louder with the hum of an 
approaching car.

				DUDE
		Yeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino.  
		And stay away from my special la--
		from my fucking lady friend.

The Dude steps out to meet Walter's car as it pulls up, its 
passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and 
yapping.

DENNY'S

Four people sit at a booth:  Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in 
black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde 
hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless 
tee-shirt, worn thin with age.  She is apparently braless, 
and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and 
arms.

Notable  is  her  camera-side  leg,  which  ends in  a bandage-
swaddled foot.  Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of 
the bandage. The  four  are  arguing,  loudly,  in  German.   
They seem  very unhappy. A waitress enters with a checkpad 
and pen.

				WAITRESS
		You folks ready?

The German shouting stops.  Dieter looks sourly up.

				DIETER
		I haff lingenberry pancakes.

				KIEFFER
		Lingenberry pancakes.

				FRANZ
		Sree picks in blanket.

The woman speaks to Dieter in German.  He nods.

				DIETER
		Lingenberry pancakes.

WALTER'S CAR

Walter's eyes are on the road as he listens, driving, to the 
Dude, whose speech is occasionally punctuated by yaps from 
the back seat.

				DUDE
		I mean we totally fucked it up, man.  
		We fucked up his pay-off.  And got 
		the kidnappers all pissed off, and 
		the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, 
		but he didn't do anything.  Huh?

				WALTER
		Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, 
		uh.

				DUDE
		I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck-
		up, then why does he still leave me 
		in charge of getting back his wife?  
		Because he fucking doesn't want her 
		back, man!  He's had enough!  He no 
		longer digs her!  It's all a show!  
		But then, why didn't he give a shit 
		about his million bucks?  I mean, he 
		knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, 
		but he never asked for it back.

				WALTER
		What's your point, Dude?

				DUDE
		His million bucks was never in it, 
		man!  There was no money in that 
		briefcase!  He was hoping they'd 
		kill her!  You throw out a ringer 
		for a ringer!

				WALTER
		Yeah?

				DUDE
		Shit yeah!

				WALTER
		Okay, but how does all this add up 
		to an emergency?

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		I'm saying, I see what you're getting 
		at, Dude, he kept the money, but my 
		point is, here we are, it's shabbas, 
		the sabbath, which I'm allowed to 
		break only if it's a matter of life 
		and death--

				DUDE
		Walter, come off it.  You're not 
		even fucking Jewish, you're--

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you talking about?

				DUDE
		You're fucking Polish Catholic--

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you talking about?  
		I converted when I married Cynthia!  
		Come on, Dude!

				DUDE
		Yeah, and you were--

				WALTER
		You know this!

				DUDE
		And you were divorced five fucking 
		years ago.

				WALTER
		Yeah?  What do you think happens 
		when you get divorced?  You turn in 
		your library card?  Get a new driver's 
		license?  Stop being Jewish?

				DUDE
		This driveway.

AS HE TURNS:

				WALTER
		I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye

				DUDE
		It's just part of your whole sick 
		Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her 
		fucking dog.  Going to her fucking 
		synagogue.  You're living in the 
		fucking past.

				WALTER
		Three thousand years of beautiful 
		tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax--
		YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE 
		PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell 
		happened?

He is looking off as the car slows.  The Dude looks where 
Walter is looking.

THE LEBOWSKI MANSION

Walter's car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he 
and the Dude get out.

Both are gaping off at the front lawn.

				WALTER
		Jesus Christ.

THEIR POV

Tire treads lead across the manicured front lawn to where a 
little red sports car rests with its hood crumpled into a 
palm trunk.

TRACKING DOWN THE GREAT HALLWAY

Through the French doors at its far end we can see Bunny, 
naked, briefly bouncing on the diving board before splashing 
into the illuminated pool outside.  Heavy metal music filters 
in from a boom box by the pool.

Brandt, approaching, stoops and straightens, stoops and 
straightens, picking up the discarded clothes that run the 
length of the hall.

				BRANDT
		He can't see you, Dude.

We pull the Dude and Walter as they approach the doors to 
the great study.  Walter's dog follows, stiffly waving its 
tail.

				DUDE
		Where'd she been?

				BRANDT
		Visiting friends of hers in Palm 
		Springs.  Just picked up and left, 
		never bothered to tell us.

				DUDE
		But I guess she told Dieter.

				WALTER
		Jesus, Dude!  He never even kidnapped 
		her.

				BRANDT
		Who's this gentleman, Dude?

				WALTER
		Who'm I?  I'm a fucking VETERAN!

				BRANDT
		You shouldn't go in there, Dude!  
		He's very angry!

BANG--the Dude and Walter push through the double doors into--

THE GREAT ROOM

The big Lebowski turns at the sound of the door.  His 
wheelchair hums as he spins it around.

				LEBOWSKI
			(bitterly)
		Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.

				DUDE
		Where's the money, Lebowski?

				WALTER
		A MILLION BUCKS FROM FUCKING NEEDY 
		LITTLE URBAN ACHIEVERS!  YOU ARE 
		SCUM, MAN!

The dog yaps.

				LEBOWSKI
		Who the hell is he?

				WALTER
		I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy 
		who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY 
		GOLDBRICKING ASS!

				DUDE
		We know the briefcase was empty, 
		man.  We know you kept the million  
		bucks yourself.

				LEBOWSKI
		Well, you have your story, I have 
		mine.  I say I entrusted the money 
		to you, and you stole it.

				WALTER
		AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING 
		YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!

				DUDE
		You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped 
		and you could use it as a pretext to 
		make some money disappear.  All you 
		needed was a sap to pin it on, and 
		you'd just met me.  You thought, 
		hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone 
		the square community won't give a 
		shit about.

				LEBOWSKI
		Well?  Aren't you?

				DUDE
		Well. . . yeah.

				LEBOWSKI
		All right, get out.  Both of you.

				WALTER
		Look at that fucking phony, Dude!  
		Pretending to be a fucking 
		millionaire!

				LEBOWSKI
		I said out.  Now.

				WALTER
		Let me tell you something else.  
		I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, 
		and this guy is a fake.  A fucking 
		goldbricker.

He is crossing to Lebowski.

				WALTER
		This guy fucking walks.  I've never 
		been more certain of anything in my 
		life!

				LEBOWSKI
		Stay away from me, mister!

Walter reaches around from behind and hoists the big Lebowski 
out of the wheelchair by his armpits.

				WALTER
		Walk, you fucking phony!

The big Lebowski waggles helplessly, his rubbery feet grazing 
the floor like a Raggedy Ann's.  The pomeranian gaily leaps 
and yaps.

				LEBOWSKI
		Put me down, you son of a bitch!

				DUDE
		Walter!

				WALTER
		It's all over, man!  We call your 
		fucking bluff!

				DUDE
		WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S 
		CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!

				WALTER
		Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS!
		ACHTUNG, BABY!!

He shoves the big Lebowski forward and he crumples to the 
floor, weeping.

				WALTER
		Oh, shit.

				LEBOWSKI
			(sobbing)
		You're bullies!  Cowards, both of 
		you!

Walter is abashed.  The Big Lebowski flails about on the 
floor.

				WALTER
		Oh, shit.

				DUDE
		He can't walk, Walter!

				WALTER
		Yeah, I can see that, Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		You monsters!

				DUDE
		Help me put him back in his chair.

Walter moves to comply.

				WALTER
		Shit, sorry man.

THROUGH HIS TEARS:

				LEBOWSKI
		Stay away from me!  You bullies!  
		You and these women!  You won't leave 
		a man his fucking balls!

				DUDE
		Walter, you fuck!

				WALTER
		Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I 
		wouldn't've done it if I knew he was 
		a fucking crybaby.

				DUDE
		We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.

The Dude has picked up the Big Lebowski's plaid lap warmer 
and is frantically tucking it back in around his waist and 
batting the dog away.

				DUDE
		There ya go.  Sorry man.

Walter, puzzled, hands on hips, stands over the big Lebowski.

				WALTER
		Shit.  He didn't look like a spinal.

TEN PINS

Scattered at the cut.

DUDE AND WALTER

Each with a beer at the scoring table.

				WALTER
		Sure you'll see some tank battles.  
		But fighting in desert is very 
		different from fighting in canopy 
		jungle.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war 
		whereas, uh, this thing should be a 
		fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an 
		M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking 
		tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, 
		eyeball to eyeball.

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				WALTER
		That's fuckin' combat.  The man in 
		the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy 
		fuckin' adversary.

				DONNY
		Who's in pyjamas, Walter?

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch 
		of fig-eaters with towels on their 
		heads tryin' to find reverse on a 
		Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--

				VOICE
		HEY!

The Dude and Walter look.

Quintana is bellowing from the lip of the lane, and is 
restrained by O'Brien.

				QUINTANA
		What's this "day of rest" shit, man?!

Walter looks at him innocently.

				QUINTANA
		What is this bullshit, man?  I don't 
		fucking care!  It don't matter to 
		Jesus!  But you're not fooling me!  
		You might fool the fucks in the league 
		office, but you don't fool Jesus!  
		It's bush league psych-out stuff!  
		Laughable, man!  I would've fucked 
		you in the ass Saturday, I'll fuck 
		you in the ass next Wednesday instead!

				QUINTANA

He makes hip-grinding coital motions as O'Brien leads him 
away.

				QUINTANA
		You got a date Wednesday, man!

Walter, his head cocked, and the Dude, peeking over his 
shades, watch him go.

				WALTER
		He's cracking.

BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT

Donny, Walter and the Dude emerge from the alley, each holding 
his leatherette ball satchel.

				WALTER
		A tree of life, Dude.  To all who 
		cling to it.

They react to the droning synthesizer-based technopop coming 
from a boom box.

REVERSE

Dieter, Kieffer and Franz, in shiny black leather, stand in 
a line facing them in the all-but-deserted lot.  Behind them 
orange flames lick gently at the Dude's car, which has been 
put to the torch.  The orange flames glow on the men's 
creaking leather.  Next to the car are three motorcycles, 
parked in a neat row.  The Dude looks sadly at the burning 
car.

				DUDE
		They finally did it.  They killed my 
		fucking car.

				DIETER
		Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.

				KIEFFER
		Ja, uzzervize vee kill ze girl.

				FRANZ
		Ja, it seems you forgot our little 
		deal, Lebowski.

				DUDE
		You don't have the fucking girl, 
		dipshits.  We know you never did.  
		So you've got nothin' on my Johnson.

				DUDE

The men in black, stunned, confer amongst themselves in 
German.  Under his breath:

				DONNY
		Are these the Nazis, Walter?

Walter answers, also sotto voce, his eyes still on the three 
men:

				WALTER
		They're nihilists, Donny, nothing to 
		be afraid of.

The Germans stop conferring.

				DIETER
		Vee don't care.  Vee still vant zat 
		money or vee fuck you up.

				KIEFFER
		Ja, vee still vant ze money.  Vee 
		sreaten you.

He pulls an uzi from under his coat.  It glints in the 
firelight.

				WALTER
		Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.

				DUDE
		Hey, cool it Walter.

Walter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans:

				WALTER
		There's no ransom if you don't have 
		a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom 
		is.  Those are the fucking rules.

				DIETER
		Zere ARE no ROOLZ!

				WALTER
		NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS-
		OF- BITCHES--

				KIEFFER
		His girlfriend gafe up her toe!  She 
		sought we'd be getting million 
		dollars!  Iss not fair!

				WALTER
		Fair!  WHO'S THE FUCKING NIHILIST 
		HERE!  WHAT ARE YOU, A BUNCH OF 
		FUCKING CRYBABIES?!

				DUDE
		Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, 
		there never was any money.  The big 
		Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, 
		man, so take it up with him.

				WALTER
		AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!

The Germans confer again, in German.

Donny is visibly frightened.

				DONNY
		Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?

WALTER 'S TONE IS GENTLE:

				WALTER
		They won't hurt us, Donny.  These 
		men are cowards.

THE CONFERENCE ENDS:

				DIETER
		Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on 
		you und vee call it eefen.

				WALTER
		Fuck you.

The Dude is digging into his pocket.

				DUDE
		Come on, Walter, we're ending this 
		thing cheap.

Walter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Dieter's.

				WALTER
		What's mine is mine.

				DUDE
		Come on, Walter!.

Louder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet:

				DUDE
		Four dollars here!

He inspects the change in his palm.

				DUDE
		Almost five!

				DONNY
			(tremulously)
		I got eighteen dollars, Dude.

				WALTER
			(grimly)
		What's mine is mine.

With a ring of steel, Dieter produces a glinting saber.

				DIETER
		VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR 
		MONEY!

				WALTER
			(coolly)
		Come and get it.

				DIETER
		VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!

				WALTER
		Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.

				DIETER
		I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!

				WALTER
		Show me what you got.  Nihilist.  
		Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.

In a rage, Dieter charges.

				DIETER
		I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!

WALTER

hurls his leather satchel.

KIEFFER

Watching Dieter's charge, is caught off-guard.  The bowling 
ball thuds into his chest and lifts him off his feet.

He falls back, his uzi clattering away.

WALTER

twists away as Dieter reaches him; grabs Dieter's head in 
both hands; draws Dieter's head up to his mouth, which closes 
on Dieter's ear.

DUDE

He rushes Franz but draws up short as Franz sends out karate 
kicks, his leather pants squeaking and popping.  Franz gives 
a loud cry with each kick; the Dude leans back, throwing his 
arms up, evading the kicks.

WALTER

His jaw is still clamped on Dieter's ear.  Dieter draws his 
saber against Walter's side, drawing blood.

Walter doesn't react to the wound.  Growling as Dieter 
screams, he worries his ear, waggling his head with his jaws 
clamped.

THE SABER

Dieter drops it.

DUDE

Awkwardly circling, evading Franz's kicks.

WALTER

still worrying the ear.  With a tearing sound his head and 
Dieter's separate.

DIETER, EARLESS, SCREAMS:

				DIETER
		I FUCK YOU!  YOU CANNOT HURT ME!  I 
		BELIEF IN NUSSING!

Walter spits his ear into his face.

DUDE

The Dude and Franz, both now panting heavily, have yet to 
establish body contact.  Franz continues to kick.

				FRANZ
		VEAKLING!

WALTER

draws back his fist.

				DIETER
		NUSSING!

				WALTER
		ANTI-SEMITE!

Bam!--A powerhouse blow to the middle of his face drops Dieter 
for the count.

DUDE AND FRANZ

With a piercing shriek Franz finally summons the nerve to 
charge the Dude, hands raised to deliver karate blows.

As he reaches the Dude--WHHAP--the  boom box swings into  
frame to smash him in the face.  Its volume shoots up.

Walter bashes him a few more times over the head.  The music 
screeches to static, then quiet.  Laid out now, Franz too is 
quiet.

All quiet.

Walter, panting, looks around.

				WALTER
		We've got a man down, Dude.

With a hand pressed to his bleeding side he trots over to 
Donny, who lies gasping on the ground.

The Dude, also panting, rises and trots over.

				DUDE
		Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!

				WALTER
		No Dude.

				DUDE
		They shot Donny!

Donny gasps for air.  His eyes, wide, go from the Dude to 
Walter.  One hand still clutches his eighteen dollars.

				WALTER
		There weren't any shots.

				DUDE
		Then what's...

				WALTER
		It's a heart attack.

				DUDE
		Wha.

				WALTER
		Call the medics, Dude.

				DUDE
		Wha. . . Donny--

				WALTER
		Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping 
		blood.  Might pass out.

The Dude runs into the lanes.  Walter lays a reassuring hand 
on Donny's shoulder.

				WALTER
		Rest easy, good buddy, you're doing 
		fine.  We got help choppering in.

FADE OUT

HOLD IN BLACK

THE DUDE AND WALTER

---

They sit side by side, forearms on knees, in a nondescript 
waiting area.  Walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off 
those of the other.  They sit.  They wait.

A tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters.  He 
eyes the Dude's bowling attire and sunglasses and Walter's 
army surplus, but doesn't make an issue of it.

				MAN
		Hello, gentlemen.  You are the 
		bereaved?

				DUDE
		Yeah man.

				MAN
		Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet 
		you.

				DUDE
		Jeffrey Lebowski.

				WALTER
		Walter Sobchak.

				DUDE
		The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.

				DONNELLY
		Excuse me?

				DUDE
		Nothing.

				DONNELLY
		Yes.  I understand you're taking 
		away the remains.

				WALTER
		Yeah.

				DONNELLY
		We have the urn.

He nods through a door.  Another man in a black suit enters 
to carefully deposit a large silver urn on the desktop.

				DONNELLY
		And I assume this is credit card?

He is vaguely handing a large leather folder across the desk 
to whomever wants to take it.

				WALTER
		Yeah.

He takes it, opens it, puts on reading glasses that sit 
halfway down his nose, and inspects the bill with his head 
pulled back for focus and cocked for concentration.  Silence.  
The Dude smiles at Donnelly.  Donnelly gives back a 
mortician's smile.  At length Walter holds the bill towards 
Donnelly, pointing.

				WALTER
		What's this?

				DONNELLY
		That is for the urn.

				WALTER
		Don't need it.  We're scattering the 
		ashes.

				DONNELLY
		Yes, so we were informed.  However, 
		we must of course transmit the remains 
		to you in a receptacle.

				WALTER
		This is a hundred and eighty dollars.

				DONNELLY
		Yes sir.  It is our most modestly 
		priced receptacle.

				DUDE
		Well can we--

				WALTER
		A hundred and eighty dollars?!

				DONNELLY
		They range up to three thousand.

				WALTER
		Yeah, but we're--

				DUDE
		Can we just rent it from you?

				DONNELLY
		Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental 
		house.

				WALTER
		We're scattering the fucking ashes!

				DUDE
		Walter--

				WALTER
		JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T 
		MEAN WE'RE SAPS!

				DONNELLY
		Sir, please lower your voice--

				DUDE
		Hey man, don't you have something 
		else you could put it in?

				DONNELLY
		That is our most modestly priced 
		receptacle.

				WALTER
		GODDAMNIT!  IS THERE A RALPH'S AROUND 
		HERE?!

POINT DUME -- DAY

It is a high, wind-swept bluff.  Walter and the Dude walk 
towards the lip of the bluff.  Parked in the background is 
one lonely car, Walter's.

Walter is carrying a bright red coffee can with a blue plastic 
lid.  When they reach the edge the two men stand awkwardly 
for a beat.  Finally:

				WALTER
		I'll say a few words.

The Dude clasps his hands in front of him.  Walter clears 
his throat.

				WALTER
		Donny was a good bowler, and a good 
		man.  He was. . . He was one of us.  
		He was a man who loved the outdoors, 
		and bowling, and as a surfer explored 
		the beaches of southern California 
		from Redondo to Calabassos.  And he 
		was an avid bowler.  And a good 
		friend.  He died--he died as so many 
		of his generation, before his time.  
		In your wisdom you took him, Lord.  
		As you took so many bright flowering 
		young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc 
		and Hill 364.  These young men gave 
		their lives.  And Donny too.  Donny 
		who. . . who loved bowling.

Walter clears his throat.

				WALTER
		And so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos, 
		in accordance with what we think   
		your dying wishes might well have 
		been, we commit your mortal remains 
		to the bosom of.

Walter is peeling the plastic lid off the coffee can.

				WALTER
		the Pacific Ocean, which you loved 
		so well.

AS HE SHAKES OUT THE ASHES:

				WALTER
		Goodnight, sweet prince.

The wind has blown all of the ashes into the Dude, standing 
just to the side of and behind Walter. The Dude stands, 
frozen. Finished eulogizing, Walter looks back.

				WALTER
		Shit, I'm sorry Dude.

He starts brushing off the Dude with his hands.

				WALTER
		Goddamn wind.

Heretofore motionless, the Dude finally explodes, slapping 
Walter's hands away.

				DUDE
		Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking 
		asshole!

				WALTER
		Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!

The Dude is near tears.

				DUDE
		You make everything a fucking 
		travesty!

				WALTER
		Dude, I'm--it was an accident!

The Dude gives Walter a furious shove.

				DUDE
		What about that shit about Vietnam!

				WALTER
		Dude, I'm sorry--

				DUDE
		What the fuck does Vietnam have to 
		do with anything!  What the fuck 
		were you talking about?!

Walter for the first time is genuinely distressed, almost 
lost.

				WALTER
		Shit Dude, I'm sorry--

				DUDE
		You're a fuck, Walter!

He gives Walter a weaker shove.  Walter seems dazed, then 
wraps his arms around the Dude.

				WALTER
		Awww, fuck it Dude.  Let's go bowling.

THE LANES THE DUDE AND WALTER BOWLING

We watch each of them glide across the floor, release, follow 
through--gracefully.  We have never seen them bowl before.  
They are quite good.  Each wears a black armband on his 
bowling shirt.

BAR AREA

The Dude walks up to the bar.

				DUDE
		Two oat sodas, Gary.

				GARY
		Right.  Good luck tomorrow.

				DUDE
		Thanks, man.

				GARY
		Sorry to hear about Donny.

				DUDE
		Yeah.  Well, you know, sometimes you 
		eat the bear, and, uh.

"Tumbling Tumbleweeds" has come up on the jukebox, and The 
Stranger ambles up to the bar.

				THE STRANGER
		Howdy do, Dude.

				DUDE
		Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered 
		if I'd see you again.

				THE STRANGER
		Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things 
		been goin'?

				DUDE
		Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, 
		ups and downs.

The Stranger's eyes crinkle merrily.

				THE STRANGER
		Sure, I gotcha.

The bartender has put two gleaming beers on the counter.

				DUDE
		Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I 
		gotta get back.

				THE STRANGER
		Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know 
		that you will.

THE DUDE, LEAVING, NODS:

				DUDE
		Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude 
		abides.

Gazing after him, The Stranger drawls, savoring the words:

				THE STRANGER
		The Dude abides.

He gives his head a shake of appreciation, then looks into 
the camera.

				THE STRANGER
		I don't know about you, but I take 
		comfort in that.  It's good knowin' 
		he's out there, the Dude, takin' her 
		easy for all us sinners.  Shoosh.  I 
		sure hope he makes The finals.  Welp, 
		that about does her, wraps her all 
		up.  Things seem to've worked out 
		pretty good for the Dude'n Walter, 
		and it was a purt good story, dontcha 
		think?   Made me laugh to beat the 
		band.  Parts, anyway.  Course--I 
		didn't like seein' Donny go. But 
		then, happen to know that there's a 
		little Lebowski on the way.  I guess 
		that's the way the whole durned human 
		comedy keeps perpetuatin' it-self, 
		down through the generations, westward 
		the wagons, across the sands a time 
		until-- aw, look at me, I'm ramblin' 
		again.  Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed 
		yourselves.

He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip as we begin to pull 
back.

				THE STRANGER
		Catch ya further on down the trail.

As we pull away The Stranger swivels in to the bar.  As his 
voice fades:

				THE STRANGER
		...Say friend, ya got any more a 
		that good sarsaparilla?...
THE BIG LEBOWSKI

We are floating up a steep scrubby slope.  We hear male voices 
gently singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and a deep, affable, 
Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps:

				VOICE-OVER
		A way out west there was a fella, 
		fella I want to tell you about, fella 
		by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At 
		least, that was the handle his lovin' 
		parents gave him, but he never had 
		much use for it himself.  This 
		Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.  
		Now, Dude, that's a name no one would 
		self-apply where I come from.  But 
		then, there was a lot about the Dude 
		that didn't make a whole lot of sense 
		to me.  And a lot about where he 
		lived, like- wise.  But then again, 
		maybe that's why I found the place 
		s'durned innarestin'.

We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at 
twilight stretches out before us.

				VOICE-OVER
		They call Los Angeles the City of 
		Angels.  I didn't find it to be that 
		exactly, but I'll allow as there are 
		some nice folks there.  'Course, I 
		can't say I seen London, and I never 
		been to France, and I ain't never 
		seen no queen in her damn undies as 
		the fella says.  But I'll tell you 
		what, after seeing Los Angeles and 
		thisahere story I'm about to unfold--
		wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' 
		bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any 
		a those other places, and in English 
		too, so I can die with a smile on my 
		face without feelin' like the good 
		Lord gypped me.

INTERIOR   RALPH'S

It is late, the supermarket all but deserted.  We are tracking 
in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the 
dairy case.  He is the Dude.  His rumpled look and relaxed 
manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep.

He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their 
expiration dates.

				VOICE-OVER
		Now this story I'm about to unfold 
		took place back in the early nineties--
		just about the time of our conflict 
		with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I 
		only mention it 'cause some- times 
		there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro, 
		'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes 
		there's a man.

The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of 
milk.  He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs.

				VOICE-OVER
		And I'm talkin' about the Dude here-- 
		sometimes there's a man who, wal, 
		he's the man for his time'n place, 
		he fits right in there--and that's 
		the Dude, in Los Angeles.

CHECKOUT GIRL

She waits, arms folded.  A small black-and white TV next to 
her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with 
helicopter rotors spinning behind him.

				GEORGE BUSH
		This aggression will not stand. . . 
		This will not stand!

The Dude, peeking over his shades, scribbles something at 
the little customer's lectern.  Milk beads his mustache.

				VOICE-OVER
		...and even if he's a lazy man, and 
		the Dude was certainly that--quite 
		possibly the laziest in Los Angeles 
		County.

The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and 
is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents.

				VOICE-OVER
		...which would place him high in the 
		runnin' for laziest worldwide--but 
		sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes 
		there's a man.

EXTERIOR  RALPH'S

Long shot of the glowing Ralph's.  There are only two or 
three cars parked in the huge lot.

				VOICE-OVER
		Wal, I lost m'train of thought here.  
		But--aw hell, I done innerduced him 
		enough.

The Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot.  
Next to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and 
cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk.  
The two men's footsteps echo in the still of the night.

After a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points.

				DUDE
		It's the LeBaron.

DUDE'S HOUSE

The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow 
court.  He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small 
leatherette satchel in the other.  He awkwardly hugs the 
grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door.

INSIDE

The Dude enters and flicks on a light.

His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit.  
We track with him as he is rushed through the living room, 
his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body.  
Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece 
of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a 
hole.

The Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small 
bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of 
doorframe.  His head is plunged into the toilet.  The paper 
bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet 
rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the 
floor.

The Dude blows bubbles.

				VOICE
		We want that money, Lebowski.  Bunny 
		said you were good for it.

Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and 
gasps for air.

				VOICE
		Where's the money, Lebowski!

His head is plunged back into the toilet.

				VOICE
		Where's the money, Lebowski!

The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping.

				VOICE
		WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!

				DUDE
		It's uh, it's down there somewhere.  
		Lemme take another look.

His head is plunged back in.

				VOICE
		Don't fuck with us.  If your wife 
		owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that 
		means you owe money to Jackie 
		Treehorn.

The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and 
flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against 
the toilet.

The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand.

Looming over him is a strapping blond man.

Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly 
and walks over to a rug.

				CHINESE MAN
		Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.

He starts peeing on the rug.

The Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his 
sunglasses.

				DUDE
		Oh, man.  Don't do--

				BLOND MAN
		You see what happens?  You see what 
		happens, Lebowski?

The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses.

				DUDE
		Look, nobody calls me Lebowski.  You 
		got the wrong guy.  I'm the Dude, 
		man.

				BLOND MAN
		Your name is Lebowski.  Your wife is 
		Bunny.

				DUDE
		Bunny?  Look, moron.

He holds up his hands.

				DUDE
		You see a wedding ring?  Does this 
		place look like I'm fucking married?   
		All my plants are dead!

The blond man stoops to unzip the satchel.  He pulls out a 
bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious 
native.

				BLOND MAN
		The fuck is this?

The Dude pats at his pockets, takes out a joint and lights 
it.

				DUDE
		Obviously you're not a golfer.

The blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile.

				BLOND MAN
		Woo?

The Chinese man is zipping his fly.

				WOO
		Yeah?

				BLOND MAN
		Wasn't this guy supposed to be a 
		millionaire?

				WOO
		Uh?

They both look around.

				WOO
		Fuck.

				BLOND MAN
		What do you think?

				WOO
		He looks like a fuckin' loser.

The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger 
and peeks over them.

				DUDE
		Hey.  At least I'm housebroken.

The two men look at each other.  They turn to leave.

				WOO
		Fuckin' waste of time.

The blond man turns testily at the door.

				BLOND MAN
		Thanks a lot, asshole.

						 ON THE DOOR SLAM WE CUT TO:

BOWLING PINS

Scattered by a strike.

Music and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins 
flying, bowlers hoisting balls, balls gliding down lanes, 
sliding feet, graceful releases, ball return spinning up a 
ball, fingers sliding into fingerholes, etc.

The music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant 
jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike.

A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail 
turns from the strike to walk back to the bench.

				MAN
		Hot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight.  
		Mark it, Dude.

We are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man 
nursing a large plastic cup of Bud.  He has dark worried 
eyes and a goatee.  Hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts.  
He also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves 
cut off over an old bowling shirt.  This is Walter.  He 
squints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he 
addresses the Dude at the scoring table.

The Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, wears 
some of its foam on his mustache.

				WALTER
		This was a valued rug.

He elaborately clears his throat.

				WALTER
		This was, uh--

				DUDE
		Yeah man, it really tied the room 
		together--

				WALTER
		This was a valued, uh.

Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next Walter.

				DONNY
		What tied the room together, Dude?

				WALTER
		Were you listening to the story, 
		Donny?

				DONNY
		What--

				WALTER
		Were you listening to the Dude's 
		story?

				DONNY
		I was bowling--

				WALTER
		So you have no frame of reference, 
		Donny.  You're like a child who 
		wanders in in the middle of a movie 
		and wants to know--

				DUDE
		What's your point, Walter?

				WALTER
		There's no fucking reason--here's my 
		point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--

				DONNY
		Yeah Walter, what's your point?

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		What's the point of--we all know who 
		was at fault, so what the fuck are 
		you talking about?

				WALTER
		Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you 
		talking--I'm not--we're talking about 
		unchecked aggression here--

				DONNY
		What the fuck is he talking about?

				DUDE
		My rug.

				WALTER
		Forget it, Donny.  You're out of 
		your element.

				DUDE
		This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I 
		can't go give him a bill so what the 
		fuck are you talking about?

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you talking about?!  
		This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm 
		talking about drawing a line in the 
		sand, Dude.  Across this line you do 
		not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is 
		not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- 
		American.  Please.

				DUDE
		Walter, this is not a guy who built 
		the rail- roads, here, this is a guy 
		who peed on my--

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you--

				DUDE
		Walter, he peed on my rug--

				DONNY
		He peed on the Dude's rug--

				WALTER
		YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This 
		Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.

				DUDE
		So who--

				WALTER
		Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other 
		Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire.  
		He's gonna be easier to find anyway 
		than these two, uh. these two  . . . 
		And he has the wealth, uh, the 
		resources obviously, and there is no 
		reason, no FUCKING reason, why his 
		wife should go out and owe money and 
		they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?

				DUDE
		No, but--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong!

				DUDE
		Yeah, but--

				WALTER
		Okay. That, uh.

He elaborately clears his throat.

That rap really tied the room together, did it not?

				DUDE
		Fuckin' A.

				DONNY
		And this guy peed on it.

				WALTER
		Donny!  Please!

				DUDE
		Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--

				DONNY
		His name is Lebowski?  That's your 
		name, Dude!

				DUDE
		Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should 
		compensate me for the fucking rug.  
		I mean his wife goes out and owes 
		money and they pee on my rug.

				WALTER
		Thaaat's right Dude; they pee on 
		your fucking Rug.

CLOSE ON A PLAQUE

We pull back from the name JEFFREY LEBOWSKI engraved in silver 
to reveal that the plaque, from Variety Clubs International, 
honors Lebowski as ACHIEVER OF THE YEAR.

Reflected in the plaque we see the Dude entering the room 
with a YOUNG MAN.  We hear the two men talk:

				YOUNG MAN
		And this is the study.  You can see 
		the various commendations, honorary 
		degrees, et cetera.

				DUDE
		Yes, uh, very impressive.

				YOUNG MAN
		Please, feel free to inspect them.

				DUDE
		I'm not really, uh.

				YOUNG MAN
		Please!  Please!

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

We are panning the walls, looking at various citations and

certificates unrelated to the ones being discussed offscreen:

				YOUNG MAN
		That's the key to the city of 
		Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was 
		given two years ago in recognition 
		of his various civic, uh.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				YOUNG MAN
		That's a Los Angeles Chamber of 
		Commerce Business Achiever award, 
		which is given--not necessarily given 
		every year!  Given only when there's 
		a worthy, somebody especially--

				DUDE
		Hey, is this him with Nancy?

				YOUNG MAN
		That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the 
		first lady, yes, taken when--

				DUDE
		Lebowski on the right?

				YOUNG MAN
		Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, 
		Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--

				DUDE
		He's handicapped, huh?

				YOUNG MAN
		Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And 
		this picture was taken when Mrs. 
		Reagan was first lady of the nation, 
		yes, yes? Not of California.

				DUDE
		Far out.

				YOUNG MAN
		And in fact he met privately with 
		the President, though unfortunately 
		there wasn't time for a photo 
		opportunity.

				DUDE
		Nancy's pretty good.

				YOUNG MAN
		Wonderful woman.  We were very--

				DUDE
		Are these.

				YOUNG MAN
		These are Mr. Lebowski's children, 
		so to speak--

				DUDE
		Different mothers, huh?

				YOUNG MAN
		No, they--

				DUDE
		I guess he's pretty, uh, racially 
		pretty cool--

				YOUNG MAN
		They're not his, heh-heh, they're 
		not literally his children; they're 
		the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, 
		inner-city children of promise but 
		without the--

				DUDE
		I see.

				YOUNG MAN
		--without  the means  for higher  
		education, so Mr. Lebowski  has 
		committed  to sending  all of them 
		to college.

				DUDE
		Jeez.  Think he's got room for one 
		more?

				YOUNG MAN
		One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went 
		to college?

				DUDE
		Well, yeah I did, but I spent most 
		of my time occupying various, um, 
		administration buildings--

				YOUNG MAN
		Heh-heh--

				DUDE
		--smoking thai-stick, breaking into 
		the ROTC--

				YOUNG MAN
		Yes, heh--

				DUDE
		--and bowling.  I'll tell you the 
		truth, Brandt, I don't remember most 
		of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!

Our continuing track and pan have brought us onto a framed 
Life Magazine cover which is headlined ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI 
ACHIEVER?  Oddly, the Dude's sunglassed face is on it; we 
realize that, under the magazine's logo and headline, the 
display is mirrored.

We hear the door open and the whine of a motor.  The Dude, 
wearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look.

So does Brandt, the young man we've been listening to.  He 
wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin.

Entering the room is a fat sixtyish man in a motorized 
wheelchair--Jeff Lebowski.

				LEBOWSKI
		Okay sir, you're a Lebowski, I'm a 
		Lebowski, that's terrific, I'm very 
		busy so what can I do for you?

He wheels himself behind a desk.  The Dude sits facing him 
as Brandt withdraws.

				DUDE
		Well sir, it's this rug I have, really 
		tied the room together-

				LEBOWSKI
		You told Brandt on the phone, he 
		told me.  So where do I fit in?

				DUDE
		Well they were looking for you, these 
		two guys, they were trying to--

				LEBOWSKI
		I'll say it again, all right?  You 
		told Brandt.  He told me.  I know 
		what happened. Yes?  Yes?

				DUDE
		So you know they were trying to piss 
		on your rug--

				LEBOWSKI
		Did I urinate on your rug?

				DUDE
		You mean, did you personally come 
		and pee on my--

				LEBOWSKI
		Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla 
		usted Inglese?  I'll say it again.  
		Did I urinate on your rug?

				DUDE
		Well no, like I said, Woo peed on 
		the rug--

				LEBOWSKI
		Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I 
		just want to understand this, sir--
		every time a rug is micturated upon 
		in this fair city, I have to 
		compensate the--

				DUDE
		Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam 
		anybody here, I'm just--

				LEBOWSKI
		You're just looking for a handout 
		like every other--are you employed, 
		Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Look, let me explain something.   
		I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. 
		Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's  
		what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. 
		His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if,  
		you know, you're not into the whole 
		brevity thing--

				LEBOWSKI
		Are you employed, sir?

				DUDE
		Employed?

				LEBOWSKI
		You don't go out and make a living 
		dressed like that in the middle of a 
		weekday.

				DUDE
		Is this a--what day is this?

				LEBOWSKI
		But I do work, so if you don't mind--

				DUDE
		No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds.  
		This will not stand, ya know, this 
		will not stand, man.  I mean, if 
		your wife owes--

				LEBOWSKI
		My wife is not the issue here. I 
		hope that my wife will someday learn 
		to live on her allowance, which is 
		ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that 
		will be her problem, not mine, just 
		as your rug is your problem, just as 
		every bum's lot in life is his own 
		responsibility regardless of whom he 
		chooses to blame.  I didn't blame 
		anyone for the loss of my legs, some 
		chinaman in Korea took them from me 
		but I went out and achieved anyway.  
		I can't solve your problems, sir, 
		only you can.

The Dude rises.

				DUDE
		Ah fuck it.

				LEBOWSKI
		Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer!  
		Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your 
		answer to everything!

The Dude is heading for the door.

				LEBOWSKI
		Your "revolution" is over, Mr.  
		Lebowski!  Condolences!  The bums 
		lost!

As the Dude opens the door.

				LEBOWSKI
		...My advice is, do what your parents 
		did!  Get a job, sir!  The bums will 
		always lose-- do you hear me, 
		Lebowski?  THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS--

The Dude shuts the door on the old man's bellowing to find 
himself--

				HALLWAY
		--in a high coffered hallway.  Brandt 
		is approaching.

				BRANDT
		How was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Okay.  The old man told me to take 
		any rug in the house.

WALKWAY

A houseman with a rolled-up carpet on one shoulder goes down 
a stone walk that winds through the back lawn, past a swimming 
pool to a garage.  Brandt and the Dude follow.

				BRANDT
		Manolo will load it into your car 
		for you, uh, Dude.

				DUDE
		It's the LeBaron.

DUDE'S POINT OF VIEW

Tracking toward the pool.  A young woman sits facing it, her 
back to us, leaning forward to paint her toenails.

Beyond her a black form floats in an inflatable chair in the 
pool.

				BRANDT
		Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see 
		you again some time, Dude.

				DUDE
		Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the 
		neighborhood, need to use the john.

CLOSER TRACK

Arcing around the woman's foot as she finishes painting the 
nails emerald green.

THE DUDE

Looking.

WIDER

The young woman looks up at him.  She is in her early 
twenties.

She leans back and extends her leg toward the Dude.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Blow on them.

The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose and peeks over 
them.

				DUDE
		Huh?

She waggles her foot and giggles.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		G'ahead.  Blow.

The Dude tentatively grabs hold of her extended foot.

				DUDE
		You want me to blow on your toes?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Uh-huh. . . I can't blow that far.

The Dude looks over at the pool.

				DUDE
		You sure he won't mind?

The man bobbing in the inflatable chair is passed out.  He 
is thin, in his thirties, with long stringy blond hair.  He 
wears black leather pants and a black leather jacket, open, 
shirtless, exposing fine blond chest hair and pale skin.  
One arm trails off into the water; next to it, an empty 
whiskey bottle bobs.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Dieter doesn't care about anything.  
		He's a nihilist.

				DUDE
		Practicing?

The young woman smiles.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		You're not blowing.

Brandt nervously takes the Dude by the elbow.

				BRANDT
		Our guest has to be getting along, 
		Mrs.  Lebowski.

The Dude grudgingly allows himself to be led away, still 
looking at the young woman.

				DUDE
		You're Bunny?

				BUNNY
		I'll suck your cock for a thousand 
		dollars.

Brandt releases a gale of forced laughter:

				BRANDT
		Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Wonderful woman.  Very 
		free-spirited.  We're all very fond 
		of her.

				BUNNY
		Brandt can't watch though.  Or he 
		has to pay a hundred.

				BRANDT
		Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  That's marvelous.

He continues to lead away the Dude, who looks back over his

SHOULDER:

				DUDE
		I'm just gonna find a cash machine.

BOWLING PINS

Scattered by a strike.

THE BOWLERS

Donny calls out from the bench:

				DONNY
		Grasshopper Dude--They're dead in 
		the water!!

As the Dude walks back to the scoring table he turns to 
another team in black bowling shirts--the Cavaliers--that 
shares the lane.

				DUDE
		Your maples, Carl.

Walter, just arriving, is carrying a leatherette satchel in 
one hand and a large plastic carrier in the other.

				WALTER
		Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it 
		is no dream.

				DUDE
		You're fucking twenty minutes late.  
		What the fuck is that?

				WALTER
		Theodore Herzel.

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		State of Israel.  If you will it, 
		Dude, it is no--

				DUDE
		What the fuck're you talking about?  
		The carrier.  What's in the fucking 
		carrier?

				WALTER
		Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian.  
		Can't leave him home alone or he 
		eats the furniture.

				DUDE
		What the fuck are you--

				WALTER
		I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian.  
		I'm looking after it while Cynthia 
		and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.

				DUDE
		You brought a fucking Pomeranian 
		bowling?

				WALTER
		What do you mean "brought it bowling"?  
		I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not 
		buying it a fucking beer.  He's not 
		gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.

He lets the small yapping dog out of the carrier.  It scoots 
around the bowling table, sniffing at bowlers and wagging 
its tail.

				DUDE
		Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked 
		me to take care of her fucking dog 
		while she and her boyfriend went to 
		Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck 
		herself.  Why can't she board it?

				WALTER
		First of all, Dude, you don't have 
		an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show 
		dog with fucking papers.  You can't 
		board it.  It gets upset, its hair 
		falls out.

				DUDE
		Hey man--

				WALTER
		Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over 
		the line!

Smokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter.

				WALTER
		Smokey Huh?

				WALTER
		Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry.  
		That's a foul.

				SMOKEY
		Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.

				WALTER
		Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.

				SMOKEY
		Bullshit. Walter!

				WALTER
		This is not Nam.  This is bowling.  
		There are rules.

				DUDE
		Come on Walter, it's just--it's 
		Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a 
		little, it's just a game.

				WALTER
		This is a league game.  This 
		determines who enters the next round-
		robin, am I wrong?

				SMOKEY
		Yeah, but--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong!?

				SMOKEY
		Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the 
		marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an 
		eight.

Walter takes out a gun.

				WALTER
		Smokey my friend, you're entering a 
		world of pain.

				DUDE
		Hey Walter--

				WALTER
		Mark that frame an eight, you're 
		entering a world of pain.

				SMOKEY
		I'm not--

				WALTER
		A world of pain.

A manager in a bowling-shirt style uniform is running for a 
phone.

				SMOKEY
		Look Dude, I don't hold with this.  
		This guy is your partner, you should--

Walter primes the gun and points it at his head.

				WALTER
		HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY?  AM 
		I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT 
		ABOUT THE RULES?  MARK IT ZERO!

The Pomeranian is excitedly yapping at Walter's elbow, making 
high body-twisting tail-wagging leaps.

				DUDE
		Walter, they're calling the cops, 
		put the piece away.

				WALTER
		MARK IT ZERO!

				SMOKEY
		Walter--

				WALTER
		YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE?  
		MARK IT ZERO!!

				SMOKEY
		All right!  There it is!  It's fucking 
		zero!

He points frantically at the score projected above the lane.

				SMOKEY
		You happy, you crazy fuck?

				WALTER
		This is a league game, Smokey!

PARKING LOT

Walter and the Dude walk to the Dude's car.  The Pomeranian 
trots happily behind Walter who totes the empty carrier.

				DUDE
		Walter, you can't do that.  These 
		guys're like me, they're pacificists.  
		Smokey was a conscientious objector.

				WALTER
		You know Dude, I myself dabbled with 
		pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, 
		of course--

				DUDE
		And you know Smokey has emotional 
		problems!

				WALTER
		You mean--beyond pacifism?

				DUDE
		He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!

As the two men get into the car:

				WALTER
		Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, 
		it's water under the bridge.  And we 
		do enter the next round-robin, am I 
		wrong?

				DUDE
		No, you're not wrong--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong!

				DUDE
		You're not wrong, Walter, you're 
		just an asshole.

They watch a squad car take a squealing turn into the lot.

				WALTER
		Okay then.  We play Quintana and 
		O'Brien next week.  They'll be 
		pushovers.

				DUDE
		Just, just take it easy, Walter.

				WALTER
		That's your answer to everything, 
		Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism 
		is not--look at our current situation 
		with that camelfucker in Iraq--
		pacifism is not something to hide 
		behind.

				DUDE
		Well, just take 't easy, man.

				WALTER
		I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

				DUDE
		Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!

				WALTER
			(smugly)
		Calmer than you are.

-his irritates the Dude further.

				DUDE
		Just take it easy, man!

Walter is still smug.

				WALTER
		Calmer than you are.

DUDE'S HOUSE

A large, brilliant Persian rug lies beneath the Dude's beat-
up old furniture.

At the table next to the answering machine the Dude is mixing 
kalhua, rum and milk.

				VOICE
		Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't 
		wanna be a hard-on about this, and I 
		know it wasn't your fault, but I 
		just thought it was fair to tell you 
		that Gene and I will be submitting 
		this to the League and asking them 
		to set aside the round.  Or maybe 
		forfeit it to us--

				DUDE
		Shit!

				VOICE
		--so, like I say, just thought, you 
		know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.

A beep.

				ANOTHER VOICE
		Mr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh, 
		well--at Mr. Lebowski's office.  
		Please call us as soon as is 
		convenient.

Beep.

				ANOTHER VOICE
		Mr. Lebowski, this is Fred Dynarski 
		with the Southern Cal Bowling League.  
		I just got a, an informal report, 
		uh, that a uh, a member of your team, 
		uh, Walter Sobchak, drew a loaded 
		weapon during league play--

We hear the doorbell.

THE DOOR

It swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding 
middle-aged man in a black T-shirt and black cut-off jeans.

				DUDE
		Hiya Allan.

				ALLAN
		Dude, I finally got the venue I 
		wanted.  I'm Performing my dance 
		quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane 
		Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on 
		Tuesday night, and I'd love it if 
		you came and gave me notes.

The Dude takes a swig of his kalhua.

				DUDE
		Sure Allan, I'll be there.

				ALLAN
		Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the 
		tenth.

				DUDE
		Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.

				ALLAN
		Just, uh, just slip the rent under 
		my door.

				DUDE
		Yeah, okay.

BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM

The  voice continues on the machine.

				VOICE
		--serious infraction, and examine 
		your standing.  Thank you.  Beep.

				VOICE
		Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again.  Please 
		do call us when you get in and I'll 
		send the limo.  Let me assure you--I 
		hope you're not avoiding this call 
		because of the rug, which, I assure 
		you, is not a problem.  We need your 
		help and, uh--well we would very 
		much like to see you.  Thank you.  
		It's Brandt.

TRACKING

We are pushing Brandt down the high-ceilinged hallway.  
Distantly, we hear a dolorous soprano.  Brandt talks back 
over

HIS SHOULDER:

				BRANDT
		We've had some terrible news.  Mr. 
		Lebowski is in seclusion in the West 
		Wing.

				DUDE
		Huh.

Brandt throws open a pair of heavy double doors.  The music 
washes over us as we enter a great study where Jeffrey 
Lebowski, a blanket thrown over his knees, stares hauntedly 
into a fire, listening to Lohengrin.

BRANDT ANNOUNCES, AMBIGUOUSLY:

				BRANDT
		Mr. Lebowski.

Jeffrey Lebowski waves the Dude in without looking around.

				LEBOWSKI
		It's funny.  I can look back on a 
		life of achievement, on challenges 
		met, competitors bested, obstacles 
		overcome.  I've accomplished more 
		than most men, and without the use 
		of my legs.  What. . . What makes a 
		man, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		Huh?

				DUDE
		I don't know, sir.

				LEBOWSKI
		Is it. . . is it, being prepared to 
		do the right thing?  Whatever the 
		price?  Isn't that what makes a man?

				DUDE
		Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.

Lebowski turns away from the Dude with a haunted stare, lost 
in thought.

				LEBOWSKI
		You're joking.  But perhaps you're 
		right.

The Dude thumps at his chest pocket.

				DUDE
		Mind if I smoke a jay?

				LEBOWSKI
		Bunny.

He turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on 
his cheeks.

				DUDE
		'Scuse me?

				LEBOWSKI
		Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light 
		of my life.  Are you surprised at my 
		tears, sir?

				DUDE
		Fuckin' A.

				LEBOWSKI
		Strong men also cry. . . Strong men 
		also cry.

He clears his throat.

				LEBOWSKI
		I received this fax this morning.

Brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and 
hands it to the Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		As you can see, it is a ransom note.  
		Sent by cowards.  Men who are unable 
		to achieve on a level field of play.  
		Men who will not sign their names.  
		Weaklings.  Bums.

THE DUDE EXAMINES THE FAX:

WE HAVE BUNNY.  GATHER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN UNMARKED NON-
CONSECUTIVE TWENTIES.  AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.  NO FUNNY STUFF.

				DUDE
		Bummer.

Lebowski looks soulfully at the Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		Brandt will fill you in on the 
		details.

He wheels his chair around to once again gaze into the fire.  
Brandt tugs at the Dude's shirt and points him back to the 
hall.

HALLWAY

The soprano's singing is once again faint.  Brandt's voice 
is hushed:

				BRANDT
		Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a 
		generous offer to you to act as 
		courier once we get instructions for 
		the money.

				DUDE
		Why me, man?

				BRANDT
		He suspects that the culprits might 
		be the very people who, uh, soiled 
		your rug, and you're in a unique 
		position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm 
		that suspicion.

				DUDE
		So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, 
		huh?

				BRANDT
		Well Dude, we just don't know.

BOWLING PINS

CRASH--scattered by a strike, in slow motion.

WIDER

Still in slow motion.  We are looking across the length of 
the bowling alley at a tall, thin, Hispanic bowler displaying 
perfect form.  He wears an all-in-one dacron-polyester stretch 
bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side.

FAST TRACK IN

On the Dude, sitting next to Walter in the molded plastic 
chairs. The Dude is staring off towards the bowler.

				DUDE
		Fucking Quintana--that creep can 
		roll, man--

BACK TO THE BOWLER

Displaying great slow-motion form as the Dude and Walter's 
conversation continues over.

				WALTER
		Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, 
		Dude.

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		The man is a sex offender.  With a 
		record.  Spent six months in Chino 
		for exposing himself to an eight-
		year-old.

FLASHBACK

We see Quintana, in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater,  
walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging 
the bell.

The VOICE-OVER conversation continues.

				DUDE
		Huh.

				WALTER
		When he moved down to Venice he had 
		to go door-to-door to tell everyone 
		he's a pederast.

The door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man 
looks dully out at Quintana, who looks hesitantly up.

				DONNY
		What's a pederast, Walter?

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.

PINS

scattered by a strike.

QUINTANA

wheeling and thrusting a black gloved fist into the air.

Stitched above the breast pocket of his all-in-one is his 
first name, "Jesus".

BACK TO WALTER AND THE DUDE

They have been joined by Donny.

				WALTER
		Anyway.  How much they offer you?

				DUDE
		Twenty grand.  And of course I still 
		keep the rug.

				WALTER
		Just for making the hand-off?

				DUDE
		Yeah.

He slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket.

				DUDE
		...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so  
		whenever these guys call--

				WALTER
		What if it's during a game?

				DUDE
		I told him if it was during league 
		play--

Donny has been watching Quintana.

				DONNY
		If what's during league play?

				WALTER
		Life does not stop and start at your 
		convenience, you miserable piece of 
		shit.

				DONNY
		What's wrong with Walter, Dude?

				DUDE
		I figure it's easy money, it's all 
		pretty harmless.  I mean she probably 
		kidnapped herself.

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DONNY
		What do you mean, Dude?

				DUDE
		Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean 
		look at it.  Young trophy wife.  
		Marries a guy for money but figures 
		he isn't giving her enough.  She 
		owes money all over town--

				WALTER
		That...fucking...bitch!

				DUDE
		It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin 
		said, look for the person who will 
		benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, 
		you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying 
		to say--

				DONNY
		I am the Walrus.

				WALTER
		That fucking bitch!

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				DONNY
		I am the Walrus.

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin!  
		Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

				DONNY
		What the fuck is he talking about?

				WALTER
		That's fucking exactly what happened, 
		Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!

				DUDE
		Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?

				DONNY
		Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed 
		off?

				WALTER
		Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking 
		thing-- I did not watch my buddies 
		die face down in the muck so that 
		this fucking strumpet--

				DUDE
		I don't see any connection to Vietnam, 
		Walter.

				WALTER
		Well, there isn't a literal 
		connection, Dude.

				DUDE
		Walter, face it, there isn't any 
		connection.  It's your roll.

				WALTER
		Have it your way.  The point is--

				DUDE
		It's your roll--

				WALTER
		The fucking point is--

				DUDE
		It's your roll.

				VOICE
		Are you ready to be fucked, man?

They both look up.

Quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of 
the lanes.  Over his polyester all-in-one he now wears a 
windbreaker with a racing stripe and "Jesus" stitched on the 
breast.  He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball 
satchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein).  Behind him stands his 
partner, O'Brien, a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair.

				QUINTANA
		I see you rolled your way into the 
		semis.  Deos mio, man.  Seamus and 
		me, we're gonna fuck you up.

				DUDE
		Yeah well, that's just, ya know, 
		like, your opinion, man.

Quintana looks at Walter.

				QUINTANA
		Let me tell you something, bendeco.  
		You pull any your crazy shit with 
		us, you flash a piece out on the 
		lanes, I'll take it away from you 
		and stick it up your ass and pull 
		the fucking trigger til it goes 
		"click".

				DUDE
		Jesus.

				QUINTANA
		You said it, man.  Nobody fucks with 
		the Jesus.

Jesus walks away.  Walter nods sadly.

				WALTER
		Eight-year-olds, Dude.

DUDE'S BUNGALOW

We are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug.  
His eyes are closed.  He wears a Walkman headset.  Leaking 
tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an 
intermittent clatter.

In his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled VENICE 
BEACH LEAGUE PLAYOFFS 1987.

The Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall 
rumbling down the lane.  On its impact with the pins, the 
Dude opens his eyes.

He screams.

A blonde woman looms over him.  Next to  her a  young man  
in paint-spattered denims stoops and swings something towards 
the carrier.

The sap catches the Dude on the chin and sends  his head 
thunking back onto the rug.

A million stars explode against a field of black.  We hear 
the "La-la-la-la" of The Man in Me.

The black field  dissolves into  the pattern  of the  rug.   
The rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of  the city  of 
Los  Angeles at twilight, moving below us at great speed.

The Dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in 
front of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his 
bowling shirt. He looks up.

Ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the 
Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet.  She is outpacing 
us, growing smaller.

The Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices 
that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand.  
His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic 
implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its 
weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. He 
is falling. From a high angle we see the Dude hurtling down 
toward the city, dragged by the ball.

A  reverse  looking  up shows  the Dude  hurtling toward  us 
out  of the inky  sky,  his eyes  wide with  horror.  Led by  
the bowling  ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in 
black.

We hear a distant rumble, like thunder.  Dull reflections 
materialize in the darkness.  They are glints off the shiny 
surface of an oncoming bowling ball.

We pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of 
a ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being 
regurgitated up at us, overtaking us.

The Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass 
rolling a huge shadow across his face.

The gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward 
us --finger holes.

The largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us, engulfing 
us once again in black..

The black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a 
bowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in 
the thumbhole of the rolling ball.

We see the receding bowler spinning away.  It is the blonde 
woman, performing her follow-through.

Floor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and 
away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor; 
ceiling; approaching pins; again and again.

We hit the pins and clatter into blackness.  We hear pins 
spin, hit each other and drop.

We hear an irritating, insistent beeping.

FADE IN

We are close on the Dude, upside down.  As the picture fades 
in the bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint.  
They come from the Dude's Walkman, the headset of which is 
now askew, with one arm off his ear.

As the Dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put 
him right side around.  His head is now resting against 
hardwood floor, not rug.

				DUDE
		Oh man.

He  raises  himself  onto  his  elbows  and  massages  the  
red   lump  on his  jaw.  The  beeper  on his  belt is  
blinking red  in sync  with the continuing irritating beeps.

WIDE ON THE ROOM

An  end  table  is  upset,  but  otherwise the  furniture is  
in place. The rug is gone.

The  Dude  looks  around.    The  bowling sounds  continue.   
The beeps continue.

The phone starts to jangle.

TRACK

We  push  Brandt  down  the  familiar  marble  hallway.   
Again  there is a  distant  aria.    Brandt  throws  out a  
wrist to  look at  his watch.

				BRANDT
		They called about eighty minutes 
		ago.  They want you to take the money 
		and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll 
		call you on the portable phone with 
		instructions in about forty minutes.  
		One person only or I'd go with you.  
		They were very clear on that: one 
		person only.  What happened to your 
		jaw?

				DUDE
		Oh, nothin', you know.

They have reached the little desk outside of the big 
Lebowski's office; Brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key 
and takes out an attache case.  He hands this to the Dude 
along with a cellular phone in a battery-pack carrying case.

				BRANDT
		Here's the money, and the phone.  
		Please, Dude, follow whatever 
		instructions they give.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				BRANDT
		Her life is in your hands.

				DUDE
		Oh, man, don't say that..

				BRANDT
		Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that:  
		Her life is in your hands.

				DUDE
		Shit.

				BRANDT
		Her life is in your hands, Dude.  
		And report back to us as soon as 
		it's done.

DUDE'S CAR

We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through 
the front windshield.  The headlights play over Walter 
standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK 
SECURITY.  Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the 
fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look 
oddly like a commuter.  He also holds an irregular shape 
bundled in brown wrapping paper.

The car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude's door 
and hands in the briefcase.

				WALTER
		Take the ringer.  I'll drive.

The Dude takes the briefcase and slides over.

				DUDE
		The what?

				WALTER
		The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have 
		they called yet?

The Dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through it 
as the car starts rolling.

				DUDE
		What the hell is this?

				WALTER
		My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude.  
		The whites.

				DUDE
		Agh--

He closes the briefcase.

				DUDE
		Walter, I'm sure there's a reason 
		you brought your dirty undies--

				WALTER
		Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight.  
		The ringer can't look empty.

				DUDE
		Walter--what the fuck are you 
		thinking?

				WALTER
		Well you're right, Dude, I got to 
		thinking.  I got to thinking why 
		should we settle for a measly fucking 
		twenty grand--

				DUDE
		We?  What the fuck we?  You said you 
		just wanted to come along--

				WALTER
		My point, Dude, is why should we 
		settle for twenty grand when we can 
		keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?

				DUDE
		Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a 
		fucking game, Walter--

				WALTER
		It is a fucking game.  You said so 
		yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--

				DUDE '
		Yeah, but--

The phone chirps.  Dude grabs it.

				DUDE
		Dude here.

				VOICE
			(German accent)
		Who is this?

				DUDE
		Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want 
		us to go?

				VOICE
		...Us?
		DUDE

Shit. . . Uh, yeah, you know, me and the driver.  I'm not 
handling the money and driving the car and talking on the 
phone all by my fucking--

				VOICE
		Shut the fuck up.
			(Beat)
		Hello?

				DUDE
		Yeah?

				VOICE
		Okay, listen--

Walter looks over at the Dude and bellows:

				WALTER
		Dude, are you fucking this up?

				VOICE
		Who is that?

				DUDE
		The driver man, I told you--

Click.  Dial tone.

				DUDE
		Oh shit.  Walter.

				WALTER
		What the fuck is going on there?

				DUDE
		They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it 
		up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was 
		in our hands!

				WALTER
		Easy, Dude.

				DUDE
		We're screwed now!  We don't get 
		shit and they're gonna kill her!  
		We're fucked, Walter!

				WALTER
		Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on.  
		You're being very unDude.  They'll 
		call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--

The phone chirps.

				WALTER
		Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, 
		Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These  
		guys are fucking amateurs--

				DUDE
		Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say 
		peep when I'm doing business here.

				WALTER
			(patronizing)
		Okay Dude.  Have it your way.

The Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack.

				WALTER
		But they're amateurs.

The Dude glares at Walter.  Into the phone:

				DUDE
		Dude here.

				VOICE
		Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there 
		is no funny stuff.

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				VOICE
		So no funny stuff.  Okay?

				DUDE
		Hey, just tell me where the fuck you 
		want us to go.

A HIGHWAY SIGN:  SIMI VALLEY ROAD

It flashes by in the headlights of the roaring car.

				DUDE
		That was the sign.

Walter wrestles the car onto the two-lane road.

				WALTER
		Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, 
		nobody's in a position to complain.  
		And we keep the baksheesh.

				DUDE
		Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't 
		told me how we get her back.  Where 
		is she?

				WALTER
		That's the simple part, Dude.  When  
		we make the handoff, I grab the guy 
		and beat  it out of him.

He looks at the Dude.

				WALTER
		...Huh?

				DUDE
		Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter.  
		That's fucking ingenious, if I 
		understand it correctly.  That's a 
		Swiss fucking watch.

				WALTER
		Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of 
		this is its simplicity. If the plan 
		gets too complex something always 
		goes wrong.  If there's one thing I 
		learned in Nam--

The phone chirps.

				DUDE
		Dude.

				VOICE
		You are approaching a vooden britch.  
		When you cross it you srow ze bag 
		from ze left vindow of ze moving 
		kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch 
		you.

Click.  Dial tone.

				DUDE
		FUCK.

				WALTER
		What'd he say?  Where's the hand-
		off?

				DUDE
		There is no fucking hand-off, Walter!   
		At a wooden bridge we throw the money 
		out  of the car!

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		We throw the money out of the moving 
		car!

Walter stares dumbly for a beat.

				WALTER
		We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks 
		up our plan.

				DUDE
		Well call them up and explain it to 
		'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking 
		simple, I'm sure they'd fucking 
		understand it!  That's the beauty of 
		it Walter!

				WALTER
		Wooden bridge, huh?

				DUDE
		I'm throwing the money, Walter!  
		We're not fucking around!

				WALTER
		The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the 
		ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!

				DUDE
		Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but 
		sooner or later you're gonna have to 
		face the fact that you're a goddamn 
		moron.

				WALTER
		Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's 
		the bridge--

There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge.  
The Dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from 
the back seat.  Walter reaches one arm across Dude's body to 
grab the laundry.

And there goes the ringer.

He flings it out the window.

				DUDE
		Walter!

				WALTER
		Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!

				DUDE
		What the fuck?

				WALTER
		Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch 
		I roll out!  I double back, grab one 
		of 'em and beat it out of him!  The 
		uzi!

				DUDE
		Uzi?

Walter points across the seat at the paper-wrapped bundle.

				WALTER
		You didn't think I was rolling out 
		of here naked!

				DUDE
		Walter, please--

Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out 
over the road.

				WALTER
		Fifteen!  This is it, Dude!  Let's 
		take that hill!

Walter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he 
hits the pavement.  The car swerves and lurches and the Dude, 
cursing, takes the wheel.

OUTSIDE

Walter tumbles onto the shoulder and--RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!--muzzle 
flashes tear open the wrapping paper.

INSIDE THE CAR

The car rocks and the Dude wrestles with the wheel.

OUTSIDE

The car clunks and screams around in a skid.

INSIDE

The Dude is thrown forward as the car hits something.

OUTSIDE

As the Dude struggles out holding the satchel of money. The 
front of his car is crumpled into a tree.  The car body saps 
back to the left, where the rear wheel has been shot out.

WALTER  is  just  rising  from  the  ground  massaging an  
injured knee.

The  Dude  runs  up  the  road  toward  the bridge,  
frantically waving the satchel in the air.

				DUDE
		WE HAVE IT!  WE HAVE IT!!

There is a distant engine roar.  A motorcycle bumps up onto 
the road from the ravine under the bridge and, tires 
squealing, skids around to speed away in the opposite 
direction.  It is closely followed by two more roaring 
motorcycles.

				DUDE
		WE HAVE IT!!. . . We have it!

The Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road, watching 
the three red tail lights fishtail away.

AFTER A LONG STARING SILENCE:

				WALTER
		Ahh fuck it, let's go bowling.

BOWLING LANE

A ball rumbles in to scatter ten pins.

WALTER.

He turns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the nook of 
molded plastic chairs.  The Dude listlessly holds the portable 
phone in his lap.  It is ringing.

				WALTER
		Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used 
		to say.

				DUDE
		What the fuck is that supposed to 
		mean?  What the fuck're we gonna 
		tell Lebowski?

				WALTER
		Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't 
		see, um-- what exactly is the problem?

The portable phone stops ringing.

				DUDE
		Huh?  The problem is--what do you 
		mean what's the--there's no--we didn't--
		they're gonna kill that poor woman--

				WALTER
		What the fuck're you talking about?  
		That poor woman--that poor slut--
		kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said 
		so yourself--

				DUDE
		No, Walter!  I said I thought she 
		kidnapped herself!  You're the one 
		who's so fucking certain--

				WALTER
		That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--

Donny is trotting excitedly up.

				DONNY
		They posted the next round of the 
		tournament--

				WALTER
		Donny, shut the f--when do we play?

				DONNY
		This Saturday.  Quintana and--

				WALTER
		Saturday!  Well they'll have to 
		reschedule.

				DUDE
		Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?

				WALTER
		I told that fuck down at the league 
		office-- who's in charge of 
		scheduling?

				DUDE
		Walter--

				DONNY
		Burkhalter.

				WALTER
		I told that kraut a fucking thousand 
		times I don't roll on shabbas.

				DONNY
		It's already posted.

				WALTER
		WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!

				DUDE
		Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about 
		that poor woman?  What do we tell--

				WALTER
		C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get 
		sick of her little game and, you 
		know, wander back--

				DONNY
		How come you don't roll on Saturday, 
		Walter?

				WALTER
		I'm shomer shabbas.

				DONNY
		What's that, Walter?

				DUDE
		Yeah, and in the meantime what do I 
		tell Lebowski?

				WALTER
		Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of 
		rest.  Means I don't work, I don't 
		drive a car, I don't fucking ride in 
		a car, I don't handle money, I don't 
		turn on the oven, and I sure as shit 
		don't fucking roll!

				DONNY
		Sheesh.

				DUDE
		Walter, how--

				WALTER
		Shomer shabbas.

The Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone.

				DUDE
		That's it.  I'm out of here.

				WALTER
		For Christ's sake, Dude.

Walter and Donny join the Dude as he walks out of the bowling 
alley.

Hell, you just tell him--well, you tell him, uh, we made the 
hand-off, everything went, uh, you know--

				DONNY
		Oh yeah, how'd it go?

				WALTER
		Went alright.  Dude's car got a little 
		dinged up--

				DUDE
		But Walter, we didn't make the fucking 
		hand- off!  They didn't get, the 
		fucking money and they're gonna--
		they're gonna--

				WALTER
		Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."

He waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra.

				WALTER
		Kill that poor woman.

				DONNY
		Walter, if you can't ride in a car, 
		how d'you get around on Shammas--

				WALTER
		Really, Dude, you surprise me.  
		They're not gonna kill shit.  They're 
		not gonna do shit.  What can they 
		do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, 
		look at the bottom line.  Who's 
		sitting on a million fucking dollars?  
		Am I wrong?

				DUDE
		Walter--

				WALTER
		Who's got a fucking million fucking 
		dollars parked in the trunk of our 
		car out here?

				DUDE
		"Our" car, Walter?

				WALTER
		And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty 
		undies.  My fucking whites--Say, 
		where is  the car?

The three bowlers, stopped at the edge of the lot, stare out 
at an empty parking space.

				DONNY
		Who has your undies, Walter?

				WALTER
		Where's your car, Dude?

				DUDE
		You don't know, Walter?  You seem to 
		know the answer to everything else!

				WALTER
		Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped 
		spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.

				DUDE
		It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking 
		know it's been stolen!

				WALTER
		Well, certainly that's a possibility, 
		Dude--

				DUDE
		Aw, fuck it.

The Dude walks away across the lot.  The portable phone starts 
ringing again.

				DONNY
		Where you going, Dude?

				DUDE
		I'm going home, Donny.

				DONNY
		Your phone's ringing, Dude.

				DUDE
		Thank you, Donny.

DUDE'S LIVING ROOM

The Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair, 
fingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses.  Facing him 
on the couch are two uniformed policeman, one middle-aged, 
the other a fresh-faced rookie.

At the cut the portable phone, in the Dude's lap, is chirping.  
The Dude waits for the rings to end.  When they do:

				DUDE
		1972 Pontiac LeBaron.

				YOUNGER COP
		Color?

				DUDE
		Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, 
		coloration.

				YOUNGER COP
		And was there anything of value in  
		the car?

DULLY:

				DUDE
		Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple 
		of Creedence tapes.  And there was 
		a, uh. . . my briefcase.

				YOUNGER COP
		In the briefcase?

				DUDE
		Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my 
		papers.  Business papers.

				YOUNGER COP
		And what do you do, sir?

				DUDE
		I'm unemployed.

				OLDER COP
		...Most people, we're working nights, 
		they offer us coffee.

There is silence.  Dude continues to stare at a spot on the 
floor.  The older cop stares at him.

				DUDE
		...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But 
		it's nice when they offer.

AT LENGTH:

				DUDE
		...Also, my rug was stolen.

				YOUNGER COP
		Your rug was in the car.

The Dude taps the floor with his foot.

				DUDE
		No.  Here.

				YOUNGER COP
		Separate incidents?

The Dude stares at the floor.

Silence.

				OLDER COP
		Snap out of it, son.

The home phone starts ringing--a ring distinct  from the  
chirp of the portable.  The Dude makes no move to answer  
it.   Finally the rings stop as an answering machine kicks 
on.

				DUDE
		You find them much?  Stolen cars?

Dude's Voice on Machine The Dude's not in.  Leave a message 
after the beep.  It takes a minute.

				YOUNGER COP
		Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much 
		hope for the tape deck though.  Or 
		the Creedence tapes.

				DUDE
		And the, uh, the briefcase?

Beep.

				FEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE
		Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you.  
		Call when you get home and I'll send 
		a car for you.  My name is Maude 
		Lebowski.  I'm the woman who took 
		the rug.

Beep.  Dial tone.

				OLDER COP
		Well, I guess we can close the file 
		on that one.

TRACKING FORWARD

We are moving through the open living area of a large downtown 
L.A. loft.  A huge unfinished canvas,  lit by  standing 
industrial lights, dominates one wall.  The furnishings  are 
spare  given the space.  On the floor is the Dude's brilliant 
rug.

We hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball.  The Dude, 
standing in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky 
depths of the cavernous space.

Something huge and white hurtles towards the Dude's head.  
As it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass.

We see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended 
from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the 
floor.  She is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush 
in the other, with which she flicks paint down at the canvas.

The Dude turns again as he hears running footsteps.  Two 
young men in paint-spattered shorts, T-shirts and sneakers 
reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track 
and haul it back for another push.

				VOICE
		I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. 
		Lebowski.

She rumbles by in another pass.

All right, we'll do the blue tomorrow.  Elfranco.  Pedro.  
Help me down.

The  two  men  help Maude  out of  her sling.   She  is naked  
except for leather  harness  straps  which  ring  her  breasts  
and wrap  her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix 
look.

Does the female form make you uncomfor- table, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Is that what that's a picture of?

				MAUDE
		In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. 
		My art has been commended as being 
		strongly vaginal.  Which bothers 
		some men.  The word itself makes 
		some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.

				DUDE
		Oh yeah?

				MAUDE
		Yes, they don't like hearing it and 
		find it difficult to say.  Whereas 
		without batting an eye a man will 
		refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or 
		his "Johnson".

				DUDE
		"Johnson"?

				MAUDE
		Thank you.

This to Elfranco, who has handed her a robe.

All right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get down to cases.  My father 
told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a 
gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give.  
Now.  As for this. . . "kidnapping"--

				DUDE
		Huh?

				MAUDE
		Yes, I know about it.  And I know 
		that you acted as courier.  And let 
		me tell you something:  the whole 
		thing stinks to high heaven.

				DUDE
		Right, but let me explain something 
		about that rug--

				MAUDE
		Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Excuse me?

				MAUDE
		Sex.  The physical act of love.  
		Coitus.  Do you like it?

				DUDE
		I was talking about my rug.

				MAUDE
		You're not interested in sex?

				DUDE
		You mean coitus?

				MAUDE
		I like it too.  It's a male myth 
		about feminists that we hate sex.  
		It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. 
		But unfortunately there are some 
		people--it is called satyriasis in 
		men, nymphomania in women--who engage 
		in it compulsively and without joy.

				DUDE
		Oh, no.

				MAUDE
		Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate 
		souls cannot love in the true sense 
		of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance 
		Bunny is one of these.

				DUDE
		Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your 
		stepmother is a nympho, but I don't 
		see what it has to do with--do you 
		have any kalhua?

				MAUDE
		Take a look at this, sir.

She is aiming a remote at a projection TV.  The screen 
flickers to life.  A title card:

JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS

SECOND CARD:

KARL HUNGUS

AND

BUNNY LAJOYA

IN

A THIRD CARD:

LOGJAMMIN'

The Dude is at the bar, a bottle of kalhua frozen halfway  
to his glass.

From the television set we hear a doorbell ring, and then  a 
door opening.

On the TV screen the door opens to reveal a sallow-faced  
man in blue coyer-alls.  It is Dieter, the floater in  
Lebowski's pool.

				DIETER
		Hello.  Nein dizbatcher says zere 
		iss problem mit deine kable.

				DUDE
		Shit, I know that guy.  He's a 
		nihilist.

				MAUDE
		And you recognize her, of course.

The girl answering the door is Bunny Lebowski.

Bunny The TV is in here.

				DIETER
		Za, okay, I bring mein toolz.

Bunny This is my friend Shari.  She just came over to use 
the shower.

				MAUDE
			(grimly)
		The story is ludicrous.

				DIETER
		Mein nommen iss Karl.  Is hard to 
		verk in zese clozes--

Maude switches off the set.

				MAUDE
		Lord.  You can imagine where it goes 
		from here.

				DUDE
		He fixes the cable?

				MAUDE
		Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little 
		matter to me that this woman chose 
		to pursue a career

in pornography, nor that she has been "banging" Jackie 
Treehorn, to use the parlance of our times.  However.  I am 
one of two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation, the other 
being my father.  The Foundation takes youngsters from Watts 
and--

				DUDE
		Shit yeah, the achievers.

				MAUDE
		Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, 
		yes, and proud we are of all of them.  
		I asked my father about his withdrawal 
		of a million dollars from the 
		Foundation account and he told me 
		about this "abduction", but I tell 
		you it is preposterous.  This 
		compulsive

fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride.

				DUDE
		Yeah, but my-

				MAUDE
		I'm getting to your rug. My  father 
		and I don't get along; he doesn't 
		approve of my lifestyle and, needless 
		to say, I don't approve of his.  
		Still, I hardly wish to make my 
		father's embezzlement a police matter, 
		so I'm proposing that you try to 
		recover the money from the people 
		you delivered it to.

				DUDE
		Well--sure, I could do that--

				MAUDE
		If you successfully do so, I will 
		compensate you to the tune of 1% of 
		the recovered sum.

				DUDE
		A hundred.

				MAUDE
		Thousand, yes, bones or clams or 
		whatever you call them.

				DUDE
		Yeah, but what about--

				MAUDE
		--your rug, yes, well with that money 
		you can buy any number of rugs that 
		don't have sentimental value for me.  
		And I am sorry about that crack on 
		the jaw.

The Dude fingers his jaw, where the lump from the sap has 
all but disappeared.

				DUDE
		Oh that's okay, I hardly even--

				MAUDE
		Here's the name and number of a doctor 
		who will look at it for you.  You 
		will receive no bill.  He's a good 
		man, and thorough.

				DUDE
		That's really thoughtful but I--

				MAUDE
		Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a 
		good man, and thorough.

LIMO

The Dude sits in back holding a White Russian,  listening to 
the chauffeur, a man of about the same age from whose livery 
cap a ponytail emerges.

				DRIVER
		--So he says, "My son can't hold a 
		job, my daughter's married to a 
		fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on 
		my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown.  
		But you know me.  I can't complain."

THROUGH RASPING LAUGHTER:

				DUDE
		Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash.			 
		Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya 
		Tony.

He takes a sip of a freshly-mixed White Russian, which leaves 
milk on his mustache.

I was feeling really shitty earlier in the day, I'd lost  a 
little  money, I  was down in the dumps.

				TONY
		Aw, forget about it.

				DUDE
		Yeah, man!  Fuck it!  I can't be 
		worrying about that shit.  Life goes 
		on!

The limo has rolled to a stop.  The Dude gets out, still 
holding his drink.

				TONY
		Home sweet home, Mr. L.  Who's your 
		friend in the Volkswagon?

				DUDE
		Huh?

His eyes on the rearview mirror, Tony jerks a thumb over his 
shoulder.

He followed us here.

The Dude turns to look.

HIS POV

Halfway up the block a Volkswagon bug has pulled over to the 
curb.  In the driver's seat we see a fat man's shape.

THE DUDE

He scowls.

				DUDE
		When did he-

The Dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half-
nelson by another uniformed chauffeur.

				SECOND CHAUFFEUR
		Into the limo, you sonofabitch.  No 
		arguments.

As he is frog-marched towards another limo the Dude holds 
his drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath it.

				DUDE
		Fuck, man!  There's a beverage here!

The waiting limo's back door is flung open.

INSIDE

The Dude is shoved in and awkwardly takes a seat facing the 
rear. The door is slammed behind him.

				LEBOWSKI
		Start talking and talk fast you lousy 
		bum!

				BRANDT
		We've been frantically trying to 
		reach you, Dude.

Brandt sits catty-corner from the Dude; directly across from 
the Dude is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees.

				LEBOWSKI
		Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!

				DUDE
		Well we--I don't--

				LEBOWSKI
		They did not receive the money, you 
		nitwit!  They  did not receive the 
		goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR 
		HANDS!

				BRANDT
		This is our concern, Dude.

				DUDE
		No, man, nothing is fucked here--

				LEBOWSKI
		NOTHING IS FUCKED! THE GODDAMN PLANE 
		HAS CRASHED INTO THE MOUNTAIN!

The Dude takes a hurried sip from his drink.

				DUDE
		C'mon man, who're you gonna believe?  
		Those guys are--we dropped off the 
		damn money--

				LEBOWSKI
		WHAT?!

				DUDE
		I--the royal we, you know, the 
		editorial--I dropped off the money, 
		exactly as per--Look, I've got certain 
		information, certain things have 
		come to light, and uh, has it ever 
		occurred to you, man, that given the 
		nature of all this new shit, that, 
		uh, instead of running around blaming 
		me, that this whole thing might just 
		be, not, you know, not just such a 
		simple, but uh--you know?

				LEBOWSKI
		What in God's holy name are you 
		blathering about?

				DUDE
		I'll tell you what I'm blathering 
		about!  I got information--new shit 
		has come to light and--shit, man!  
		She kidnapped herself!

Lebowski stares at him, dumbstruck.  The Dude is encouraged.

				DUDE
		Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy 
		wife, I mean, in the parlance of our 
		times, owes money all over town, 
		including to known pornographers--
		and that's cool, that's cool-- but 
		I'm saying, she needs money, and of 
		course they're gonna say they didn't 
		get it 'cause she wants more, man, 
		she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean--
		hasn't that ever occurred to you...?  
		Sir?

				LEBOWSKI
			(quietly)
		No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not 
		occurred to me.

				BRANDT
		That had not occurred to us, Dude.

				DUDE
		Well, okay, you're not privy to all 
		the new shit, so uh, you know, but 
		that's what you pay me for.  Speaking 
		of which, would it be possible for 
		me to get my twenty grand in cash?  
		I gotta check this with my accountant 
		of course, but my concern is that, 
		you know, it could bump me into a 
		higher tax--

				LEBOWSKI
		Brandt, give him the envelope.

				DUDE
		Well, okay, if you've already made 
		out the check.  Brandt is handing 
		him a letter-sized envelope which is 
		distended by something inside.

				BRANDT
		We received it this morning.

The Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton 
wadding and unrolls it.

				LEBOWSKI
		Since you have failed to achieve, 
		even in the modest task that was 
		your charge, since you have stolen 
		my money, and since you have 
		unrepentantly betrayed my trust.

The wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up 
inside.  The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and 
starts to unroll the inner package.

				LEBOWSKI
		I have no choice but to tell these 
		bums that they should do whatever is 
		necessary to recover their money 
		from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And 
		with Brandt as my witness, tell you 
		this:  Any further harm visited upon 
		Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon 
		your head.

Between thumb and forefinger the Dude holds up the contents 
of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish.

				LEBOWSKI
		...By God sir.  I will not abide 
		another toe.

COFFEE SHOP

The Dude and Walter sit at the counter, both staring off 
into space, both absently stirring their coffee with little 
clinking noises.

AFTER A LONG BEAT:

				WALTER
		That wasn't her toe.

				DUDE
		Whose toe was it, Walter?

				WALTER
		How the fuck should I know?  I do 
		know that nothing about it indicates--

				DUDE
		The nail polish, Walter.

				WALTER
		Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible 
		to get some nail polish, apply it to 
		someone else's toe--

				DUDE
		Someone else's--where the fuck are 
		they gonna--

				WALTER
		You want a toe?  I can get you a 
		toe, believe me.  There are ways, 
		Dude.  You don't wanna know about 
		it, believe me.

				DUDE
		But Walter--

				WALTER
		I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this 
		afternoon--with nail  polish. These  
		fucking amateurs.   They send us a  
		toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- 
		selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My  
		point is--

				DUDE
		They're gonna kill her, Walter, and 
		then they're gonna kill me--

				WALTER
		Well that's just, that's the stress 
		talking, Dude.  So far we have what 
		looks to me like a series of 
		victimless crimes--

				DUDE
		What about the toe?

				WALTER
		FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!

A waitress enters.

				WAITRESS
		Could you please keep your voices 
		down--this is a family restaurant.

				WALTER
		Oh, please dear!  I've got news for 
		you: the Supreme Court has roundly 
		rejected prior restraint!

				DUDE
		Walter, this isn't a First Amendment 
		thing.

				WAITRESS
		Sir, if you don't calm down I'm going 
		to have to ask you to leave.

				WALTER
		Lady, I got buddies who died face-
		down in the muck so you and I could 
		enjoy this family restaurant!

THE DUDE GETS UP:

				DUDE
		All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry 
		ma'am.

				WALTER
		Don't run away from this, Dude!  
		Goddamnit, this affects all of us!

The Dude has left frame; Walter calls after him:

				WALTER
		Our basic freedoms!

He looks defiantly around.

				WALTER
		I'm staying.  Finishing my coffee.

He stirs the coffee, bopping his head in time to the Muzak, 
affecting nonchalance.

				WALTER
		Finishing my coffee.

DUDE'S BATHROOM

A dripping noise.

The Dude sits in the bathtub, staring stuporously, a joint 
pinched in one hand, a washcloth draped over his head.

We hear the phone ringing in the other roam.

The Dude is staring at his toes, which protrude from the 
soapy water, splayed against the far side of the tub.

After the Dude's outgoing message we hear:

				VOICE THROUGH MACHINE
		Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty Officer 
		Rolvaag of the L.A.P.D.

The Dude looks stuporously up, his head swaying.

				VOICE THROUGH MACHINE
		We've recovered your vehicle.  It 
		can be claimed at the North Hollywood 
		Auto Circus there on Victory.

				DUDE
		Far out.  Far fuckin' out.

				MESSAGE
		You'll just need to present a--

The message is interrupted by loud smashing sounds, as of 
someone applying a baseball bat to the answering machine.

				DUDE
		Hunh?

He looks blearily at the open doorway.

A tall man dressed in black leather with a cricket paddle is 
striding across the living room towards the bathroom.

				DUDE
		Hey!  This is a private residence, 
		man!

The man has entered the bathroom and, in stride, swings the 
cricket paddle up to smash the overhead light.  Two other 
men are entering behind him.

The room is dark now except for spill from the living room; 
the men are backlit shapes.

One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small 
animal skitters excitedly about the floor.

The Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal.

				DUDE
		Nice marmot.

The man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it, 
screaming, into the bathtub.

The Dude screams.

The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a 
frenzy of fearful aggression.

				FIRST MAN
		Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.

The Dude, screaming, grabs the lip of the tub and starts to 
hoist himself up but the first man lays a palm on top of his 
head and squishes him back into the water.

				SECOND MAN
		You think veer kidding und making 
		mit de funny stuff?

				THIRD MAN
		Vee could do things you only dreamed 
		of, Lebowski.

				SECOND MAN
		Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski.  
		Vee belief in nossing.

He scoops the marmot out of the water.  It shakes itself 
off, spraying the Dude.

				DUDE
		Jesus!

				DIETER
		Vee belief in nossing, Lebowski!  
		NOSSING!!

The marmot, back on the floor, is skittering around, shaking 
itself and convulsing in little sneezes.

				DUDE
		Jesus Christ!

				FIRST MAN
		Tomorrow vee come back und cut off 
		your chonson.

				DUDE
		Excuse me?

				FIRST MAN
		I SAY VEE CUT OFF YOUR CHONSON!

The three men turn to leave.  Over their retreating backs:

				SECOND MAN
		Just sink about zat, Lebowski.

				FIRST MAN
		Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski.

				SECOND MAN
		Ja, und maybe vee stamp on it und 
		skvush it, Lebowski!

NORTH HOLLYWOOD AUTO CIRCUS

A policeman with a clipboard is leading the Dude through a 
large parking lot.

				POLICEMAN
		You're lucky she wasn't chopped, Mr.  
		Lebowski. Must've been a joyride 
		situation; they abandoned the car 
		once they hit the retaining wall.

They have reached the Dude's car.  The  driver's side  
exterior has been scraped raw.  The policeman hands the Dude  
a door  handle and an exterior rear-view mirror.

				POLICEMAN
		These were on the road next to the 
		car.  You'll have to get in on the 
		other side.

The Dude climbs in the passenger side.

				DUDE
		My fucking briefcase!  It's not here!

				POLICEMAN
		Yeah, sorry, I saw that on the report.  
		You're lucky they left the tape deck 
		though.

				DUDE
		My fucking briefcase!  Jesus--what's 
		that smell?

				POLICEMAN
		Uh, yeah.  Probably a vagrant, slept 
		in the car.  Or perhaps just used it 
		as a toilet, and moved on.

The Dude tries to roll down the driver's window but it will 
not go; he bellows through the glass:

				DUDE
		When will you find these guys?  I 
		mean, do you have any promising leads?

The policeman laughs, agreeing broadly.

				POLICEMAN
		Leads, yeah.  I'll just check with 
		the boys down at the Crime Lab.  
		They've assigned four more detectives 
		to the case, got us working in shifts.

The Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman 
rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by 
the glass.

BOWLING ALLEY BAR

The Dude, Walter and Donny sit at the bar, the Dude with a 
White Russian, Walter with a beer, and Donny eating beer 
nuts.

				DONNY
		And then they're gonna stamp on it?!

				WALTER
		Oh for Christ--will you shut the 
		fuck up, Donny.

				DUDE
		I figure my only hope is that the 
		big Lebowski kills me before the 
		Germans can cut my dick off.

				WALTER
		Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No 
		one is going to cut your dick off.

				DUDE
		Thanks Walter.

				WALTER
		Not if I have anything to say about 
		it.

				DUDE
			(bitterly)
		Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me 
		a very secure feeling.

				WALTER
		Dude--

				DUDE
		That makes me feel all warm inside.

				WALTER
		Now Dude--

				DUDE
		This whole fucking thing--I  could 
		be sitting here with just pee-stains 
		on my rug.

Walter sadly shakes his head.

				WALTER
		Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes.  
		Fucking Nazis.

				DONNY
		They were Nazis, Dude?

				WALTER
		Come on, Donny, they were threatening 
		castration!

				DONNY
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		Are you gonna split hairs?

				DONNY
		No--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong?

				DONNY
		Well--

				DUDE
		They're nihilists.

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		They kept saying they believe in 
		nothing.

				WALTER
		Nihilists!  Jesus.

Walter looks haunted.

Say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, 
Dude, at least it's an ethos.

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				WALTER
		And let's also not forget--let's not 
		forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, 
		an amphibious rodent, for uh, 
		domestic, you know, within the city--
		that isn't legal either.

				DUDE
		What're you, a fucking park ranger 
		now?

				WALTER
		No, I'm--

				DUDE
		Who gives a shit about the fucking 
		marmot!

				WALTER
		--We're sympathizing here, Dude--

				DUDE
		Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need 
		your sympathy, man, I need my fucking 
		Johnson!

				DONNY
		What do you need that for, Dude?

				WALTER
		You gotta buck up, man, you can't go 
		into the tournament with this negative 
		attitude--

				DUDE
		Fuck the tournament!  Fuck you, 
		Walter!

There is a moment of stunned silence.

				WALTER
		Fuck the tournament?!

SAD; QUIET:

				WALTER
		Okay Dude.  I can see you don't want 
		to be cheered up.  C'mon Donny, let's 
		go get a lane.

They leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar.  As he stares

DOWN INTO HIS EMPTY GLASS:

				DUDE
		Another Caucasian, Gary.

				VOICE
		Right, Dude.

STILL STARING DOWN AT THE BAR:

				DUDE
		Friends like these, huh Gary.

				GARY
		That's right, Dude.

The pop song on the jukebox has ended; someone puts on 
"Tumbling Tumbleweeds."

A man saunters up to the bar to take the stool that Walter 
vacated.  He is middle-aged, amiable, craggily handsome--Sam 
Elliot, perhaps.  He has a large Western-style mustache and 
wears denims, a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat.

TO THE BARTENDER:

				MAN
		D'ya have a good sarsaparilla?

We recognize the voice of The Stranger whose narration opened 
the movie.

				BARTENDER
		Sioux City Sarsaparilla.

The Stranger nods.

				THE STRANGER
		That's a good one.

Waiting for his drink, he looks amiably around the bar.  His 
crinkled eyes settle on the Dude.

				THE STRANGER
		How ya doin' there, Dude?

The Dude, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head.

				DUDE
		Ahh, not so good, man.

				THE STRANGER
		One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser 
		fella than m'self once said, sometimes 
		you eat the bar and sometimes the 
		bar, wal, he eats you.

				DUDE
			(absently)
		Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern 
		thing?

				THE STRANGER
		Far from it.

				DUDE
		Mm.

The bartender puts a brown bottle and a frosted glass on the 
bar in front of The Stranger, who touches his hat brim.

				THE STRANGER
		Much obliged.

He looks back at the Dude.

				THE STRANGER
		I like your style, Dude.

THE DUDE LOOKS UP, ABSENTLY:

				DUDE
		Well I like your style too, man.  
		Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.

				THE STRANGER
		Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude.  
		D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?

The Dude looks at The Stranger as if just now noticing how 
out of place the cowpoke is.

				DUDE
		The fuck are you talking about?

The Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the 
bar.

				THE STRANGER
		Okay, have it your way.

He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip.

				THE STRANGER
		Take it easy, Dude.

				DUDE
		Yeah.  Thanks man.

He is gone.  "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" is ending as we hear an 
offscreen voice, breaking the spell:

				VOICE
		Dude!  Dude!

THE DUDE LOOKS:

Tony, the unformed limo driver, is at the door of the bar, 
beckoning.

MAUDE'S LOFT

She strides toward us, naked under a robe which she is just 
cinching shut.  Paint flecks her skin.

				MAUDE
		Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the 
		doctor.

				DUDE
		No it's fine, really, uh--

				MAUDE
		Do you have any news regarding my 
		father's money?

				DUDE
		I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta 
		respecfully, 69 you know, tender my 
		resignation on that matter, 'cause 
		it looks like your mother really was 
		kidnapped after all.

				MAUDE
		She most certainly was not!

				DUDE
		Hey man, why don't you fucking listen 
		occasionally?  You might learn 
		something.  Now I got--

				MAUDE
		And please don't call her my mother.

				DUDE
		Now I got--

				MAUDE
		She is most definitely the perpetrator 
		and not the victim.

				DUDE
		I'm telling you, I got definitive 
		evidence--

				MAUDE
		From who?

				DUDE
		The main guy, Dieter--

				MAUDE
		Dieter Hauff?

				DUDE
		Well--yeah, I guess--

				MAUDE
		Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?

				DUDE
		Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, 
		you know him?

				MAUDE
		Dieter has been on the fringes of--
		well, of everything in L.A., for 
		about twenty years.  Look at my LP's.  
		Under 'Autobahn.'

The Dude fingers through the albums filling one bookshelf.

				MAUDE
		That was his group--they released 
		one album in the mid-seventies.

The Dude stops between two albums.

				DUDE
		Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.

				MAUDE
		Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their 
		music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.

The Dude pulls out an album with a worn sleeve.  On it is 
the group's name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, and a 
picture

OF THREE YOUNG GERMANS, THEIR FOREHEADS LOOMING BELOW 
SLICKED-

back hair, gazing upward in thin-lipped epiphany.  They are 
wearing severe but modishly retro suits.  Each has his name 
under his picture--Dieter, Kieffer; and Franz.  A bed of 
nails is the only set dressing on the cyc.

				DUDE
		Jeez.  I miss vinyl.

				MAUDE
		Is he pretending to be the abductor?

				DUDE
		Well...yeah--

				MAUDE
		Look, Jeffrey, you don't really  
		kidnap someone that you're acquainted 
		with.  You can't get away with it if 
		the hostage knows who you are.

				DUDE
		Well yeah...I know that.

				MAUDE
		So Dieter has the money?

				DUDE
		Well, no, not exactly.  It's a 
		complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins.  
		Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to 
		keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands 
		in old Duder's--

				MAUDE
		Do you still have that doctor's 
		number?

				DUDE
		Huh?  No, really, I don't even have 
		the bruise any more, I--

She is scribbling.

				MAUDE
		Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be 
		responsible for any delayed after-
		effects.

				DUDE
		Delayed after-eff--

				MAUDE
		I want you to see him immediately.

She is picking up a telephone.

				MAUDE
		I'll see if he's available.  He's a 
		good man, and thorough.

CLOSE SHOT   THE DUDE

His eyes are closed, a headset on, his shirt off.  Leaking 
tinnily through the headset we hear the opening bars of 
"Comin' Up Around the Bend."

Behind him, cropped so that we see only a little of his torso, 
a white-smocked figure taps at the Dude's back.  After a 
moment the figure circles to one side, out of frame.  His 
hand reaches in to pull one arm of the headset away from the 
Dude's ear, and as he does so the music issues more strongly.

				VOICE
		Could you slide your shorts down 
		please, Mr.  Lebowski?

The Dude's eyes open.

				DUDE
		Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.

				VOICE
		I understand sir.  Could you slide 
		your shorts down please?

DUDE'S CAR

The Dude is driving home.  A Creedence tape plays.  The Dude 
is sucking down a joint.  He glances at the rear-view mirror--
and, noticing something, looks again.

HIS POV

A Volkswagon bug is following, a lone fat man driving.

THE DUDE

His eyes still on the mirror, he absently takes the joint 
between thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it 
out the driver's window--except that the window is not open.  
The butt bounces off the glass and around the car, showering 
sparks.

DUDE'S CROTCH

The glowing butt rolls down the car seat between his legs. 
The Dude screams.

THE STREET

The car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off 
to, make way, horns blaring.  The car finally spins and comes 
to rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone 
poll.

INSIDE THE CAR

The Dude frantically grabs at his door, which won't open, 
and then slides over to push at the passenger door, which 
also won't open.

				DUDE
		Fuck Me.

But he is sitting on the passenger  side now,  away from  
the lit butt.  He looks around for it.

Smoke is wisping up from between the Driver's seat cushion 
and back cushion.

				DUDE
		Fuckola, man.

He takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions.   
There is a hissing  sound.   But there is a piece of paper 
sticking out from between the cushions.

The Dude pulls it out.

It is lined spiral notebook paper, slightly singed and 
dripping beer, covered with handwriting.  In the upper right-
hand corner is the name Lawrence Sellers, and under that, 
Mrs. Jamtoss 5th Period.  The theme is titled "The Louisiana 
Purchase."  In red ink is a large circled D and some 
handwritten marginal comments; misspelled words are circled 
in red throughout.

CRANE JACKSON'S FOUNTAIN STREET THEATER

We are behind Walter, the Dude, and Donny, facing the stage 
in the background where Allan, the Dude's balding landlord, 
is performing a dance moderne.

As Walter talks to the Dude he leans in to him, his voice 
hushed, so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse 
audience.

				WALTER
		He lives in North Hollywood on 
		Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--

				DUDE
		The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.

				WALTER
		Near the In-and-Out Burger--

				DONNY
		Those are good burgers, Walter.

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid 
		is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his 
		father is--are you ready for this?--
		Arthur Digby Sellers.

				DUDE
		Who the fuck is that?

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?

				WALTER
		Who the f--have you ever heard of a 
		little show called Branded, Dude?

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				WALTER
		All but one man died?  There at Bitter 
		Creek?

				DUDE
		Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show 
		Walter, so what?

				WALTER
		Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 
		156 episodes, Dude.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		The bulk of the series.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		Not exactly a lightweight.

				DUDE
		No.

				WALTER
		And yet his son is a fucking dunce.

				DUDE
		Uh.

				WALTER
		Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out 
		there after the, uh, the.

He waves a hand vaguely toward the stage.

				WALTER
		What have you.  We'll, uh--

				DONNY
		We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, 
		brace the kid--he'll be a pushover.  
		We'll get that fucking money, if he 
		hasn't spent it already.  Million 
		fucking clams. And yes, we'll be 
		near the, uh--some burgers, some 
		beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking 
		troubles are over, Dude.

RESIDENTIAL AREA

The Dude and Walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated 
house sitting on a scrubby lot.  Parked incongruously in 
front of the house is a brand new red Corvette.

				DUDE
		Fuck me, man!  That kid's already 
		spent all the money!

				WALTER
		Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's 
		still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, 
		depending on the options.  Wait in 
		the car, Donny.

THE FRONT DOOR

Walter rings the bell.  It is opened by a matronly Spanish 
woman.

				WOMAN
		Jace?

				WALTER
		Hello, Pilar?  My name is Walter 
		Sobchak, we spoke on the phone, this 
		is my associate Jeffrey Lebowski.

				WOMAN
		Jace.

				WALTER
		May we uh, we wanted to talk about 
		little Larry.  May we come in?

				WOMAN
		Jace.

They enter a dim living room and stand, looking about, as 
Pilar

CALLS UP THE STAIRS:

				PILAR
		Larry!  Sweetie!  Dat mang is here!

There is a rhythmic compressor sound; Walter places it and 
nudges the Dude.  At the other end of the living room a man 
lies on something that looks like a hospital gurney with its 
midsection enclosed by a motorized stainless-steel bubble.  
It is an iron lung, artificially breathing with distinct 
hisses in and out.

				WALTER
		That's him, Dude.

				VIVA VOCE
		And a good day to you, sir.

				PILAR
		See down, please.

				WALTER
		Thank you, ma'am.

He and the Dude sit on a sagging green sofa.  In a lowered 
voice, to Pilar:

				WALTER
		Does he, uh. . . Is he still writing?

				PILAR
		No, no.  He has healt' problems.

				WALTER
		Uh-huh.

HE BELLOWS ACROSS THE ROOM:

				WALTER
		I just want to say, sir, that we're 
		both enormous--on a personal level, 
		Branded, especially the early 
		episodes, has been a source of, uh, 
		inspir---

There are footsteps on the stairs.  Larry, a fifteen-year-
old, looks at the two men.

				PILAR
		See down, Sweetie.  These are the 
		policeman--

				WALTER
		No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the 
		impression that we're police exactly.  
		We're hoping that it will not be 
		necessary to call the police.

He adopts his command voice in turning to Larry:

				WALTER
		But that is up to little Larry here.  
		Isn't it, Larry?

Walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out 
the homework, which is now in a ziploc bag.  He holds it out 
at arm's length, displaying it to Larry.

				WALTER
		Is this your homework, Larry?

Larry does not respond.

				WALTER
		Is this your homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		Look, man, did you--

				WALTER
		Dude, please!. . .  Is this your 
		homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		Just ask him if he--ask him about 
		the car, man!

Walter is still holding out the homework.

				WALTER
		Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your 
		homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		Is the car out front yours?

				WALTER
		Is this your homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		We know it's his fucking homework, 
		Walter!  Where's the fucking money, 
		you little brat?

Throughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework 
extended towards him.

				WALTER
		Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard 
		of Vietnam?

				DUDE
		Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!

				WALTER
		You're going to enter a world of 
		pain, son.  We know that this is 
		your homework.  We know you stole a 
		car--

				DUDE
		And the fucking money!

				WALTER
		And the fucking money.  And we know 
		that this is your homework, Larry.

No answer.

				WALTER
		You're gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!.

FINALLY, IN DISGUST:

				WALTER
		Ah, this is pointless.

As he shoves the homework back in the attache case:

				WALTER
		All right, Plan B.  You might want 
		to watch out the front window there, 
		Larry.

He is heading for the door.  The Dude, puzzled, rises to 
follow him.

				WALTER
		This is what happens when you FUCK a 
		STRANGER in the ASS, Larry.

OUTSIDE

Walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like 
an enraged encyclopedia salesman.  Without looking back at, 
the Dude, who follows:

				WALTER
		Fucking language problem, Dude.

He pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase and takes 
out a tire iron.

				WALTER
		Maybe he'll understand this.

He is walking over to the Corvette.

				WALTER
		YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!

CRASH!  He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which 
shatters.

				WALTER
		YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?!

CRASH!  He takes out the driver's window.

				WALTER
		THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A 
		STRANGER IN THE ASS!

Lights are going on in houses down the street.  Distant dogs 
bark.

				WALTER
		HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!

CRASH!

				WALTER
		HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS!  FUCK A STRANGER 
		IN THE ASS!

CRASH!

A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over 
behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of 
the crowbar.

				MAN
		WHAT THE FUCK JOO DOING, MANG?!

He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter.

				MAN
		I JUS' BAWDEEZ FUCKEEN CAR LASS WEEK!

Walter cringes before the enraged Mexican.

				WALTER
		Hunh?

The man looks about, wildly.

				MAN
		I KILL JOO, MANG!  I--I KILL JOR 
		FUCKEEN CAR!

He runs over to the Dude's car.

				DUDE
		No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--

CRASH!  CRASH!

				MAN
		I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

CRASH!

				MAN
		I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

INSIDE THE CAR

Glass rains in on a terrified, cringing, Donny.

				MAN
		I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

					  ON A DEAFENING CRASH WE CUT TO:

THE DUDE'S CAR

We are looking into the car through the broken windshield as 
it rattles down the freeway.  Wind whistles through the caved-
in windows.

The Dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the

road.  Walter, beside him, and Donny in the back seat, munch 
'on In-and-Out Burgers.

Creedence music plays above the bluster of wind.

DUDE'S BUNGALOW

As the Dude talks on the phone he is hammering a two-by-four 
into the floor just inside, and parallel to, the front door.

				DUDE
		I accept your apology. . . No I, I 
		just want to handle it myself from 
		now on. . . No.  That has nothing to 
		do with it. . . .Yes, it made it 
		home, I'm calling from home.  No, 
		Walter, it didn't look like Larry 
		was about to crack.

He finishes hammering, rises and grabs a straightbacked chair 
that stands nearby.

				DUDE
		Well that's your perception. . . 
		Well you're right, Walter, and the 
		unspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND 
		LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE. . . Yeah, 
		I'll be at practice.

He hangs up and has just finished sliding the chair into 
place with its top under the doorknob and its legs braced 
against the two-by-four, thus wedging the door closed, when 
the door is opened--outwards.  The chair clatters to the 
floor.

				DUDE
		Huh?

Woo and the blond man who earlier peed on the rug stride in, 
kicking the chair away.

				WOO
		Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie
		Treehorn wants to see you.

				BLOND MAN
		And we know which Lebowski you are, 
		Lebowski.

				WOO
		Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk 
		to the deadbeat Lebowski.

				BLOND MAN
		You're not dealing with morons here.

BLACKNESS

Out of the blackness something is falling toward us.  It is 
a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her 
mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy.  She is topless.  
She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a 
beat reappears, rising into the night sky.

MALIBU BEACH

A crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried 
hair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual 
attire, are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in 
nightmarish slow motion.

WIDER

It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing 
kerosene heaters.  1960's mainstream jazz, of the Mancini-
Brubeck school, has been piped down to speakers on the beach'.

In long shot now the woman rises, squealing, disappears  
into darkness, descends into light, rises again.

A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach 
light.  He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants 
and a Turnbull & Asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the 
neck.  Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and 
disappears.

				MAN
		Hello Dude, thanks for coming.  I'm 
		Jackie Treehorn.

INSIDE THE BEACH HOUSE

The Dude is looking around at the '60's modern decor.

				DUDE
		This is quite a pad you got here, 
		man.  Completely unspoiled.

				TREEHORN
		What's your drink, Dude?

				DUDE
		White Russian, thanks.  How's the 
		smut business, Jackie?

				TREEHORN
		I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in 
		publishing, entertainment, political 
		advocacy, and--

				DUDE
		Which one was Logjammin'?

				TREEHORN
		Regrettably, it's true, standards 
		have fallen in adult entertainment.  
		It's video, Dude.  Now that we're 
		competing with the amateurs, we can't 
		afford to invest that little extra 
		in story, production value, feeling.

He taps his forehead with one finger.

				TREEHORN
		People forget that the brain is the 
		biggest erogenous zone--

				DUDE
		On you, maybe.

He hands him the drink.

				TREEHORN
		Of course, you do get the good with 
		the bad.  The new technology permits 
		us to do exciting things with 
		interactive erotic software.  Wave 
		of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off 
		manually.

				TREEHORN
		Of course you do.  I can see you're 
		anxious for me to get to the point.  
		Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?

				DUDE
		I thought you might know, man.

				TREEHORN
		Me?  How would I know?  The only 
		reason she ran off was to get away 
		from her rather sizable debt to me.

				DUDE
		But she hasn't run off, she's been--

Treehorn waves this off.

				TREEHORN
		I've heard the kidnapping story, so 
		save it.  I know you're mixed up in 
		all this, Dude, and I don't care 
		what you're trying to take off her 
		husband.  That's your business.  All 
		I'm saying is, I want mine.

				DUDE
		Yeah, well, right man, there are 
		many facets to this, uh, you know, 
		many interested parties.  If I can 
		find your money, man-- what's in it 
		for the Dude?

				TREEHORN
		Of course, there's that to discuss.  
		Refill?

				DUDE
		Does the Pope shit in the woods?

				TREEHORN
		Let's say a 10% finder's fee?

				DUDE
		Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way 
		you do business.  Your money is being 
		held by a kid named Larry Sellers.  
		He lives in North Hollywood, on 
		Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger.  
		A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure 
		your goons'll be able to get it off 
		him, mean he's only fifteen and he's 
		flunking social studies.  So if you'll 
		just write me a check for my ten per 
		cent. . . of half a million. . . 
		fifty grand.

He is getting to his feet, but sways woozily.

				DUDE
		I'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you 
		mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.

The Dude shakes his head, tries to focus.

				TREEHORN
		A fifteen-year-old?  Is this your 
		idea of a joke?

Jackie Treehorn's image starts to swim.  He is joined on 
either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking 
grimly down at the Dude.

				DUDE
		No funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid's 
		got it.  Hiya, fellas. . . kid just 
		wanted a car.  All the Dude ever 
		wanted. . . was his rug back. . . 
		not greedy. . . it really.

He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus.  
Tied the room together.

He tips forward, spilling his drink off the table.

FROM UNDER THE GLASS COFFEE TABLE

Looking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and 
squishes.

FAST FADE OUT

BLACK

				THE STRANGER'S VOICE
		Darkness warshed over the Dude--
		darker'n a black steer's tookus on a 
		moonless prairie night.  There was 
		no bottom.

We hear a thundering bass.

SCRATCHY WHITE TITLE CARD:

JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS

ANOTHER TITLE CARD:

THE DUDE

AND

MAUDE LEBOWSKI

IN

THIRD TITLE CARD:

GUTTERBALLS

The title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked 
by a pair of  bowling balls.   The  bending bass sound turns  
into the lead-in to Kenny Rogers and the First Edition's  
"Just Dropped In."

The Dude is walking down a long corridor dressed as a cable 
repairman.  The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light 
as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley.

In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing 
operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song.  She wears an 
armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails, 
and holds a trident.

The Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps 
her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball.

The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini- 
skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs 
turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the 
end.

But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their 
legs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane, 
the tools from his utility belt swinging free.  He is face 
down, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides.

His point of view shows the lane rushing by below, the little 
ball-guide arrows zipping by.

The Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so 
that he is now gliding along the lane face-up.

Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing 
chorines.

The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so 
that he is once again gliding face-down.  He looks forward 
and his forward momentum blows back his hair.

Coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs, 
are the approaching pins.  We hit the pins, scattering them,  
and rush on into black.

A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless 
woman, squealing, her legs kicking.

As she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three 
men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool 
of light.  It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding 
oversized shears which they menacingly scissor.

The Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the 
advancing Germans.  He turns and runs, fists pumping.

The scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of 
car-bys.  The field of black is punctured by headlights.  
The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific 
Coast Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring.

With the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with 
flashing gumballs pulls up.

SQUAD CAR

The Dude sits in the back seat, his head lolling with the 
motion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of Branded:

				DUDE
		He was innocent.  Not a charge was 
		true.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay.

CHIEF'S OFFICE

The Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces 
off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair.

His wallet is tossed onto the desk.

The chief leans forward, takes the wallet and sorts through 
it with disgusted incredulity.

				CHIEF
		This is your only I.D.?

He is looking at the Ralph's Shopper's Club card.
				DUDE
		I know my rights.

				CHIEF
		You don't know shit, Lebowski.

				DUDE
		I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I 
		want Bill Kunstler.

				CHIEF
		What are you, some kind of sad-assed 
		refugee from the fucking sixties?

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				CHIEF
		Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to 
		eject you from his garden party, 
		that you were drunk and abusive.

				DUDE
		That guy treats women like objects, 
		man.

				CHIEF
		Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in 
		this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw 
		shit.  We got a nice quiet beach 
		community here, and I aim to keep it 
		nice and quiet.  So let me make 
		something plain.  I don't like you 
		sucking around bothering our citizens, 
		Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk-
		off name, I don't like your jerk-off 
		face, I don't like your jerk- off 
		behavior, and I don't like you, jerk-
		off --do I make myself clear?

The Dude stares.

				DUDE
		I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude.  It 
hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee 
splashing everywhere.

The Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk.

				DUDE
		--Ow!  Fucking fascist!

The Chief slaps him twice.

				CHIEF
		Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!

He kicks the chair out from under the Dude, and then starts 
kicking at him.

				CHIEF
		Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!  Keep 
		your ugly fucking goldbricking ass 
		out of my beach community!

CAB

The Dude, in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks 
with every bump, is gingerly touching at sore spots on his 
face and scalp.

"Peaceful Easy Feeling" is on the radio.

DUDE'S POV

The back of the driver, a large black man with rasta dreds 
under a knit cap.

				DUDE
		Jesus, man, can you change the 
		station?

				DRIVER
		Fuck you man!  You don't like my 
		fucking music, get your own fucking 
		cab!

				DUDE
		I've had a--

				DRIVER
		I pull over and kick your ass out, 
		man!

				DUDE
		--had a rough night, and I hate the 
		fucking Eagles, man--

				DRIVER
		That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!

THE STREET

The cab screeches over towards the curb.  Another car, 
oncoming, its radio blaring Metallica, speeds by.

INSIDE THE OTHER CAR

It is a red convertible.  The driver, singing loudly and 
badly along with the radio, her hair blowing in the wind, a 
dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along, higher than a 
kite, is Bunny Lebowski.

THE FOOTWELL

On the accelerator her right foot, in an open-toed bright 
red high-heeled shoe, has five painted toes.

When she downshifts her left foot enters to engage the clutch.

Five more toes.

DUDE'S BUNGALOW

The Dude staggers in the open front door, one hand pressed 
to a lump on his forehead, and looks around.

				DUDE
		Jesus.

The place is a wreck.  Furniture has been overturned, 
upholstery slashed, drawers dumped.

Quiet.

The door to the bedroom starts to creak open.

The Dude cringes.

Maude emerges from the bedroom.  She is wearing a bathrobe.

				MAUDE
		Jeffrey.

				DUDE
		Maude?

She pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches.

				MAUDE
		Love me.

The Dude is stupefied.

				DUDE
		That's my robe.

					 THOOMP!  ON THE EMBRACE WE CUT TO:

BLACK

After a beat, a long sigh, and then a voice from the 
blackness:

				MAUDE
		Tell me a little about yourself, 
		Jeffrey.

				DUDE
		Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.

A match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude is lighting 
himself a joint.  He shakes the match out to restore blackness 
except for the glowing tip of the joint.

				DUDE
		I was, uh, one of the authors of the 
		Port Huron Statement.--The original 
		Port Huron Statement.

				MAUDE
		Uh-huh.

				DUDE
		Not the compromised second draft.  
		And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the 
		Seattle Seven?

				MAUDE
		Mmnun.

Click--the Dude turns on a bedside lamp.  He and Maude lie 
next to each other in bed.

				DUDE
		And then. . . let's see, I uh--music 
		business briefly.

				MAUDE
		Oh?

				DUDE
		Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed 
		of Sound Tour.

				MAUDE
		Uh-huh.

				DUDE
		Bunch of assholes.  And then, you 
		know, little of this, little of that. 
		My career's, uh, slowed down a bit 
		lately.

				MAUDE
		What do you do for fun?

				DUDE
		Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl.  
		Drive around.  The occasional acid 
		flashback.

He climbs out of bed but Maude remains in it.  She wedges a 
pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each 
kneecap.  She pulls her knees in toward her chest to keep 
her pelvis raised.

				MAUDE
		What happened to your house?

				DUDE
		Jackie Treehorn trashed the place.  
		Wanted to save the finder's fee.

				MAUDE
		Finder's fee?

				DUDE
		He thought I had your father's money, 
		so he got me out of the way while he 
		looked for it.

				MAUDE
		It's not my father's money, it's the 
		Foundation's.  Why did he think you 
		had it?  And who does?

				DUDE
		Larry Sellers, a high-school kid.  
		Real fucking brat.

He picks a White Russian off the bedside table.

				MAUDE
		Jeffrey--

				DUDE
		It's a complicated case, Maude.  
		Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately 
		I've been adhering to a pretty strict, 
		uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, 
		you know, limber.  I'm real fucking 
		close to your father's money, real 
		fucking close.  It's just--

				MAUDE
		I keep telling you, it's the 
		Foundation's money.  Father doesn't 
		have any.

				DUDE
		Huh?  He's fucking loaded.

				MAUDE
		No no, the wealth was all Mother's.

				DUDE
		But your father--he runs stuff, he--

				MAUDE
		We did let Father run one of the 
		companies, briefly, but he didn't do 
		very well at it.

				DUDE
		But he's--

				MAUDE
		He helps administer the charities 
		now, and I give him a reasonable 
		allowance.  He has no money of his 
		own.  I know how he likes to present 
		himself; Father's weakness is vanity.  
		Hence the slut.

				DUDE
		Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is 
		that yoga?

Throughout, Maude has been lying on her back with her knees 
pulled in.

				MAUDE
		It increases the chances of 
		conception.

The Dude spits some White Russian.

				DUDE
		Increases?

				MAUDE
		Well yes, what did you think this 
		was all about?  Fun and games?

				DUDE
		Well...no, of course not--

				MAUDE
		I want a child.

				DUDE
		Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--

				MAUDE
		Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner.  
		In fact I don't want the father to 
		be someone I have to see socially, 
		or who'll have any interest in rearing 
		the child himself.

				DUDE
		Huh...

Something occurs to him.

				DUDE
		So...that doctor.

				MAUDE
		Exactly.  What happened to your face?  
		Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?

The Dude is staring off into space, thinking.  His answer is 
absent.

				DUDE
		No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu.  
		A real reactionary. . . So your 
		father. . . Oh man, I get it!

				MAUDE
		What?

The Dude is leaving the bedroom.

				DUDE
		Yeah, my thinking about the case, 
		man, it had become uptight.  Yeah.  
		Your father--

LIVING ROOM

The Dude finishes punching a number into the phone.

				PHONE VOICE
		This is Walter Sobchak.  I'm not in; 
		leave a message after the beep.

FROM THE BEDROOM:

				MAUDE'S VOICE
		What're you talking about?

Beep.

				DUDE
		Walter, if you're there, pick up the 
		fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, 
		this is an emergency.  I'm not--

				WALTER
		Dude?

				DUDE
		Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I 
		need you to come pick me up--

				WALTER
		I can't drive, Dude, it's erev 
		shabbas.

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm 
		not even supposed to pick up the 
		phone, unless it's an emergency.

				DUDE
		It is a fucking emergency.

				WALTER
		I understand.  That's why I picked 
		up the phone.

				DUDE
		THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, 
		just call Donny then, and ask him to--

				WALTER
		Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--

				DUDE
		WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA 
		GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR 
		I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!

				MAUDE'S VOICE
		Jeffrey?

THE DUDE

He emerges on his front stoop, pulling on a shirt. His 
attention is caught by something down the street.

HIS POV

A car is  parked halfway down the block.  We can see the 
shape of a fat man in the driver's seat.

THE DUDE

Striding purposefully down the street.

HIS POV

The fat man leans forward and we hear the sound of the car's 
ignition coughing, but the engine will not turn over.  More 
whines and coughs; no start.

The man hurriedly fumbles in front of him.  He brings up a 
newspaper, which he holds before his face.

THE DUDE

As he gets to the car.  He reaches through the open driver's 
window and grabs the newspaper and hurls it to the ground.  
He is revved with nervous energy.

				DUDE
		Get out of that fucking car, man!

The man nervously complies.  The Dude flinches at the man's 
movement as he gets out.

The man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch.

He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit.  He is bald with a 
short fringe and a mustache.

The Dude shouts to cover his fear:

				DUDE
		Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, 
		man!

				MAN
		Relax, man!  No physical harm 
		intended!

				DUDE
		Who the fuck are you?  Why've you 
		been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!

				MAN
		Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.

The Dude is stunned.

				DUDE
		Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?

				MAN
		Irish m--What the fuck are you talking 
		about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a 
		private snoop!  Like you, man!

				DUDE
		Huh?

				DA FINO
		A dick, man!  And let me tell you 
		something: I dig your work. Playing 
		one side against the other--in bed 
		with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.

				DUDE
		I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay 
		away from my fucking lady friend, 
		man.

				DA FINO
		Hey hey, I'm not messing with your 
		special lady--

				DUDE
		She's not my special lady, she's my 
		fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping 
		her conceive, man!

				DA FINO
		Hey, man, I'm not--

				DUDE
		Who're you working for?  Lebowski?  
		Jackie Treehorn?

				DA FINO
		The Gundersons.

				DUDE
		The?  Who the fff--

				DA FINO
		The Gundersons.  It's a wandering 
		daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man.  
		Her real name is Fawn Gunderson.  
		Her parents want her back.

He is fumbling in his wallet.

				DA FINO
		See?

The Dude looks at the picture.

It is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but 
fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and 
straight Partridge Family hair and bangs.

				DUDE
		Jesus fucking Christ.

				DA FINO
		Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.

He is holding out another picture.

The Gundersons told me to show her this when I found her.  
The family farm.

A bleak farmhouse and silo are the only features on a flat 
snow-swept landscape.

Outside of Moorhead, Minnesota.  They think it'll make her 
homesick.

				DUDE
		Boy.  How ya gonna keep 'em down on 
		the farm once they seen Karl Hungus.

He hands back the picture.

She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.  Or maybe not, but she's 
definitely not around.

				DA FINO
		Fuck, man!  That's terrible!

				DUDE
		Yeah, it sucks.

				DA FINO
		Well maybe you and me could pool our 
		resources--trade information--
		professional courtesy--compeers, you 
		know--

We hear distant yapping, growing louder with the hum of an 
approaching car.

				DUDE
		Yeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino.  
		And stay away from my special la--
		from my fucking lady friend.

The Dude steps out to meet Walter's car as it pulls up, its 
passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and 
yapping.

DENNY'S

Four people sit at a booth:  Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in 
black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde 
hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless 
tee-shirt, worn thin with age.  She is apparently braless, 
and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and 
arms.

Notable  is  her  camera-side  leg,  which  ends in  a bandage-
swaddled foot.  Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of 
the bandage. The  four  are  arguing,  loudly,  in  German.   
They seem  very unhappy. A waitress enters with a checkpad 
and pen.

				WAITRESS
		You folks ready?

The German shouting stops.  Dieter looks sourly up.

				DIETER
		I haff lingenberry pancakes.

				KIEFFER
		Lingenberry pancakes.

				FRANZ
		Sree picks in blanket.

The woman speaks to Dieter in German.  He nods.

				DIETER
		Lingenberry pancakes.

WALTER'S CAR

Walter's eyes are on the road as he listens, driving, to the 
Dude, whose speech is occasionally punctuated by yaps from 
the back seat.

				DUDE
		I mean we totally fucked it up, man.  
		We fucked up his pay-off.  And got 
		the kidnappers all pissed off, and 
		the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, 
		but he didn't do anything.  Huh?

				WALTER
		Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, 
		uh.

				DUDE
		I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck-
		up, then why does he still leave me 
		in charge of getting back his wife?  
		Because he fucking doesn't want her 
		back, man!  He's had enough!  He no 
		longer digs her!  It's all a show!  
		But then, why didn't he give a shit 
		about his million bucks?  I mean, he 
		knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, 
		but he never asked for it back.

				WALTER
		What's your point, Dude?

				DUDE
		His million bucks was never in it, 
		man!  There was no money in that 
		briefcase!  He was hoping they'd 
		kill her!  You throw out a ringer 
		for a ringer!

				WALTER
		Yeah?

				DUDE
		Shit yeah!

				WALTER
		Okay, but how does all this add up 
		to an emergency?

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		I'm saying, I see what you're getting 
		at, Dude, he kept the money, but my 
		point is, here we are, it's shabbas, 
		the sabbath, which I'm allowed to 
		break only if it's a matter of life 
		and death--

				DUDE
		Walter, come off it.  You're not 
		even fucking Jewish, you're--

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you talking about?

				DUDE
		You're fucking Polish Catholic--

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you talking about?  
		I converted when I married Cynthia!  
		Come on, Dude!

				DUDE
		Yeah, and you were--

				WALTER
		You know this!

				DUDE
		And you were divorced five fucking 
		years ago.

				WALTER
		Yeah?  What do you think happens 
		when you get divorced?  You turn in 
		your library card?  Get a new driver's 
		license?  Stop being Jewish?

				DUDE
		This driveway.

AS HE TURNS:

				WALTER
		I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye

				DUDE
		It's just part of your whole sick 
		Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her 
		fucking dog.  Going to her fucking 
		synagogue.  You're living in the 
		fucking past.

				WALTER
		Three thousand years of beautiful 
		tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax--
		YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE 
		PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell 
		happened?

He is looking off as the car slows.  The Dude looks where 
Walter is looking.

THE LEBOWSKI MANSION

Walter's car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he 
and the Dude get out.

Both are gaping off at the front lawn.

				WALTER
		Jesus Christ.

THEIR POV

Tire treads lead across the manicured front lawn to where a 
little red sports car rests with its hood crumpled into a 
palm trunk.

TRACKING DOWN THE GREAT HALLWAY

Through the French doors at its far end we can see Bunny, 
naked, briefly bouncing on the diving board before splashing 
into the illuminated pool outside.  Heavy metal music filters 
in from a boom box by the pool.

Brandt, approaching, stoops and straightens, stoops and 
straightens, picking up the discarded clothes that run the 
length of the hall.

				BRANDT
		He can't see you, Dude.

We pull the Dude and Walter as they approach the doors to 
the great study.  Walter's dog follows, stiffly waving its 
tail.

				DUDE
		Where'd she been?

				BRANDT
		Visiting friends of hers in Palm 
		Springs.  Just picked up and left, 
		never bothered to tell us.

				DUDE
		But I guess she told Dieter.

				WALTER
		Jesus, Dude!  He never even kidnapped 
		her.

				BRANDT
		Who's this gentleman, Dude?

				WALTER
		Who'm I?  I'm a fucking VETERAN!

				BRANDT
		You shouldn't go in there, Dude!  
		He's very angry!

BANG--the Dude and Walter push through the double doors into--

THE GREAT ROOM

The big Lebowski turns at the sound of the door.  His 
wheelchair hums as he spins it around.

				LEBOWSKI
			(bitterly)
		Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.

				DUDE
		Where's the money, Lebowski?

				WALTER
		A MILLION BUCKS FROM FUCKING NEEDY 
		LITTLE URBAN ACHIEVERS!  YOU ARE 
		SCUM, MAN!

The dog yaps.

				LEBOWSKI
		Who the hell is he?

				WALTER
		I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy 
		who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY 
		GOLDBRICKING ASS!

				DUDE
		We know the briefcase was empty, 
		man.  We know you kept the million  
		bucks yourself.

				LEBOWSKI
		Well, you have your story, I have 
		mine.  I say I entrusted the money 
		to you, and you stole it.

				WALTER
		AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING 
		YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!

				DUDE
		You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped 
		and you could use it as a pretext to 
		make some money disappear.  All you 
		needed was a sap to pin it on, and 
		you'd just met me.  You thought, 
		hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone 
		the square community won't give a 
		shit about.

				LEBOWSKI
		Well?  Aren't you?

				DUDE
		Well. . . yeah.

				LEBOWSKI
		All right, get out.  Both of you.

				WALTER
		Look at that fucking phony, Dude!  
		Pretending to be a fucking 
		millionaire!

				LEBOWSKI
		I said out.  Now.

				WALTER
		Let me tell you something else.  
		I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, 
		and this guy is a fake.  A fucking 
		goldbricker.

He is crossing to Lebowski.

				WALTER
		This guy fucking walks.  I've never 
		been more certain of anything in my 
		life!

				LEBOWSKI
		Stay away from me, mister!

Walter reaches around from behind and hoists the big Lebowski 
out of the wheelchair by his armpits.

				WALTER
		Walk, you fucking phony!

The big Lebowski waggles helplessly, his rubbery feet grazing 
the floor like a Raggedy Ann's.  The pomeranian gaily leaps 
and yaps.

				LEBOWSKI
		Put me down, you son of a bitch!

				DUDE
		Walter!

				WALTER
		It's all over, man!  We call your 
		fucking bluff!

				DUDE
		WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S 
		CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!

				WALTER
		Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS!
		ACHTUNG, BABY!!

He shoves the big Lebowski forward and he crumples to the 
floor, weeping.

				WALTER
		Oh, shit.

				LEBOWSKI
			(sobbing)
		You're bullies!  Cowards, both of 
		you!

Walter is abashed.  The Big Lebowski flails about on the 
floor.

				WALTER
		Oh, shit.

				DUDE
		He can't walk, Walter!

				WALTER
		Yeah, I can see that, Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		You monsters!

				DUDE
		Help me put him back in his chair.

Walter moves to comply.

				WALTER
		Shit, sorry man.

THROUGH HIS TEARS:

				LEBOWSKI
		Stay away from me!  You bullies!  
		You and these women!  You won't leave 
		a man his fucking balls!

				DUDE
		Walter, you fuck!

				WALTER
		Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I 
		wouldn't've done it if I knew he was 
		a fucking crybaby.

				DUDE
		We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.

The Dude has picked up the Big Lebowski's plaid lap warmer 
and is frantically tucking it back in around his waist and 
batting the dog away.

				DUDE
		There ya go.  Sorry man.

Walter, puzzled, hands on hips, stands over the big Lebowski.

				WALTER
		Shit.  He didn't look like a spinal.

TEN PINS

Scattered at the cut.

DUDE AND WALTER

Each with a beer at the scoring table.

				WALTER
		Sure you'll see some tank battles.  
		But fighting in desert is very 
		different from fighting in canopy 
		jungle.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war 
		whereas, uh, this thing should be a 
		fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an 
		M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking 
		tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, 
		eyeball to eyeball.

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				WALTER
		That's fuckin' combat.  The man in 
		the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy 
		fuckin' adversary.

				DONNY
		Who's in pyjamas, Walter?

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch 
		of fig-eaters with towels on their 
		heads tryin' to find reverse on a 
		Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--

				VOICE
		HEY!

The Dude and Walter look.

Quintana is bellowing from the lip of the lane, and is 
restrained by O'Brien.

				QUINTANA
		What's this "day of rest" shit, man?!

Walter looks at him innocently.

				QUINTANA
		What is this bullshit, man?  I don't 
		fucking care!  It don't matter to 
		Jesus!  But you're not fooling me!  
		You might fool the fucks in the league 
		office, but you don't fool Jesus!  
		It's bush league psych-out stuff!  
		Laughable, man!  I would've fucked 
		you in the ass Saturday, I'll fuck 
		you in the ass next Wednesday instead!

				QUINTANA

He makes hip-grinding coital motions as O'Brien leads him 
away.

				QUINTANA
		You got a date Wednesday, man!

Walter, his head cocked, and the Dude, peeking over his 
shades, watch him go.

				WALTER
		He's cracking.

BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT

Donny, Walter and the Dude emerge from the alley, each holding 
his leatherette ball satchel.

				WALTER
		A tree of life, Dude.  To all who 
		cling to it.

They react to the droning synthesizer-based technopop coming 
from a boom box.

REVERSE

Dieter, Kieffer and Franz, in shiny black leather, stand in 
a line facing them in the all-but-deserted lot.  Behind them 
orange flames lick gently at the Dude's car, which has been 
put to the torch.  The orange flames glow on the men's 
creaking leather.  Next to the car are three motorcycles, 
parked in a neat row.  The Dude looks sadly at the burning 
car.

				DUDE
		They finally did it.  They killed my 
		fucking car.

				DIETER
		Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.

				KIEFFER
		Ja, uzzervize vee kill ze girl.

				FRANZ
		Ja, it seems you forgot our little 
		deal, Lebowski.

				DUDE
		You don't have the fucking girl, 
		dipshits.  We know you never did.  
		So you've got nothin' on my Johnson.

				DUDE

The men in black, stunned, confer amongst themselves in 
German.  Under his breath:

				DONNY
		Are these the Nazis, Walter?

Walter answers, also sotto voce, his eyes still on the three 
men:

				WALTER
		They're nihilists, Donny, nothing to 
		be afraid of.

The Germans stop conferring.

				DIETER
		Vee don't care.  Vee still vant zat 
		money or vee fuck you up.

				KIEFFER
		Ja, vee still vant ze money.  Vee 
		sreaten you.

He pulls an uzi from under his coat.  It glints in the 
firelight.

				WALTER
		Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.

				DUDE
		Hey, cool it Walter.

Walter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans:

				WALTER
		There's no ransom if you don't have 
		a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom 
		is.  Those are the fucking rules.

				DIETER
		Zere ARE no ROOLZ!

				WALTER
		NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS-
		OF- BITCHES--

				KIEFFER
		His girlfriend gafe up her toe!  She 
		sought we'd be getting million 
		dollars!  Iss not fair!

				WALTER
		Fair!  WHO'S THE FUCKING NIHILIST 
		HERE!  WHAT ARE YOU, A BUNCH OF 
		FUCKING CRYBABIES?!

				DUDE
		Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, 
		there never was any money.  The big 
		Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, 
		man, so take it up with him.

				WALTER
		AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!

The Germans confer again, in German.

Donny is visibly frightened.

				DONNY
		Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?

WALTER 'S TONE IS GENTLE:

				WALTER
		They won't hurt us, Donny.  These 
		men are cowards.

THE CONFERENCE ENDS:

				DIETER
		Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on 
		you und vee call it eefen.

				WALTER
		Fuck you.

The Dude is digging into his pocket.

				DUDE
		Come on, Walter, we're ending this 
		thing cheap.

Walter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Dieter's.

				WALTER
		What's mine is mine.

				DUDE
		Come on, Walter!.

Louder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet:

				DUDE
		Four dollars here!

He inspects the change in his palm.

				DUDE
		Almost five!

				DONNY
			(tremulously)
		I got eighteen dollars, Dude.

				WALTER
			(grimly)
		What's mine is mine.

With a ring of steel, Dieter produces a glinting saber.

				DIETER
		VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR 
		MONEY!

				WALTER
			(coolly)
		Come and get it.

				DIETER
		VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!

				WALTER
		Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.

				DIETER
		I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!

				WALTER
		Show me what you got.  Nihilist.  
		Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.

In a rage, Dieter charges.

				DIETER
		I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!

WALTER

hurls his leather satchel.

KIEFFER

Watching Dieter's charge, is caught off-guard.  The bowling 
ball thuds into his chest and lifts him off his feet.

He falls back, his uzi clattering away.

WALTER

twists away as Dieter reaches him; grabs Dieter's head in 
both hands; draws Dieter's head up to his mouth, which closes 
on Dieter's ear.

DUDE

He rushes Franz but draws up short as Franz sends out karate 
kicks, his leather pants squeaking and popping.  Franz gives 
a loud cry with each kick; the Dude leans back, throwing his 
arms up, evading the kicks.

WALTER

His jaw is still clamped on Dieter's ear.  Dieter draws his 
saber against Walter's side, drawing blood.

Walter doesn't react to the wound.  Growling as Dieter 
screams, he worries his ear, waggling his head with his jaws 
clamped.

THE SABER

Dieter drops it.

DUDE

Awkwardly circling, evading Franz's kicks.

WALTER

still worrying the ear.  With a tearing sound his head and 
Dieter's separate.

DIETER, EARLESS, SCREAMS:

				DIETER
		I FUCK YOU!  YOU CANNOT HURT ME!  I 
		BELIEF IN NUSSING!

Walter spits his ear into his face.

DUDE

The Dude and Franz, both now panting heavily, have yet to 
establish body contact.  Franz continues to kick.

				FRANZ
		VEAKLING!

WALTER

draws back his fist.

				DIETER
		NUSSING!

				WALTER
		ANTI-SEMITE!

Bam!--A powerhouse blow to the middle of his face drops Dieter 
for the count.

DUDE AND FRANZ

With a piercing shriek Franz finally summons the nerve to 
charge the Dude, hands raised to deliver karate blows.

As he reaches the Dude--WHHAP--the  boom box swings into  
frame to smash him in the face.  Its volume shoots up.

Walter bashes him a few more times over the head.  The music 
screeches to static, then quiet.  Laid out now, Franz too is 
quiet.

All quiet.

Walter, panting, looks around.

				WALTER
		We've got a man down, Dude.

With a hand pressed to his bleeding side he trots over to 
Donny, who lies gasping on the ground.

The Dude, also panting, rises and trots over.

				DUDE
		Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!

				WALTER
		No Dude.

				DUDE
		They shot Donny!

Donny gasps for air.  His eyes, wide, go from the Dude to 
Walter.  One hand still clutches his eighteen dollars.

				WALTER
		There weren't any shots.

				DUDE
		Then what's...

				WALTER
		It's a heart attack.

				DUDE
		Wha.

				WALTER
		Call the medics, Dude.

				DUDE
		Wha. . . Donny--

				WALTER
		Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping 
		blood.  Might pass out.

The Dude runs into the lanes.  Walter lays a reassuring hand 
on Donny's shoulder.

				WALTER
		Rest easy, good buddy, you're doing 
		fine.  We got help choppering in.

FADE OUT

HOLD IN BLACK

THE DUDE AND WALTER

---

They sit side by side, forearms on knees, in a nondescript 
waiting area.  Walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off 
those of the other.  They sit.  They wait.

A tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters.  He 
eyes the Dude's bowling attire and sunglasses and Walter's 
army surplus, but doesn't make an issue of it.

				MAN
		Hello, gentlemen.  You are the 
		bereaved?

				DUDE
		Yeah man.

				MAN
		Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet 
		you.

				DUDE
		Jeffrey Lebowski.

				WALTER
		Walter Sobchak.

				DUDE
		The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.

				DONNELLY
		Excuse me?

				DUDE
		Nothing.

				DONNELLY
		Yes.  I understand you're taking 
		away the remains.

				WALTER
		Yeah.

				DONNELLY
		We have the urn.

He nods through a door.  Another man in a black suit enters 
to carefully deposit a large silver urn on the desktop.

				DONNELLY
		And I assume this is credit card?

He is vaguely handing a large leather folder across the desk 
to whomever wants to take it.

				WALTER
		Yeah.

He takes it, opens it, puts on reading glasses that sit 
halfway down his nose, and inspects the bill with his head 
pulled back for focus and cocked for concentration.  Silence.  
The Dude smiles at Donnelly.  Donnelly gives back a 
mortician's smile.  At length Walter holds the bill towards 
Donnelly, pointing.

				WALTER
		What's this?

				DONNELLY
		That is for the urn.

				WALTER
		Don't need it.  We're scattering the 
		ashes.

				DONNELLY
		Yes, so we were informed.  However, 
		we must of course transmit the remains 
		to you in a receptacle.

				WALTER
		This is a hundred and eighty dollars.

				DONNELLY
		Yes sir.  It is our most modestly 
		priced receptacle.

				DUDE
		Well can we--

				WALTER
		A hundred and eighty dollars?!

				DONNELLY
		They range up to three thousand.

				WALTER
		Yeah, but we're--

				DUDE
		Can we just rent it from you?

				DONNELLY
		Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental 
		house.

				WALTER
		We're scattering the fucking ashes!

				DUDE
		Walter--

				WALTER
		JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T 
		MEAN WE'RE SAPS!

				DONNELLY
		Sir, please lower your voice--

				DUDE
		Hey man, don't you have something 
		else you could put it in?

				DONNELLY
		That is our most modestly priced 
		receptacle.

				WALTER
		GODDAMNIT!  IS THERE A RALPH'S AROUND 
		HERE?!

POINT DUME -- DAY

It is a high, wind-swept bluff.  Walter and the Dude walk 
towards the lip of the bluff.  Parked in the background is 
one lonely car, Walter's.

Walter is carrying a bright red coffee can with a blue plastic 
lid.  When they reach the edge the two men stand awkwardly 
for a beat.  Finally:

				WALTER
		I'll say a few words.

The Dude clasps his hands in front of him.  Walter clears 
his throat.

				WALTER
		Donny was a good bowler, and a good 
		man.  He was. . . He was one of us.  
		He was a man who loved the outdoors, 
		and bowling, and as a surfer explored 
		the beaches of southern California 
		from Redondo to Calabassos.  And he 
		was an avid bowler.  And a good 
		friend.  He died--he died as so many 
		of his generation, before his time.  
		In your wisdom you took him, Lord.  
		As you took so many bright flowering 
		young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc 
		and Hill 364.  These young men gave 
		their lives.  And Donny too.  Donny 
		who. . . who loved bowling.

Walter clears his throat.

				WALTER
		And so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos, 
		in accordance with what we think   
		your dying wishes might well have 
		been, we commit your mortal remains 
		to the bosom of.

Walter is peeling the plastic lid off the coffee can.

				WALTER
		the Pacific Ocean, which you loved 
		so well.

AS HE SHAKES OUT THE ASHES:

				WALTER
		Goodnight, sweet prince.

The wind has blown all of the ashes into the Dude, standing 
just to the side of and behind Walter. The Dude stands, 
frozen. Finished eulogizing, Walter looks back.

				WALTER
		Shit, I'm sorry Dude.

He starts brushing off the Dude with his hands.

				WALTER
		Goddamn wind.

Heretofore motionless, the Dude finally explodes, slapping 
Walter's hands away.

				DUDE
		Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking 
		asshole!

				WALTER
		Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!

The Dude is near tears.

				DUDE
		You make everything a fucking 
		travesty!

				WALTER
		Dude, I'm--it was an accident!

The Dude gives Walter a furious shove.

				DUDE
		What about that shit about Vietnam!

				WALTER
		Dude, I'm sorry--

				DUDE
		What the fuck does Vietnam have to 
		do with anything!  What the fuck 
		were you talking about?!

Walter for the first time is genuinely distressed, almost 
lost.

				WALTER
		Shit Dude, I'm sorry--

				DUDE
		You're a fuck, Walter!

He gives Walter a weaker shove.  Walter seems dazed, then 
wraps his arms around the Dude.

				WALTER
		Awww, fuck it Dude.  Let's go bowling.

THE LANES THE DUDE AND WALTER BOWLING

We watch each of them glide across the floor, release, follow 
through--gracefully.  We have never seen them bowl before.  
They are quite good.  Each wears a black armband on his 
bowling shirt.

BAR AREA

The Dude walks up to the bar.

				DUDE
		Two oat sodas, Gary.

				GARY
		Right.  Good luck tomorrow.

				DUDE
		Thanks, man.

				GARY
		Sorry to hear about Donny.

				DUDE
		Yeah.  Well, you know, sometimes you 
		eat the bear, and, uh.

"Tumbling Tumbleweeds" has come up on the jukebox, and The 
Stranger ambles up to the bar.

				THE STRANGER
		Howdy do, Dude.

				DUDE
		Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered 
		if I'd see you again.

				THE STRANGER
		Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things 
		been goin'?

				DUDE
		Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, 
		ups and downs.

The Stranger's eyes crinkle merrily.

				THE STRANGER
		Sure, I gotcha.

The bartender has put two gleaming beers on the counter.

				DUDE
		Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I 
		gotta get back.

				THE STRANGER
		Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know 
		that you will.

THE DUDE, LEAVING, NODS:

				DUDE
		Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude 
		abides.

Gazing after him, The Stranger drawls, savoring the words:

				THE STRANGER
		The Dude abides.

He gives his head a shake of appreciation, then looks into 
the camera.

				THE STRANGER
		I don't know about you, but I take 
		comfort in that.  It's good knowin' 
		he's out there, the Dude, takin' her 
		easy for all us sinners.  Shoosh.  I 
		sure hope he makes The finals.  Welp, 
		that about does her, wraps her all 
		up.  Things seem to've worked out 
		pretty good for the Dude'n Walter, 
		and it was a purt good story, dontcha 
		think?   Made me laugh to beat the 
		band.  Parts, anyway.  Course--I 
		didn't like seein' Donny go. But 
		then, happen to know that there's a 
		little Lebowski on the way.  I guess 
		that's the way the whole durned human 
		comedy keeps perpetuatin' it-self, 
		down through the generations, westward 
		the wagons, across the sands a time 
		until-- aw, look at me, I'm ramblin' 
		again.  Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed 
		yourselves.

He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip as we begin to pull 
back.

				THE STRANGER
		Catch ya further on down the trail.

As we pull away The Stranger swivels in to the bar.  As his 
voice fades:

				THE STRANGER
		...Say friend, ya got any more a 
		that good sarsaparilla?...
The Black Dahlia

     CREDITS ROLL OVER

     Black and white newsreel footage from the 1930s. Clips from
     prize fights featuring two different boxers against various
     opponents. One a light heavyweight--pure finesse, a
     counterpunches; the other, stouter and stronger, a
     headhunting puncher.

     The intercutting of the two fighters suggests a possible
     showdown at the end of the newsreel. No such luck.

     A TRIPLE CARBON LAPD "INCIDENT REPORT" FORM trapped in an old
     Corona typewriter. The keys pound letters into the blank
     spaces.

     INCIDENT: THE ZOOT SUIT RIOTS...JUNE 10, 1943...
     REPORTING OFFICER...DWIGHT "BUCKY" BLEICHERT

     EXT. BOYLE HEIGHTS - EVERGREEN AND WABASH - DUSK

     A WORLD WAR II ERA PERSONNEL CARRIER transports twenty silent
     LAPD officers into the heart of downtown Los Angeles. The
     sounds of glass breaking and men screaming serves as backdrop
     for their arrival.

     We focus in on BUCKY BLEICHERT, 26, (The counterpuncher from
     the newsreels) as he jumps from the carrier.

     Bucky's minus his gun but plus a WWI tin helmet and a three
     pound truncheon.

     BUCKY'S POV:

     Hundreds of in-uniform GI's use baseball bats and two-by-
     fours to beat the shit out of Zoot Suit-wearing Mexicans.

     Most of the cops wander to the edge of the race riot and
     hobnob with the pockets of MPs and Shore Patrol who've chosen
     to "restore order" by cheering on their countrymen against
     the outnumbered but equally fierce zooters.

     Sailors shatter streetlights and shop windows. Darkness falls
     quickly on what Bucky rightly realizes is chaos.

     Suddenly Bucky's RUNNING--

     away from the action...

     down a side street and onto a

     QUIET RESIDENTIAL BLOCK.

     He slows to a jog, trying to gather his thoughts. And then a
     voice:

                          VOICE
               Bleichert! Bleichert!

     EXT. A BUNGALOW COURTYARD - SAME

     A POLICE OFFICER has THREE MARINES IN DRESS BLUES and ONE
     ZOOT SUITER cornered in a center walkway.

     The marines swipe clumsily at the officer with their two-by-
     fours as he bobs back and forth on the balls of his feet,
     dodging the blows like the ex-fighter he is.

                          VOICE OVER
               I already knew him by reputation, had our
               respective records down pat: Lee
               Blanchard, 43-4-2 as a heavyweight,
               formerly a regular attraction at the
               Hollywood Legion Stadium.

     The terrified Mexican stands frozen on one side of Blanchard,
     trying to avoid the entire mess as the policeman parries the
     marines' blows with his own truncheon.

                          LEE BLANCHARD
               Code three, Bleichert!

     Bucky runs into the courtyard and immediately wades in,
     fending off the marines' blows to jab at them with his stick.

                          VOICE OVER
               And he knew me, Bucky Bleichert, light-
               heavy, 36-0-0, ranked tenth by Ring
               magazine in 1937 fighting no-name
               opponents in no-man's-land division.

     On instinct, Bucky drops his baton and begins wailing on the
     marines with his fists, connecting hard punches with soft
     midsections.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               In our first year at Central we'd never
               spoke--but people spoke of us. Opinions
               about a fantasy Bleichert-Blanchard
               fight, and who would win.

     And now Blanchard moves in, lashing vicious truncheon blows
     to the shoulders of the marines, sending them one by one into
     a heap.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               I'd heard almost all of 'em: Blanchard by
               early KO; Bleichert by decision;
               Blanchard stopped on cuts--everything but
               Bleichert by knockout.

     The marines reduced to rubble, Lee Blanchard turns his
     attention to the Zooter: he slaps handcuffs on him and leads
     him away. He motions for Bucky to follow.

     Lee turns back to the marines:

                          LEE
               To the halls of Tripoli, shitbirds.

     One of them flips Lee off. The Zooter kicks him in the chest
     as Lee pulls him away from them, laughing.

     The three men start back toward the riots. Gunshots can be
     heard. Palm trees blaze up into the night.

                          LEE (cont'd)
                   (re the Zooter)
               Bucky Bleichert, meet Senor Tomas Dos
               Santos, subject of an all-points fugitive
               warrant for manslaughter committed during
               the commission of a Class B Felony.
               Snatched a purse off a hairbag and she
               keeled of a heart attack.

                          BUCKY
               You come all the way down here to roust--

                          LEE
                   (smiling)
               I came all the way down here same as you
               did.
                   (jerks a finger to the riots)
               Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see
               those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--
                   (nudging Dos Santos)
               Habla Ingles, Tomas?

     The man shakes his head "no".

                          LEE (cont'd)
               He's dead meat. Manslaughter Two's a gas
               chamber jolt for spics. Hepcat here's
               about six weeks away from the Big Adios.
               Been better off getting a couple cracked
               ribs from our Privates First Class back
               there.

     Blanchard spies a home with newspapers stacked on the front
     porch.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               We'll never get him booked tonight.

                                                            CUT TO:

     LEE JIMMYING THE FRONT DOOR...

     INT. THE KITCHEN - LATER

     Tomas Dos Santos cuffed by his ankles to a radiator. The
     three men are on their second fifth of Cutty Sark swiped from
     the kitchen cupboard.

     Dos Santos sings a drunken Spanish version of "The
     Chattanooga Choo Choo" before slumping to his side and
     passing out.

     Bucky covers him with a blanket.

                          LEE
               Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the
               month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In
               three years I'll be working Central
               Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there
               wets his pants for fighters. Promised me
               the next spot he can wangle.

                          BUCKY
                   (not impressed)
               Impressive.

                          LEE
                   (not impressed either)
               Wanna hear something more impressive? My
               first twenty fights were stumblebums
               handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend
               saw you fight a couple times over at the
               Olympic. Says maybe you could take me.

     Lee gets up and wanders into the living room. From the
     kitchen Bucky watches Lee stare out at the flames.

                          BUCKY
               Whatta we do about the Mex?

                          LEE
               We'll take 'em in the morning.

                          BUCKY
               You'll take him.

                          LEE
               He's half yours, partner.

                          BUCKY
               He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.

                          LEE
                   (without turning)
               Someday.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     A CLOSE UP OF TOMAS DOS SANTOS' FACE

     screaming in silence.

     AS WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL

     Tomas Dos Santos dying in a large Plexiglas GAS CHAMBER.
     Bucky stands in the back of the room, forcing himself to
     watch. He can't stand it and leaves.

     IN THE FRONT ROW

     Lee also watches, elbows on knees and chin in hands. He can't
     stand it, either. He stays.

     IN THE HALLWAY AFTERWARDS

     Bucky watches from afar as men in suits shake Lee's hand and
     brush imaginary lint off of his BRAND NEW SERGEANT'S STRIPES.
     Their eyes meet briefly as Bucky retreats to daylight.

     Another TRIPLE CARBON FORM FILLED OUT ON THE CORONA...

     Transfer and Promotion...Sergeant Lee Blanchard...
     Highland Park Vice to Central Warrants...Effective
     10/14/46

     EXT. 2ND AND BEAUDRY - DAY

     An extremely bored Bucky Bleichert gives a man a speeding
     ticket and sends him on his way.

     EXT./INT. RADIO PATROL CAR - MOVING

     Bucky drives as a ROOKIE COP chatters in the seat next to
     him.

                          ROOKIE
               Yep, three years in the Canal Zone.
               Nothin' but skeeter bites and drunk
               fights over three-dollar skank tail...

     INT. THE CENTRAL MUSTER ROOM - DAY

     Bucky sits at his desk filling out a form as the rookie cop
     prattles on in the background.

                          ROOKIE
               ...fights over three-dollar skank tail...

     AN OLDER OFFICER

     walks by the rookie and rolls his eyes. Catching Bucky's
     look, the cop throws him a shadow punching one-two. Bucky
     smiles thinly. Returns to his paperwork. Then another cop
     passes by and breaks into a bob-and-weave. Bucky looks
     puzzled and annoyed.

     He grabs a third cop walking by (TOM JOSLIN).

                          BUCKY
               Somethin' up, Tommy?

                          TOM
               You, that's what.
                   (off Bucky's look)
               You know Lee Blanchard over at Central
               Warrants?

     Bucky nods.

                          TOM
               His partner's toppin' his twenty and
               goin' for early retirement. Word is the
               felony D.A.'s lookin' for a bright boy to
               fill the spot. Christ knows why but it's
               down to you and Johnny Vogel for the
               spot.

     Bucky takes a surreptitious peek across the room at JOHNNY
     VOGEL, fat, slick-hair and bad skin.

                          BUCKY
               His old man Fritzie's a Central Dick.

                          TOM
                   (chucking Bucky on the chin)
               But who'd look better when they bring back
               the boxing team, eh Buckaroo?

     Bucky shakes his head, dismissing the whole thing.

     INT. THE RADIO PATROL CAR - ANOTHER DAY

     Bucky drives on as the rookie talks and talks...

                          VOICE OVER
               Warrants was local celebrity as a cop.
               Warrants was plainclothes without a coat
               and tie, romance and a mileage per diem
               on your civilian car. Warrants was going
               after the real bad guys and not rousting
               winos and wienie waggers in front of the
               Midnight Mission.

     INT. BUCKY'S GARAGE - NIGHT

     Bucky hits a speed-bag, building up a sweat.

                          VOICE OVER
               I told myself I didn't care.

     He hits the bag faster and faster.

     INT. THE CENTRAL MUSTER ROOM - DAY

     A desk officer hands Bucky a note.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. CITY HALL - CHIEF OF DETECTIVES OFFICE - LATER

     A secretary leads Bucky into an office with CHIEF OF
     DETECTIVES THAD GREEN etched on the pebble glass door.

     Inside the office: Lee Blanchard, ASST. D.A. ELLIS LOEW, and
     CHIEF THAD GREEN. They all sit in matched leather chairs.

                          SECRETARY
               Officer Bleichert.

     She exits. An awkward silence.

                          LEE
                   (getting to his feet)
               Gentlemen, Bucky Bleichert. Bucky, Chief
               Thad Green, Deputy DA Ellis Loew.

     Bucky shakes their hands, nodding to each.  Chief Green
     gestures for him to sit.

                          CHIEF GREEN
               Read this aloud, Officer. It's running in
               Sunday's Times.

                          BUCKY
               "Before the war, the City of the Angels
               was graced with two local fighters, born
               and raised a scant five miles apart,
               pugilists with styles as different as
               fire and ice. Lee Blanchard was a
               bowlegged windmill of a leather slinger--

                          CHIEF GREEN
               Skip down to the fire and ice part.

                          BUCKY
                   (searching, finding)
               "Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice never fought each
               other, but a sense of duty brought them
               together in spirit, and both joined the
               Los Angeles Police Department." Blanchard
               cracked the baffling Boulevard-Citizens
               bank robbery case in 1939 and captured
               thrill-killer Tomas Dos Santos; Bleichert
               served with distinction during the '43
               Zoot Suit Wars--"

     A glance to Lee...

                          CHIEF GREEN
               Skip to the end.

                          BUCKY
               "Both men made great sacrifices to serve
               their city, and on Election Day, voters
               are going to be asked to do the same
               thing--vote on a five million dollar bond
               proposal to upgrade the LAPD's equipment
               and provide for an eight percent pay
               raise for all personnel. Keep in mind the
               examples of Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice. Vote
               "Yes" on Proposition B."

                          CHIEF GREEN
               Whattya think?

                          BUCKY
               Subtle.

     Blanchard and Green smile; Loew frowns.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Prop. B's looking like a loser right now.
               But if we can drum up some publicity we
               may he able to get it passed in the '47
               Special. We need to build up morale in
               the department.
               Impress voters with the quality of our
               men. Wholesome white boxers are a big
               draw, Bleichert. You know that.

     Bucky looks to Lee.

                          LEE
               Fire and Ice.

                          LOEW
               Ten rounds. The Academy Gym. Three weeks
               from now. Right before the election. All
               the gate to charity. After that, we bring
               back the interdivisional boxing team.
               Wholesome fighters.

                          LEE
               Wholesome.

                          CHIEF GREEN
               Are you in, Bucky?

                          LEE
               It's not like you'll last the ten rounds
               anyway.

     Bucky eyes Lee quickly, assessing his larger but slightly
     softer physique.

     All the remaining eyes are on him.

                          BUCKY
               I'm in.

     Back slaps and congratulations all around.

                          LOEW
               I'm betting on great things from you,
               Bleichert. And if I don't miss my bet we
               may be colleagues soon.

                          BUCKY
               Uh, yes sir.

     EXT. THE CITY HALL PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATEER

     Bucky exits and sees Lee leaning against an unmarked car
     talking with a striking woman in an auburn pageboy cut.

     Lee waves Bucky over.

                          LEE
               Bucky I'd like you to meet Kay Lake.

                          BUCKY
               Hello.

                          FAY
               I saw you fight a couple times. You won.

                          BUCKY
               I always won. You a fight fan?

                          KAY
               Lee used to drag me. I was taking somme
               art classes so I'd sketch the boxers.

     Lee puts his arm around her.

                          LEE
               Made me quit fighting the smokers. Didn't
               want me doin' the "vegetable shuffle."

     He staggers around like a punch-drunk fighter.

                          BUCKY
               I'll try not to hurt you.

     A flicker of anger in her eyes.

                          LEE
               Sure make Loew happy.

                          BUCKY
               He's got money on me, I gather?

                          LEE
               Seems that way.

                          BUCKY
               And if I win I get Warrants?

                          LEE
               Seems that way.

     Bucky shakes his head. Turns to Kay.

                          BUCKY
               What do you think of all this, Miss Lake?

                          KAY
               For moral reasons I hope the LAPD gets
               ridiculed for perpetrating this farce.
               For financial reasons I hope Lee wins.
               And for aesthetic reasons I hope you both
               look good with your shirts off.

     Bucky and Lee break into laughter. Bucky sticks out his hand.
     Lee takes it.

                          BUCKY
               Luck short of winning.

                          LEE
               You, too.

     Bucky tips his hat to Kay and turns to go.

                          KAY
               Luck, Dwight.

     He stops at hearing his real name. But he knows she's waiting
     to see his reaction so he keeps walking...

               Even the dicks in Ad Vice had suspended

               I was a local celebrity again.

     EXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - LINCOLN HEIGHTS - DAY

     Bucky pulls up in front of a small ugly house in a tired
     neighborhood. He exits the car carrying a cardboard box full
     of canned goods and old girlie magazines.

     ON THE PORCH OF THE HOUSE

     a bony old man sits in a broken chair, aiming a BB pistol at
     some balsa wood airplanes scattered in the yard.

     ON BUCKY'S FACE

     disgust and sadness.

     This is DOLPH BLEICHERT, Bucky's father. Bucky approaches,
     pulling a chair up next to his father. Up close it's even
     worse: white skin stretched tight over blue veins, yellow
     rimming his rheumy eyes. Flecks of dirt and vomit on a filthy
     shirt.

                          BUCKY
               Papa?

                          DOLPH
               Guten tag, Dwight.

                          BUCKY
               Speak English, papa.

                          DOLPH
               Englisch Schiesser! Amerikan Schiesser!

     He aims the BB gun and fires at an airplane: the gun's empty.

     Bucky enters the house. Half-eaten cans of beans on the
     dining room table, an entire legion of broken balsa wood
     airplane kits. Alley cats wander in and out of the kitchen,
     nosing their faces into open tuna fish cans...

     BACK ON THE PORCH

     Dolph leans on the porch rail. Bucky returns.

                          BUCKY
               Say something, Papa. Get me mad. Tell me
               how you can fuck this place up so bad in
               one month.

                          DOLPH
               Du, Dwight? Du?

                          BUCKY
               Speak...English. Papa, please.

     He searches his father's eyes for a response and gets none.

     He surveys the house again. Somewhere in the corner of his
     eye we see the glint of an idea...

     INSIDE THE HOUSE

     Bucky on the phone.

                          BUCKY
               ...He's had another stroke. If you could
               just come by and clean the place up and
               keep an eye on him for week or so...a
               hundred dollars is fine. No more than ten
               days. I promise. I do. Thank you.

     INT. THE POLICE BOXING GYM

     Bucky leans against a wall watching Lee spar. Studying him.
     Mentally fighting the sparring partner's fight.

                          VOICE OVER
               He was better than I thought. It made
               what came next easier.

     INT. A BANK - DAY

     Bucky sits at a desk with an assistant manager and fills out
     forms. The manager counts out approximately $4,500 in cash.
     Bucky slides him the forms. The manager slides him the cash.

     INT. THE GOOD LUCK BAR - NIGHT

     Bucky slides into a booth across from PETE LUKINS.

                          PETE
               So...I'm surprised but I'm not so
               surprised. I hear you been lookin' good.
               Better'n people think.

     Bucky pushes an envelope across to Pete. He looks in it.

                          PETE (cont'd)
               I guess what I hear is correct. Then
               you'll be wantin' to place this with
               Mickey Cohen's indie. He's got Blanchard
               2 to 1--

                          BUCKY
               I'm not bettin' on me, Pete.

                          PETE
                   (a beat)
               Oh.
                   (another beat)
               Then as a friend I feel it's my duty to
               tell you this: you better make it look
               good.

                          BUCKY
               Knockout between rounds eight and ten.

     Pete nods his head, thinking.

                          PETE
               Dragna's got a guy really sold on you.
               Even money. Best you're gonna get.

                          BUCKY
               Thanks, Pete.

     Pete sticks out his hand.

                          PETE
               Luck.

                          BUCKY
               Short of winning?

                          PETE
               Luck.

     Bucky takes his hand.

     INT. THE BOXING GYM - DAY

     Bucky takes apart his sparring partner with a series of
     lightning quick counterpunches.

                          VOICE OVER
               I'd almost finished the Police Academy
               when the background check turned up my
               father's German-American Bund membership.
               Pressured by the FBI goons to confirm my
               patriotism, I gave the Alien Squad Sam
               Murakawa, a guy I'd grown up with, in
               order to secure my LAPD appointment.

     EXT. DOLPH BLEICHERT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Bucky watches from across the street as AN OFF-DUTY NURSE
     tries to get Papa Bleichert to eat a sandwich.

                          VOICE OVER
               The old fuck never knew any better. Never
               knew what he cost me. Or Sammy, who'd
               died at Manzanar. I was a good fit in the
               snitch's jacket and with a little
               alteration I slipped easily into the
               whole suit.

     INT. THE BOXING GYM - DAY

     Bucky watches Lee spar. His quick eyes spying:

     --scar tissue over Lee's right eye

     --Lee dropping his left when throwing the right hook

     --Lee tucking his elbows too tight and opening up his ribcage

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               I had traded Warrants for a close-out on
               bad old debts, the eight grand I was
               gonna clear enough to maintain the old
               man in a good clean rest home for three
               years; the late round tank job enough to
               convince myself I wasn't a complete
               coward.

     INT. THE BOXING GYM - DAY

     Kay approaches Bucky as he studies Lee.

                          KAY
               At least he looks good with his shirt
               off.

     She waves to Lee between rounds. He blows a kiss back.

                          BUCKY
               Where's your sketch pad?

                          KAY
               I was never very good. Ended up with a
               degree in History. Masters. Lee's fight
               money paid for it.

                          BUCKY
               Education's an expensive habit to kick.
                   (beat)
               He shouldn't have quit fighting.

                          KAY
               I asked him to. Besides, catching
               animals gave him a sense of order. You
               have a girlfriend, Dwight?

                          BUCKY
               Saving myself for Rita Hayworth.

     A roar from the gym onlookers. Lee's sparring partner hits
     the deck, blood spraying from his mouth.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Quits fighting for you. Puts you through
               school. Quite a guy. Quite a pair.

                          KAY
                   (flirting)
               We're not getting married if that's what
               you're wondering.

                          BUCKY
               Why not? Shacking's against the regs.
               Probably cost him a stripe.

                          KAY
               I have to go, Dwight. Good luck tomorrow
               night.

                          BUCKY
               You didn't answer my question--

                          KAY
                   (a throwaway)
               Lee and I don't sleep together, Dwight.

     She keeps walking. He just stares...

     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A half-eaten steak and two beers gone. It's six hours later
     and Bucky's still thinking about Kay's exit line. Restless.
     He grabs his jacket.

     INT. HEARST BUILDING - HERALD-EXAMINER MORGUE - NIGHT

     Bucky flashes his badge to a late-night clerk who escorts him
     into the newspaper's morgue. Pulls a bound stack of newspaper 
     clippings and gives them to Bucky. He begins poring through
     them...

     A newspaper photo of a BANK shifts into live action:

     A GRAINY NEWSREEL-TYPE FLASHBACK (SLO-MO)

     An armored truck idles in front of the Boulevard-Citizens
     Bank. Three men dressed in guard uniforms run out of the
     front of the bank, an alarm keening in the background.

     Three police cars converge on the scene and a gun battle
     ensues... Two of the bank robbers are shot as the third man
     (the one carrying the money) jumps into the truck. The truck
     takes off, able to escape when someone from inside the truck
     throws open the doors and pushes the naked and bound
     legitimate guards out the back and into the line of
     pursuit...

                          VOICE OVER
               With no lead on the two escaped men, the
               heist quickly went from page one to page
               five. Two weeks later...

     A newspaper clipping headline: "Tip from Ex-boxer cop
     breaks B-C Bank Job"

     A still photo of Lee which becomes live action as...

     INT. A SMALL VENICE BEACH APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

     A younger Lee and four other cops tear apart a small flat. In
     a closet they find BANK GUARD UNIFORMS, BANK BAGS, and a
     small stash of MARIJUANA.

                          VOICE OVER
               One of Lee's snitches fingered Bobby
               DeWitt, a greasy little pimp with a yard
               long rap, as the brains behind the bank
               job.

                                                            CUT TO:

     FLASHBACK: A HATCHET FACED MAN (DEWITT) LED BY HANDCUFFS
     THROUGH A GIANT CROWD...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               DeWitt howled frame-up the entire trial,
               never ID'ing the driver or coughing up
               the dough, even after damning character
               testimony from some of his employees,
               including one Katherine Lake, formerly of
               Sioux Falls, South Dakota and looking to
               go straight.

     FLASHBACK: LEE LEADING KAY FROM THE COURTROOM, HAND ON HER
     ELBOW...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               DeWitt got ten to life at San Quentin;
               Lee got Kay, or maybe the other way
               around.

     BACK TO PRESENT: Bucky walks through downtown L.A., hands
     stuffed in his pockets like James Dean...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               They both got a few weeks in the gossip
               pages before Kay dove into her college
               education and Lee down the hero's road
               ending in Warrants and a shack job with a
               woman he loved but wouldn't touch...

     Bucky passes A WHORE on the corner, their eyes meet for a
     moment and he walks on.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               You come off a winning fight. Sweat-
               drenched, tasting blood, still wanting to
               go. The handbooks who made money on you
               bring you a girl. A pro, a semi-pro. You
               do it in the dressing room, or a hallway.
               The eleventh round of a ten round fight.
               And when you go back to an ordinary life,
               it's just weakness, a loss.

     Bucky turns back to give the whore a second look but she's gone.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               To a fighter, sex tastes like blood and
               resin and suture scrub. I wondered if
               some day that would ever be different.

                                                            CUT TO:

     A HAMMER HITTING A BELL

     and the fight is on.

     INSIDE THE PACKED ACADEMY GYM

     Cops and mobsters sit shoulder to shoulder, cigar smoke like
     L.A. haze as

     LEE CHARGES BUCKY, the big man trying to cut of the ring.
     Bucky engages, dodging Lee's thundering blows and peppering
     back with counterpunches...

     **The general fight storyline is this: a very even and brutal
     match see-sawing back and forth, Bucky doing all he can to
     make it into the middle rounds. Somewhere around the fourth
     or fifth round his competitive juices take over and he begins
     trying to win at all costs. The two men hurt each other
     badly, and in the eighth round it's anybody's fight.
     Bucky punches toe-to-toe with Lee, abandoning his strategy.
     Lee knocks Bucky out.

     INT. BUCKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Bucky lies in bed, radio playing jazz. He looks horrible--
     face swollen, lip split, stitches across his nose. He sips
     whiskey from a bottle through a straw.

     The phone rings and rings. He refuses to answer it...

     INT. A REST HOME - ANOTHER DAY

     Bucky, bruised but somewhat better, stands in the hallway of
     a very nice rest home. He surreptitiously watches his father
     as the old man tries to grab at a nurse.

     EXT. THE REST HOME - MINUTES LATER

     Pete Lukins waits outside on the porch for Bucky.

                          PETE
               Well?

                          BUCKY
               He'll catch on soon enough.

     The scene widens behind the two men and we see the sign on
     the facility:

     KING DAVID VILLA

     Jewish stars adorn the sign.

     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Bucky stands in front of his mirror clipping at his stitches
     with scissors. He hears a voice outside his window.

                          VOICE OVER
               Hey. Canvasback!

     Bucky recognizes the voice and goes to the window.

     EXT. THE COURTYARD - SAME

     Lee Blanchard, his own bruises fading, stands in the yard.

                          LEE
               You gonna hide in there another week?
               Ain't you bored yet?

                          BUCKY
               Gettin' there.

                          LEE
               Wanna work Warrants with me?

                          BUCKY
               What?

                          LEE
               Harrell's been callin' to tell you. You
               been hibernating--

                          BUCKY
               But I lost. Loew's deal--

                          LEE
               Don't you read the papers? The bond issue
               passed yesterday. Want the job, partner?

     Off Lee's devilish grin:

                          VOICE OVER
               Mister Fire. Mister Ice. The hero and the
               snitch.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. CENTRAL WARRANTS - MORNING

     A door marked "DETECTIVE'S MUSTER ROOM". Bucky, wearing his
     best SPORTS COAT AND SLACKS, pushes through the door.

     INSIDE THE MUSTER ROOM

     Full of the LAPD's plainclothes hotshots. All stand and give
     Bucky a standing ovation. Lee's there, too, playing to the
     crowd.

     On the blackboard at the front of the room: 8%!!!

     CAPTAIN JACK TIERNEY is at the podium.

                          TIERNEY
                   (as introduction)
               Officer Bleichert, the men of Central
               Dicks, Homicide, Ad Vice, Bunco, et
               cetera. I'm Captain Jack Tierney. You and
               Lee are the white men of the hour, so I
               hope you enjoyed your ovation. You won't
               get another one until you retire.

     Everyone laughs. Tierney raps the podium and speaks again.

                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
               Enough horseshit. This is the felony
               summary for the week ending November 14,
               1946. First, three liquor store
               stickups...

     Tierney begins the summary as Bucky's eyes wander around the
     room, taking in his new surroundings... Older men, coats and
     ties... He tunes back in...

                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
               And here's a collar'd please Cap'n Jack
               to no end. Sergeants Vogel, Koenig, have
               you read the SID memos on the Bunker Hill
               burglaries?

     FRITZ VOGEL AND BILL KOENIG, both hulking and unpleasant-
     looking (Fritzie being the elder version of his son Johnny).
     The two men shake their heads "no". Tierney disapproves.

                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
               Set of latents at the last break-in ID's
               one Maynard Coleman, two sodomy priors. A
               surefire baby raper. Highland Park's got
               four child sodomy unsolveds. Maybe he's
               our boy, maybe not. But between that and
               the B&E's I'd put Maynard as a high
               priority lamster right now. There's a
               list of his known associates on the
               bulletin board. Let's all take a look...

     INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - LATER

     The meeting's breaking up. A tall, elegant man (RUSS MILLARD)
     and a squat disheveled man (HARRY SEARS) approach Bucky.

                          RUSS MILLARD
                   (introducing himself)
               Russ Millard, homicides. Wife and kids
               thank you for the raise, Officer.

     Bucky smiles a dumb smile, not knowing what to say.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
                   (re the other man)
               My partner, Harry Sears.

                          HARRY
                   (stuttering)
               Y-y-y-yes.  Th-th-thanks Officer B-B-
               Bleichert.

     Before Bucky can answer ELLIS LOEW grabs him by the elbow and
     leads him away.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Officer Bleichert. Welcome to Central
               Warrants--

     When he gets him out of ear shot:

                          ELLIS LOEW (cont'd)
               You shouldn't have slugged with him. You
               were ahead on all three cards.

                          BUCKY
               The proposition passed, sir.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Yes but some of your patron's lost money.
               Play things smarter here. Don't blow this
               like you blew the fight.

     Bucky's about to respond when Lee saves him--

                          LEE
               Ready to roll, canvasback?

     He grabs Bucky and they head out the door.

     INT. LEE'S CAR - LATER

     Lee cruises them through downtown, rambling about the job
     description.

                          BUCKY
               Why'd you really quit fighting?

     He pulls the car into a parking lot of a Mexican restaurant.

                          LEE
                   (matter of fact)
               Benny Siegel bought out my contract,
               scared off my manager. Said he'd get me a
               shot at Joe Louis if I'd take two dives
               for him. I said no, joined the Department
               'cuz Jew syndicate boys won't kill cops.
               Anything else?

                          BUCKY
                   (as they exit the car)
               One more. What are we doin' here?

                          LEE
               While you were dancing with Ellis at
               muster I checked Maynard Coleman's KA's
               on the bulletin and recognized the name
               of a fence. Think he tends bar here...

     INSIDE THE RESTAURANT

     Lee and Bucky slide into a booth on either side of BRUNO
     ALBANESE, halfway through plate of huevos rancheros.

                          LEE
               Bruno Albanese?

                          BRUNO
               Who wants to know?

                          LEE
               Police officers, Bruno. Let's make this
               fast so I don't have to watch you eat.

     Lee slides the Maynard Coleman mug shot to Albanese.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               We know he sells to you and we don't
               care. Where is he?

     Albanese burps.

                          BRUNO
               Never seen 'em before.

     Lee sighs. And then grabs Bruno by the back of the neck and
     jams his face into the hot cheese and goo of his food.
     Bruno's arms flap back and forth as Lee drowns him in his
     food.

     Finally Lee shrugs and pulls Bruno's face out of his food,
     blood from his nose mixing with the grease of the enchiladas.

                          BRUNO
               Versailles apartments. Sixth and St.
               Andrews.

     EXT. THE VERSAILLES APARTMENTS - MINUTES LATER

     Lee and Bucky pull up and look for a parking spot just as
     MAYNARD COLEMAN trots down the front stairs and gets into a
     car.

                          BUCKY
               Right there!

     They ease the car back into traffic and follow Coleman's car
     from a safe distance. Bucky picks up the two-way radio. Lee
     gestures for him to put it back:

     Coleman's pulling into the parking lot of THE POLAR PALACE,
     an ICE SKATING RINK. They follow.

     Coleman exits his car, eyeing a group of kids carrying ice
     skates and heading into the Polar Palace. He follows them
     inside...

     The two men follow...

     INSIDE THE POLAR PALACE

     Children skate around on the ice with a giant polar bear
     suit. Lee and Bucky scan the area--not an adult in sight. Lee
     spots some stairs leading to the restrooms and gestures to
     Bucky, who hustles down them.

     ON THE STAIRCASE

     Maynard Coleman, carrying a stuffed bunny rabbit, walks up
     the stairs toward Bucky. Just as the two men pass Bucky PULLS
     HIS GUN and puts it to Coleman's head.

                          BUCKY
               Police officer. You're under arrest.

     Coleman throws his hands in the air; the bunny drops to the
     ground. Bucky cuffs Coleman and leads him up the stairs as
     Lee comes down from above.

     A small voice from below Bucky:

                          VOICE OVER
               Let go of him! Let go of him!

     Bucky looks down to see A SMALL BOY pounding on his leg. The
     kid's hysterical.

                          BOY
               Let go a my daddy! Daddy!

     The resemblance is unmistakable. Two generations of Okie
     white trash. Bucky continues marching Coleman the elder up
     the stairs as Lee snags the kid, both the father and the son
     crying like babies.

     INT. THE HALL OF JUSTICE JAIL - LATER

     Lee and Bucky fill out a release form for the desk officer.

     Bucky looks up to see BILL KOENIG and FRITZ VOGEL march by
     with barely a nod.

                          LEE
               They got here fast.
                   (off Bucky's look)
               The confession.

     INT. CENTRAL WARRANTS - LATER

     Lee finishes typing up a report on a manual typewriter while
     Bucky talks on the phone. He hangs up as Fritz Vogel and Bill
     Koenig return.

                          LEE (cont'd)
                   (re the two meatheads)
               Play nice. They've got juice with Loew.

                          KOENIG
                   (stupid and proud)
               He confessed. Kiddie porks and the
               burglaries. Fritzie says we're all
               getting commendations.

     Bucky's POV: both Koenig and Vogel have small bits of
     blood spattered on their white dress shirts.

                          VOGEL
               Ellis loves the kid angle.

                          LEE
               You talk to Ellis?

                          VOGEL
               He's only "Ellis" to lieutenants on up,
               Blanchard.

                          LEE
               Least I don't call him "kike".

                          VOGEL
                   (flushing)
               C'mon, Billy.

     The two men push by with barely a nod in Bucky's direction.
                          BUCKY
               Play nice. Hm.

                          LEE
               Shitbirds.

     HARRY SEARS approaches their cubicle. He looks a little
     drunk. (And when you get to know him you'll realize that when
     he's drunk he doesn't stutter.)

                          HARRY
               Russ says good collar today.

     The men nod thanks. Bucky notes the lack of stutter and the
     presence of a liquor smell.

                          HARRY (cont'd)
               And Lee--I heard something you oughta
               know--I was over at County Parole--Bobby
               DeWitt got an "A" number. He'll be
               released to LA around mid-January.

     Lee bobs his head slightly as Harry moves off. He's disturbed
     but covers quickly--

                          LEE
               You like pot roast?

     EXT. A BEAUTIFUL DECO HOME - NIGHT

     Lee leads Bucky up the walk. Bucky's impressed with the house.

                          LEE
               Don't say anything to Kay about DeWitt.
               It'll upset her.

     INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     A doll's house of Danish Modern furniture, fresh flowers and
     polished mahogany wainscoting.

                          BUCKY
               You takin' bribes, partner?

                          LEE
               Fight stash.

     Kay arrives from the kitchen, smiling broadly at Bucky. She
     takes his hand.

                          KAY
               Hello, Dwight. Glad you could make it.

     And holds his hand about two beats than usual...

     INT. THE DINING ROOM - LATER

     Kay brings in the food. Bucky walks around the room, checking
     things out.

                          FAY
               Fairy tale come true, isn't it?

                          BUCKY
               Hm?

                          FAY
               The house. You and Lee partners. Fairy
               tale.

                          BUCKY
               Can't say I believe in fairy tales.

                          KAY
               Then you've never really had to. Lucky
               man. (beat) Lee! Dinner!

     INT. THE DINING ROOM - LATER

     The food is finished. So is a bottle of champagne. Kay pops
     another one, hitting Lee in the chest with the cork. Everyone
     laughs hysterically. They fill the glasses again.

                          LEE
               A toast...To Proposition B!

                          BUCKY
               To the Bleichert/Blanchard rematch!
               Bigger than Louis/Schmeling!

                          KAY
               To fairy tales!

                          BUCKY
                   (abruptly, drunk)
               To...us!

     He's referring to all three of them--something which doesn't
     escape or displease anyone. They clink glasses and drink.

     ANOTHER LAPD TRIPLE CARBON INCIDENT REPORT:

     JANUARY 10, 1947...Raymond "Junior" Nash...

     INT. ELLIS LOEW'S OFFICE - MORNING

     Lee and Bucky enter the Loew's inner sanctum where they are
     joined by Russ Millard and Harry Sears. A stack of L.A.

     Heralds sit on the desk, the top one folded to the headline:
     "Criminal Division's DA to try for Boss's Job in '48
     Primary?"

     Bucky's look of disgust says it all just as Loew walks into
     the room--

                          LEE
               Goin' into politics, Ellis? Give us a
               quote. (as FDR) "The only thing to fear
               is fear itself."

     Loew smiles thinly and hands over a photo and a rap sheet.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Here's the man to fear.

     ANGLE ON THE MUG SHOT AND RAP SHEET:

     RAYMOND "JUNIOR" NASH:  Statutory raps, armed robbery,
     felony mayhem...Texas State Prison...Alcatraz...

     The cops are impressed.

                          BUCKY
               Give us the good news. He's in LA and
               actin' uppity?

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Witnesses made him at a stickup near
               Leimert Park over the weekend. Pistol-
               whipped an old lady. She died about an
               hour ago.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Anything common in the sex beefs?

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Negro girls. Young ones. All the
               complainants have been colored.

                          LEE
               Seeya in Leimert Park.

     As they walk out...

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Sergeant Blanchard? Try not to kill the
               man. I'd like to do it in court.

     Lee flashes a demon smile.

     EXT. CRENSHAW BOULEVARD - DAY - LATER

     A montage of shots as Lee and Bucky cruise south on Crenshaw 
     Boulevard. The beginning of the post-war boom.

                          VOICE OVER
               From November through the New Year, Lee
               and I captured a total of eleven hard
               felons, eighteen traffic warrantees and
               three parole and probation absconders...

     On Crenshaw's northern end, once grand and now dilapidated
     houses in the process of demolition, their faces replaced by
     giant billboards advertising department stores, jumbo
     shopping centers and movie theaters.

                          VOICE OVER
               After tours of duty, Lee and I would go
               to the house and find Kay. Sometimes she
               made dinner for us, other times the three
               of us would go dancing, or see a flick.

     Southbound, older wooden structures looking more and more
     unkempt. Empty lots...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Always she'd be there, never in between
               us, but always in the middle. It was the
               best time of my life.

     EXT./INT. THE CAR - A FILLING STATION - CONTINUOUS

     Lee pulls the car into the parking lot. Jumping out of the
     car--

                          LEE
               This grand tour stuff's for shit. I'm
               callin' in some favors.

     He heads to a payphone and beings pumping coins into it.

     BACK IN THE CAR - MINUTES LATER

     Lee gets back in the car. He's pale, sweating.

                          LEE
               Got a tip. Snitch a mine says he's
               shacking with some poon in a crib near
               Slauson and Hoover.

                          BUCKY
               It's all colored down there--

                          LEE
               We fuckin' roll.

     He pulls out.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT./INT. THE CAR - HOOVER AVE - MINUTES LATER

     Lee and Bucky roll up on four men loitering on a corner.
     Three are black and one is white.

                          LEE
               Hopheads. Let's shake 'em for an address
               or a name.

     As Lee and Bucky exit the car, the four men immediately start
     the slow walk to the wall, arms over their heads. The white
     guy glances at Lee:

                          WHITE HOPHEAD
               What the---Blanchard?

                          LEE
               Shut up, shitbird.

     Lee pushes him closer to the wall and starts frisking him.
     Bucky starts with one of the other men, pulling out some
     marijuana cigarettes.

     Out of the corner of his eye, Bucky sees the black man
     closest to Lee reaches for something shiny in his belt--

                          BUCKY
               Partner!

     Bucky pulls his .38...

     THE WHITE GUY swings around and LEE SHOOTS HIM twice in the
     face--

     THE FIRST BLACK MAN pulls a SHIV free and BUCKY SHOOTS HIM in
     the neck--

     ANOTHER OF THE MEN goes for his trousers, fumbling for
     something as BUCKY SHOOTS HIM THREE TIMES.

                          LEE
               Bucky duck!

     Bucky hits the cement and gets an upside down view of Lee and
     the last man drawing guns on each other--Lee's three shots
     cutting down the man before he can fire his tiny derringer.

     Bucky pulls himself to his feet, stumbling past the blood-
     covered sidewalk and vomits in the gutter.

     FROM THE DISTANCE: THE SOUND OF SIRENS.

     Bucky pulls out his badge and pins it to his jacket pocket.
     Behind him, Lee is busy turning the dead men's pockets inside
     out--scattering shivs and reefers onto the sidewalk away from
     the blood.

     All the while Lee cries like a baby.

     INT. THE 77TH ST. DETECTIVES' STATION - LATER

     Bucky and a Detective exit a de-briefing room. Bucky looks
     worn but composed.

                          DETECTIVE
               Thank you for your time, Officer. And
               your police work, as well.

     They pass another de-briefing area where Lee sits with
     another Detective. Lee looks terrible, muttering and
     shivering.

                          DETECTIVE (cont'd)
               Your partner's taking this hard.

                          BUCKY
               He knew one of the guys. Baxter Fitch.
               Busted him once for loitering. Sort of
               liked the guy.

     The detective nods sympathetically.

     EXT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Lee and Bucky walk up the front steps where they're met by
     Kay. She runs to Lee and embraces him.

                          KAY
               Oh baby. Oh babe.

     She escorts him into the house. Bucky sees a newspaper on the
     front porch railing. The evening edition of The Mirror.

     "Boxer Cops in Gun Battle. Four Crooks Dead."

     Publicity boxing photos accompany a full-page article. Bucky
     begins to read it when he hears from inside:

                          LEE
               Leave me alone! You'll never fucking
               understand--

     A door slam. Soon after the sound of Lee's motorcycle roaring
     off... After a beat Kay comes outside and sits down next to
     Bucky.

                          BUCKY
               He knew one of the guys.

     She nods.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               It was them or us.

     She nods again.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Tomorrow's off-duty so treat him nice--

                          KAY
               Bobby DeWitt gets out in a week, Dwight.
               We're on edge. He swore at the trial he
               was going to kill Lee.

                          BUCKY
               We can take care of Bobby DeWitt.

                          KAY
               Lee's scared. You don't know Bobby.

                          BUCKY
               I know as much as I need to know.

     Kay gives him a look: that's what you think. She gets up and
     goes inside. Not knowing what to do, Bucky continues reading
     the paper.

     INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - LATER

     Bucky wanders inside, obviously fidgety and not wanting to go
     home. He putters around their living room. From the back of
     the house Bucky hears the sound of A SHOWER RUNNING.

     Bucky walks back to the bathroom, drawn there by the sound of
     the drumming water. The bathroom door is open, an invitation.

     He stops at the threshold of the bathroom. His POV:

     Kay stands in the shower, curtain open for Bucky's benefit.
     She faces him and he takes in the view of her nakedness.

     Her attitude is not one of seduction, however, her expression
     passive and fixed even when their eyes meet. She pirouettes
     for him, showing:

     A SERIES OF OLD KNIFE SCARS CRISS-CROSSING HER BACK FROM
     THIGH TO SPINE.

     The history of Bobby DeWitt.

     Bucky backs away, retreating as he chokes back tears.

     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - MORNING

     Bucky's awakened by the phone ringing. He pulls the receiver
     off the cradle but leaves it on the nightstand. From the
     receiver he barely hears:

                          LEE
               Rise and shine partner!

     Bucky grabs the phone.

                          BUCKY
               Lee? You okay?

                          LEE
               Sure. Ran Mulholland at a hundred and
               ten. Played house with Kay all day
               yesterday. Feel like doing some police
               work?

                          BUCKY
               Keep going.

                          LEE
               Junior Nash's got a fuck pad on Norton
               and Coliseum.

     EXT. THE CORNER OF COLISEUM AND NORTON - SOON AFTER

     Bucky and Lee pull up to a mangy apartment building.

     INT. RAYMOND NASH'S ROOM - SOON AFTER

     They push the door open to reveal a filthy little flop
     littered with muscatel short dogs and used rubbers.

                          LEE
               Okie trash.

     They poke around for a minute, finding nothing. The smell is
     awful. Bucky goes to a window and pulls it open.

     HIS POV OUT THE WINDOW:

     IN A VACANT LOT ACROSS THE WAY

     A cluster of uniformed cops and men in civilian clothes stare
     at something in the weeds. A CORONER'S VAN parks next to
     three black and whites and two detectives' sedans.

                          BUCKY
               Lee.

     Lee goes to the window.

                          LEE
               Is that Millard and Sears?

     An LAPD PHOTO VAN pulls up next.

     Lee and Bucky sprint out of the room.

     EXT. THE VACANT LOT - 39TH AND NORTON - SECONDS LATER

     Photo men have already begun fanning out and taking photos.
     Bucky sees Harry Sears take a shot from a hip flask in full
     view of other officers. Lee and Bucky elbow their way to the
     front and see:

     The nude, mutilated body of a young woman, cut in half at the
     waist. Another wide cut down her center reveal an empty
     cavity--her organs have been removed.

     Her face has been bashed in and her mouth cut ear to ear in a
     leering smile.

     Even the experienced cops are rattled by the scene. They
     point and whisper and generally begin to fall into disbelief
     and disorder when

     RUSS MILLARD

     whistles harshly with his fingers in his mouth.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Before this gets out of hand let's put
               the kibosh on something. If this gets a
               lot of publicity we're going to get a lot
               of confessions. So we keep some things
               quiet. This girl was disemboweled. You
               keep this information to yourselves. Not
               your wives, not your girlfriends, no
               other officers.

     The men all nod, coming together as Millard takes control.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
               No reporters view the body. You photo
               men, take your pictures now. Coroner's
               men, you put a sheet on the body as soon
               as they're done. Set up a perimeter six
               feet back. Any reporter crosses it,
               arrest him.
                   (noticing Bucky)
               Bleichert. What are you doing here?
               Where's Blanchard?

     Bucky indicates Lee, crouched down by the body taking notes.

                          BUCKY
               Nash is renting a room in that building
               over there.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Blood on the premises?

                          BUCKY
               No. This isn't him.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               The lab'll be the judge of that.

     Millard and Bucky look dawn the street to see cars swinging
     onto Norton, beelining for the commotion. Reporters and
     photographers begin pouring out of their cars, quickly coming
     up against a line of cops keeping them from the body.

     Bucky makes his way over to Lee, unable to stop staring at
     the body.

                          BUCKY
               Hey. Junior Nash, remember?

                          LEE
               He didn't do this.

                          BUCKY
               No. He beat an old woman to death. That's
               why he's our priority warrantee.

                          LEE
               Not anymore.

                          BUCKY
               This ain't ours, partner--

                          LEE
                   (on edge)
               It is now, partner.

     EXT. THE CRIME SCENE - LATER

     Too sheet-covered stretchers are shoved into the coroner's
     wagon. The doors slam shut and the car pulls away.

                                                            CUT TO:

     RUSS MILLARD DIVIDING A STREET ATLAS INTO FOOTBEATS

     as fifteen officers (including Lee and Bucky) wait for their 
     assignment.

     A MONTAGE OF QUESTIONING

     Cops ring doorbells throughout Leimert Park:

                          OFFICER
                   (to an old woman)
               Have you heard female screams...

                          BUCKY
                   (to an off-duty serviceman)
               ...anyone discarding women's clothing?

                          LEE
                   (to a little kid)
               ...seen anyone in the lot on 39th...

                          BUCKY
                   (to a housewife)
               ...and what about this man?
                   (holds out a photo of Junior
                    Nash)

     To all of these questions a big fat "no".

     INT. THE OLYMPIC BOXING ARENA - NIGHHT

     Bucky watches two Mexican bantamweights beat each other
     bloody. An EMPTY SEAT next to him. Irritated, he gets up and
     leaves.

     ENT. 39TH AND NORTON - NIGHT - LATER

     Bucky gets out of his car and finds Lee standing inside the
     crime scene rope watching lab techs poke around in the weeds.
     The entire area is lit up by arclights, illuminating the two
     quicklime outlines of the body parts.

                          BUCKY
               You were supposed to meet me at the
               fights tonight, remember?

                          LEE
               Priority. Remember.

                          BUCKY
               Priority for the Bureau. Not for us.

                          LEE
               Nice white girl gets snuffed. Gotta show
               the voters they did the right thing
               passing the bond issue. It's a showcase.
               It's A-plus, Buck. We don't miss this.

                          BUCKY
               We've had enough headlines for the week.

     Lee points to the body outline. His hand shakes a bit and
     maybe for the first time we sense he's wired on something.

                          LEE
               With or without you, partner.

     Bucky shakes his head and begins walking away.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               With or without you.

                          BUCKY
               I heard you.

     INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - NEXT DAY

     Bucky enters a mob scene. One cop holds up a front page
     headline: "Hunt Werewolf's Den in Torture Slaying"

     Along a bench, five derelict-looking men are manacled to a
     bench. A cop walks by, notes Bucky's confusion:

                          OFFICER
               Confessors.

     Just then the interrogation room door opens and Bill Koenig
     leads a doubled-over fat man out of the door.

                          KOENIG
               He didn't do it.

     A couple officers clap satirically at their desks.

                          BUCKY
                   (to another cop)
               Blanchard?

                          OFFICER
               In with Loew.(beat) And reporters.

     Off Bucky's concerned look we

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. ELLIS LOEW'S OFFICE - MORNING

     Bucky walks in to see Loew holding a press conference, Lee
     dressed in a suit and sitting at his side.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               ...and the heinous nature of this killing
               makes it imperative to catch this fiend
               as soon as possible. A number of
               specially trained officers, including Mr.
               Fire and his partner Mr. Ice...

     ON BUCKY'S FACE

     Disbelief. Disgust.

     BACK IN THE WARRANTS CUBICLE - LATER

     Lee catches up with a pissed off Bucky.

                          BUCKY
               You got us detached?

                          LEE
               Slow and easy, Bucky. First I gave Loew a
               memo saying Nash blew our jurisdiction--

                          BUCKY
               You did what?

                          LEE
               It's all right. The APB still stands.
               We've got the pad staked. He's covered.

     Bucky's face says he's not sold on Lee's reasoning.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               One week. Just one week. After that, it's
               back to Junior. I promise.

     Bucky studies Lee's resolve; he relents.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               Copacetic.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. PATHOLOGY ROOM - LATER

     Antiseptic white with metallic slab tables. Two objects
     covered in sheets lay on the table.

     Bucky, Lee, Russ Millard and Harry Sears sit on benches
     facing the table. THE CORONER and a STENOGRAPHER NUN stand
     over the body. The coroner pulls the sheets off.

                          LEE
               Jesus, Bucky.

                          CORONER
               On gross pathology, we have a female
               Caucasian between sixteen and thirty.
               Cadaver is presented in two halves with
               bisection level with the umbilicus.

     The nun scribbles furiously to keep up. The officers are torn
     between staring at their shoes and at the body.

                          CORONER (cont'd)
               ...Through-and through laceration from
               both mouth corners...no visible signs of
               neck bruises...massive depressed skull
               fractures...Inspection of upper half
               abdominal cavity reveals no free-flowing
               blood. Intestines, stomach, liver and
               spleen removed.

     The doctor stops to allow the nun time to catch up. Russ
     Millard clears his throat.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Is it...all right to smoke, doctor?

                          CORONER
               She's not going to mind.

     Both Russ and Harry light up.

                          CORONER (cont'd)
               Lower half of the cadaver reveals removal
               of reproductive organs...Both legs broken
               at the knee, and healing, light lash
               marks on the upper back and shoulders...

     The door opens and a police officer enters, handing a sheet
     of paper to Millard and speaking to him briefly. Millard
     reads the sheet and hands it to Harry, who then hands it to
     Lee.

                          LEE
                   (reading)
               Bingo.

     He hands it to Bucky.

     The note: "Girl ID'd as Elizabeth Ann Short, DOB
     7/29/24, Medford, Mass."

     The coroner steps back from the table.

                          CORONER
               Questions?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               What's your best guess?

                          CORONER
               Here's what she wasn't. She wasn't raped,
               she wasn't pregnant, dried semen
               indicates voluntary intercourse within
               the last week...She took what I'd call a
               gentle whipping in the last ten days...In
               terms of the nitty-gritty...She was
               probably tortured with a knife for thirty-
               six to forty-eight hours before death.
               The cause of which is either the mouth
               wound or more likely she was beaten to
               death with something like a baseball bat.

                          LEE
               What about her insides?

                          CORONER
               They came out after death. Then I'd say
               he drained the blood from the body and
               washed it clean, probably in a bathtub.

                          LEE
               Did the guy know anything about medicine
               or anatomy?

                          CORONER
               Maybe. Probably not a surgeon type--but
               that doesn't rule out veterinary
               training, biological training, or my
               Pathology for Beginners class at UCLA.
               Has she got a name yet?

     The cops look to each other, hesitant to speak her name.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Elizabeth Short.

                          CORONER
                   (saluting heaven)
               God love you, Elizabeth.
                   (to Millard)
               Russell, when you get the son of a bitch
               who did this to her, give him a kick in
               the balls and tell him it's from
               Frederick D. Newbarr, M.D. Now all of you
               get out of here, I've got a date with a
               jumper suicide in ten minutes.

     INT. CENTRAL DIVISION BULLPEN - LATER

     Jack Tierney posts mug shots of Elizabeth Short as Russ,
     Harry, Lee and Bucky look over his shoulder. (In the
     background we can hear the by-now constant droning of Ellis
     Loew to reporters, both in person and over the phone)

                          CAPTAIN JACK
               Cops popped her in '43. Santa Barbara.
               Underage drinking. Other than that she's
               clean. Four sisters. Parents divorced.
               Father's here in LA. Hear he sold some
               old portrait photos of her to the Herald.

     Russ makes a noise of disgust.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               How many confessions so far?

                          CAPTAIN JACK
               Eighteen.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Double that by morning. More if Loew got
               the press excited with his purple prose.

                          LOEW
                   (he's been eavesdropping)
               I'd say my prose fits the crime,
               Lieutenant.

     Reveal Loew with Koenig and Fritz Vogel behind him.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Too much publicity is a hindrance, Ellis.
               If you were a policeman you'd know that.

     Loew flushes and gives Millard a dark look.

                          ELLIS LOEW
                   (to Tierney)
               Captain have you sent men to talk to the
               victim's father?

                          CAPTAIN JACK
               Not yet, Ellis.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               How about Vogel and Koenig?

     Tierney looks to Millard. The second in command shakes his
     head ever so slightly. We understand that even though he's
     second in command to Jack he's in charge.

                          CAPTAIN JACK
               Aaah, Russ, who do you think we should
               send?

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. WILSHIRE DISTRICT - DUSK

     A garage apartment at the rear of a big Victorian house. Lee
     and Bucky amble up and ring the buzzer.

     A skinny man (CLEO SHORT) in his fifties opens the door,
     eyeing them narrowly.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Cops, huh?

     He leads them inside. The apartment resembles its resident,
     soiled, worn and ugly.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               I've got an alibi, just in case you think
               I did it. Tighter than a crab's ass, and
               that is air tight.

     The two cops sit down, sizing up his hostility.

                          BUCKY
               I'm Detective Bleichert, Mr. Short. This
               is Sergeant Blanchard. We'd like to
               express our condolences for the loss of
               your daughter.

                          CLEO SHORT
               I know who you are. Neither of you'da
               lasted a round with Gentleman Jim
               Jeffries.
               (beat) As for Betty, c'est la vie. She
               called the tune, she paid the piper.
               (beat) You wanna hear my alibi?

                          LEE
               Since you're so anxious to tell it.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Johnny on the spot at my job. Twenty-
               seven straight hours. Refrigerator
               repairman. Twenty-seven straight and the
               last seventeen overtime. Call my boss.
               He'll alibi me up tighter than a popcorn
               fart, and that's air tight.

                          BUCKY
               When was the last time you saw your
               daughter?

                          CLEO SHORT
               Betty came west in '43 with stars in her
               eyes. I promised her three squares and a
               five-spot if she kept the house tidy.

     The cops look around at the squalor.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Gave her the boot in July. She moved to
               Santa Barbara. Sent me a postcard couple
               weeks later. Some soldier beat her up
               bad. Last I heard from her.

                          BUCKY
               Was that soldier her boyfriend?

     The old man lets out a hoot.

                          CLEO SHORT
               They were all her boyfriends! Not so ugly
               and wearing a uniform, can't go wrong
               there. Betty believed in quantity before
               quality.

                          LEE
               You calling your own daughter a tramp?

                          CLEO SHORT
               Got five daughters. One bad apple ain't
               so bad.

     Lee's about to burst. Bucky motions for him to take a walk.
     Lee goes through the den into the bathroom. From his view
     Bucky can see Lee chase a couple pills with a glass of
     water...

                          BUCKY
               Any names, Mr. Short?

                          CLEO SHORT
               Tom, Dick, Harry. Don't matter.
                   (he drifts for a moment)
               Said she was looking for movie work
               but...just paraded the Boulevard in those
               black get-ups of hers.

     Lee returns to the room.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Who wouldn't get herself killed doin'
               that? Who? Who wouldn't?

     EXT. CLEO SHORT'S APARTMENT - MINUTES LATER

     The two men walk out, disgusted.

                          LEE
               Jesus fuck. We just got handed the entire
               U.S. Armed forces as suspects.

                          BUCKY
               Flip to see who writes it up?

                          LEE
               I'm staking Nash's pad for the night. See
               if we get any strange drive-bys at the
               murder sight. Do me a favor and drop in
               on Kay. She's worried about me.

                          BUCKY
               She's a smart woman.

     INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Bucky opens the front door to find Kay reading a book on the
     couch. She doesn't even look up.

                          KAY
               Hi, Dwight.

                          BUCKY
               How'd you know it was me?

                          KAY
               Lee stomps, you tread lightly.

     Bucky appreciates her subtext.

                          BUCKY
               Lee's--

                          KAY
               Let me guess...Lee's up all night--
               probably on Benzedrine again--working
               that poor girl's murder--

     She says this as fact, not judgement. She knows him.

                          KAY
               You're worried about him. And he's
               worried about me.
                   (beat)
               But who's worried about you? Is that left
               for me?

                          BUCKY
               No need for that.

                          KAY
               For such a cautious man you're quite a
               hardcase.

                          BUCKY
               It's just...He's done a lot for me.

     Kay smiles, sweeps her arms around the perfect living room as
     if to reinforce to Bucky all Lee's done for her.

     The point is not lost on him.

     She crosses to him and kisses him softly on the cheek.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               Good night.

     INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky sits at their kitchen table, eating a ham sandwich with
     a glass of milk and filling out the police reports.

     INT. THE HOMICIDE BULLPEN - MORNING

     Bucky walks in reading the Herald front page: A picture of
     Elizabeth Short in a striking black dress. Underneath:"The
     Black Dahlia".

     He stops at a room where two detectives are sorting through
     a steamer trunk full of letters and assorted personal effects.

                          RUSS MILLARD (O.S.)
                   (re trunk)
               Found it in storage down at the railway.
               Carbons of mash notes to sailors.
               Hundreds of 'em.

     Bucky shows him the newspaper.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Thank our friend Bevo Means at the
               Herald. Bevo's painting Betty and her
               black dress like some actress in that
               Alan Ladd movie, The Blue Dahlia. Should
               triple our confessions.

                          BUCKY
               Great.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
               Hollywood will fuck you when no else
               will. What do you think?

                          BUCKY
               I think I want to go back to Warrants.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               No dice. You're a bright penny and I want
               you here.
                   (hands him a piece of paper)
               Betty's last known residences and KA's.
               Go to University Station and pick up Bill
               Koenig. Fritzie's sick. Keep Bill on a
               tight leash, and you write the report
               because Billy's practically illiterate.

                          BUCKY
               Lieutenant--

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Call me Russ and get out of here.

     Millard gestures for him to leave.

     EXT. AN APARTMENT HOUSE - LATER

     Bucky and Koenig walk up to the steps of an apartment house.

                          BUCKY
               How do you want to play this, Sarge?

                          KOENIG
               Fritzie usually does the talking and I
               stand back up.
                   (re a leather sap in his belt)
               Muscle job?

                          BUCKY
               Let's try talk job.

     Bucky checks names on the doorbells against a couple names on
     his piece of paper. He stops at "S. Saddon".

     INT. THE HALLWAY UPSTAIRS - LATER

     Bucky knocks on the door.

                          BUCKY
               Miss Saddon?

     A young woman dressed in a metallic Egyptian costume opens
     the door.

                          SHERYL
               You the driver from RKO?

                          BUCKY
               Police.

     The woman shuts the door. Seconds later the TOILET FLUSHES.
     She returns and opens it again.

                          SHERYL
               If this is about those jaywalking--

                          BUCKY
               It's about Elizabeth Short.

                          SHERYL
               I did all this on the phone this morning.
               Nine thousand questions about Betty's
               nine thousand boyfriends and I don't
               remember any of the names. Can I go now?
               The extras truck is due any minute.

                          BUCKY
               How about you sit dawn and answer my
               questions or I bust you for the reefer
               you flushed.

     She lets him in and sits defiantly.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               First question. Does a...
                   (re to his paper)
               Linda Martin or a Marjorie Graham live
               here?

                          SHERYL
               That's Betty's other place. DeLongpre and
               Orange.

                          BUCKY
               She moved around quite a bit. You know
               why? Was somebody threatening her?

                          SHERYL
               Betty's problem wasn't enemies. It was
               too many friends.

                          BUCKY
               I've gathered that. Let's change the
               subject.

                          SHERYL
               How 'bout "the world of high finance"?

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               How about movies? You girls are all
               tryin' to break in, right?

                          SHERYL
                   (re her extras costume)
               I'm in mister.

                          BUCKY
               Congratulations. What about Betty?

                          SHERYL
               Maybe once. Maybe not. 'Round
               Thanksgiving she showed up bragging about
               gettin' her big break...Had one of those
               viewfinders around her neck? But who
               knows where she really got it. Betty had
               a tendency to--

                          BUCKY
               ...stretch the truth?

                          SHERYL
               Lie.

     A CAR HORN HONKS. Bucky walks to the window and looks
     outside: A FLATBED TRUCK FULL OF CLEOPATRAS waits.

                          BUCKY
               Your ride's here--

     But she's already gone.

     INT. THE CAR - MOVING - HOLLYWOOD - CONTINUOUS

     They cruise to the next address.

                          KOENIG
               What'd the cooze say 'bout me?

     Bucky just stares at him; the guy's an idiot.

     EXT./INT. DELONGPRE APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

     Two men lounge on the stoop. Koenig gives them the eye as he
     passes.

     Bucky checks his piece of paper against the doorbells again.
     Finds "M. Graham" but no Linda Martin.

                          KOENIG
               I'm bored.

                          BUCKY
               This'll just take a minute.

                          KOENIG
               I'm gonna take those two guys outside.
               Maybe they knew the cooze--

                          BUCKY
               I'll handle 'em Sarge--

                          KOENIG
               No! I'm gonna do it! (beat) Now what do I
               roust 'em about?

                          BUCKY
               I dunno. Ask 'em anything. Alibis. See if
               Betty ever engaged in prostitution...

     Koenig goes running outside. Bucky shakes his head.

     INT. A COMMUNAL SITTING ROOM - LATER

     Marjorie Graham sits on a couch with a dog-eared back issue
     of Photoplay in her hands. She's mild but well-traveled.

                          MARJORIE
               ...Betty had this gift, you see. She was
               so sweet and eager to please...a bit
               dumb, maybe. But she'd do anything to be
               liked, become whatever you wanted her to
               be. She'd walk like you, or talk like
               you...but she wasn't...she was still her.

                          BUCKY
               Did she ever tell you she was in a movie?
               Sometime around November?

                          MARJORIE
               Sure. She had this viewfinder and showed
               it around to all the guys. Said it was
               from the director. A co-starring role.

                          BUCKY
               Did she say what it was?

                          MARJORIE
               Once she said it was for Fox. Another
               time Paramount. I think she was just
               fibbing. You know, for the boys.

                          BUCKY
               Do you remember the names of any of the
               guys?

                          MARJORIE
               Don and Harold--sitting outside. She
               dated both of 'em once or twice. Other
               than that...I just...didn't really pay
               attention to who she was with.

     Marjorie looks down, fidgeting.

                          BUCKY
               What is it? You can tell me.

                          MARJORIE
               Well...Right before she moved out...l saw
               her and Linda...

                          BUCKY
               Linda Martin?

                          MARJORIE
               Yeah. Her and Linda Martin--talking to
               this older woman up on the Boulevard. She
               had a man's suit and short hair like a
               man...Only that one time...

                          BUCKY
               Are you saying the woman was a lesbian?

     Marjorie nods yes.

     Bucky's about to press her for more when Bill Koenig barges
     in, all sweaty.

                          KOENIG
               Them guys talked. Said the stiff peddled
               her twat when she got strapped bad. I
               called it in. Mr. Loew said to keep it
               zipped cuz it don't look as good.

     Bucky looks at Marjorie. Back to Koenig.

                          BUCKY
               Take their statements, Bill. I've got a
               little more here.

     Bill disappears back to the porch.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Linda Martin's room?

     INT. LINDA MARTIN'S ROOM - LATER

     Bucky pushes open the room and finds it empty. He checks the
     closet. Empty.

     Bucky runs his hand under the bed. Finds something and pulls
     it out. A small red vinyl purse. He opens the purse. Inside
     is an ID. He shows it to Marjorie.

                          MARJORIE
               That's her. God...She's only fifteen.

                          BUCKY
                   (re card)
               Lorna Martikova. Omaha, Nebraska.
               Runaway. When'd you see her last?

                          MARJORIE
               This morning. I told her I'd called the
               police to come talk to us about Betty.
               Was that the wrong thing to do?

                          BUCKY
               You couldn't have known.

     EXT. THE APARTMENT COMPLEX - LATER

     Bucky emerges. Koenig stands on the stoop with the two men,
     both of whom look like they might have seen the wrong end of
     Koenig's less-than-subtle interrogation style.

                          KOENIG
                   (re the men)
               They didn't do it.

                          BUCKY
               No shit Sherlock.

     INT. AN ANONYMOUS CASTING OFFICE - DAY

     Clapsticks come down in front of the camera: "Elizabeth
     Short...Screen Test #1."

     Elizabeth Short sits on a tiny chair in a cheap office. She's
     dressed for an audition, overly made up and nervous.

                          MAN (O.S.)
               Your name please?

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Elizabeth Short. Betty. Beth...Elizabeth.

                          MAN (O.S)
               Relax, Elizabeth.

     She nods, can't relax.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Sorry. Can we try it again?

                          MAN (O.S.)
               We haven't even started yet.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Oh.

     FADE OUT.

     INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - LATER

     Bucky fills out forms.

                          VOICE OVER
               I used a Warrant cops special prerogative
               and issued an APB on Lorna Martikova aka
               Linda Martin. I wrote up my day's report,
               omitting Marjorie Graham's lead on the
               old dyke. I didn't need Ellis Loew
               quashing it along with the skinny on
               Betty as the part-time prostie.

     EXT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky pulls up in front of the house. Heads inside...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               To be honest, I'd pretty much overdosed
               on Betty Short's low-rent last months on
               earth and decided to kiss off the rest of
               the day and head to Lee and Kay's for a
               sandwich.

                                                            CUT TO:

     CLOSE-UPS OF BLACK DAHLIA CRIME SCENE PHOTOS

     spread out on Lee and Kay's dining room table.

     Bucky stands just inside the door watching Lee study the
     photos, Kay a pace or two back, smoking nervously. Neither of
     them seem to notice him. Finally Kay sees him:

                          KAY
               Hi, Dwight.

                          LEE
                   (wired)
               It ain't a random job. Horseshit. Guy who
               did this...hated her. Bad. Wanted the
               whole goddamn world to know. Babe, you
               took pre-Med, whattya think? Mad doctor?

                          KAY
               Lee, Dwight's here.

                          LEE
               Oh, hey partner. Bucky listen to Kay.
               Babe's got ideas. Good stuff--

                          KAY
               This kind of theorizing's nonsense, but
               I'll give you a theory if you'll eat
               something to calm yourself down.

                          LEE
               Theory on, teach.

                          KAY
               Well. Just a guess. But maybe there were
               two killers. Because the torture cuts are
               crude, while the bisection and the cut on
               the abdomen are neat and clean...

     CLOSE ON: Lee's face, somehow both intense and unfocused...

                          VOICE OVER
               Three days 'til Bobby De Witt hit LA.
               Three days since we killed four men.

     BACK ON: BUCKY, who turns on his heels and exits, catching
     Kay's eye as he goes.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Maybe nobody cared. Maybe they cared too
               much.

     EXT. 39TH AND NORTON - DUSK - LATER

     Bucky cruises by the crime scene. Rubberneckers gawk around
     the vacant lot while vendors peddle greasy food and cheap
     portrait glossies of the Dahlia in a black dress.

     INT. CENTRAL DIVISION BULLPEN - BUCKY'S DESK - NIGHT

     Bucky sits at his desk staring at RAYMOND NASH'S MUGSHOT.

     HIS EYES DRIFT TO:

     A WAGER POOL SIGN-UP LIST POSTED ON THE WALL: a crude felt
     craps table with various betting spaces: "Solved--2 to 1",
     "Random Sex Job--4 to 1", "Uhsolved--Even Money",
     "Boyfriend(s)--l to 4"...

     Next to it are TWO HALVES OF A BLACK DRESS on separate
     hangers...a crude joke.

     Bucky opens up his desk drawer and drops the Nash mugshot
     inside. He dials the phone:

                          BUCKY
               Administrative Vice Squad?

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. THE SWANK SPOT LOUNGE - THE VALLEY - NIGHT

     Bucky pulls his car up to a low-slung building with a log-
     cabin facade and swinging Western doors. He enters.

     INT. THE SWANK SPOT LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

     A dimly lit LESBIAN BAR. Butch women in GI khakis mix with
     soft girls in cashmere skirt suits.

     Bucky approaches a bartender. The woman sizes him up and
     slides him a whiskey.

                          BARTENDER
               Beverage Control?

                          BUCKY
                   (downing the whiskey)
               LAPD Homicide.

                          BARTENDER
               Who got snuffed?

     Bucky slides her a photo of the Dahlia and Linda Martin's ID.

                          BUCKY
               Seen either of 'em?

                          BARTENDER
               Huh. The Dahlia's a sister?

                          BUCKY
               You tell me.

                          BARTENDER
               Never seen her 'cept in the papers. And
               the little schoolgirl twist I've never
               seen. We don't truck with underaged
               stuff. Capice?

                          BUCKY
               Capice when your girls tell me that.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. THE BAR - SOON AFTER

     as the photos are passed from patron to patron. Aside from a
     few raised eyebrows over the Dahlia, nothing to indicate
     anyone knows anything.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. A DIFFERENT LESBIAN BAR - LATER

     This time an Olde English motif. Bucky sips another free
     whiskey as a dozen more women pass the photos around. Bucky
     watches their reactions closely but doesn't see anything out
     of the ordinary.

     He takes another shot of whiskey and heads out the door.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. LAVERNE'S HIDEWAY - LATER

     A tropical motif. Faux bamboo wrap-around booths shield women
     snuggled deep into the dark corners.

     A bit buzzed and embarrassed to have to go booth to booth and
     break up couples, Bucky slowly makes his way around the bar
     with the two photos. More of the same...

     He approaches a woman polishing glasses at the bar. Slides
     over the photos.

                          BUCKY
               Black Dahlia.

                          BARTENDER
               No shit.

     He taps a finger onto Linda Martin's ID.

                          BUCKY
               What about this girl?

     The bartender picks up the card and squints at it. Bucky sees
     a flicker of recognition in her eyes. She hesitates--

                          BARTENDER
               Never seen her.

     He leans over the counter.

                          BUCKY
               Don't you fuckin' lie to me. She's
               fifteen fucking years old. So you come
               clean or I slap a contributing beef on
               you, and you spend the next five years
               servin' raisinjack to bulldykes in
               Tehachapi.

     The bartender looks again at the ID card.

                          BARTENDER
               A couple times. Two, three months ago.
               Just to cadge drinks off the sisters,
               though. She liked boys, I'm sure. And not
               the Dahlia. Never.

     Out of his peripheral vision Bucky sees another woman just
     starting to sit down on a bar stool but at the last minute,
     change her mind and make for the door.

     A baby spotlight catches her face; a fleeting resemblance to 
     Elizabeth Short.

     Bucky takes a deep breath, counts to ten and then goes out
     after the woman.

     EXT. THE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

     The woman gets into a beautiful snow-white Packard.

                                                            CUT TO:

     SHOTS OF VARIOUS STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     as Bucky tails the white Packard from three car-lengths back.
     He follows her all the way from the Valley to Hancock Park.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. MUIRFIELD ROAD - HANCOCK PARK - NIGHT

     As the woman parks her car in front of A HUGE TUDOR MANSION,

     Bucky cruises by, catching her license plate and writing it
     on a pack of matches from LaVerne's.

     In his rear view mirror he sees her exit the car, a striking
     figure in a sharkskin suit. He watches her walk up the
     enormous lawn and into the home.

     EXT. A PAY PHONE - MINUTES LATER

     Bucky reads the license plate into the phone. He receives
     information back and writes it onto the matchbook, as well.

     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Bucky lies in his bed, staring at the ceiling. His bedside
     light reveals a still life: Elizabeth Short's mug shot photo
     tucked underneath the matchbook. The cover is flipped open
     and we can see written: "Madeleine Cathcart Sprague".

     INT. BUCKY'S CAR - MORNING

     Bucky's listening to The Dexter Gordon quartet on the radio
     when the tune is interrupted by a feverish voice:

                          ANNOUNCER
               We interrupt our regular broadcast to
               bring you a bulletin. A major suspect in
               the investigation of Elizabeth Short, the
               raven-haired beauty known as the Black
               Dahlia, has been captured! Red Manley, a
               Huntington Park hardware salesman and one
               of the last men to be seen with the
               Dahlia, was captured early this morning.
               Currently being held at Hollenback
               Station--

     Bucky takes a quick left down another street.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. HOLLENBACK STATION JAIL - LATER

     Bucky runs into Lee as he enters the station.

                          LEE
               Dahlia left San Diego six days before we
               found her. Dago cops got a witness puts
               her in a tan Dodge with a partial plate
               ident. Finally got a cross-check that
               matched on Red here.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM - CONT.

     Seems like every cop in town has jammed themselves into a
     small corridor, watching Russ Millard interrogate RED MANLEY
     through a one way mirror. Manley is carrot-topped, 25, and
     scared shitless.

     Millard's soothing voice can be heard through speakers.

                          MILLARD
               Like I said, Robert. We're doing this
               because you didn't come forward.

                          RED MANLEY
               I've told it three times now. I didn't
               want my wife to know I was chipping her.

                          MILLARD
               But you said you didn't chip on her.
               Betty wouldn't put out. That's no reason
               to hide from the police.

                          RED MANLEY
               I dated her down in Dago. I slow-danced
               with her. It's the same thing as
               chipping.

                          MILLARD
               And you wanted to fuck her, didn't you?

                          RED MANLEY
               I wanted...to test my loyalty to my wife.

                          MILLARD
               Come on, son!

                          RED MANLEY
               I wanted to fuck her. Yes.

                          MILLARD
               But she cock-teased you.

                          RED MANLEY
               She said she had her period--

     All of the cops outside laugh.

                          RED MANLEY
               Said the father of her child would be a
               combat veteran--

                          MILLARD
               And you were in the Army band. You get
               angry?

                          RED MANLEY
               I told you. I didn't kill her.

                          MILLARD
               You drove her back to LA with you
               on...December tenth? And dropped her at
               the Biltmore Hotel?

                          RED MANLEY
               I've told it how many ways? How many more
               ways do you went to hear it?

     Millard straightens up and turns to the one-way mirror. He
     tugs at the knot of his tie. Soon after he slips out of the
     room and Harry Sears slips in.

     Bucky turns to Lee.

                          BUCKY
               Welcome back to earth, partner.

                          LEE
               Your fault, really. After you left Kay
               slipped me a Mickey. Slept for seventeen
               hours.

                          BUCKY
               Your fault for buying her all those
               chemistry classes.

                          LEE
               Learn anything interesting?

                          BUCKY
               No.

                          LEE
                   (re the interrogation)
               Now you'll see why Russ keeps Harry
               around.

     INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME

     Harry circles Red Manley, lightly tapping a metal-studded sap
     in his hand.

                          LEE
                   (re the sap)
               Russ's only rule. No actual hitting.

     BACK INSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME

     Harry leans close to Red, tapping the sap on the table. His
     stutter completely gone.

                          HARRY SEARS
               You wanted some fresh gash, and you
               thought Betty was easy. You came on
               strong and that didn't work. You offered
               her money. She told you she was on the
               rag, and that was the final straw. You
               wanted to make her bleed for real--

                          RED MANLEY
               No no no. Not Betty--

     Harry SMASHES the sap onto a glass ashtray, shattering it.
     Red bites down on his lip, cutting it.

                          HARRY SEARS
               You plied Betty with drinks, got her to
               talk about her old boyfriends and came on
               like a pal, like the nice little corporal
               willing to leave Betty to the real men,
               the men who saw combat--

                          RED MANLEY
               No--

     Harry SMASHES the table again.

                          HARRY SEARS
               You took her to a toolshed, maybe one of
               those abandoned warehouses out by the old
               Ford plant in Pico-Rivera. There was some
               twine and lots of cutting tools lying
               around, and you got a hard-on...

                          RED MANLEY
               No no no--

     Again Harry smashes the table. Red almost topples his chair
     backwards out of fear, only Harry's hand an the back slats
     keeping it from going over...

                          HARRY SEARS
               Yes, Reddy, yes. You thought of every
               girl who said "I don't suck", every time
               your mommy spanked you, every evil eye
               you got from real soldiers when you
               played your trombone in the army band.

                          RED MANLEY
               No--

                          HARRY SEARS (cont'd)
               Goldbrick, needle-nick, pussy-whipped--

                          RED MANLEY
               No--

                          HARRY SEARS
               That's what Betty had to pay for wasn't
               it?

                          RED MANLEY
               No, please! God as my witness!

                          HARRY SEARS
               God hates liars!

     Smash!

                          HARRY SEARS (cont'd)
               Tell me, Red! Tell Betty! Tell God!

                          RED MANLEY
               I didn't hurt her--

                          HARRY SEARS
               Tell God!

     Harry smashes the sap down the table once more and then hurls
     the whole thing over onto its side.

     Red fumbles out of the chair onto his knees. He clasps his
     hands together--

                          RED MANLEY
               The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not
               want...

     He begins to weep. Completely broken.

     Harry turns to the one way mirror, looking straight out at
     his audience: self-loathing etched into his flabby,
     juicehound face.

     He gives the thumbs-down sign and walks out of the room.

     OUTSIDE IN THE HALLWAY

     Russ Millard meets him at the door and leads him away from
     the general crowd of officers.

     BACK IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM

     Bucky watches as Lee and another officer handcuff Red and
     take him outside. Lee has his hand on Red's shoulder like a
     kindly uncle.

     OUTSIDE THE STATION

     Bucky stands on the steps, taking fresh air. Russ steps out.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Good report yesterday, Bleichert.

                          BUCKY
               Thanks.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               What next?

                          BUCKY
               You send me back to Warrants?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Wrong again. But keep going.

                          BUCKY
               Canvass around the Biltmore. If Red
               dropped her off there on the tenth maybe
               we can start reconstructing the last days
               before she got snatched.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bright penny. You're doing well, Bucky.
               Run with the ball.

                          BUCKY
               All I know is you should keep an eye on
               Loew and his boys.
               I didn't put it in my report, but Betty
               sold it outright when she needed money
               bad enough, and Loew's been trying to
               keep it kiboshed so it'll look better if
               he ever takes it to trial.

                          RUSS MILLARD
                   (smiles)
               You calling your boss an evidence
               suppressor?

                          BUCKY
               And a grandstanding son of a bitch.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You're a brighter penny than I thought.
                   (hands him a sheet of paper)
               Betty sightings. Wilshire Division. I
               need smart pennies to eliminate the
               phonies from the tip sheet.

                          BUCKY
               What are you gonna do?

                          MILLARD
               Keep an eye on the evidence suppressor
               son of a bitch and his minions to make
               sure they don't try to coerce a
               confession out of that innocent man in
               the holding tank.

     He pats Bucky on the shoulder and walks inside.

                                                            CUT TO:

     BUCKY CANVASSING THE WILSHIRE DISTRICT

     Restaurants, bars, juke joints. Bucky interviews every drunk
     on Western and Normandie...

                          VOICE OVER
               Barflies. Daytime juicers...The longer I
               listened the more they talked about
               themselves, interweaving their sad tales
               with the Black Dahlia, who they actually
               believed to be a glamorous siren headed
               for Hollywood stardom...

     Bucky cruises in his car into Lee and Kay's neighborhood.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               It was as if they would have traded their
               own lives for a juicy front-page death.
               I decided my report would consist of two
               words: "All bullshit".

     IN FRONT OF LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Bucky pulls up just as Kay storms out the door and down the
     steps, hurling an armful of paper onto the lawn. Lee storms
     beside her, shouting and waving his arms as they go back
     inside.

     Bucky walks over and kneels down besides the papers: carbons
     of LAPD report forms, tip sheets, evidence tickets, the
     autopsy...all with "E. Short" typed at the top.

                          BUCKY
               Oh Jesus.

     Kay and Lee come back out again, Kay tossing out more files.

                          KAY
               It's sick and it's insane! After
               everything...And all that might happen--

                          LEE
               I need this, babe. You know it. I'll rent
               a room for the stuff but--
                   (noticing Bucky)
               You tell her Bucky. Reason with her.

                          BUCKY
               She's right, Lee. You've pulled at least
               three misdemeanors here. It's out of
               control--

     Bucky stops himself short, studying Lee's strained face.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
                   (to Kay)
               I promised him a week on it. Four more
               days and it's over.

                          KAY
               Dwight, you can be so gutless sometimes.

     She turns on them both and goes back inside. Before Lee can
     make a wisecrack Bucky kicks his way through the LAPD papers
     back to his car...

     INT. LAVERNE'S HIDEAWAY - NIGHT

     Bucky sits low in his car, watching THE WHITE PACKARD parked
     near the front of LaVerne's. He's been there awhile...

     Finally the woman from the night before exits and heads for
     her car. He jumps out and walks quickly to intercept her
     while she's fumbling for her keys.

                          BUCKY
               Slumming, Miss Sprague?

     She sighs, exasperated.

                          MADELEINE
               I am now. Daddy spying on me again?

     She pulls a wad of cash out of her purse. Switching to a very
     deft imitation of a Scotchman's burr:

                          MADELEINE (cont'd)
               Maddy, girl, ye shouldn't be congregatin'
               in such unsuitable places--

                          BUCKY
               I'm a policeman.

                          MADELEINE
               Well that's a new one--

     She peels off another bill. Hands it to Bucky. He counts it
     out. Over a hundred dollars.

                          BUCKY
               Homicide.

     He hands the money back.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Let's try Elizabeth Short. Linda Martin.

     All of her bravado drops. Bucky sees it immediately. He grabs
     her purse and keys and tosses them on the hood of her car.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Here or downtown? I know you knew her so
               don't jerk me off on that or it's
               downtown and a whole lot of publicity.

     She opens the door to her car and slides in. Bucky gets in
     next to her. By the roof light he can see that her similarity
     to the Dahlia is more in her clothes and hair, but the
     resemblance is still there nonetheless.

                          MADELEINE
                   (gathering herself)
               This is all a fluke. I met them at
               LaVerne's last fall.
               Betty maybe one time. Linda a couple.
               She'd come in to cadge a drink or a meal
               off a sister.

                          BUCKY
               You sleep with either of them?

                          MADELEINE
               No. Just cocktail lounge chitchat.

                          BUCKY
               Are you lez?

                          MADELEINE
                   (Scotchman's burr)
               Ye might say I take it where I can find
               it, laddie.

     Bucky's charmed by her, but stays focused.

                          BUCKY
               Why'd you rabbit last night?

                          MADELEINE
                   (exasperated)
               Mister, my father is Emmett Sprague. The
               Emmett Sprague. He built half of
               Hollywood and Long Beach, and what he
               didn't build he bought. Imagine the
               headlines. "Tycoon's Daughter Questioned
               in Black Dahlia Case--Played Footsie with
               Dead Girl at Lesbian Nightclub". Get the
               picture?

                          BUCKY
               In Technicolor. (beat) What did you talk
               about?

                          MADELEINE
               Linda talked about her boring boy back in
               Hicktown, Nebraska, or wherever. Betty
               talked about the latest issue of Screen
               World. Hollywood dreams, the sad nine
               yards.

                          BUCKY
               Betty ever tell you about a movie she
               did? Show you a viewfinder? Anything
               specific?

                          MADELEINE
               On a conversational level they were right
               down there with you, only they were
               better looking.

                          BUCKY
               You're cute.

                          MADELEINE
               You're not. Look, I'm tired. You want to
               hear my alibi so I can end this farce and
               go home?

                          BUCKY
               That's all anyone ever wants to
               volunteer: the alibi. Go ahead.

                          MADELEINE
               My family and I were at our house in
               Laguna from Sunday through Thursday along
               with our live-in servants. If you want
               verification, call Daddy. But be discreet
               about where we met.

     She turns in the seat to face him directly.

                          MADELEINE (cont'd)
               Don't suppose I can convince you to keep
               my name out of the papers?

                          BUCKY
               I don't need your cash if that's what
               you're saying.

     She touches his leg.

                          MADELEINE
               Ah, Laddie...'S not what I'm saying...

     He knows exactly what she's saying.

                          BUCKY
               Convince me.

                          MADELEINE
               Tomorrow night. Eight o'clock. My address
               is 482 So. Muirfield.

                          BUCKY
               I know the address.

                          MADELEINE
               Not surprised. Pick me up. Like a
               gentleman.

     He starts to get out of the car.

                          MADELEINE (cont'd)
               One more thing--What's your name?

                          BUCKY
               Bucky Bleichert.

                          MADELEINE
               I'll try to remember.

     He pulls the purse off the hood and tosses her the keys. As
     he walks away he lets out a deep breath, as if he'd been
     holding it the whole time...

     INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - NEXT DAY

     Bucky enters and finds Lee at a desk, manning the tip phones.

                          LEE
               Yes, ma'am. I understand. A werewolf and
               Red Manley. Oh no. The werewolf is Red
               Manley. Yes that would be more
               efficient...

     Lee dutifully writes down the crank on a routing slip. Bucky
     slides into a chair across from him, brushing imaginary dust
     off of the phone in front of him.

     Lee rings off. Smiles at Bucky.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               I love tip duty.

                          BUCKY
               So...You smooth things with Kay?

                          LEE
               Yeah. I rented a room for the stuff at
               the El Nido Motel. Nine scoots a week.
               Chump change if it makes her feel good.

                          BUCKY
               De Witt gets out tomorrow, Lee. I was
               thinking maybe I should lean on him. Get
               Fritz Vogel and Koenig to do it--

     Lee swings away in his rotating chair, knocking over a
     wastepaper basket.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Lee--

     The phone in front of Lee rings. He snatches it--

                          LEE
               Blanchard. Homicide.

     Lee listens to the call, not saying anything. It goes on for
     some time. Finally Bucky catches Lee's eye. Lee makes the
     "looney" sign with his finger.

     Bucky's phone rings. He picks it up.

                          BUCKY
               Bleichert. Homicide.

     The person on the other line starts rambling on. Bucky takes
     notes diligently as we

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - LATER

     Bucky's on another call. His pile of tip sheets and routing
     slips have grown. Behind him Lee pulls on his jacket and
     gives Bucky a two-fingered salute as he saunters out.

                          VOICE OVER
               I logged forty-six phone tips, about half
               of which were reasonably coherent. Lee
               left early, dodging any talk about De
               Witt. Ellis Loew stuck me with writing up
               the summary report, most of which
               concerned the numerous dead end leads,
               bogus confessions and three hundred new
               Dahlia sightings per day. It left me gut
               certain of one thing:

                                                            CUT TO:

     A CLOSE UP OF THE BETTING POOL TABLE

     as Bucky drops twenty dollars on "Unsolved - pay 2 to 1".

     INT. ANOTHER CASTING OFFICE - DAY

     Elizabeth Short in another dress, her hair fixed differently.
     Clapsticks come in again: "Elizabeth Short...Screen Test
     #2"

                          MAN #2 (O.S.)
               Where are you from?

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Boston. Massachusetts.

                          MAN #2
               How long have you lived here?

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Two years.

                          MAN #2
               You've lost your accent.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Well, you know, when in Rome...
                   (looks nervously into camera)
               Why? Do you want a girl with an accent?

     FADE OUT

     EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - NIGHT

     Bucky rings the bell dressed in his Sunday best blazer.
     Madeleine answers, a knockout in a skirt and cashmere sweater.

                          MADELEINE
               Look. I hate to pull this, but Daddy has
               heard about you. He insisted you stay for
               dinner. I told him we met at that art
               exhibit at Stanley Rose's Bookshop, so if
               you have to pump everybody for my alibi,
               be subtle. All right?

                          BUCKY
               Sure.

     She leads him inside.

     INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - CONTINUOUS

     Thick Persian carpets, tapestries, giant rooms with a men's
     club atmosphere.

     Next to the fireplace Bucky notices A STUFFED SPANIEL with a
     yellowed newspaper rolled into its mouth.

                          MADELEINE
                   (re the dog)
               That's Balto. The paper is the LA Times
               for August 1, 1926. Balto was bringing in
               the paper when Daddy's accountant told
               him he'd made his first million. Daddy
               wanted to consecrate the moment so he
               shot him. Here we go--

     INT. A SMALL SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The Sprague family sits in matching easy chairs. No one
     stands up.

                          MADELEINE
               Bucky Bleichert. May I present my family.
               My mother, Ramona Cathcart Sprague. My
               father, Emmett Sprague. My sister, Martha
               McConville Sprague.

     Emmett Sprague jumps to his feet, pumping Bucky's hand.

                          BUCKY
               A pleasure, Mr. Sprague.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Saw you fight Mondo Sanchez. Boxed the
               pants off him. Another Billy Conn you
               were.

                          BUCKY
               Thanks.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Mondo gave a good show. What ever
               happened to him?

                          BUCKY
               Died of a heroin overdose.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Too bad. Shamed his family. (beat)
               Speaking of families--

     Both Martha and Ramona stand up. Martha is 19, plain and
     serious, with a tenacious resemblance to Emmett. (Neither of
     whom look much like Madeleine.)

     Ramona, on the other hand, possesses a pushing-fifty
     resemblance to Madeleine combined with the flaccid face and
     unfocused features of a booze or drug addict.

                          RAMONA
                   (trace of a slur)
               Madeleine says nice things about you.

                          MADELEINE
               Daddy can we eat? Bucky and I want to
               catch a nine-thirty show.

     INT. THE DINING ROOOM - LATER

     A black maid serves large portions of corned beef and cabbage.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Dig in, lad. Hearty fare breeds hearty
               people. Haute cuisine breeds degenerates.

     Bucky smiles politely and begins eating.

                          MARTHA
               I want to draw Mr. Bleichert, Daddy.

     On Emmett's nod Martha pulls out a small sketch pad.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               You're in for a cruel caricaturing,
               Bucky. Maddy's my pretty one, but
               Martha's my certified genius.

     A wince from Martha.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE (cont'd)
               What kind of name is Bleichert? Dutch?

                          BUCKY
               German.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               A great people, the Germans. Hitler was a
               bit excessive, but mark my words that
               someday we'll regret not joining forces
               with him to fight the Reds. I killed a
               lot of your countrymen during the war.

                          MARTHA
               Did you meet Balto out in the hallway?

                          BUCKY
               Very realistic.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               An old friend stuffed him. We were in the
               Scots regiment together. Georgie Tilden.
               He wanted to work in the flickers.

                          BUCKY
               So when did you come here?

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               1920. Hollywood was a cow pasture, but
               the silent flickers was booming. Georgie
               got work as a lighting man, and me
               building houses.
               Georgie got me introduced to Mack Sennett
               and I helped him build that housing
               project he was putting up--Hollywoodland--
               underneath that godawful sign.

                          BUCKY
               I always loved the Keystone Kops.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Old Mack knew how to squeeze a dollar
               dry, he did. He had extras moonlighting
               as laborers and vice versa. I used to
               drive 'em over to Hollywoodland after
               twelve hours on a Keystone Cops flicker
               and put in another six hours by
               torchlight. Even gave me as assistant
               director credit a couple times, so
               grateful he was for the way I squeezed
               his slaves--

     A SCREECH interrupts Emmett's monologue. Bucky looks across
     the table to see Ramona trying to corral a potato with her
     fork (the source of the sound).

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE (cont'd)
               Mother? Are you feeling well? Would you
               like to contribute to the conversation?

     Ramona forks a small bit of food and chews it daintily.

                          RAMONA
               Did you know, Mr. Bleichert, that Ramona
               Boulevard was named after me?

                          BUCKY
               No Mrs. Sprague, I didn't.

                          RAMONA
               When Emmett married me for my father's
               money he promised my family that he would
               use his influence with the City Zoning
               Board to have a street named after me.
               But all he could manage was a dead-end
               block in a red light district in Lincoln
               Heights. Are you familiar with the
               neighborhood, Mr. Bleichert?

                          BUCKY
               I grew up there.

                          RAMONA
               Then you know that the Mexican
               prostitutes expose themselves out of
               windows to attract customers. I hear many
               of them know Mr. Sprague by name--

     Emmett Sprague SLAMS the table. Plates rattle. Silence. Bucky
     stares into his lap as Madeleine grabs his knee tightly.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               I'll sing for my supper when Mayor Bowron
               comes to dinner, but not for Madeleine's
               male whores. A common policeman. My God,
               Emmett. How little you think of me.

     She struggles to her feet and leaves the room. Her husband
     follows.

                          MADELEINE
               I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

                          MARTHA
                   (cheery)
               Mr. Bleichert?

     Martha tears a piece of paper out of her sketch pad. Bucky
     takes it as she walks away.

     ANGLE ON THE SKETCH:

     A caricature of a naked Bucky having sex with Madeleine.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER

     A cinderblock auto court filled with pre-war jalopies. The
     camera closes on a dingy door. Room 11.

     INT. THE RED ARROW INN - ROOM 11 - SAME

     A single yellow light illuminates the dreary flop as Bucky
     and Madeleine fuck on the bed.

                          MADELEINE
               I'm so...sorry. Don't hate my family--
               don't--they're not so bad--

     Bucky grabs her hair--

                          BUCKY
               Not them, me. Do me. Be with me.

     Focusing, Madeleine pins Bucky with her knees and pulls him
     deep into her until they're no longer common policeman and
     rich girl slut. They're one.

     INT. THE RED ARROW INN - ROOM 11 - SAME

     They hold each other, sweaty and spent.

                          BUCKY
               Well. I think you kept your name out of
               the papers.

                          MADELEINE
               Until we announce the wedding?

                          BUCKY
               Your mother would love that.

                          MADELEINE
               She's a hypocrite. She takes pills the
               doctor gives her, so she's not a hophead.
               You know how Daddy really made his money?

                          BUCKY
               How?

                          MADELEINE
               He bought rotten lumber and abandoned
               movie facades from Mack Sennett and built
               houses out of them. He's got firetraps
               all over LA registered to phony
               corporations...His "good friend" George?
               Disfigured in a car crash while running
               Daddy some errands. Daddy throws him
               scraps now--odd jobs tending some rental
               property--

                          BUCKY
               You don't have to tell me this--

                          MADELEINE
               I want to. I like you Bucky.

                          BUCKY
               I like you, too.

     She looks at him earnestly.

                          MADELEINE
               Bucky, I didn't tell you all about Betty
               Short.

                          BUCKY
               Jesus--

                          MADELEINE
               Don't be mad at me. It's nothing. I just
               don't want to lie to you.

                          BUCKY
               What is it?

                          MADELEINE
               Last summer I was bar-hopping a lot.
               Straight bars. I heard about a girl who
               looked like me. I got curious and left
               notes at a couple places: "Your lookalike
               wants to meet you", things like that. I
               left my number. She called. That's how I
               met her at LaVerne's with Linda.

                          BUCKY
               And that's all of it?

                          MADELEINE
               Yes. That's all of it.

                          BUCKY
               Then be prepared, babe. There's fifty
               cops out there combing every bar in town
               looking for Dahlia info. You could be
               headed for the papers no matter what.

                          MADELEINE
               Serve my family right.

                          BUCKY
               You don't mean that.

                          MADELEINE
               No. I don't.

     He strokes her dark hair.

                          BUCKY
               Tell me something. Why'd you want to meet
               Betty Short?

                          MADELEINE
               I've worked pretty hard to be loose and
               free. But the way people described Betty.
               It sounded like she was a natural.

                          BUCKY
               How do you mean?

                          MADELEINE
               Hmmm...She was this poor girl...Came from
               nothing...But then she carried nothing
               with her, either. I don't know...when
               you're rich sometimes you romanticize the
               poor...

                          BUCKY
               I wouldn't know.

     An awkward silence as she considers her foot in her mouth. He
     studies her for a moment. Pulls her close, kisses her
     mouth...the arch of her neck...They begin to move together
     again...

     Another LAPD FORM: "Witness Report: Lorna
     Martikova...aka Linda Martin..."

     EXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - MOVING

     Bucky weaves fast through traffic. He whips a right turn...

     EXT. THE CALEDONIA LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky's car screeches into the parking lot just as LINDA
     MARTIN bursts through the doors and takes off running.

     Bucky jumps from the car and sprints after her, the girl
     clutching an oversized purse to her chest as she dashes in
     and out of busy traffic.

     The girl runs like a fucking antelope as Bucky barely misses
     being hit by a large BEER TRUCK and gets to the other side of
     the street just as Linda stumbles over a curb--sending her
     sprawling on the sidewalk.

     Bucky jumps on her, grabbing her tiny fists as she kicks and
     screams like a hell cat.

     He cuffs her and pulls her up, dragging her to where she
     spilled her purse.

                          LINDA MARTIN
               I'm an emancipated minor and if you touch
               me without a matron present I'll sue you!

     He picks it up her purse. Surprised by the heft, he opens it
     and pulls out A METAL FILM CAN.

     Her demeanor changes instantly to fear:

                          LINDA MARTIN
                   (near tears)
               Please, mister...My...my parents.

     INT. JUVENILE DETENTION HALL - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

     Russ, Harry and Bucky sit opposite Linda Martin. She's pretty
     and small, and about to get smaller...

                          RUSS MILLARD
               ...and you don't recall any of the names
               Betty went out with last fall?

                          LINDA MARTIN
               They were just pickups.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               No one who would do her harm?

     The girl thinks hard, shakes her head "no".

                          BUCKY
               You made the casting rounds together.
               Ever get any movie work?

                          LINDA MARTIN
               No.

                          BUCKY
               So what about the film can?

     Her eyes go to the floor, tears begin to drop.

                          LINDA MARTIN
               It's...a movie.

                          BUCKY
               A dirty movie?

     She nods her head silently.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You have to tell us the whole thing,
               sweetheart. So think it through.

     Harry pours her a paper cup of water. She takes a sip.

                          LINDA MARTIN
               I was...cadging at a bar in Gardena. This
               Mexican man - Raoul or Jorge or something
               - starting talking to me.
               I thought I was pregnant, and I was
               desperate wicked bad for money. He said
               he'd give me two hundred dollars to act
               in a nudie film.

     She takes a large gulp of water.

                          LINDA MARTIN (cont'd)
               He said he needed another girl so I asked
               Betty. The three of us drove down to
               Tijuana and we made the movie at this big
               house outside of town. (beat) Then he
               drove us back to LA.

     Her head bowed. Russ and Harry stare at her impassively.

                          BUCKY
               Was this around Thanksgiving?

     She nods yes.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Did the Mex give Betty a viewfinder?

     She raises her head in recognition and nods yes.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Did he seem particularly interested in
               Betty? Did she see him again?

     She shakes her head "no".

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               But you saw him again, didn't you? How
               else could you have gotten a copy?

     Linda looks sadly at Bucky.

                          LINDA MARTIN
               After Betty...After I read about
               Betty...I went looking for him in
               Gardena. He was about to go back to
               Mexico and I conned him out of a print.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Where was that?

                          LINDA MARTIN
               I don't remember. On Aviation somewhere.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Why would you do that?

                          LINDA MARTIN
               A Black Dahlia stag film? I thought...I
               could sell it if I had to. (ashamed) It
               was...a collector's item.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               And he willingly gave you a copy of the
               film? For nothing?

                          LINDA MARTIN
               No. Not for nothing.

     She looks down again. The cops look at each other. Linda's
     harder and more desperate than they imagined.

                          LINDA MARTIN (cont'd)
               You'll let me have it back, won't you?
               You won't let people look at it?

     Now its the cops turn to look away.

     EXT. THE HALLWAY - AFTER

     Russ and Bucky.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Whattya think?

                          BUCKY
               I think she's covering on the Mex angle.
               Maybe she knows him and doesn't want him
               taking a smut rap. Maybe he's white. The
               TJ stuff is sound, though. I'd detach Meg
               Caulfield from Wilshire Clerical to play
               cellmate for a day.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bleichert you are a very bright penny
               today. (beat) Well. Looks like it's blue
               movie night at City Hall.

     INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - LATER

     A projector and screen has been set up. All the big-wigs are
     present: Ellis Loew, Jack Tierney, Thad Green and Chief of
     Police C.B. Horrall. Millard, Harry and Lee.

     A clerical assistant threads the projector as Bucky settles
     into a seat next to Lee. On Lee's lap is a newspaper with the 
     headline: "Boulevard-Citizen's Mastermind to be Released
     --LA Bound after 8 years of Custody"

                          LEE
                   (raggedy)
               Gettin' any?

     Bucky's about to respond when the lights dim and a blurred
     image hits the screen. It begins to focus.

     A title: "Slave Girls From Hell"

     The movie: A big high-ceiling room with Egyptian
     hieroglyphics on the walls. Pillars shaped like coiled
     serpents are stationed throughout the room; the camera zooms
     in for a close-up of two inset plaster snakes swallowing each
     other's tails. The snakes dissolve into Betty Short, wearing
     only stockings and doing an inept hoochie koochie dance...

     An audible breath in the muster room.

     A hand reaches into frame, passing Betty a large cylindrical
     object: a dildo, scales covering the shaft, fangs extending
     from the circumcised head. Betty puts it in her mouth, sucks
     it, eyes wide open and glassy.

     An abrupt cut: Linda Martin, naked, lying on a divan. Betty
     enters the frame with the dildo; she puts it between Linda's
     legs, pushing it inside her. Linda rotates her hips, trying
     her best to fake ecstasy instead of pain and sadness.

     Another cut: Betty mouthing the words "No, please" to the
     camera. A hand pushing her head down towards Linda's crotch.
     Betty tonguing next to the dildo...

     BACK ON THE MUSTER ROOM

     The atmosphere is somber, but calm. The film continues...

                          CHIEF HORRALL
               Whattya think, Russ? This got anything to
               do with the girl's murder--

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Long shot, Chief. Harry and I are headed
               down to TJ tonight. The Mex doesn't play
               as the killer. But maybe he showed it to
               someone--

     Suddenly Lee jumps up, standing in front of the screen.

                          LEE
               Who gives a fuck if he didn't kill her!
               I've sent Boy Scouts to the green room
               for less than this!

     He yanks down the screen with a crash and storms out of the
     room. The movie continues on the chalked up blackboard.

     INT. THE LOCKER ROOM - LATER

     Lee sits on the ground, head in his hands. Bucky enters and
     sits on a bench next to him.

                          LEE
               Did you see her face, Bucky? Did you see?

                          BUCKY
               Yeah. I did, partner. I did.

     Bucky notices Lee's still clutching the De Witt article in
     his fist. He pries it loose.

     Ellis Loew and Russ Millard enter.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Goddammit, Blanchard! I got you Warrants.
               You're my man, and you made me look like
               a fool in front of the two most powerful
               men in the Department. If you weren't
               Mr. Fire you'd be suspended from duty
               already. You've gotten personally
               involved in the Short case--

                          BUCKY
                   (holding up the newspaper)
               Mr. Loew, it's not just Betty Short--

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Shut up, Bleichert.
                   (back to Lee)
               You're back on Warrants as of tomorrow.
               Report to me at 0800 with letters of
               apology for Green and Horrall. For the
               sake of your pension I'd suggest you
               grovel.

                          LEE
               I want to go to TJ--

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Blanchard!

     Poison hangs in the air. Ellis turns on his heels.

     INT. THE SQUADRON - DAY

     Bucky sits in his cubicle searching the Dahlia files. The
     clock behind him reads "12:30". Loew approaches.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               You've been skating around all morning,
               Bleichert. Vogel and Koenig went to
               Tijuana an hour ago so I need you to
               check out a radio car and get out there.

                          BUCKY
               Yes, sir.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               And if you see that phantom partner of
               yours, tell him this no-show's gonna cost
               him three days pay.

     Loew walks off. Bucky dials the phone.

                          MADELEINE (VO)
               Hello.

                          BUCKY
               It's me. You want to get together?

                          MADELEINE (VO)
               When?

                          BUCKY
               I'll pick you up in forty-five minutes.

                          MADELEINE (VO)
               Not at the house. Daddy's having a
               business soiree. The Red Arrow.

                          BUCKY
               I have an apartment, you know.

                          MADELEINE (VO)
               Room 11. Forty-five minutes.

     She hangs up.

     INT. RED ARROW MOTEL - ROOM 11 - LATER

     They lie naked in the bed. Bucky's lost in thought.

                          MADELEINE
               Smile at me. Look soft and sweet.

     He looks anything but.

                          BUCK
               They picked up Linda Martin yesterday.
               She had a stag film of her and Betty
               Short playing lez. Spooky stuff.

     Madeleine sits up.

                          MADELEINE
               Did she mention me?

                          BUCKY
               No. And I checked through the case file.
               There's no mention of that note-leaving
               number you pulled. (beat) Babe, I'm
               withholding evidence for you. It's a fair
               trade for what I'm getting, but it still
               shakes me. Is there anything you haven't
               told me about Betty and Linda?

     She runs her fingers down his ribcage, teasing his boxing
     scars.

                          MADELEINE
               Sugar, Betty and I made love once, that
               one time we met last summer. I just did
               it to see what it would be like to do it
               with someone who looked like me and--

                          BUCKY
               Jesus Christ.

     He jumps from the bed and pulls on his pants.

                          MADELEINE
               Bucky that's it, I swear. Please stay--

     He pulls on his shirt, his handcuffs and his .38. Grabs his
     jacket--

                          MADELEINE (cont'd)
               Stay sugar stay--

     --and slams the door on the way out.

     INT. THE POLICE CRUISER - LATER

     Bucky steamed in the car. He flips on the police radio,
     looking for distraction. Instead he gets:

                          RADIO DISPATCHER
               Code four all units at Crenshaw and
               Stocker. Two dead, suspect dead, Raymond
               Douglas Nash, warrant number--

     EXT. A KOREAN GROCERY - MINUTES LATER

     RAYMOND NASH lies dead on the sidewalk. Off to one side, a
     short and wiry cop is describing for detectives how it all
     went down, pantomiming how he shot an escaping Raymond Nash.

     Bucky stands over Nash, staring at his dead features. He
     walks inside.

     INT. A KOREAN GROCERY - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky's POV:

     A robbery gone bad. A sixty-year old Korean shopowner lies
     dead behind the counter and his teenaged son lies dead in an
     aisle. Blood and green linoleum.

     INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - SOON AFTER

     Bucky bursts into the squad room, seeing red.

                          BUCKY
               Blanchard!

     A cop walking through the bullpen points to the bathroom.

     INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky kicks in the door, finding Lee washing his hands in the
     sink. He holds his hands up to Bucky, blood oozes from Lee's
     knuckles.

                          LEE
               I beat up a wall. Penance for Nash.

                          BUCKY
               Not good enough.

     Bucky steps into Lee with fists flying, a mad demon. He
     smashes him again and again, beating his only friend until
     Lee slides senseless to the floor...

     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Bucky drinks bourbon straight, his wrist heavily bandaged.

                          VOICE OVER
               Losing the first Bleichert-Blanchard
               fight got me local celebrity, Warrants,
               and close to nine grand in cash;
               winning the rematch got me a sprained
               wrist, two dislocated knuckles and the
               rest of the day off. Whoever said winning
               isn't everything got that part right.

     EXT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NEXT DAY

     Bucky walks into the house and finds Kay there. She holds up
     a newspaper: The front page includes The Black Dahlia, Junior
     Nash, and Bobby De Witt.

                          KAY
                   (eyes red from crying)
               We're famous, Dwight.

                          BUCKY
               Notorious, maybe. Where's Lee?

                          KAY
               I haven't seen him since you beat him up.

     Bucky looks ashamed.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               I don't blame you.

     He walks to her and she holds him.

                          BUCKY
               He's in trouble, you know.

     She nods. He strokes her hair.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               De Witt's probably in LA by now. If Lee
               doesn't show up by tonight I'll come over
               to stay with you.

                          KAY
               I don't want you coming over here just to
               sleep an the couch again.

                          BUCKY
               Kay. Lee--

     She holds up a hand, waving him off. She knows all this.

                          KAY
               You know Dwight? Fighting, cops, guns. To
               most people--that's the scary stuff. Not
               everything else.

     She knows him to the core. She steps back, holding his hands.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               Luck.

                          BUCKY

     INT. POLICE STATION - BUCKY'S CUBICLE - LATER

     Bucky's on the phone.

                          BUCKY
               Thank you very much.

     He rings off looking very disturbed as Russ and Harry arrive.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               What happened in TJ?

                          HARRY SEARS
               Checked for the smut pad. Goose egg.
               Peddlers--double goose egg--

               Bucky. Blanchard's in Tijuana. A border
               cop spotted him hobnobbing with a bunch
               of rough-looking Rurales last night.

     Bucky exhales hard.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
               What is it?

                          BUCKY
                   (re his phone call)
               That was County Parole. Bobby DeWitt
               bought a bus ticket at the Santa Rosa
               depot this morning. San Diego. Transfer
               Tijuana.

     EXT. TIJUANA - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAWN

     Bucky cruises the Tijuana streets: child beggars dig for 
     breakfast in trash cans, taco venders stir pots of dog-meat
     stew, sailors and marines stumble out of whorehouses. Rurales
     drive prewar Chevys wearing black uniforms...

                          VOICE OVER
               Back in LA, Linda Short let slip that her
               "Mex" was actually a local named Walter
               Wellington, who copped to making the film
               but quickly provided the cops his alibi
               for the Dahlia's missing days.

     Bucky parks at a big pink Art Deco hotel (The Divisidero).

     INT. THE DIVISIDERO - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky badges the desk clerk and gets a room number. He heads
     upstairs.

                          VOICE OVER
               Not that this stopped Loew and his boys
               from rousting spics all over town for a
               possible Dahlia frame-up. The circus was
               becoming a farce.

     INT. A DIVISIDERO HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Ellis Loew, Fritz Vogel, and Bill Koenig arguing.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               We can't do that! Wellington told Tierney
               he made the pic--

     Bucky opens the door and the room falls quiet.

                          ELLIS LOEW (cont'd)
               Bleichert.

                          BUCKY
               Lee's down here and so is Bobby De Witt.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Fuck Blanchard. He's suspended.

     Bucky charges the DA but Vogel and Koenig intercept him,
     pushing him roughly back out in the hall. Loew retreats to
     the other side of the room.

                          VOGEL
               You know what, kid? I got a soft spot in
               my heart for light heavyweights.
                   (chucks his chin)
               You promise not to hit Billy and I'll
               help you look for your partner.
                   (re Bucky's ragged appearance)
               I'll drive. You look like shit.

     EXT. THE TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS

     Bucky and Fritz Vogel drive past beggars swarming tourists,
     hookers dispensing front seat blow jobs, zoot suit youths
     prowling for drunks to roll...

     EXT. THE TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS

     The two men park the car in the middle of a car-choked street
     and decide to try walking. They're immediately swallowed up
     by kid beggars shoving crucifixes in their faces.

     Bucky tosses handfuls of coins into the gutters and the
     children scatter, squabbling over the coins.

     IN THE BACKGROUND

     Fritz Vogel approaches a Rurale and talks to him. The Rurale
     nods yes, gesturing down an alley to a squat cinderblock
     building.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. A FILTHY MEXICAN JAIL - SOON AFTER

     Vogel and Bucky walk quickly down a corridor lined with empty
     cells. A Mexican jailer unlocks the last cell and the two
     cops walk in to face

     BOBBY DEWITT

     the hatchet-faced tough of 1939 now a grizzled and bloated
     well-used piece of work. He stands up, full of con bravado.

                          DEWITT
               Cops, huh? Well at least you're American.
               Never thought I'l be glad to see you
               guys.

                          VOGEL
               Why start now?

     Vogel kicks in the balls, dropping him to his knees. Vogel
     smashes him with a thick backhand across the face.

                                                            CUT TO:

     BUCKY HANDCUFFING BOBBY DEWITT TO A CHAIR

     Vogel stands over him.

                          VOGEL
               Lee Blanchard's here in TJ, and you came
               here flush out of Big Q. That's a
               goddamned strange coincidence and I don't
               like it. I don't like you and I don't
               like being down in this rat-infested
               country when I could be home with my
               family.

     DeWitt pisses his pants.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Did you know Blanchard was in TJ?

                          DEWITT
               Ain't seen Blanchard since my fuckin'
               trial.

     Vogel smashes him across the face.

                          VOGEL
               Do not use profanity with me, and address
               me as sir.

     DeWitt's head bobs up and down.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Now Blanchard's scared of you. Why?

                          DEWITT
               Man o Manieschewitz, what a laugh. Lee
               beauty gotta be scared of me 'cause of
               how I flapped my trap at trial, but all I
               know is what I read in the papers. Maybe
               I was thinkin' revenge, maybe talkin'
               trash to my cellies, but when Lee beauty
               killed them niggers--

     Vogel topples DeWitt with a right hook and then picks him
     back up by the neck, squeezing the life out of him.

                          VOGEL
               Bobby boy I do not like Sergeant
               Blanchard but he is a fellow officer and
               I will not have syphilitic scum like you
               defaming him. Now you risked a parole
               violation for a trip down here.

     He lets go of his neck, the color returning to DeWitt's face.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Why are you here, Bobby. You tell me.

                          DEWITT
                   (a beaten dog)
               I came down to cop some heroin and move
               it back to LA. I'm meeting a guy, Felix
               Casco, at the Gardena Motel. Please.
               Don't hurt me no more. Please.

     Vogel claps his hands together, gleeful with this bonus bust.

                          VOGEL
                   (heading out of the cell)
               I'm gonna call Ellis.

     Bucky turns back to De Witt, who's much more relaxed now that
     Vogel's left the cell.

                          BUCKY
               Finish up with you and Blanchard.

                          DEWITT
               Sir, all that's between me and Blanchard
               is that I fucked this cunt Kay Lake--

     IN SLOW MOTION--

     Bucky leaps on De Witt, grabbing him around the neck and
     choking him. De Witt turns blue, his eyes bulging out--

     BEHIND BUCKY, VOICES IN SPANISH

     and then hands on his shoulders as Ducky is hurled backwards
     into the cell bars. And then

     BLACKNESS

     which slowly becomes grey, and then back to normal as Bucky
     finds himself awakening on the floor of the cell.

     Refocusing on the scene:

     Two Rurales in jodhpur boots pick their teeth with
     matchsticks as Fritz Vogel pulls Bucky to his feet.

                          BUCKY
               How long--

                          VOGEL
               I let Bobby boy go so we could tail him
               to his pal. But he blew his tail while
               you were catching up on your beauty
               sleep, which is too bad for him.

                                                            CUT TO:

     A STUDEBAKER PATROL CAR WITH LIGHTS FLASHING

     INSIDE THE STUDEBAKER

     Vogel, Koenig, a Rurale, and Bucky (holding a piece of ice to
     the back of his head).

     The car arrives at a horseshoe-shaped auto court. Two Mexican 
     policeman stand guard outside one of its rooms.

     INT. THE MOTEL ROOM - SECONDS LATER

     As the American cops walk in on a cordite-reeking
     slaughterhouse. Bobby De Witt and a Mexican man lay dead on
     the floor, bullet holes oozing blood all over them.

     Bucky notes the bruises on De Witt's neck from where he
     choked him. Bucky squints at the men, still a little
     disoriented...

                          VOGEL
               The spic's Felix Casco, a known dope
               trafficker. Maybe it was other dope scum,
               maybe Lee, maybe it was God. I say let
               our Mexican colleagues handle their own
               dirty laundry and we go back to LA and
               find the son of a bitch who sliced the
               Dahlia.

     INT. KAY AND LEE'S HOUSE - DAY

     Kay sits curled into a corner of the couch, defensively.
     Bucky sits on a small chair next to Lee's large easy chair.

                          KAY
               I spent the morning with Internal
               Affairs. I told them...everything I knew.
               I gave them so much...and in the end it
               didn't seem like anything at all.

                          BUCKY
               He'll came back, Kay. I'm sure of it.

                          KAY
               You don't know anything, Dwight. But
               that's what I like about you.

                          BUCKY
               Kay--

                          KAY
               I've been offered a job. Teaching sixth
               grade at Fairfax Primary. With Lee gone
               now--

                          BUCKY
               He's coming back.

     She nods, mollifying him.

     Boxes of police falls scattered on the bed and desk. Photos

     glossies, newspaper photos, enlarged crime scene
     grotesquerie.

     The amount of manpower represented here is staggering; so
     much work over one girl.

               You been working this case pretty hard.
               Or is it the other way around?

     Bucky smiles weakly; Russ knows him.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               It's not as much fun once it moves to the
               back pages, is it? (changing subjects) I
               hear they arrested two Mexicans in Juarez
               for the Bobby De Witt murder.

                          BUCKY
               I heard that, too.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You must be relieved.

                          BUCKY
               They've rescinded the APB on Lee. If he
               doesn't show up in thirty days he's out.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               He'll be found if he wants to be found.

                          BUCKY
               Like the guy who killed the Dahlia?

     Russ smiles grimly.

     EXT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - EVENING

     Bucky rings the doorbell. Fritz Vogel answers.

                          VOGEL
               Boyo! Glad you could make it.

     He claps Bucky on the shoulder and leads him into the house.

     INT. FRITZ VOGEL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The interior decorating equivalent of highballs and pretzels,
     which is exactly what Vogel, Bucky and Ellis Loew are
     consuming. Bucky drinks with the trepidation of the King's
     food taster.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               I called this little meeting for a couple
               reasons, Bucky.
               We'd both like to see the Short case
               closed out and get back to normal
               business.

     Bucky looks impatient and Ellis senses this.

                          ELLIS LOEW (cont'd)
               We're both comers, Bucky. Fritzie wants
               you for his partner when he gets his
               lieutenancy, and--

                          BUCKY
               Russ Millard wants me when Harry retires.

                          VOGEL
               You're too raw for him, boyo. Old Russ is
               a sob sister, and I'm much more your type.

     Bucky considers the truth in this. To Loew:

                          BUCKY
               What do you want, Ellis?

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Very well, Dwight. I'll tell you. There
               are four confessors still being held at
               City Jail. They've got no alibis, weren't
               coherent when they were first questioned,
               and they're all violent, frothing-at-the-
               mouth lunatics. I want them reintegrated.
               It's a muscle job.

                          VOGEL
               I wanted Bill Koenig--

                          ELLIS LOEW
               But Bill's a bit too enamored with
               violence. So it's you, Dwight. Yes or no?
               Because if it's yes, I'll make sure
               you're back on Warrants tomorrow with an
               inside track to some stripes. If not,
               it's Homicide shitwork until Russ Millard
               gets tired of you. We both know that Russ
               is a patient, forbearing man, Dwight.
               That could be a long time. Yes or no?

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. THE CITY JAIL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     as four manacled men are being loaded into a drunk wagon
     while Bucky flips through their rap sheets and mug shots.

     INSIDE THE DRUNK WAGON

     the four men sit in the back as Bucky drives the truck. The
     camera pans their faces. The first, LOREN BIDWELL, pale, old
     and palsied.

                          VOICE OVER
               On my way over I played out their rap
               sheets in my head, trying to work up a
               head of hate...Loren Bidwell, three time
               Atascadero loser, falls for aggravated
               sexual assault on minors. Between prison
               jolts he confessed to all the big sex
               crimes.

     EXT. AN OLD WAREHOUSE BUILDING

     Bucky pulls the drunk wagon up to a building, its street
     facade illuminated: "KOUNTY KING LUNCH MEAT--SERVING L.A.
     COUNTY WITH INSTITUTIONAL FOOD SINCE 1923"...

     THE CAMERA finds the second man, CECIL DURKIN.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Cecil Durkin--hophead, knife fighter and
               a jailhouse rape-o who played jazz drums
               with some good combos. He took two
               Quentin jolts for Arson and was caught
               masturbating at the scene of his last
               torch.

     AT THE FRONT OF THE WAREHOUSE BUILDING

     Fritz Vogel opens the door and leads the men inside.

     INT. THE WAREHOUSE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

     A huge sawdust-covered roam, meathooks dangling from the
     ceiling. Beef dangles over half the hooks. The four men look 
     terrified.

     The camera finds the third man, CHARLIE ISSLER:

                          VOICE OVER
               Charlie Issler was a pimp and a career
               confessor specializing in copping to
               hooker homicides. His three procuring
               beefs had netted him a year county jail
               time, his phony confessions two ninety
               day observation stints at the Camarillo
               nut farm.

     And the fourth man, PAUL ORCHARD:

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               And finally Paul Orchard. Jack roller,
               male prostitute, and a former San
               Bernardino County deputy sheriff.

     The group reaches a back wall of the warehouse where FOUR
     UNUSED MEATHOOKS DANGLE OVER FOUR CHAIRS.

     Bucky studies the men's apprehensive faces as Vogel stands
     each one on a chair with their manacled hands hooked over
     their respective meathooks.

     Bucky's gaze drifts back behind a large box where he sees A
     SHEET-COVERED TABLE sticking out. Before his curiosity draws
     him over Vogel addresses the prisoners.

                          VOGEL
               You all confessed to killing the Dahlia.
               We can't prove you did, so you're gonna
               have to convince us... Query on, Bucko.

     Bucky takes a deep breath and heads first to old man Bidwell.
     The man's palsy has him shaking and Bucky grabs the meathook
     above him to steady him.

                          BUCKY
               Tell me about Betty Short, pops. Why'd
               you kill her?

     Bidwell looks at him with beseeching eyes.

                          VOGEL
               Don't be timid, boyo. That bird made
               little boys suck his hog.

     Bucky's hand twitches on the meathook.

                          BUCKY
               Come clean, pop.

                          BIDWELL
               I didn't kill her mister. I just wanted a
               ticket to the honor farm. Three hots and
               a cot, that's all. Please, mister.

     The man's weakened state makes his argument for him. Bucky
     moves on to Cecil Durkin.

                          BUCKY
               Tell me about it, Cecil.

                          DURKIN
                   (laughing)
               You get that line from Dick Tracy or
               Gangbusters?

     Bucky catches Vogel out of the corner of his eye. Measuring...

                          BUCKY
               One more time, shitbird. Tell me about
               you and Betty Short.

                          DURKIN
               I fucked Betty Short and I fucked your
               mama! I'm your fucking daddy!

     Bucky one-two's him in the solar plexus. His legs buckle, but
     he keeps his feet on the chair.

                          DURKIN (cont'd)
               You think you clever, don't you. You the
               bad guy, your buddy the nice guy. Older
               than vaudeville.

                          BUCKY
               I'm the nice guy, Cecil. Keep that in
               mind.

     This shuts Durkin up. Bucky moves to Charlie Issler.

                          ISSLER
                   (sincere)
               Please. I didn't kill Liz. I don't know
               why I do these things, and I apologize.
               So please don't let that man hurt me.

                          BUCKY
               Convince me.

                          ISSLER
               I...can't. I just can't.

                          BUCKY
               You're a pimp. You know Betty Short?

                          ISSLER
               No.

                          BUCKY
               Why'd you confess to her murder?

                          ISSLER
               She looked so...sweet and pretty and I
               felt so bad. I always confess to the
               pretty ones.

                          BUCKY
               You feel guilty Charlie? You hit your
               girls, get 'em high on hop?

                          ISSLER
               I do such nasty things I don't know why--

     Vogel struts over, putting on brass knuckles.

                          VOGEL
               This kid glove routine's gettin' old--

     He kicks Issler's chair out from under him, the pimp
     screaming as his wrists snap. Vogel kicks the remaining three
     chairs out, punctuating each with a declaration:

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Jack roller! Nigger! Baby fucker!

     The men scream like dying animals as Fritzie zeroes in on
     Charlie Issler. He begins punching him in the gut with the
     brass knuckles.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Tell me about the Dahlia's missing days
               you whoremonger! Tell me!

                          ISSLER
               I...don't...know...anything!

                          VOGEL
               Tell me what you know!

     He punches him in the crotch.

                          ISSLER
               I knew you at Ad Vice!

     Vogel ignores him, rabbit punching him, cracking one rib and
     then another--

     ON BUCKY'S FACE

     knowing this is getting out of control. He's mesmerized by A
     FIRE ALARM on the wall behind the men...

                          VOGEL
               Tell me what your girls tell you!

     Issler retches, coughing up blood. Bucky stares at the fire
     alarm as Fritz runs through his field of vision, cackling.

     Bucky refocuses on the scene as Fritzie returns, wheeling the
     sheet-covered table Bucky'd seen before. He whips off the
     sheet revealing:

     A NAKED FEMALE CORPSE, CUT IN TWO AND MADE UP TO LOOK LIKE
     THE DAHLIA.

     Vogel grabs Issler by the scruff of the neck and jerks him
     down off of the meathook.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               For your cutting pleasure, Jane Doe
               number forty-three. You're all going to
               slice her, and the best slicer buys the
               ticket!

     Issler bites through his lip as Fritzie pulls out a
     switchblade and pops it open.

     Bucky takes in the nightmare scene all in slow-motion, the
     men with their broken wrists, the pudgy naked corpse, Fritzie
     with the knife...

     He runs for the fire alarm and pulls the lever, a piercing
     bell ringing out as Bucky runs out of the warehouse and jumps
     into the drunk wagon, tearing off into the night.

     INT. KAY AND LEE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Kay answers the door and finds Bucky sitting on the front
     porch, sobbing.

     She moves to him, touching him on the back of the neck, the
     stroke of her finger enough to make him stand and face her.

     INT. THE BEDROOM - LATER

     Bucky tries to talk but she puts fingers to his mouth. Mouth
     to his fingers. She undresses him. Slowly she touches him,
     easing him, bringing him back to earth, back to humanity. To
     her.

     And finally they are joined.

                                                            CUT TO:

     ANOTHER TYPEWRITTEN SHEET: "LAPD Transfer orders: Officer
     Dwight Bleichert...From: Central Warrants...To: Foot
     Patrol, Swingwatch. Central Station..."

     EXT. SKID ROW - EVENING

     Bucky picks his way through passed-out drunks and bums. He's
     back in uniform.

                          VOICE OVER
               East 5th Street from Main to Stanford.
               Blood banks, liquor stores selling half
               pints and short dogs exclusively, fifty-
               cent-a-night flophouses and derelict
               missions...

     DOWN THE STREET

     two officers brutally herd winos into a drunk wagon. Bucky
     turns and walks the other direction, refusing to help. They
     see him and sneer.

                          VOICE OVER
               Banished by Ellis Loew, who dared me to
               try my word against a twenty-two year man
               and the city's future District Attorney.
               I confined the truth to Russ and Kay, and
               determined to spend my shifts trying to
               be the worst foot hack in history.

     He hands a quarter to a drunk as he passes, urging him with
     his nightstick to crawl back into a bar.

     INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT

     Russ Millard pores over a file in their private collection.
     Bucky sits with his feet up on the bed, flipping through a
     folder...

                          VOICE OVER
               A month passed. The Dahlia leads dwindled
               to zero and every officer except Russ and
               Harry were returned to their regular
               assignments. As for me, I'd been able to
               contain my Dahlia interests within the
               walls of the El Nido.

     Bucky eyes a Dahlia photo pinned to the wall.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Still, I remembered what Madeleine said
               when I told her we were through...

     INT. THE RED ARROW MOTEL - NIGHT

     Madeleine sits on the bed fully dressed. Bucky stands in the
     doorway.

                          MADELEINE
               You'll be back. (beat) I look like her.

     Bucky turns and leaves as we

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. KAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     where Kay and Bucky sleep in bed, locked as spoons. Safe.

                          VOICE OVER
               But sometimes Betty came to me...

     INT. THE MEAT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT - A DREAM

     Bucky watches Fritz Vogel beats the hell out of Charles
     Issler as he hangs off the meathook. In the background, Betty
     Short stands and screams:

                          BETTY SHORT
               Bucky! No! Stop him!
                   (crying)
               I'll do whatever you want...

                          ISSLER
               I'll be okay....Liz...

     Bucky turns and stares at her.

     CLOSE ON BUCKY'S BLAZING EYES

                          MILLARD (VO)
               Bucky. What is it?

     INT. THE EL NIDO - SAME

     as Bucky stares across the room at a picture of the Dahlia.
     Millard sits at the small desk, waiting for him to come back.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bucky.

     Bucky finally sees Russ again.

                          BUCKY
               You ever hear anyone refer to Betty as
               Liz? Anyone at all?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Nope.

                          BUCKY
               Issler did.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               The pimp? I thought he said he'd never
               heard of her.

                          BUCKY
               You know what else he said?

     A FLASHBACK - THE WAREHOUSE

     As Vogel cracks Issler's ribs.

                          VOGEL
               What did you know about the Dahlia's
               missing days?

                          ISSLER
               I knew you at Ad Vice--

     INT. THE POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     Harry Sears cradles the phone in his ear as he flips through
     a large metal file cabinet. Behind him the glass door reads
     in reverse: "ADMINISTRATIVE VICE'.

                          HARRY SEARS (INTO PHONE)
               N-n-no, Russ. No file on Issler. Gone.

     BACK AT THE EL NIDO - SAME

     Bucky and Russ sit in silence, thinking. They know they're
     onto something...

                          BUCKY
               Fritzie didn't give a damn about those
               other three. It was all about Issler.
               Never occurred to me before.

     Bucky gets to his feet.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Meet me back here. Late.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bright penny--

     But Bucky's already out the door.

     EXT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Bucky stakes out the dark house.

     EXT. VOGEL'S SERVICE PORCH - LATER

     Bucky slips an oil dipstick into the narrow crack of the back
     door and flips the simple hook and eyehole lock. He slides
     into the house...

     INT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     as Bucky creeps through the house until he gets to a closed
     door. He opens it, entering

     FRITZIE'S STUDY

     He stumbles along the wall until he finds a standing
     gooseneck lamp and turns it on. The walls are covered with
     pictures of Fritzie in uniform, dating back twenty-five
     years.

     Bucky bends down in front of the small mahogany desk and
     begins rifling through its file drawers. What he finds
     surprises him:

     --carbons of official LAPD intelligence reports, lists of
     account balances, financial dealings, payments made--all 
     cross-referenced to each individual being investigated.

     A veritable how-to primer on how to extort from criminals..

     Bucky digs deeper into the files and pulls out:

     ISSLER'S AD VICE FILE complete with mug shots.

                          BUCKY
               Hello, Charlie. Get lost?

     Bucky scans the file, running his finger down the list of
     names, looking for something familiar. He stops at one:
     "SALLY STINSON". Beside her name a handwritten note:
     "Biltmore Hotel".

     He writes it down and moves to another list of names: "Known 
     Associates, no Prostitution Record".

     And there it is: "Betty Short".

     INT. BUCKY'S CAR - LATER

     Bucky bops to jazz on his radio, pumped with adrenaline.

     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT

     Bucky tears through a file as Russ watches.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               So good ol' Fritzie's shaking down
               crooks, maybe sellin' 'em tip-offs before
               a roust.

                          BUCKY
               I want him nailed.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Easy, penny. They'd have to testify
               against him first. And that's not likely
               after he burns those carbons. But this
               Issler business--why hide the Issler-
               Betty connection?

                          BUCKY
                   (finding a file)
               Maybe Charlie pimped her out...to
               somebody Fritzie doesn't want us to know
               about...

     A FLASHBACK - THE WAREHOUSE

     as Fritz beats on Charlie--

                          FRITZIE
               Tell me what you know about the Dahlia's
               missing days--

     BACK TO THE EL NIDO

     Bucky reads through a letter.

                          BUCKY
               I knew it. Here. Betty writes to one of
               her phantom servicemen boyfriends:
                   (reading aloud)
               "...had drinks with a great girl, Sally
               Stinson, who thinks she way be able to
               help me get a job cocktailing..."

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Cocktailing.

                          BUCKY
               Yeah, I know. That's what made it stick
               with me...What next, padre?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You sit tight. Go hack to swingwatch. Me
               and Harry'll poke around.

                          BUCKY
                   (displeased)
               I want him.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You'll get him, too. But you've got to
               cool your temper. It's all patience with
               the big fish or they wriggle off.

     INT. KAY'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     Bucky lies awake while Kay sleeps.

                          VOICE OVER
               What kept me up that night wasn't the
               idea of Fritz Vogel extorting criminals,
               or Fritz Vogel bracing Charlie the pimp
               to see if Betty had told him something
               about one of her johns...maybe even
               Vogel, himself...No...

     A FLASHBACK - FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE

     Ellis Loew, Fritz Vogel and Bucky drink cocktails and eat
     pretzels...

                          VOICE OVER
               ...what kept me up was this thought: if
               Issler blabbed about Liz and her tricks I
               would have overheard. Fritz was confident
               he could keep me quiet.

     Ellis and Fritz clink glasses...Smile at Bucky.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               And that was an underestimation I would
               bleed him for.

     BACK IN KAY'S BED

     Her hand brushes against his cheek. He reaches for it.

     OVER THIS SCENE WE HEAR A PHONE RING AND THE FOLLOWING
     EXCHANGE.

                          BUCKY (VO)
               Hello?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               We've found her. Meet me at 1546 North
               Havenhurst in half an hour.

     INT. THE POLICE STATION - SAME

     As Bucky hangs up the phone. Trying to look casual he sidles
     over to a desk with FRITZ VOGEL on the name plate and snags a
     photo of Fritz and Johnny off the desk...

     INT. SALLY STINSON'S APARTMENT - DAY

     A worn woman in her early thirties (SALLY STINSON) sits on a
     stack of luggage, Russ and Bucky in chairs. She wears a cheap
     kimono and too much makeup for the middle of the day.

     She holds the photo of the Vogels. Shakes out her hair and
     closes her kimono a little.

                          SALLY
               I do a lot a cops, you know. Comes with
               the territory. Charlie used to say it was
               my union dues. Keep my operator's license.

     She laughs a little, trying to loosen herself up.

                          BUCK
               Ma'am. Please get to it.

                          SALLY
               Anyway. It was a full-day job. C-Note and
               a half. Kept talkin' about givin' me "The
               Big Schnitzel"...more like a cocktail
               frank once we got down to it...Well, we
               screw the whole afternoon...Go down to
               the lobby for some dinner and there's
               Liz, sittin' by herself.

                          BUCKY
               You'd hooked with her before?

                          SALLY
               Three or four times. Conventioneers. And
               lemme tell you something, I'm pretty good
               at faking it. But Liz, she was good. A
               virtuoso, Academy Award kind of stuff--

                          BUCKY
               --She do dyke?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bucky--

                          SALLY
               No. Nothing like that.

                          BUCKY
               Any porn?

                          SALLY
               No. But I bet she'd be gooood...

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Ma'am.

                          SALLY (cont'd)
               Anyway, we all get to talking...Schnitzel
               takes a liking to her and Liz tells me
               she needs the dough. So I set up a trick
               within a trick...I take a breather and
               they go at it in the bedroom. A couple
               hours later Liz left.

                          BUCKY
               Did anything unusual happen?

     Sally thinks...

                          SALLY
               I think it got a little kinky. He'd
               brought a couple toys...He may
               have...whipped her a bit.

     Russ and Bucky glance at each other, remembering lashmarks at
     the autopsy.

                          BUCKY
               Did Vogel say anything about Liz? Was he
               gonna see her again? Anything?

                          SALLY
               He said...she liked the Big Schnitzel.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Anything else, Miss Stinson?

     Her face clouds over.

                          SALLY
               Two days...after...Liz got in all the
               papers...

     She has a hard time going on.

                          BUCKY
                   (helping her out)
               Is this when your pimp Charlie confesses?

                          SALLY
                   (composing herself)
               Yeah. Bad habit. Anyways, Fritzie V.
               shows up and shakes me hard about
               Charlie, whether he'd say anything about
               Liz to the caps. Beat me bad. Real bad.

     She lifts her head. Taps her nails on the suitcases
     underneath her.

                          BUCKY
               One last time to be sure.
                   (pointing to Fritzie's picture)
               You are sure this is the man that you
               tricked with? And tricked with Liz Short?

     A puzzled look covers her face.

                          SALLY
               No mister you got it all wrong.

                          BUCKY
               But you said--

                          SALLY
               Fritz just beat me. It was Sonny me and
               Liz did. Sonny.

     She taps her finger on John Vogel's face.

                          SALLY (cont'd)
               I'd recognize that lousy fuck anywhere.

     Off Bucky and Russ' shock we

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT./INT. RUSS MILLARD'S CAR - LATER

     as they cruise the streets of skid row. While Russ talks
     Bucky fills a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE with an amber liquid...

                          RUSS MILLARD
               I'll be a chimp's priest, Buck. A chimp's
               priest--watch the air bubbles--I shoulda
               known that Johnny I d need a pro to lose
               his cherry...Never had 'em for a kink and
               a cherry, though...

     Bucky points out the window.

                          BUCKY
               There.

     OUTSIDE ON THE SIDEWALK

     Johnny Vogel wrestles with two drunks, kicking at them as
     they scamper into some trash.

                          BUCKY
                   (exiting the car)
               Johnny--

     Johnny ambles over to Bucky.

                          JOHNNY VOGEL
               Whatcha doin' in civvies, Bleichert?

     Bucky drills him in the solar plexus, doubling him over. He
     grabs Vogel by the hair and slams his head into the roof of
     the car as Johnny's lights dIm...

                                                            CUT TO:

     THE BACKSEAT OF THE CAR - SECONDS LATER

     as Russ Millard injects the needle into Johnny's arm.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. THE EL NIDO - DAY

     Johnny Vogel handcuffed to a radiator, his head bobbing back
     and forth. His eyes trying to focus on Russ and Bucky.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Pentothal's good for another couple
               hours. No way he can lie.

     Johnny's eyes drift to the pictures on the walls.

                          BUCKY
               Elizabeth Short, shitbird. Elizabeth
               fucking Short!

     Russ touches Bucky's arm, urging him to sit back.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               There's a method to this, Bucky.
                   (focusing on Johnny)
               What's your name, son?

                          JOHNNY
                   (slurring)
               You know me, loot.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Answer me anyway.

                          JOHNNY
               Vogel, John G.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               What's sixteen and fifty-two?

                          JOHNNY
               Uhmmm. Sixty-eight. Why'd you hit me
               Bleichert? I didn't do you no dirt.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Focus on January, Johnny. Your father--

                          JOHNNY
               Friedrich Vogel. Fritzie.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Yes. Fritzie. He wanted you to lose your
               cherry. He bought you a woman for two
               days. Is that right?

                          JOHNNY
               Not a woman. Not a real one. A hoooer.

     Johnny turns the syllable into a long laugh.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               This was at the Biltmore?

                          JOHNNY
               Daddy got a good rate on the room. He
               knew the house dick...This ain't right...

                          RUSS MILLARD
               We'll be done soon, Johnny. You met Liz
               Short at the Biltmore, too?

                          JOHNNY
               What's her name introduced me...the
               hooer.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               And what did you and Liz do?

                          JOHNNY
               We...played horse and rider. Gave her the
               Big Schnitz.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Did you whip her?

     Johnny thinks back, his head lolling to and fro...

                          JOHNNY
               Softly. So so softly. Horse and Rider.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Johnny. Did you kill Liz Short?

     Johnny jerks back spasmodically.

                          JOHNNY
               No no no no! I didn't kill her!

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Easy son--

                          JOHNNY
               I didn't slice her!

                          RUSS MILLARD
               It's all right...Do you know who did?
                          JOHNNY
               No! No!

     Johnny's starting to sweat. Russ and Bucky lean in...

                          RUSS MILLARD
               When your Daddy found out you'd been with
               her, he tried to fix things didn't he?

     Johnny nods yes.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
               He found out Charlie Issler had been
               picked up and he knew Charlie had this
               confessing problem, right?

                          JOHNNY
               Daddy...went to Ellis...to the Jewboy.
               Wanted to get Charlie released...but the
               Jewboy said no...Daddy had a morgue
               friend owed him a favor and got this DOA
               cooze...Daddy wanted Uncle Bill but Ellis
               Jewboy said take Bleichert.
                   (looking right at Bucky)
               Daddy said you'd do it cuz without
               Blanchard you were jelly. Said you were a
               sob sister, weak sister...

     Johnny starts laughing hysterically, shaking his chained hands
     like a zoo animal trying to get loose. Russ steps in front of
     a red-hot Bucky--

                          RUSS MILLARD
                   (to Bucky)
               I think you should go outside.

     EXT. THE FIRE ESCAPE - LATER

     Bucky sits out on the fire escape watching cars drive by.
     Russ leans out the window and hands Bucky the statement.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               His statement. Signed.

     Bucky reads it and slips it into his pocket.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               We should sit on this for a little bit.
               Until I can talk to a legal officer.

     Bucky shakes his head no, climbs back inside the window.

     INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Bucky handcuffs Johnny's hands behind his back as the big man
     cries...

                          JOHNNY
               Daddy...

                          RUSS MILLARD
                   (to Bucky)
               It's the shithouse until you retire, you
               know that.

                          BUCKY
               I owe her this one.

     He squeezes Johnny's handcuffs tighter.

     INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - BOOKING - NIGHT

     Reporters follow Bucky and Johnny inside, piqued by the sight
     of a plainclothes officer escorting a cuffed uniform inside.

                          BUCKY
               No comment...No comment...
                   (whispering in Johnny's ear)
               Tell your Daddy I know everything.
               Including his extortion deal. Tell him
               I'm goin' to the papers tomorrow.

     He approaches the desk sergeant.

                          DESK SERGEANT
               What the hell is this?

     A flashbulb goes off in their faces. Johnny sobs.

                          BUCKY
               I'm Officer Dwight Bleichert and this is
               Officer John Vogel.

     He hands over Johnny's signed statement.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Book him.

     Another flashbulb.

     EXT. CENTRAL STATION - LATER

     Bucky jogs up the steps inside.

     INT. THE LOCKER ROOM - LATER

     He dresses in his blue uniform, preparing to go back to work.

                          INTERCOM
               Officer Bleichert, go to the watch
               commander's office immediately.

     Bucky brushes imaginary dust off his shirt and grabs his hat.

     INT. LIEUTENANT JASTROW'S OFFICE - SOON AFTER

     Bucky walks in, saluting like an idealistic rookie. Jastrow
     stands, ignoring the salute.

                          JASTROW
               You're on two weeks vacation leave as of
               now. When you return to duty, report to
               Chief Green. He'll reassign you to
               another division.

                          BUCKY
               Why?

                          JASTROW
               Fritz Vogel just blew his brains out.
               That's why.

     All Bucky can think to do is salute again, rock firm. He
     walks outside and crosses into

     INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Crammed with blues awaiting roll call. They all stare at
     Bucky; he meets the eyes that seek his, making them look
     down. Defiant.

     As he passes he can hear the hisses: "Traitor". "Bolshevik".
     He continues towards the door, almost out when suddenly he
     hears applause.

     Bucky turns to see,Russ Millard, Harry Sears and Thad Green
     clapping good-bye...

     INT. THE CASTING OFFICE - DAY

     Clapstick: "Elizabeth Short Screen Test #4"

     She sits on an ugly brown sofa, sides in her hands. Silence.

                          MAN #4 (O.S.)
               Are you all right, Miss Short?

     She looks up, seeing the camera as if for the first time.

                          MAN #4 (cont'd)
               Why don't you just...talk.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               What do you mean?

                          MAN #4
               Put the sides down. Just...talk to me.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               What would you like to talk about?

                          MAN #4
               I don't know...Anything...Do you have a
               boyfriend?

     FADE OUT

     EXT. THE SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT

     Kay and Bucky sit on a bench, looking out at the water.

                          KAY
               I could take sick days. Maybe a trip to
               Santa Barbara, or even a drive to San
               Francisco...

                          BUCKY
               Kay.

                          FAY
               You don't owe him a thing, Bucky. I know
               you won't believe me. But you've more
               than repaid him already.

     He looks at her and she knows it's useless.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               When?

                          BUCKY
               First thing.

     She takes his hand.

                          KAY
               You're a fool, Dwight.

     EXT. THE SAN DIEGO FREEWAY - LATE MORNING

     as Bucky crosses the border into Mexico.

                          VOICE OVER
               I closed out my glory days the only way I
               knew how--I chased the gone man.

     EXT. TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

     Bucky hands out pennies and nickels to locals, flashing both
     his badge and snapshots of Lee.

                                                            CUT TO:

     BUCKY AND AN ENTOURAGE OF TRAILING LOCALS

     as Bucky tries to shake them, pulling out his pockets to show
     them he has no more coins.

                                                            CUT TO:

     BUCKY QUESTIONING TIJUANA COPS

     graduating from small change to one dollar bills. Same of
     them seem to have stories to tell.

                          VOICE OVER
               I got headshakes, bullshit broadsides and
               a strange series of tales that rang true.
               One had "el blanco explosivo" beating the
               shit out of three jack rollers, then
               buying off the cops with double-saws
               peeled from a large roll.
               Another had Lee donating 200 scoots to a
               leper ministry priest and then driving to
               Ensenada.

     EXT - THE COASTAL ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

     as Bucky drives South, passing a sign which says "ENSENADA
     60 MI."

     He passes a cluster of families walking on the side of the
     road. They carry suitcases and head North.

     EXT. THE COAST ROAD - NEAR ENSENADA

     Bucky approaches Ensenada. The trickle of families headed
     north has now becoming a roadside migration march. Every
     fifth of sixth marcher carries a torch or lantern.

     EXT. THE CITY LIMITS OF ENSENADA - NIGHT

     Bucky cruises slowly into town and the most blatant shakedown
     he's ever seen:

     Rurales in brownshirts walk from peasant to peasant in the
     northbound migration line, taking money and attaching tags to
     their shoulders with staple guns; plainclothes cops sell bags
     of beef jerky and dried fruit, putting coins into dispensers
     attached to their belts.

     Two Rurales pull a man out of line and beat him senseless
     with the butts of their sawed-off shotguns.

                          VOICE OVER
               I decided it would be wise to check in
               with the law before going out to question
               the Ensenada citizenry.

     EXT. THE ENSENADA POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     Bucky stands outside a converted church with the word POLICIA
     painted in black over religious scenes.

     INT. THE POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     Velvet wall hangings depicting Jesus decorate the entrance
     hall. Blackshirts lounge on converted pews, a huge carved
     cross on the front desk betrays its altar origins.

     Bucky slides the Rurale at the desk his badge and a dollar.
     The man saunters off down the hall.

     INT. THE POLICE CHIEF'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

     as Bucky is escorted in. The man sitting behind the desk
     looks up. In flawless English:

                          CAPTAIN VASQUEZ
               Officer Bleichert. Come in, please. I'm
               Captain Vasquez. How can I help you?

     Bucky exchanges his badge for a photo of Lee.

                          BUCKY
               This man's LAPD. He's been missing in
               Mexico since January. He was last seen
               headed here.

     Vasquez studies the photo. Bucky senses a twitch...

                          CAPTAIN VASQUEZ
               No. I'm afraid not. I'll ask my men,
               however. Staying the night?

                          BUCKY
               At least.

                          VASQUEZ
               Are you here alone?

                          BUCKY
               I have two partners waiting for me in
               Tijuana.

     Vasquez nods, hard to know if he believes Bucky any more than
     Bucky believes him.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               If you don't mind I'll check back in the
               morning.

                          CAPTAIN VASQUEZ
               Please.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. A FLEABAG MOTEL ROOM - LATER

     Bucky squeezes a bit of brown water onto a handkerchief and
     wipes his brow off. He kicks his travel bag underneath the
     bed and heads out.

     EXT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     as Bucky pulls two hairs from his head and spit-glues them to
     the door jamb.

     EXT. THE ENSENADA STREETS - NIGHT

     Garish neon, military personnel. Brownshirts packing serious
     weapons keeping the mostly white street crowd in order.

     HIS POV: An adobe streetfront with a neon sign: "CLUB BOXEO".
     Bucky goes inside.

     INT. THE CLUB BOXEO - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky finds a brightly lit room filled with sailors and half-
     dressed Mexican strippers. He stands on his tip-toes trying
     to see over the crowd to find somebody with the air of
     proprietor.

     Cn a far wall: boxing publicity stills. He wanders over.

     CLOSE ON THE WALL OF STILLS:

     A row of light-heavies: Gus Lesnevich, Billy Conn, and Bucky. 
     Three stills over, next to Joe Louis, is Lee's photo. They
     all look so young...So good...

     An old voice in English breaks his reverie:

                          OLD MAN
               Bleichert? Jesus. First Blanchard, then
               you. Who's next? Willie Pep?

     Bucky wheels and finds himself face to face with an old man.

                          BUCKY
               Blanchard? You've seen him? When?

                          OLD MAN
               Couple months ago. Heavy rains in
               February. Musta talked fights for ten
               hours straight. You know Blanchard thinks
               the feathers are the best division? me,
               it's the middies for sure. La Motta,
               Graziano--

                          BUCKY
               Is he still in town?

                          OLD MAN
               Don't think so. I own this place. He
               ain't been back. You lookin' for a
               rematch?

                          BUCKY
               I'm looking to get him out of a shitload
               of trouble.

     The old pug looks him up and down.

                          OLD MAN
               Well. I'll tell ya the little I know.
               Heard he caused a ruckus over at the Club
               Satan, had to bribe his way out big with
               Captain Vasquez. Talk to Ernie the cook.
               Tell him I said to be kosher with you.

                          BUCKY
               Thank you.

                          OLD MAN
               You ain't been in there.

     INT. CLUB SATAN - LATER

     Bucky walks into the biggest sewer you have ever seen. The
     bar is a urinal trough where marines and sailors masturbate
     while going down on nude women squatting on the bartop. Blow
     jobs are being dispensed underneath tables facing the
     bandstand.

     Up on the stage a man in a Satan costume is fucking a woman
     on a mattress. Next to him, a donkey with red velvet horns
     pinned to his head eats hay out of a bowl while drunken
     servicemen shout "Donkey! Donkey!"

     Bucky is accosted by a disgusting old woman.

                          OLD WOMAN
               You wan' the bar, handsome? Breakfast of
               champions, one dollar. Round the world,
               two dollars.

                          BUCKY
               Ernie. I need to see Ernie.

                          OLD WOMAN
               Vamanos!

     And grabs him by the arm...

     INT. THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     ERNIE, a half-Mexican half-Chinese man, stands next to a huge
     vat of stew. Bucky flashes Lee's photo.

                          BUCKY
               I heard this man gave you some trouble a
               while back.

                          ERNIE
               Who wants to know?

     Bucky flashes his badge, giving him a glimpse of his gun.

                          ERNIE
               You his friend?

                          BUCKY
               He's my best friend.

     The chef tucks his hands into his aprons, fidgeting.

                          ERNIE
               Your friend drink fourteen shots of my
               best Mescal, a house record. That I like.
               He make toasts to dead women. That I don't
               mind. But he try to fuck with my donkey
               show, and that I don't take.

                          BUCKY
               What happened?

                          ERNIE
               Four of my guys he take, the fifth he
               don't. Rurales take him home to sleep it
               off.

                          BUCKY
               That's it?

     Ernie casually pulls a switchblade out of his apron and
     scratches the back of his neck with it.

                          ERNIE
               Finito.

     EXT. THE CLUB SATAN - LATER

     Bucky walks outside and begins weaving his way back through
     the crowds. Out of the corner of his eye he catches a couple
     Rurales who seem to have taken an interest in him.

     He dodges down an alley and cuts down another street,
     breaking into a slow jog.

     EXT. ANOTHER STREET - SECONDS LATER

     Bucky walks backwards, checking the crowd. He's lost them.

     INT. THE FLEABAG MOTEL - LATER

     Bucky stands in front of his door. He runs his finger up and
     down the door jamb. The hairs are gone.

     With one swift kick he breaks down the door.

     INT. THE MOTEL ROOM - SECONDS LATER

     A white man stands with his hands raised.

                          MAN
               Whoa, Bleichert. I'm a friend--

     Bucky gestures with his gun for the man to hit the wall. He
     frisks him, pulling out a wallet and tossing on the bed.

                          MAN (cont'd)
               Milton Dolphine, citizen of San Diego and
               a licensed private dick. I got seventy
               bucks in there but that money's jackshit
               compared to what Blanchard was holding.
               You go partners with me and it's easy
               street--

     Bucky kicks the man's legs out and pushes his to the floor.

                          BUCKY
               You tell me all of it and you watch what
               you say about my partner, or it's a B&E
               roust and the Ensenada jail.

     Dolphine pulls himself up.

                          DOLPHINE
               You mean Vasquez? How do you think I knew
               to follow you? He's got a vested interest
               in you not finding out about Blanchard.

     Bucky eyes the door.

                          BUCKY
               Does he know I'm staying here?

                          DOLPHINE
               No.

     Bucky steps back from Dolphine.

                          BUCKY
               So. Let's hear it.

                          DOLPHINE
               About a month ago this Mexican woman
               shows up at my office in Dago. Chubby,
               ten tons a makeup, but dressed to the
               nines. Offers me five hundred to find
               Blanchard. Just like you I track him here
               where he's playing the rich gringo--

     A FLASHBACK - LEE TEARING UP AN ENSENADA BAR

                          DOLPHINE
               I even see him beat up two spics who
               insult this Senorita--Rurales stand by
               and do nothing. So I know he's paying
               protection dough. A lot of it. Then  I
               hear he paid off two plainclothes Rurale
               to snuff a coupla guys in TJ--

     A FLASHBACK - BOBBY DE WITT AND FELIX CASCO BLOWN AWAY...

                          DOLPHINE
               I leave a message in Dago for the woman
               tellin' her what I know...

                          BUCKY
               What's her name?

                          DOLPHINE
               Delores Garcia. But it was obviously a
               phony. Casco ran with some rich bimbos
               and I'm betting she's one of his. Revenge
               on Blanchard for offin' Felix.

     Bucky tightens his grip on the slats of a wooden chair. This
     is hitting him hard.

                          BUCKY
               Go on.

                          DOLPHINE
               I come back to Ensenada on my own,
               thinking about all that cash he was
               flashing.

     Bucky's jaw clenches.

                          DOLPHINE (cont'd)
               You wanna hear this?

                          BUCKY
               Go on.

                          DOLPHINE
               Blanchard's dead. Bullet in the cabeza.
               (beat) Rumor is they never found any
               money.

     Bucky's head begins to reel...

                          DOLPHINE (cont'd)
               Maybe the Rurales. Maybe that woman or
               friends of hers. Who knows? I figured
               Blanchard was rogue, figured someone like
               you'd come lookin' for him. Maybe have a
               line on where the cash was. You knew
               Blanchard, maybe we can--

     Bucky backhands Dolphine hard, knocking him off the chair.

                          DOLPHINE (cont'd)
               Look I didn't know it was personal! Don't
               hit me again--

     Bucky has his gun out, leveled at Dolphine.

                          BUCKY
               Prove it to me. Prove it!

     EXT. THE BACKROADS OF ENSENADA - NIGHT

     Dolphine drives his car while Bucky trains his gun on him.

     They come over a ridge and find themselves on a big bluff
     overlooking the ocean. A HUGE WOODEN BURNING CROSS marks the
     spot.

                          DOLPHINE
               The locals keep the damn thing lit up.
               They got a lotta missing relatives.

                          BUCKY
               You got a shovel?

                          DOLPHINE
               Gardening tools--

                          BUCKY
               Good enough.

     EXT. THE BLUFF - LATER

     Bucky scavenges a spare piece of picket fence, wraps it in a
     rag and lights a torch off of the cross. Dolphine kicks at a
     filthy American flag in the sand.

                          DOLPHINE
               Here. Supposed to be near el bannero.

                                                            CUT TO:

     A SMALL SHOVEL PUSHING INTO THE GROUND

     as Dolphine digs at gun point. After a few strokes the crunch
     of the shovel hitting bone.

     Bucky terrified to look but has to know--

     --a white jumper--

                          DOLPHINE
               Sailor's uniform. It's a sailor...

     Bucky breathes out hard. Unbearable. Dolphine digs on,
     pushing the corpse out of the way and digging further into he
     sand.

     Bucky can't stand the suspense. He tucks his gun into his
     waistband and grabs the shovel. After a few more strokes the
     thump of something solid.

     And suddenly it's there--sunburned pink skin, blond hair and
     stitch scars on the eyebrows.

     Lee Blanchard. Lee Blanchard. Lee Blanchard.

     And Bucky's in Dolphine's truck while Dolphine's screaming
     for him to wait and Bucky slams the truck in reverse,
     knocking the burning cross to the ground and grinding out out
     of the sand onto the road, heading north and leaving Dolphine
     and Lee alone at the grave...Heading north like a refugee...

     EXT. KAY'S HOUSE - DAWN

     Bucky's car rolls up slowly as he kills the engine, trying
     not to make any noise.

     The sun comes up, illuminating Bucky's filthy face as he
     watches the picture-perfect house, wishing time would stand
     still. Or better yet, wishing it would go back...

     Finally he gets out of the car and begins a long walk into
     the house.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     A LAPD CHAPLAIN READING SOLEMNLY FROM A BIBLE

     But as the camera PULLS BACK we see Bucky in his dress blues
     standing next to Kay in a wedding dress.

     EXT. THE BACKYARD OF KAY'S HOUSE

     Russ Millard and Harry Sears stand by as the only two guests.

                          VOICE OVER
               Lee and Kay had lived in sin; not because
               their shack job was against department
               regs, but because the ghosts of their
               past had forced them to choose between
               love and passion, the veneer of a "fairy
               tale" only a band-aid for a fractured
               life.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     LEE AND KAY DANCING TOGETHER

     as Harry and Russ drink from a punch bowl...

                          VOICE OVER
               Our true vows were made in private; bury
               the past, bury our ghosts, and as Kay
               said, "bury that fucking girl"...

     ANOTHER LAPD TRANSFER FORM: "Officer Dwight
     Bleichert...Reassigned to: Scientific investigation
     Detail"

     INT. THE LAPD SCIENCE LAB - DAY

     Bucky with plastic gloves on typing blood with an eye dropper
     and a test tube. Meticulous and boring.

     News radio plays in the background...

     A Detective pokes his head in:

                          DETECTIVE
               Bleichert? You got those prints for me?

     Bucky pulls a file out of a stack and gives it to him. The
     nonchalance of a man whose job has become routine.

                          DETECTIVE (cont'd)
               Thanks. We gotta hot one I think.

     Bucky smiles politely and returns to his desk. The radio:

                          ANNOUNCER
               ...results in the 1948 Republican primary
               are final...John Dougdale trouncing D.A.
               Ellis Loew 64% to 36%...In county
               primaries...

     This gets a smile from Bucky as he returns to his test tubes
     and beakers.

     INT. AN APARTMENT - CRIME SCENE - DAY

     Detectives comb through a murder scene as Bucky collects
     latent fingerprints off doorknobs. No one pays him any
     attention. He's been relegated to the worst kind of
     purgatory.

     INT. THE KITCHEN - MORNING

     Bucky and Kay drink coffee and read the morning paper. She
     absently strokes his free hand.

     Bucky intently reads the front page.

     The headline reads: "CITY COUNCIL INVESTIGATES '20s BOOM
     BARONS FOR SHODDY HOME CONSTRUCTION".

     Underneath, a picture of Sprague and Mack Sennett posing in
     front of the HOLLYWOODLAND sign.

     He's startled by Kay tapping her finger on the photo.

                          KAY
               That reminds me of something, Dwight.

     Bucky tries to hide his panic.

                          BUCKY
               What?

                          KAY
               Floorboard's loose near the closet. Think
               you could fix it?

                          BUCKY
                   (relieved)
               Sure, babe.

     The phone rings. Bucky answers it.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Hello...Hey Vic...

     Bucky writes something on a piece of paper. Hangs up.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Gotta go. Work-up on a probable gunshot
               suicide.

                          KAY
               Sounds lovely. Where is it?

                          BUCKY
               Hancock Park.

     EXT. A COLONIAL MANSION - JUNE STREET - MORNING

     Bucky rings the bell. He's dressed plainclothes and carries a 
     technician's canvas bag.

     An attractive woman in her early fifties opens the door.

                          WOMAN
               Yes?

                          BUCKY
               I'm Officer Bleichert. LAPD. My I express
               my condolences, Mrs.--

                          WOMAN
               Jane Chambers. Condolences accepted.
               You're the lab man?

     He nods yes. She lets him in and he follows.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               It's the study in back of the dining
               room. You'll see the police rope. If
               you'll excuse me, I'll be in my garden.

     He notices for the first time she's dressed for gardening.

     INT. THE STUDY - MORNING

     Bucky steps over the police rope and into the study. A large
     desk chair lies overturned an the ground next to A TAPE
     OUTLINE OF A BODY. Three feet away lies A SHOTGUN.

     Behind the chair the brown spattering of blood and brains
     decorates the white wall and crown mouldings.

                                                            CUT TO:

     A SERIES OF SHOTS

     as Bucky measures the splatter marks on the walls, scrapes
     tissue from the muzzle of the gun, dusts it for latent
     prints, etc. At the end he wraps the gun in a plastic bag.

     INT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     as Bucky steps over the police rope and walks back towards
     the main foyer. He stops short.

     ON THE OPPOSING WALL

     hangs a disturbing PAINTING: the portrait of a clown, a young
     boy done up in court jester's garb. His body is gnarled and 
     hunched. He wears a stuporous ear-to-ear smile that looks
     like one continuous deep scar.

     It is eerily reminiscent of Elizabeth Short's death wound.

     Spooked, Bucky pulls his eyes away and settles them on nearby
     family photos--two young women linked arm in arm.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               The other survivors. Pretty aren't they?

     She arrives next to him, dusty with soil.

                          BUCKY
               Like their mother. How old are they?

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Twenty-one and twenty-three. Are you
               finished in the study?

                          BUCKY
               Yes. Tell whoever cleans it up to use
               pure ammonia...
                   (looking at the two girls)
               Mrs. Chambers--

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Jane.

                          BUCKY
               Jane, do you know Madeleine and Martha
               Sprague? The next block over?

                          JANE CHAMBERS
                   (snorts)
               Those girls and that family. How do you
               know them?

                          BUCKY
               I did a little work for them once.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Consider it lucky if it was a brief
               encounter.

                          BUCKY
               How do you mean?

     The hallway phone rings. Jane moves to answer it.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Back to condolences. Thank you for being
               so nice, Mr.--

                          BUCKY
               Bucky. Good-bye, Jane.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Good-bye.

     INT. THE CRIME LAB - LATER

     Bucky writes up a report. VIC pokes his head in.

                          VIC
               You finish working up the suicide, Bucky?

                          BUCKY
               Yeah. Pretty routine. Whattya know about
               the husband?

                          VIC
               Eldridge Chambers? Widow said he was
               depressed, failing health. The terrible
               burden of all that money'll get you every
               time.

                          BUCKY
               Wonder how he made it?

                          VIC
               No mystery there. Real estate.

                          BUCKY
               Oh really?

     INT. THE GARAGE - EVENING

     The garage door is open to the evening air. Bucky's heavy bag
     and speed bag hang on hooks. Bucky leans against a stool, a
     large box open on the work bench.

     INSIDE THE BOX

     Bucky brushes aside a clutter of junk and pulls out A PHOTO
     ALBUM. He opens it and begins flipping through: articles and
     photos concerning Elizabeth Short. MOSTLY PHOTOS.

     It's like a man in a mid-life crisis fantasizing about his
     high school sweetheart.

     OFF ONE OF THE PHOTOS WE DISSOLVE TO:

     ANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION

     "Elizabeth Short...Screen Test #5"

     She rambles on, almost oblivious of the camera.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               ...I had a fiance, Captain Matt Durand.
               He was in a tank battalion. A Commander.
               He had...the fiercest blue eyes. Like the
               deep water you see from a fishing boat...

     She's lost in thought...we're not sure whether this is a
     scene, her real life, or just a sad lie...

     THE NOISE OF A CAR APPROACHING

     BACK TO SCENE

     Bucky drops the album back in the box as Kay's car pulls into
     the driveway. He covers it back up.

                          KAY
                   (getting out)
               What're you doing?

                          BUCKY
               I'm...looking for the hammer.

     She points over his shoulder to the hammer hanging in plain
     view.

     INT. THE BEDROOM - LATER

     Bucky kneels on the ground near the closet, toolbox next to
     him. He pulls on the floorboard, it flexes and squeaks.

     He uses the hammer to pull the board completely off. He
     squeezes wood glue around the edges and is about to replace
     the board when something under the floor catches his eye.

     He reaches into the hole, pulling out STACKS OF HUNDRED
     DOLLAR BILLS BOUND WITH RUBBER BANDS.

     He spies another scrap of paper in the hole...

     INT. THE KITCHEN - SAME

     Kay pours two scotches.

                          KAY
               Dwight?

     She carries the scotches into the bedroom and finds Dwight
     sitting on the floor, staring at thousands of dollars in
     cash.

     He holds a paper money band inscribed: "$100...Boulevard-
     Citizens Bank..."

                          KAY (cont'd)
               Oh. I...always wondered where he kept it.

     THE BOULEVARD-CITIZENS BANK HEIST - A FLASHBACK

     A SHOTGUN BLAST shatters the back window of the armored
     truck. In the front seat, LEE BLANCHARD ducks down as the
     driver hits the gas...

     BACK ON THE SCENE

     as Bucky leans back against the bed.

                          BUCKY
               Were you ever going to tell me?

                          KAY
               He'd given all his money to Ben Siegel.
               (beat) He wanted to give me a home.

     A FLASHBACK - LEE'S CAR

     Lee and Bucky, their first day as partners...

                          LEE
               ...said I'd get a shot at Joe Louis if
               I'd take two dives for him. I said no...

     BACK ON THE SCENE

     as Bucky looks straight up into the ceiling light...

                          BUCKY
               Were you ever going to tell me?

                          KAY
               He knew what Bobby was doing to me...How
               he'd used a razor on me...pimped me to
               his friends...

     INT. DEWITT'S APARTMENT - A FLASHBACK

     as Lee plants the incriminating bank bags in DeWitt's closet...

     BACK ON THE SCENE

     Bucky staring back into the hole in the floor...

                          KAY
               ...Bobby know nothing about the bank job.
               He and Lee, they never even met. After
               Lee and his driver got away, Lee figured
               framing Bobby'd give me a way out...

     EXT. DEWITT'S TRIAL - FLASHBACK

     Lee leads Kay out of the courtroom.

     BACK ON THE SCENE

     as Kay leans down next to Bucky, gently putting her hand on
     his shoulder...

                          KAY
               Then last year...the fourth man--the
               driver--he heard Bobby was getting
               paroled. He threatened to tell DeWitt
               that Lee framed him. He wanted money we
               didn't have. Ten thousand dollars.

                          BUCKY
               Ever. Were you ever...?

                          KAY
               Promise me this: Forgive him for DeWitt.
               Forgive him for the bank. It doesn't
               matter anymore. Not to us.

                          BUCKY
               Who was the driver, Kay? Tell me. Tell
               me!

     He's in her face now. Okay, pal, you asked for it.

                          KAY
               Baxter Fitch.

     EXT. THE STREET - A FLASHBACK

     Three black man and a white man get rousted by Lee and Bucky.

                          BAXTER FITCH
               Blanchard?

     Chaos erupts as Lee executes Baxter Fitch and Bucky kills two
     others...

     BACK TO THE SCENE

     on Bucky's anguished face:

                          KAY (cont'd)
               He used you, Dwight. He did. Forgive him
               everything else. But don't forgive him
               for that. Ever.

     She reaches for his face and he pulls away.

     SLO-MO CLOSE-UP...

     as the crumpled money drops down into the hole in the floor,
     into the blackness...

     WE FADE UP TO:

     INT. THE GARAGE - NIGHT

     Bucky, stripped to bare chest, attacks the heavy beg.

                          VOICE OVER
               Fire and Ice. The hero and the snitch.
               Bank robber and his best friend the
               bumfuck detective. Triggerman. Stooge.
               Weak point in a fairy tale triangle.

     He lashes into the heavy bag with a series of brutal left
     hooks. Kay stands in the door, watching him. Her eyes red
     from crying.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               I would forgive Lee the bank job. And I
               thought I'd forgive Kay her role in
               keeping it from me. But the basic rule of
               Homicide applied: Nothing stays buried
               forever. Corpses. Ghosts. Nothing stays
               buried forever. Nothing.

     Kay turns around and shuts the door behind her.

     EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S GARDEN - DAY

     Bucky and Jane drink iced tea. A glorious garden behind them.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               So. What brings you around again?
               Considering a courtin' the old rich
               widow?

                          BUCKY
               You're not that old. And you're not very
               widowed.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               You either are or you aren't.

                          BUCKY
               You seem to be doing all right.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Eldridge had cancer. I half expected it.
               We weren't that close anymore...You married?

                          BUCKY
               Little over a year.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               God. Newlyweds. Nothing better, is there?

     Bucky's face betrays his difficulties.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               Sorry.

                          BUCKY
               So how well do you know the Spragues?

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Eldridge and Emmett went way back. They
               served on the California real estate
               board together. But Emmett was a bit of a
               crook. My husband got him kicked off the
               board for building dangerous buildings
               under phony corporations.

                          BUCKY
               Your husband sounds like a good man.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               He had his moments. Most of it was out of
               guilt. He owned slum blocks in San Pedro.
               When he learned he had cancer, he really
               started feeling guilty. He voted
               Democratic last year. Even went in and
               had meetings with the City Council. I'm
               sure he gave them dirt on Emmett.

                          BUCKY
               I read an article in the paper.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Same day Eldridge killed himself.
               Apropos, I guess.

                          BUCKY
               Maybe your husband--

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               My husband was rich and did a mean
               Charleston. I loved him until I found out
               he was cheating on me. Now I'm starting
               to love him again. How strange.

                          BUCKY
               It's not so strange.

     They watch each other, enjoying each other's company. A
     strange emotional peace.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               You're very accepting of other people's
               frailties. You're young. You should have
               illusions.

                          BUCKY
               I'm a cop. Illusions aren't standard
               issue.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               So how'd a cop get mixed up with
               Madeleine Sprague? It was Madeleine, I
               assume?

     Bucky's gut clenches.

                          BUCKY
               I stopped her at a red light. One thing
               led to another. Why do you assume it was
               Madeleine?

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Don't play dumb, Bucky. The girl's a
               roundheels. Always has been.

                          BUCKY
               Jane. Don't be catty.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               I'm sorry. She can't help it I'm sure.
               She probably inherited it from her
               mother.

     Before Bucky can press Jane stands up with the tray of iced
     tea. The visit is over.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               You figure out the rest, officer.

     He follows her back inside.

     INT. THE HALLWAY - SAME

     As they stop momentarily in front of the scary clown painting.

                          BUCKY
               God that is spooky.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Valuable, too. Eldridge bought it for my
               birthday a couple years ago. I hate it.
               Want to take it with you?

                          BUCKY
               No thanks.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Thank you, then. You were my best
               condoler.

                          BUCKY
               And you mine.

     Jane gives Bucky a warm handshake.

     EXT. THE STREET - HANCOCK PARK - SOON AFTER

     Bucky pulls out of June Street, and passes Muirfield. He
     slows for a moment, squinting down the street, trying to
     discern the Sprague mansion. He drives on.

     We hang on the sign for Muirfield Avenue as the day turns to
     night...

     And down Muirfield Road, we see Bucky's car parked in the
     shadows. Watching the Sprague house. A voyeur.

     INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

     Bucky sleeps soundly as Kay readies herself for work. She
     watches him for a moment, considering whether to wake him.
     She decides not to and leaves.

     The minute she goes, Bucky opens his eyes...

     EXT. MUIRFIELD ROAD - HANCOCK PARK - EVENING

     Bucky spies on the Spragues. He digs back into his seat as
     Madeleine comes down the walk and puts mail in the mail box.
     Just for a second it looks like she sees him...maybe not...

     INT. CRIME LAB - DAY

     Bucky dozes, his tie almost catching on fire in a Bunsen
     burner.

     EXT. THE MUIRFIELD ROAD STAKEOUT - EVENING

     Bucky leans against the window, propping himself up.

     ACROSS THE STREET

     Madeleine's Packard pulls out and roars up the street. Bucky
     guns his car to follow...

     EXT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT

     Bucky follows the Packard into a crowded GI bar parking lot.
     He parks a distance away. But as he watches Madeleine get out
     of her car he is staggered:

     It's ELIZABETH SHORT.

     Or, more accurately, it's Madeleine dressed up exactly like
     the Dahlia in one of her famous portrait photos. Slinky black
     dress, upswept hair, down to the yellow barrette. She strides
     into the bar...

     INT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT

     Bucky ducks into a smoke-filled GI bar where a commotion is
     already taking place.

     Madeleine is surrounded by soldiers fawning all over her.
     Other men simply point and whisper--her Dahlia act isn't lost
     on anybody.
     Bucky slides into a booth in the corner to watch. He signals
     for a drink.

     INT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

     Four bourbons later. Bucky watches as Madeleine settles into
     a more intimate conversation with one soldier. Bucky downs
     his drink as Madeleine grabs the GI's elbow and escorts him
     out of the bar.

     EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER

     Bucky sits in his car in the parking lot watching the soldier
     loiter outside of A motel room. Madeleine returns from the
     office with the key and lets the two of them in.

     He watches as the light goes on; and then off.

     INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S BEDROOM - LATER

     Bucky comes into the bedroom to find Kay waiting up for him.

                          KAY
               Dwight--

     He moves to her, pulling off his clothes as quickly as he
     can.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               Dwight--

     He's on top of her, his bourbon stained kisses go and down
     her neck and her breasts.

     She responds, but not quickly enough for him. He rushes into
     her before she's ready. Still, she tries to be there for him,
     hoping to catch up with his lust.

     She doesn't. And they both know it. They embrace, trying to
     cover up the hollow awkwardness with familiar affection.

     It doesn't work...

     INT. THAD GREEN'S OFFICE - DAY

     Bucky sits at Thad Green's desk, penitent.

                          THAD GREEN
               SID's not a bad beat, Bucky. At the time
               it was better than you deserved.

     Bucky nods.

                          THAD GREEN (cont'd)
               The blues hate you, Bucky. Vogel was
               their pal. I do this for you, you better
               be fucking supercop.

     Bucky just sits silent.

     ANOTHER LAPD TRANSFER ORDER: "Transfer order...Officer
     Bleichert...From SID...to Newton Street Division,
     Nightwatch.

     EXT. NEWTON STREET - MIDNIGHT

     Bucky back in uniform again. This time, the black slums.
     Heroin hookers, hard-core dealers, gangs.

                          VOICE OVER
               Newton Street Division. Footbeat hacks
               carried metal-studded saps; squadroom
               dicks packed .45 automatics loaded with
               unregulation dum-dums.

     INT. A LIQUOR STORE DOORWAY - NIGHT

     Bucky and a large black man come tumbling out of the liquor
     store throwing vicious punches at each other.

     Bucky takes three to land six, eventually knocking the guy
     out. He looks across the street to see to cops watching him,
     measuring him.

     INT. AN ALLEY - NIGHT

     As Bucky chases two men towards a chain link fence at the end
     of the alley. One of them gets to the fence and scrambles up
     it. Bucky yanks the other one off the fence, slamming him to
     the ground.

                          VOICE OVER
               Kay. Lee. Madeleine. Betty Short. For one
               month I escaped them all.

     INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     As Kay sleeps alone in the bed.

                          VOICE OVER
               A fucking supercop.

     INT. A JAZZ BAR - EARLY MORNING

     Bucky sits in his uniform listening to a jazz quartet.

     INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

     Bucky sleeps on the couch as Kay leaves for work.

                          VOICE OVER
               I escaped them all. Almost.

     EXT. A STREET CORNER - NIGHT

     Bucky in his patrol car. The night a hot sweat. He listens to
     music on his radio and watches two hookers dance on the
     corner, waving at cars.

     A SCRAGGLY OLD WINO staggers up to the women, stumbling
     around them, dancing with them. They sneer at him, tell him
     to beat it.

     INSIDE THE PATROL CAR

     Bucky flashes his headlights at the bum. The bum ignores him.
     Bucky flashes them again, annoyed.

     The bum looks into the glare and flips Bucky off.

     And suddenly Bucky snaps, jumping from his car. In three big
     strides he's on the bum, clobbering him with roundhouse lefts
     and rights.

     The women are screaming. The drunk is screaming.

                          OLD DRUNK
               Pleease!

     Bucky drops him, staggering into a phone booth. He drops a
     nickel in the phone. Dials a number. Ring. Ring. Ring...

     He hangs up. Dials another. A woman's voice answers.

                          BUCKY
               It's me.

     EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - NIGHT

     Bucky's just onto the porch steps when Madeleine answers the
     door. She's dressed like the Dahlia.

     He pushes her inside.

                          VOICE OVER
               It was a reunion of avowed tramps, old
               rutters who knew they'd never have it as
               good with anyone else...
               Afterwards we'd talk through the night.
               The Spragues...Crazy Papa Bleichert...

     INT. AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

     Sixth graders write in silence. Kay sits at her desk, sadness
     in her eyes as she watches the children.

                          VOICE OVER
               Mostly, though we'd talk about Betty. Her
               utter malleability, a chameleon eager to
               please anybody...and the disrupter of
               every life close to me...It would last a
               month.

     INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - MORNING

     Bucky stands in the living room, examining family photos. A
     photo of two young, proud WWI vets: George Tilden and Emmett 
     Sprague...A photo of the dark-haired Ramona and the ruddy and
     fair-haired Emmett...Photos of Madeleine and Martha, the
     brunette and the ruddy blond...Back to the first photo:
     George Tilden's dark hair.

     Madeleine wanders in, Bucky smiles at her.

                          MADELEINE
               What?

                          BUCKY
               Nothing.

     She runs her hands over his shoulders.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               I thought the family came back from
               Laguna this week.

                          MADELEINE
                   (her Scottish brogue)
               You miss 'em, laddie? Mother's insults?
               Martha's pornography...

                          BUCKY
               Your father's Georgie Tilden war stories?

     He scans her for a reaction. If she has one it ripples
     through her almost undetectable. Almost.

     EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - LATER

     As Bucky cruises by, grinning. He salutes the house.

                          VOICE OVER
               In the scheme of things it wasn't much.
               Rich old lady gossip, as Jane put it.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. BUCKY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

     as he drives onto his own modest street.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               But combine it with banging Madeleine in
               all twenty-two rooms of their mansion, it
               was good enough for me.

     EXT. KAY AND BUCKY'S HOUSE - DAY

     A moving van in the driveway and Kay's Plymouth stuffed with
     boxes. Bucky double-parks and bolts up the steps.

     The van pulls away behind him.

                          BUCKY
                   (to the van driver)
               Hey! Goddammit! Get back here!

     The van driver ignores him; Bucky turns as Kay walks out onto
     the porch.

                          KAY
               I didn't touch your things. You can have
               the furniture.

                          BUCKY
               Babe--

                          KAY
               Did you think I'd let my husband
               disappear for three weeks and do nothing
               about it? I've had detectives following
               you, Dwight. Detectives. She looks like
               that fucking dead girl, so you can have
               her--not me.

                          BUCKY
               Babe. Goddammit.

     He reaches for her and she backs out of grabbing range.

                          KAY
               Whoremonger. Coward. Necrophile.

     She spins out of his grasp and makes for her car. She guns
     the engine and disappears.

     INT. THE HOUSE - SECONDS LATER

     Bucky stands in the middle of the living room, cataloguing
     the little things. No periodicals on the coffee table, half
     the record collection gone, no candlesticks.

     He picks up the largest chair (Lee's favorite) and throws it
     at the wall. Next, Kay's rocking chair shatters the glass
     cabinets. The coffee table goes through the front window.

     IN THE BEDROOM

     Bucky yanks out all the drawers, turns over the bed.

     IN THE BATHROOM

     he takes a pipe wrench to the sink, crushes the mirror with
     one blow...

     In a terrible ten rounder with the ghosts of his past Bucky
     demolishes the dream house, pulls his uniforms out of the
     closet and bolts out of the house, leaving the door open so
     scavengers can pick the place clean...

     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT

     Bucky sits on the bed, his back pushed up against the wall.
     Eyeball to eyeball with Elizabeth Short, Betty, Liz, the
     Black Dahlia.

     A collage of photos and file folders...

                          VOICE OVER
               It came on then, big and ugly: bye-bye
               Bleichert at the bus stop, adios
               shitbird, has-been, never-was, stool
               pigeon harness bull.

     EXT. THE SLUMS - LATE NIGHT

     Bucky stands in the worst of slums, his blue uniform a beacon
     to anyone who would do him harm.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               You traded a good woman for skunk pussy,
               you've turned everything that's been
               handed you to pure, undiluted shit, your
               "I will's" amount to the eighth round at
               the Academy gym when you stepped into a
               Blanchard right hand--pratfalling into
               clover that you turned into horse dung.

     ANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION

     No clapsticks this time. Just Betty Short sitting an the
     couch. She reaches down and pulls off her pumps. Now she
     reaches under her dress and begins unrolling her stockings.
     Not sexy. Empty and resigned.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Bye-bye Betty, Beth, Betsy, Liz, we were
               a couple of tramps, too bad we didn't
               meet before 39th and Norton, it just
               might have worked. Maybe us would've been
               the one thing we wouldn't have fucked up
               past redemption...

     EXT. 39TH AND NORTON - NIGHT - LATER

     An apartment complex has been erected at the murder site.

     EXT. AN AERIAL VIEW OF LOS ANGELES - DAY

     ANGLE ON: THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN. As we watch the sign
     changes, the "D" dropping off the end. It now reads
     "HOLLYWOODLAN".

     EXT. WILSHIRE DISTRICT - DAY

     Bucky, unshaven and out of uniform, leans against his car on
     a working class residential street. He stares across at a
     modest Victorian house and the garage behind it. We recognize
     it hopefully; we've been here before.

     EXT. A GARAGE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     It's Cleo Short's apartment. Or at least it used to be. Bucky
     peers in a window and sees it's filled with junk.

     He walks back towards the street, intent on heading back to
     his car. on a hunch, he walks up onto the porch of the
     Victorian house and rings the bell.

     EXT. THE PORCH - SAME

     Footsteps at the door. It opens to reveal another identical
     twin to Elizabeth Short.

     Bucky is stunned and can't find his tongue.

                          GIRL
                   (Boston accent)
               Can I help you? (no response). Great.
               Take a hike you big sicko--

                          BUCKY
               Wait--

     She begins to shut the door but someone behind her pulls it
     back open.

     Cleo Short, Elizabeth's father.

                          CLEO SHORT
               It's all right, dear. I know this pug.

     INT. THE SITTING ROOM - LATER

     The two men arrange themselves in chairs while the Betty look-
     a-alike makes herself busy in the kitchen behind Cleo.

     Bucky tries not to stare. He forces himself to focus on Cleo,
     who, while five years older, looks much better than last time
     Bucky saw him.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Came into a little change a while back,
               managed to trade in that shit shack out
               back for these digs. (beat) And I don't
               give a fuck what you think, you and your
               partner ain't much to look at now. I read
               the papers.

     Bucky can't deny that.

     The young woman brings in two beers for Bucky and Cleo. Bucky
     checks her out again. Cleo knows why.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               My youngest, Christine.

     He squeezes her hand affectionately.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Best housekeeper of the bunch. Can't cook
               a damn, though.
               Got her sister's star-eyes for the
               pictures, damn straight. Thinks she's
               gonna be another goddamn Jayne Mansfield.
               Get out of here, Chrissie...

     She rolls her eyes, picks up a newspaper and heads out on the
     porch.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Used to be dozens'd stop by, you know.
               Drive up from Dago or San Berdoo just to
               snap a shot of the goddamn garage back
               there. Thought maybe they'd find one of
               Betty's dresses in the garbage. Jackals.

                          BUCKY
               You didn't move far.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Wouldn't a mattered if I did. (beat)
               Whatcha here for, mug? I know you ain't
               smart enough to solve the case, and you
               ain't dumb enough to still think I did
               it...I had an alibi.

                          BUCKY
               Tighter'n a popcorn fart.

                          CLEO SHORT
               And that's air tight, mug. Air tight.

     Bucky takes a swig of his beer. Cleo's eyes scour Bucky.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               You're hooked on her still, ain't ya? Ha.
               That's a plug nickel you can't spend,
               ain't it, mug? Ha. Yea. Betty'll do that
               to a fella. Especially someone like you.
                   (off Bucky's look)
               Like I said, I know you mug.

                          BUCKY
               I just thought...Maybe after all this
               time...There's something you might have
               forgot...Anything she might have said...

     Cleo studies him, knows Bucky's a lost soul. He softens for
     the first time. Leans forward, elbows on knees. Almost
     looking like a father who'd lost a daughter.

                          CLEO SHORT
               She was a terrible actress. I'm sure
               folks've told you that. She'd practice in
               front of the john mirror.
               Once or twice she got me in on
               it...Reading parts with her for some
               audition. She stunk. Even a parent could
               tell. What Beth was good at was writing.
               All her teachers used to say that. Not
               that a grease like me'd know the
               difference. Maybe she coulda written for
               the pictures. But she wanted to be an
               actress like every other silly girl.

     His gaze drifts outside to his youngest daughter.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Your folks still alive?

                          BUCKY
               My father.

                          CLEO SHORT
                   (poking)
               He proud of his son, the ace copper? Or
               maybe he thought you'd end up champ?

     Bucky shrugs off any talk of his father. Cleo gets it.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Your momma?

                          BUCKY
               She killed herself a long time ago.

     Cleo takes a swig of his beer.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Probably better off then.

     INT./EXT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Cleo follows Bucky out onto the porch. Christine reads a copy
     of Photoplay. The cover touts the current Mack Sennett
     Revival in honor of the revised Hollywoodland sign...

                          BUCKY
               Thank you for your time, Mr. Short. if--

                          CLEO SHORT
               Get a life, Bleichert. Don't dream it all
               away. Dreamin'll kill ya.
                   (to Christine)
               You, too. Get me a sandwich.

     He snatches away the Photoplay and slaps it into Bucky's
     hands.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Clean up some dog shit with this for me,
               willya?

     The man winks. Bucky takes the magazine and salutes him with
     it. He heads back down the walk. Behind him Cleo Short
     watches him go.

     EXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - HOLLYWOOD - DUSK

     Bucky sits at a light, staring north. Scaffolding drapes the 
     Hollywoodland sign. Movie lights have been set up, capturing
     the event on film.

     His attention turns to Christine's Photoplay on the seat next 
     to him; the weekly rag is open to an ad for the Mack Sennett
     revival:

     A reproduction of the Hollywoodland sign across the top of
     the page, and below it the words "Keystone Kops at the
     Admiral Theater--Air conditioned!"

     Below that a still from a Keystone Kops movie, registering
     huge and loud and wrong: Three Keystone Kops standing between 
     pillars shaped like snakes swallowing their own tails; a wall
     inset with Egyptian hieroglyphics was behind them.

     Unmistakably the background that appeared in the Linda
     Martin/Betty Short porn film.

     Cars honking behind him. Bucky's transfixed by the image. The
     light is green.

     He jerks upright and squeals out of the intersection.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. THE ADMIRAL THEATER - SOON AFTER

     Bucky buys a ticket underneath a marquee which reads MACK
     SENNETT REVIVAL".

     INT. THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

     A Keystone Kop short in progress. Bucky can barely sit down
     to watch...

                          VOICE OVER
               I tried to keep calm. I told myself that
               just because Emmett Sprague helped Mack
               Sennett build sets in the twenties didn't
               mean he had anything to do with a smut
               film twenty-five years later.

     And there's a shot of the porn set--the Keystone Kops running
     around in it like they're solving at crime back in ancient
     Egypt.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Duke Wellington had admitted making it.
               Linda Martin had said it was shot in
               Mexico.

     The short ends with a large pie throwing scene on the porn
     set. The credits begin to roll: "Director--Mack Sennett.
     Scenarist--Mack Sennett. Assistant Director--Emmett
     Sprague"

     On Bucky's face as one last piece of information hits him:
     "Filmed in Hollywood, USA."

     EXT. THE MOVIE THEATER

     as Bucky bursts out into the evening, the lights on the
     Hollywood hill catching his attention.

     INT. A FLASHBACK - THE SPRAGUE HOUSE

     Bucky at dinner with the Spragues.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Mack Sennett? Helped him build that
               housing project he was putting up--
               Hollywoodland--

     BACK TO THE SCENE

     as Bucky stares up at the sign.

     INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT

     Bucky tears through it, pulling out files. The door opens -
     it's Russ Millard.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               I got your message, Bucky.

                          BUCKY
               Look, Russ...I think...I may have it. I--

                          RUSS MILLARD
               It?

     Bucky whirls around, gesturing to the room--

                          BUCKY
               Her! Her! I've got a hot one, padre. It's
               just...

     Bucky flops onto the bed, almost frantic.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Calm down, son. Tell me.

     Bucky meets his eyes: forgive me my sins.

     INT. BUCKY'S CAR - NIGHT

     Bucky drives with Russ in the car next to him.

                          VOICE OVER
               I told him everything. Me and Madeleine,
               the Spragues. Withholding evidence for
               her. Everything. Even Lee. After all of
               it he only had one thing to say:

     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

     On Russ:

                          RUSS MILLARD
               All right, then. It's your ball. What do
               you wanna do?

                          BUCKY
               I want to search every fucking inch of
               every goddamn acre of Emmett Sprague
               property if it takes the rest of my
               shitty career. And I know exactly where
               we start.

     INT. BUCKY'S CAR - BEACHWOOD CANYON - NIGHT

     as they inch their way up into a huge traffic snarl in
     Beachwood Canyon. The sign looms high above them as the "A"
     is taken dawn.

                          VOICE OVER
               Between my time with Madeleine and the
               local boom baron expose in the papers, I
               was practically an expert on Emmett
               Sprague's land deals...

     EXT. A PARK AREA AT THE NORTH END OF BEACHWOOD DRIVE

     A huge area is cordoned off as people watch the sign being
     torn down.

     Bucky and Russ leave the car there, badge the local blue
     doing crowd control, and split off down a dirt side road into
     the woods.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               For the first time since the beginning of
               the whole fiasco, I stopped trying to
               figure out who killed Elizabeth Short.
               Instead, I focused on where.

     EXT. A WOODED AREA - NIGHT

     Bucky and Russ play a flashlight over a piece of paper, like
     two men consulting a treasure map in the woods.

     In the background is a tiny bungalow with the windows blown
     out and the door hanging off its hinges.

                          VOICE OVER
               And if my hunch was right, we wouldn't
               have to look any further than one of
               Emmett Sprague's condemned bungalows. One
               that was isolated...abandoned...

     They walk on, leaving this particular bungalow behind.

     EXT. A STREAM - WOODS - LATER

     Bucky shines the light in a running stream as they follow it
     deeper into the night...

                          VOICE OVER
               ...and most importantly, close to a water
               source...where one could drain a body of
               its blood.

     Bucky and Russ round a bend in the stream and see

     THE SKELETON OF A BUNGALOW

     teetering on the edge of the stream. Empty window and doors
     hover over a rotting porch like skull sockets over a death
     leer.

     Bucky and Russ feel it, tensing up as they approach. They
     pick their footsteps carefully through the broken porch and
     step into the abandoned house.

     INT. THE BUNGALOW - SAME

     A scattering of trash in the front room, animal shit, a
     bicycle tire, rags.

     They move through the house, each roam, each closet and
     corner creeps with potential violence. Still, nothing.

     From the kitchen:

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bucky.

     Bucky joins Russ at the back door, the screen rotted off.
     Through the empty window they see:

     AN ALUMINUM GARDENING SHED, the door wide open.

     You know it before they even get there. But as soon as they
     step inside...

     INT. THE GARDENING SHED - CONTINUOUS

     They know something bad happened here...

     Half the room is taken up by a mattress, its blue ticking
     stained dark brown with blood. A gas lantern sits in the
     corner, leaning against a stack of blood-spattered books,
     including a copy of Gray's Anatomy and Victor Hugo's The Man 
     Who Laughs along with a clutch of pornographic pictures.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               God help her.

     Bucky's already pulling on a pair of rubber gloves from his
     SID days. For the first time we notice he's carrying his
     forensic kit.

     He opens it, revealing the test tubes, fingerprint powder,
     tweezers, etc.

                          BUCKY
                   (throwing Russ gloves)
               Box up the books and papers. Maybe light
               that lantern.

     Russ grants Bucky his take-charge attitude. He snaps on a
     pair of gloves.

     A GRUESOME MONTAGE

     1. Bucky scrapes blood off a wall and into a test tube.

     2. Russ flips through the pornographic material--some of it
     very intense.

     3. Bucky fills up another test tube with dark hair tweezed
     from the caked blood on the mattress.

     4. Underneath the mattress, Bucky finds small pieces of
     rope...

     5. Bucky measures a bloody sole print and traces it onto a
     piece of paper.

     6. Bucky finger prints the whole fucking place, pulling good
     prints from the door jamb, the door, and the wall near the
     head of the mattress.

     OUTSIDE THE GARDENING SHED

     Russ fiddles with the books, making himself busy. Finally he
     walks back inside.

     INT. THE GARDENING SHED - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky sits on the floor, his hands shaking as he holds a
     fingerprint plate in one hand and a piece of paper in the
     other.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You all right?

     Bucky hands him the fresh plate. Russ studies it. Bucky hands
     him the piece of paper with a blown-up set of prints on it.
     The two sets of prints are identical. Russ sees the name at
     the top of the paper: ELIZABETH SHORT.

     He exhales deeply.

                          BUCKY
               Thing is, Russ. Thing is...There's
               another set of latents up there on the
               doorjamb...And my hands're shaking so bad
               I can't transfer 'em.

                                                            CUT TO:

     RUSS MILLARD HACKING A FOUR INCH SECTION OF THE DOOR JAMB OFF
     WITH HIS KNIFE AND SLIPPING IT INTO A PLASTIC BAG.

     Bucky sits on the ground outside.

     EXT. UNDERNEATH THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN - LATER

     The last of the "LAND" letters has come down and a party has
     ensued. A marching band plays "There's No Business Like Show 
     Business".

     Bucky and Russ stumble out of the woods, carrying the
     evidence of Betty Short's death in their hands.

     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT

     Bucky sits on the bed, the evidence spread out around him.
     Russ stands in the doorway.

                          BUCKY
               We finally have it, Russ. All of it. All
               of her.
                   (gesturing around the room)
               All right here.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Are you sure you don't want to came home?
               Mrs. Millard'll fix up the couch.

                          BUCKY
               No. Thanks. I'll stay here.
                   (re the doorjamb piece)
               I want to get up early and confirm these
               prints.

     Russ nods.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You're a very very bright penny, Officer.

     He closes the door, leaving Bucky alone with Elizabeth.

     INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT

     Bucky lies on the bed, staring at the ceiling.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               That night I pictured myself the way I
               wanted Elizabeth to picture me--her
               knight in shining armor, a reborn two-bit
               harness bull who cracked the biggest
               unsolved homicide in California history.
               A war hero, a heavyweight champion.

     INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - DAWN

     Bucky flips through Gray's Anatomy, killing time.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               I stayed with her that night and dreamed
               of all the bullshit that would never
               happen. Not if I wanted to keep my job at
               all. Because there was no way for me to
               make the arrest without admitting that
               I'd suppressed evidence years ago. The
               case would always be open.
               And so while it killed me to wait 'til
               morning, in some ways...this was our last
               night together.

     INT. THE CRIME LAB - MORNING

     Bucky transfers the killer's prints from the doorjamb to a
     plate.

     INT. A LARGE ROOM WITH FILE CABINETS

     Bucky pulls a fingerprint card from a cabinet. He shuts the
     cabinet. The tab on the outside reads: "City Employees".

     EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - MORNING

     Bucky edges his way along the side of the house. A side
     window is open and he pulls himself inside.

     INT. THE MANSION - CONTINUOUS

     Moving boxes fill the front hallway. Bucky hears voices
     coming from the main hall. Madeleine and Emmett.

     Bucky unholsters his gun; from his pocket he pulls out a
     SILENCER and screws it on the muzzle.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE (O.S.)
               ...besides, one of my foremen said the
               goddamn pipes are spewing gas...There'll
               be hell to pay. It's about time I showed
               the three of you good ol' Scotland.

                          MADELEINE
               I don't wanna go to Europe, Daddy. You're
               always talking about how dreadful and
               provincial it is.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               ...they've got what you need, lassie.

     Bucky steps into the main room, gun prominent at his side.

                          BUCKY
               And what is that, Emmett? Saps like me?
               Direct line to the straight dope? Or is
               that what you needed?

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Aaah, laddie.

     He eyes the gun.

                          BUCKY
               George Tilden killed Elizabeth Short and
               the two of you covered it up.

     On the Spragues, trying to maintain their upper-class cool.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
                   (to Madeleine)
               You helped Linda Martin and Betty make
               that stag film. Where was the set? In one
               of Daddy's old buildings?

     He levels the gun at Madeleine. Rock steady. Madeleine sits
     on a divan.

                          MADELEINE
               Georgie was always...sneaking around
               Daddy's properties. He saw them make
               it...He...got crazy about Betty.

                          BUCKY
               Of course. She looked like his daughter.

     Off Emmett's shocked look:

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               He fucked your wife. But I don't think
               you cared about that. But he's her daddy.
               And that must have made you crazy. He was
               a handsome bastard, too. Somehow I don't
               think he was disfigured in a car wreck.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               In the Argonne, Georgie used to bayonet
               the dead Gerries. I saw it. Thrilled him,
               it did. He was...hmm...disturbed. I think
               Ramona found him...a good way to strike
               back at me.

     Bucky points the gun at Madeleine again.

                          BUCKY
               How'd it all go down?

     She hesitates. He shoots a MING VASE next to her. She jumps.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               So many pretty things here...

                          MADELEINE
               It was Sunday I remember...Betty
               called...short of cash as usual.
               I put Daddy on, and he offered Betty
               money to date a nice man he knew.
               Georgie'd been driving Daddy crazy,
               wanting to get with Betty ever since the
               movie. Threatening to tell people he was
               my father. But we thought Georgie just
               wanted her for sex.

     Bucky blows away another objet d'art. The two Spragues huddle
     on the couch.

                          BUCKY
               He was a sick fuck and you knew it!

     Emmett gestures vainly towards the stuffed dog Balto.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               He was passive. He liked to touch dead
               things. His father was a surgeon, did you
               know that? Famous in Scotland.

                          BUCKY
               What did you tell Betty? What did you
               tell her?

                          MADELEINE
               We said he was a war hero. Because we
               didn't want her to feel like a whore.

                          BUCKY
               Then?

                          MADELEINE
               You know the rest.

                          BUCKY
               Pretend I'm stupid. For old time's sake.

     Madeleine exhales hate.

                          MADELEINE
               I went looking for Linda Martin, and I
               found her at a motel in the Valley. I
               gave her money and told her to say the
               stag was filmed in Tijuana with a Mexican
               crew.

                          BUCKY
               And then what? I come along? Daddy tell
               you to fuck me or was that your idea?

                          MADELEINE
               Bucky--

     Two more shots from the gun destroy another fifty grand worth
     of art. Bucky reloads.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               The whole family have a good laugh at
               dinner that night? Pumping me for info
               about the case? Throwing me Georgie
               stories to see if I'd bite? A little
               hospitality and some cunt so I wouldn't
               check out your alibi--

                          MADELEINE
               Bucky--

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Ramona didn't know a thing. Martha--

                          BUCKY
               What about sweet little Martha?

                          MADELEINE
               Martha knew I'd been with Betty. But that
               was all. But she's a demon, you know. She
               even called the cops with a tip on La
               Verne's--just hoping I'd get smeared in
               the papers. I scratched her good for
               that.

                          BUCKY
               Martha tell you this?

     She nods yes.

                          BUCKY
               Then she lied to get your goat, 'cuz no
               one ever called in a tip on LaVerne's.

                          MADELEINE
               Figures.

     Emmett clears his throat.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               What are you gonna do?

                          BUCKY
               Passports. All four.

     Emmett walks to a small desk. He reaches into the drawer--
     Bucky puts his gun to Emmett's head--

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Don't insult me, lad.

     He pulls out the four passports (not a gun). Bucky takes
     them.

                          MADELEINE
               We'll ruin you in court, you know. If you
               go after us, we'll ruin you. Over what?
               Some little slut--

     Bucky blows a hole in a vase some six inches from her. He
     cocks his head at her, as if to say: the next one will be
     closer.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               You know, laddie. The rich don't
               necessarily own art just for themselves;
               we safekeep it for future generations.

     The dig crosses through Bucky's mind for a moment before he
     shooes it away. To Emmett:

                          BUCKY
               I need to see it.
                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               It?

                          BUCKY
               Just to be sure. I need to see it.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               I'm not sure I know...

     Bucky puts the silenced muzzled half an inch from Sprague's
     brain.

                          BUCKY
               I need to see his grave, you tightass
               kiltwearing motherfucker. Where'd you
               bury George Tilden?

     EXT. A PAUPER'S CEMETERY - DAY

     Bucky stands in front of a plain grave marker: "George
     Tilden. 1906 - 1948.  War Hero and Loyal Friend"

                          VOICE OVER
               When I'd pulled George's print card that
               morning, I'd already laid fifty down with
               Russ that he was our guy. Amateur
               taxidermist, transient. If he was a cop
               39th and Norton woulda been right in the
               middle of his beat...

     INT. THE ROOM WITH THE FILE CABINETS - FLASHBACK

     Bucky pulls Tilden's card and we see the close-up: "George
     Tilden". Added by hand: "Deceased"

                          VOICE OVER
               But I'd be lying if I said I hadn't
               wanted to nail the sicko myself, giving
               him ten rounds of Bleichert rage.

     EXT./INT. THE ALUMINUM GARDEN SHED - DAY

     Bucky watches as Russ tips the gas lantern over on its side,
     the gas leaking out into the tin shed.

                          VOICE OVER
               Maybe he'd have gone for a gun or
               probably a knife, and the Bleichert fists
               would've given way to a full load of .45
               in the chest.

     Bucky and Russ step outside. Russ lights a match and tosses
     it inside. Flames begin to eat away the bloody mattress...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Sprague said they found him croaked in a
               parking lot downtown, just twelve blocks
               from where he'd dumped Betty Short. Just
               croaked. Natural causes, if anything
               about crazy Georgie was natural. I hoped
               the evil ate him from the inside out,
               filling him with blackness like the
               sawdust in Sprague's goddamn dog. (beat)

     Bucky kicks the tin door shut, sealing the fire inside
     Elizabeth Short's private hell.

     INT. JANE CHAMBERS HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

     Bucky and Jane Chambers drink some iced tea.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               ...and then Eldridge said: I'm sure
               that's the case Mr. Mayor, but that's not
               my dog and those sure as hell aren't my
               shoes!

     They laugh, Jane a bit more than Bucky. She narrows in on him.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               It's so nice of you to stop by again. Of
               course you've been staking out the
               Sprague house. Four nights in a row.
                   (off his surprise)
               I walk my dog every night. And I'm almost
               as nosy as you.

                          BUCKY
                   (covering)
               Yeah, well. Old habits die hard.

     He gets up from the table.

     INT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky wanders over and stares at the slash-mouthed clown
     painting, always transfixed by it.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
                   (re the painting)
               I'd been thinking about giving it to
               charity, but it's too valuable. I found
               Eldridge's receipt...

     She wanders into the study and fishes out some papers from
     her late husbands desk while Bucky continues to stare at the
     clown. She returns, reading from the sale slip.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               It's a Frederick Yannantuono original,
               inspired by an old classic novel--The
               Man Who Laughs by Victor Hugo.

     A FLASHBACK - THE GARDENING SHED

     A blood-spattered copy of The Man Who Laughs on the pile of 
     pornography--

     BACK TO SCENE

     As the slash-mouthed clown towers over Bucky, his head
     buzzing...

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               The clown in the painting is the book's
               main character, Gwynplain. When he was a
               child he had his mouth slashed ear to ear
               and then sold to the 16th century Spanish
               aristocracy to be used as a court jester.

     Bucky steps back.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               Are you all right, Bucky?

                          BUCKY
               Yes, I'm fine.

     He focuses on her.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Where'd Eldridge get the painting?

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               You'll appreciate the coincidence--

     She hands him the receipt.

     ANGLE ON THE RECEIPT:

     "Received from Eldridge Chambers, $3500 for the sale
     of the F. Yannantuono painting. Ramona Cathcart
     Sprague, January 15, 1947."

     Speechless.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               What is it--

     He's out the door.

     EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - SAME

     Bucky runs to his car, pulls out his gun. He sprints off down
     the street...

     EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - SAME

     Bucky waits outside, watching from behind a tree. He watches
     as the last of the cars, Madeleine's, pulls out of the
     driveway.

     He crosses the street. He tries the front door, surprised to
     find it unlocked. He goes inside.

     INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - CONTINUOUS

     Gun drawn, Bucky cases the downstairs. He hears a noise.

                          RAMONA
               I'm in here, officer.

     A red wave of sweat washes over him. He walks carefully into

     RAMONA'S SITTING ROOM

     where the matriarch sits on a tiny sofa, her arms lost in a
     silk dressing gown. Her face puffy and her eyes dark, her
     gray hair frizzy.

     Bucky trains a gun on her.

                          BUCKY
               I know what you did, Ramona. You and
               Georgia. I've seen the painting. You sold
               it the day of the murder. You know I've
               got the book. And now I've got you.

     She smiles. Very slowly she withdraws one of her hands from
     the folds of her dressing gown. She holds a tiny ladylike
     revolver in her fingers and drops it at her feet. When she
     speaks, it's with complete control.

                          RAMONA
               We see you out there, you know. Every
               night. We see you. You don't fool us. You
               didn't hurt Georgie. You didn't hurt
               Madeleine. And as much as I wish you
               would, you didn't hurt Emmett. You're a
               voyeur. That's all the lesser classes
               have. Pressing their nose up against the
               glass.

                          BUCKY
               So tell me. Let me see.

     She smiles at him again, loving his need.

                          RAMONA
               Emmett slashed his face, I'm sure you
               know. Madeleine was eleven and she looked
               just like Georgie. When he got out of the
               hospital I gave him the Hugo book as a
               present. My Gwynplain. But he was afraid
               of Emmett's rage...After that...we rarely
               spoke.

     Bucky eases himself into a chair opposite her.

                          BUCKY
               Tell me about Betty Short.

     Her face hardens.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
                   (with venom)
               It was the cruelest of jokes. He'd become
               obsessed with her...That filthy film.

                          BUCKY
               Your husband bought her for George.

                          RAMONA
               Emmett never stopped hating me.

                          BUCKY
               For George--

                          RAMONA
               For being richer than he was.

     She looks over her nose at him.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               I followed them to the bungalow. There
               was a baseball bat under...under a
               tree...She tried to run from me...but she
               was drunk. The first swing knocked her
               out. I made Georgie tie her to the
               mattress....The second swing woke her up.

                          BUCKY
               You tortured her.

     She seems to drift.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               She looked so much like my Maddy. It
               was...the cruelest of jokes.

     Her thousand yard stare gradually returns to Bucky.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               Martha mustn't know. She's all that's
               left of this family that isn't dying. You
               consider her when you decide whether
               we're worth it.

     Bucky's not sure what to say next. She fills the space quite
     well.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               Honestly, though. Sometimes I thought
               Martha was going to bring the whole
               family down around her by chance. Her
               little stunt about tipping the police to
               LaVerne's--

                          BUCKY
               She lied about that. To get Madeleine's
               goat.

     Ramona's eyes brighten up.

                          RAMONA
               Oh is that so? You poor boy. Your life is
               worse than mine. Maybe the cruel joke is
               on you.

     She speaks with such an insanity and calm it frightens him.
     And on Bucky's hungry eyes we

                                                            CUT TO:

     BUCKY'S CAR peeling out of Hancock Park.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. THE FAIRFAX PRIMARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

     Kay sits at her desk, grading papers. Bucky bursts in.

                          KAY
               Dwight?

                          BUCKY
               How much of the hundred grand did Lee let
               you keep?

     INT. THE TIP DESK - POLICE DEPARTMENT - FLASHBACK

     Bucky and Lee sit at the tip desk while Lee listens to a very
     long call, saying nothing...

     BACK TO SCENE

     Kay and Bucky stare each other down.

                          BUCKY
               He knew about Madeleine Sprague. He knew
               about Laverne's Hideaway.

     INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - NIGHT - A FLASHBACK

     Lee Blanchard beats the hell out of Emmett Sprague while
     Madeleine's looks on.

                          BUCKY (VO)
               He blackmailed Sprague--

                          MADELEINE (VO)
               --Don't come over. Daddy's having a
               business soiree--

     INT. THE BATHROOM OF THE POLICE STATION - A FLASHBACK

     Bucky bursts in on Lee washing his bloody fists.

                          LEE
               --Penance for Junior Nash--

     BACK TO SCENE

     Bucky's leaning on the desk...

                          BUCKY
               And you knew it, Kay! You knew it all! He
               took that hundred thousand and split to
               Mexico and you let him go!

     Kay fingers the edges of an exam. She looks him in the eye.

                          KAY
               You are so, so good at some things.

     He absorbs the blow and waits for her to continue.

                          KAY
               He was going to leave no matter what. I
               didn't know if I was ever going to see
               him again, and I wanted him to be
               comfortable if such a thing was possible.
               Dwight, he knew I was in love with you,
               and he wanted us to be together.

                          BUCKY
               He didn't leave, he ran. He ran from the
               bank job, ran from the frame on DeWitt.
               He knew who killed Elizabeth Short and
               fucking ran away! This whole time. You
               both knew everything--

     Kay slams down a book.

                          KAY
               Goddammit, Dwight! That girl--that girl!
               I don't give a damn about that girl. She
               ruined our lives!

     The room grinds to a halt.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               He loved us. Don't take that away from
               him. And I love you. And if you hadn't
               seen so much of yourself in her you'd
               realize how much you loved me. (beat) So
               if you're aware of something more
               important than that...I'd like to hear
               what it is.

     Bucky looks like he's about to burst. He wants to go to her,
     lock her in his arms and forgive. instead, he just backs up
     three steps, slowly turns on his heels, and walks out.

     INT. A BAR - NIGHT

     Bucky sits in the back of the bar, shrouded in smoke and loud
     music. He drinks bourbon and watches Madeleine over at the
     bar. She's got her hand on a soldier's knee.

     EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - NIGHT

     Madeleine Sprague and the soldier boy walk from the office
     over to the now familiar Room 11. They enter, shutting the
     door and flicking on the light to reveal

     BUCKY

     sitting on the back of a chair with his feet on the seat. He
     trains his silenced pistol on them. Flashing his badge, he
     points the soldier to the door:

                          BUCKY
                   (quoting Lee)
               Adios yourself back to the Halls of
               Tripoli, shitbird. I've got business
               with the lady.

     You don't have to tell the soldier twice. He backs out and
     shuts the door.

                          BUCKY
               I've been pointing my gun at a lot of
               people this week. But I haven't had much
               of a chance to shoot anybody. Whattya
               think?

                          MADELEINE
               I think you'd rather fuck me than kill
               me. But you don't have the guts to do
               either. You're a boxer. Not a puncher.

     Bucky smiles.

                          BUCKY
                   (Scotchman's burr)
               Aaaah, lassie. You wanna sell me short
               to the very end, eh?

     Now she's curious.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               It's not as good as yours, I'll admit.
               But then again you've got an ear for
               accents. Accents, dressing up in
               costumes...

     Maybe a trace of fear in her eyes...

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Do another one for me. Play someone else.
               Rich little slut...Lez...Daddy's
               girl...Dahlia...Play someone else. Do
               another.

                          MADELEINE
               I don't know what you're talking about--

     He cocks the gun.

                          BUCKY
               How 'bout the Mexican accent you used
               when you hired the private dick to track
               down Lee. Let's see the make-up job.
               Let's see the fucking dress, mamacita,
               that you wore when you chased after poor
               daddy's money. Tell me something--you
               shoot Lee yourself?

     She steps back against the door as he advances.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Did you at least have the guts to shoot
               him yourself?

     He puts the gun to her forehead.

                          MADELEINE
               You'll never do it. Never. Remember...I
               look like her.

     She grins wickedly.

     He pulls the gun from her head and shoots her in the kneecap.

     EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER

     Cap cars, flashing lights, an ambulance.

                          VOICE OVER
               We took the fall together.

     INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

     Madeleine is interrogated by Homicide dicks.

                          VOICE OVER
               Ever the consummate actor, Madeleine
               Sprague confessed to killing Lee by
               concocting a love triangle from the three
               of us...The Bleichert/Blanchard rematch
               fought over her hand, with Lee beating
               Emmett and demanding he "hand over" his
               daughter when she preferred me.

     EXT. THE ENSENADA STREETS - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

     As Madeleine, dressed as a Mexican woman in heavy makeup and
     a large hat, tails Lee back to his motel...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Madeleine stalking Lee...Revenge-killing
               him in Ensenada to avenge the Sprague
               honor...No mention of the Black Dahlia
               murder case at all.

     EXT. THE COURTHOUSE - DAY

     Madeleine led away amongst a flock of photographers. Her
     family linked arm-and-arm in the background, crying, only
     Martha looking like she might survive...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Her story's enough to get her a psych tag
               as a delusional schizophrenic and ten
               years at Atascadero State Hospital.

     INT. THE POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

     Bucky sits at a table, staring into the one-way mirror.

                          VOICE OVER
               So the brass girl took the fall for the
               whole family. And I took the fall for me.
               IAD cleared me on the motel shooting--a
               cop's code make-good for Blanchard's
               snuff.
     WE PULL OUT and see Bucky's cuffs, badge and gun sitting on
     the table in front of him.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Afterwards I was fired from the Los
               Angeles Police Department on grounds of
               moral turpitude and conduct unbecoming an
               officer. I thought of turning over Ramona
               in hopes of pulling a grandstander's
               turnabout...

     THE CAMERA DRIFTS THROUGH THE ONE-WAY MIRROR revealing RUSS
     MILLARD standing on the other side.

                          VOICE OVER
               ...but I had people to protect...People
               who already knew that, for the briefest
               of times, and in the darkest of places, I
               had been so, so, good at some things.

     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT

     Bucky standing amongst the Dahlia files. He begins pulling
     photos off the walls...

     INT. BUCKY AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     The destroyed fairy tale house is in mid-repair. Kay is in
     work clothes, painting a new trim in the living room.

     The front door opens. Bucky stands in the doorway, carrying a
     box of Dahlia files. Kay watches as he crosses the room
     without a word and dumps the box of files into the fireplace.
     He tosses on a match and the box goes up in flames.

     She moves to him.

     INT. A CASTING OFFICE - DAY

     We arrive just as she exits, the outline of her body quickly 
     disappearing into the blackness beyond the office door...

                          VOICE OVER
               Thank you Elizabeth.

          1 INT. DARK STAGE - NIGHT 1
                         
                          OPENING CREDITS:
                         
           A SPOTLIGHT slices black space.
                         
           In its beam, a DANCER materializes. She is fair-skinned.
           Beautiful and pure.
                         
           The maiden twirls on pointe, a smile on her face, light as
           air and carefree.
                         
           She pauses, her face grows worried. Sensing someone watching.
                         
           Scared, she peers into the darkness.
                         
           She moves now, looking, growing more frantic.
                         
           Then, a SINISTER MAN emerges out of the darkness behind her.
           She stumbles backwards, frightened.
                         
           She tries to escape, twirling away, but he pursues. His true
           form is revealed, the demon ROTHBART.
                         
           He flings his open hand towards her, casting the spell.
                         
           She wants to scream, but nothing comes out. She looks at her
           body, sensing something happening to her. Something
           terrifying.
                         
           She spins, panicking, but it's too late. She disappears
           beneath the beast's cape.
                         
           She emerges as the WHITE SWAN, the iconic protagonist of SWAN
           LAKE.
                         
           CUT TO BLACK.
                         
                         
          2 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 2
                         
           In the darkness, a pair of EYES. They belong to NINA, the
           same dancer. She lies awake in bed, thinking about her dream.
                         
           The room looks like it hasn't been redecorated since she was
           a teenager. Stuffed animals. Dolls. Pink and frilly.
                         
           The door opens, throwing LIGHT on her face. Nina looks
           towards the door and smiles softly at whoever opened it.
                         
           Nina sits up and hangs her BARE FEET off the side of the bed.
           Like all ballerinas, she's beautiful and her feet are
           atrocious. Covered in corns, broken blisters and bunions. She
           arches them, doing her first extensions of the day.
           2.
                         
          3 INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING 3
                         
           The room is empty of furniture to leave space for dancing. A
           large mirror covers the opposite wall entirely.
                         
           Nina rubs her knees to get them warm, and then begins her
           morning exercises, extending and contracting her feet and
           legs in precise and rhythmic motions.
                         
           The skin on her chest stretches tautly over her sternum.
           Defined vertebrae run up her back, sinewy muscles contract as
           she moves. Her slender neck leads into her hair, contained
           in a ballerina's bun.
                         
           Nina looks serene as she moves, completely in her element.
                         
           She hears someone fussing about in the kitchen.
                         
                          NINA
                          (WHILE STRETCHING)
           I had the most amazing dream last
           night. I was dancing the White
           Swan.
                         
           No answer.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Different choreography, like the
           Bolshoi's. It was the prologue,
           when Rothbart casts his spell.
                         
           Still no answer.
                         
           Nina continues to stretch.
                         
                         
          4 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 4
                         
           Nina sits at the table. An older woman, ERICA, places a
           POACHED EGG and a QUARTER-GRAPEFRUIT in front of her.
                         
                          ERICA
           You're in a good mood.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm just excited to get back.
                         
                          ERICA
           Off-season always makes you grumpy.
                         
                          NINA
                          (RE: GRAPEFRUIT)
           Look how pink. So pretty.
           2A.
                         
                          ERICA NINA
           (inside joke) (inside joke)
          Pretty. Pretty.
                         
          They giggle and Erica resumes packing Nina's shoulder bag
          with extra clothing, shoes, snack filled tupperware, duct
          tape, ribbon, thread, etc.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Plus he promised to feature me
           more.
                         
                          ERICA
           He certainly should. You're the
           most dedicated dancer in the
           company.
                         
          Nina smiles, comforted, and begins taking her vitamins.
                         
          Erica walks over with a SWEATSHIRT and holds it above her.
          Nina pulls it over her head and starts to push her arms
          through the sleeves.
           3.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
                          (NOTICING SOMETHING)
           What's that?
                         
                          NINA
           What?
                         
                          ERICA
           There.
                         
           Erica points to her shoulder. Nina feels and finds a small
           SCRATCH MARK.
                         
           She shrugs and shakes her head.
                         
           Erica gives her a suspicious look, but lets it go and smiles.
           Nina finishes pulling down the sweatshirt.
                         
           Erica hugs Nina into her chest and kisses the top of her
           head.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Sweet girl.
                         
           Erica releases her and Nina begins eating.
                         
                         
          5 INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY 5
                         
           Nina rides inside a crowded subway, staring absentmindedly at
           her faint reflection in the train's window.
                         
           Suddenly, another train roars by on the opposite track,
           snapping her awake.
                         
           In the next train car, she sees the back of a BALLERINA
           standing in the midst of the crowd. Her head bops to music
           playing through iPod earphones.
                         
           Nina moves a strand of hair out of her eyes, and at that
           exact moment, the girl in the next car moves in the same way.
           Mirroring her.
                         
           Unnerved, Nina slowly lowers her arm. So does the other girl.
           Although Nina can't quite see her face, the girl seems
           IDENTICAL from Nina's vantage point.
           4.
                         
           The train jerks to a stop as it arrives at a station. Nina
           sees the girl head to the exit. She cranes to see her face,
           but her view's obscured.
                         
           The doors slide shut and the train pulls out. Nina watches
           the platform whisk by, keeping her eyes peeled, but she
           doesn't see the girl.
                         
                         
                         6 OMITTED 6
                         
                         
          7 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER - DAY 7
                         
           Nina emerges from the subway station onto a city street.
                         
           She arrives at the MAJESTIC-LOOKING THEATER, where a few
           other BALLERINAS likewise trickle towards the entrance. They
           all look strangely similar: slender, carrying shoulder bags,
           wearing leggings and loose sweatshirts.
                         
           She passes a ROW OF POSTERS featuring the company's prima
           ballerina, BETH MACINTYRE.
                         
           Nina looks at them, a little envious, before continuing on to
           the STAGE DOOR.
                         
                         
          8 INT. SOLOIST DRESSING ROOM - DAY 8
                         
           Crammed into a single dressing room, Nina and the company's 5
           SOLOISTS get ready for rehearsal. Chatting, sewing ribbon
           onto shoes, applying makeup, putting band-aids on blisters.
                         
           Nina removes a new pair of BALLET SHOES, admires them for a
           moment, before cutting off the satin toe with scissors.
                         
           In the background, catty VERONICA and Russian GALINA gossip.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Can't believe she's back.
                         
                          GALINA
           Of course she is.
                         
                          VERONICA
           She can't take a hint? Company's
           broke. No one comes to see her
           anymore.
                         
                          SOLOIST 1
           No one comes to see ballet period.
           5.
                         
                          VERONICA
           That's not true, I heard the Royal
           had one of their best seasons yet.
                         
                          GALINA
           He needs to try something new.
                         
                          VERONICA
           No, someone new.
                         
                          SOLOIST 1
           Like who?
                         
                          VERONICA
           Like someone who's not approaching
           menopause.
                         
          They snicker.
                         
                          NINA
           I think it's sad.
                         
                          VERONICA
           What's sad?
                         
                          NINA
           Beth's such an amazing dancer.
                         
                          GALINA
           So's my grand-mother.
                         
                          NINA
           Fonteyn danced into her 50's...
                         
                          VERONICA
                          (ROLLING EYES)
           Yeah, we know.
                         
          Irked, Nina starts POUNDING the shoes against the floor to
          soften the toe.
                         
          Her eyes are drawn to a NEW GIRL standing in the doorway.
          Nina pauses to scrutinize her. She wears vampy make-up, hair
          down. Dark and sexy.
                         
                          NEW GIRL
           Soloists?
                         
          Wary, the girls mumble mmm-hmm's and nod.
                         
           NEW GIRL (CONT'D)
           Great.
           6.
                         
           She slinks past the suspicious group of girls and plops down
           at an open spot.
                         
           NEW GIRL (CONT'D)
           Fucking got off the wrong stop and
           had to hoof it from 79th.
                         
           Nina exchanges glances with the other girls, taken aback.
                         
           The new girl notices the looks, smirks to herself and starts
           getting ready.
                         
                         
          9 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 9
                         
           Nina wears a look of intense concentration as the entire
           company warms up, including the pubescent CORPS MEMBERS and a
           handful of MALE DANCERS.
                         
           LEGS, HANDS, and FEET repeat the same movements all around
           her, led by a severe BALLET MISTRESS.
                         
                          BALLET MISTRESS
           To the back, fondu, to the back,
           plie. Fourth, fourth, and one and
           fifth, to the back...
           (to a corps member)
           Like this. Push it. Why can't you
           do this?
                         
           Using the mirror, Nina monitors her movements carefully. The
           mistress surprises her.
                         
           BALLET MISTRESS (CONT'D)
           It needs to be looser. Relax. Let
           it flow.
                         
           Flustered, Nina nods and tries to follow her instruction.
                         
           Suddenly, the girls around Nina begin stripping off their
           sweatshirts and insulated pants.
                         
           Nina sees that the intense and brooding director of the
           company, THOMAS LEROY, has entered the space. He has the
           unkept look of an artist. Magnetic and intense.
                         
           The ballerinas remove their warm-up gear to show off their
           bodies.
                         
           Leroy walks around the room, judging his flock. Smiles and
           glances are thrown his way.
                         
           He goes up to the ballet mistress, takes her hand and kisses
           her on the cheek. Even she manages a smile.
           7.
                         
          He heads to the line of soloists, studying them.
                         
                          LEROY
           We all know the story: virginal
           girl, pure and sweet, trapped in
           the body of a swan. She desires
           freedom, but only true love can
           break the spell.
                         
          He taps a dancer on the shoulder, she lights up. He walks,
          then taps another. A selection process of some kind.
                         
          Nina looks nervous, has an inkling of what it means.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Her wish is granted in the form of
           a prince.
                         
          He nears Nina. She sneaks peeks at him, eager and hopeful.
          He acknowledges her with a small nod and a smile.
                         
          But he walks on without tapping her. She deflates.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But before he can declare his love,
           her lustful twin, the Black Swan,
           tricks and seduces him.
                         
          He approaches the New Girl. Nina watches, threatened.
                         
          But he doesn't tap her either.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Devastated, the White Swan leaps
           off a cliff, killing herself. But,
           in death, finds freedom.
                         
          He taps one more soloist and then CLAPS.
                         
          The music stops and all the girls face him, attentive.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Good morning, company.
                         
          They respond "Good morning" in nervous, unsure voices.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           We open our season with Swan Lake.
           Done to death, I know. But not like
           this. We strip it down. Make it
           visceral and real.
                         
          He pauses for effect.
           8.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           And a new production needs a new
           Swan Queen. A fresh face to present
           to the world.
                         
           Surprised, the soloists glance at each other, trying to keep
           their cool.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But which of you can embody both
           swans? The white and the black?
                         
           Nina prepares for disappointment.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           All the soloists I touched...

           rehearsals this afternoon.
                         
           The girls are confused.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           And the girls I didn't touch, meet
           me in studio B at five.
                         
           Nina breathes, realizing the girls he didn't tap are the ones
           he's selected, purposefully toying with them.
                         
                         
          10 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 10
                         
           Hidden inside a nook, Nina has her eyes closed, nervously
           HUMMING the score to Swan Lake.
                         
           She makes small motions with her feet and hands, going
           through the choreography in her mind. Preparing for the
           audition.
                         
           A loud CRASHING sound snaps her out of it.
                         
           She goes out into the hallway to investigate.
                         
           The door to a PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM is halfway open. Nina
           cautiously approaches.
                         
           Inside, she can see someone moving around the room in a fury,
           trashing it.
                         
           Suddenly, the door swings open and BETH MACINTYRE bursts out.
                         
           She makes brief eye-contact with Nina.
                         
                          BETH
           What?!
           9.
                         
           Nina just shakes her head.
                         
           Beth scoffs as she slams the door behind her. She clips down
           the hall in the opposite direction.
                         
           Nina waits until she's gone, then moves closer to the door
           and peeks inside, curious.
                         
           She checks to make sure no one's around and quickly enters.
                         
                         
          11 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 11
                         
           Large and comfortable. Beth's presence is everywhere.
           Photographs, clothing, and personal belongings scattered
           across the space.
                         
           Nina looks at herself in the mirror and smiles, imagining how
           great it would be...
                         
           Then she notices a LARGE VASE lying on the floor. The flowers
           have been shredded, water everywhere.
                         
           She moves to the vanity counter and touches Beth's
           belongings in reverence. The items are neatly laid out:
           ballet supplies, jewelry, and makeup.
                         
           Her fingers brush a tube of LIPSTICK. She picks it up.
                         
           Nina slips the lipstick into her bag and exits the room.
                         
                         
          12 INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 12
                         
           In the middle of her audition, Nina dances Odette's Variation
           from Act II of the ballet, a frightened look on her face.
                         
           Although her movement is incredibly precise, there's a
           definite vulnerability. Exactly as the White Swan should be:
           fear tinged with melancholy.
                         
           Leroy waves his arm. The music and Nina stop abruptly.
                         
           He approaches her and, when he gets close, taps on her
           sternum with two of his fingers.
                         
                          LEROY
           So Nina, would you like to be the
           Swan Queen?
                         
                          NINA
           If you want me to be.
                         
           He leans in and talks softly so the other girls can't hear.
           10.
                         
                          LEROY
           Well, if I was just casting the
           White Swan, she'd be yours.
                         
          She can't help but smile, flattered. He pulls away from her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But I'm not.
                         
          He turns to the PIANO PLAYER.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Maestro, Odile's Coda.
                         
          The piano player rifles through the song book.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Show me your Black Swan, Nina.
                         
          Nervous, she glances over at Veronica and Galina, who
          anxiously await their turn.
                         
          She takes a few breaths, then looks towards the piano player
          and nods.
                         
          The music begins.
                         
          Nina dances a few steps, and then launches into the most
          difficult and famous part of Swan Lake: The Black Swan's
          Coda. It consists of 32 consecutive fouettes (spins).
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Come on, not so controlled.
                         
          The music builds in intensity, she pushes herself into the
          next turn.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Seduce us! Not just the Prince, but
           the court, the audience, the entire
           world! The fouettes are like a
           spider spinning her web. Come on!
           Attack it! Attack it!
                         
          Leroy runs his hand through his hair, dismayed.
                         
          A look of worry spreads across Nina's face. Knows she's
          blowing it.
                         
          The door CLANGS open and throws Nina's focus completely. She
          stumbles, several spins short of finishing.
           11.
                         
           The New Girl obliviously marches into the room, listening to
           an iPod.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
                          (SARCASTIC)
           Good of you to join us.
                         
           The New Girl notices everyone staring and pulls out her
           earphones to talk.
                         
                          NEW GIRL
           Sorry.
                         
                          LEROY
           Girls, this is Lily. Straight off
           the plane from San Francisco. She's
           filling Rebecca's old spot.
                         
           LILY gives a small wave. Nina eyes her with scorn as she
           catches her breath.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Go on, get warmed up.
                         
                          LILY
           I'm good.
                         
           Lily starts stripping off her layers, revealing her lithe
           body. On her back, she has a TATTOO OF LILIES.
                         
                          NINA
           Should I go again?
                         
                          LEROY
           (distracted by Lily)
           I've seen enough. Thank you, Nina.
                         
           She looks down, getting his meaning.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Okay, Veronica. Your turn. The
           White Swan's variation...
                         
           Furious, Nina marches out of the room.
                         
                         
          A13 INT. THEATER BATHROOM STALL - NIGHT A13
                         
           Nina stands up from a kneeled position and flushes the
           toilet. She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand and
           exits the stall.

          15 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 15
                         
           Nina walks along a quiet side street. She clutches her
           jacket, for warmth and comfort.
                         
           Her CELL PHONE starts ringing. She digs it out of her bag and
           checks the CALLER ID: MOM. She silences it and puts it away.
                         
           Up ahead, she sees the sidewalk dead end at a construction
           site, and detour into an enclosed PASSAGEWAY beneath the
           scaffolding.
                         
           Nina slows, a little scared, but decides to push on.
                         
           The passageway is dark. The temporary lighting dim and
           flickering.
                         
           She walks quickly, trying to get to the other side.
                         
           She hears the sound of soft FOOTSTEPS approaching. She
           stops, and the other FOOTSTEPS stop.
                         
           She looks up and sees the faint outline of a SLENDER WOMAN
           standing there, almost ghostlike.
                         
           Nina starts walking again, keeping her head down, and the
           other woman continues as well.
           13.
                         
           As they pass each other, Nina glances at the woman's face and
           discovers...
                         
           The woman looks EXACTLY LIKE HER.
                         
           But the moment passes as the woman continues walking.
                         
           Nina stares after her, perturbed.
                         
           Her cell phone starts RINGING again, piercing the silence.
           Nina continues out, ignoring the phone.
                         
                         
          16 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 16
                         
           Nina enters and locks the deadbolt and chain-lock behind her.
                         
           She turns and is startled to see Erica standing right there.
                         
                          ERICA
           How did it go?
                         
           Nina looks at her confused. Erica helps take off her coat.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           You were late, so I called Susie in
           the office. An audition?! Can't
           believe he just sprung that on you.
                         
           Nina nods.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           So?
                         
                          NINA
           It went okay.
                         
                          ERICA
           Just okay?
                         
           Erica hangs up her coat, turns and sees Nina tearing up.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Darling?
                         
           The tears start falling now.
                         
           Erica goes to her and wraps her in an embrace.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Shhh, shhh, tell me what happened.
           14.
                         
          17 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 17
                         
           Nina lies on the floor, stewing. Her legs straight in the air
           to drain the lactic acid in her muscles.
                         
           ERICA (O.S.)
                          (FROM KITCHEN)
           I told them it doesn't matter how
           talented their daughter is, if she
           misses any more classes, she's out.
           She forgets half of what I teach
           her, and I waste time catching her
           up. It's ridiculous.
                         
           Nina sits up and retrieves a pair of point shoes from her
           bag. She considers them for a moment, then starts to put them
           on.
                         
           She stands, takes a breath, and does a single spin, testing
           the waters.
                         
           She takes a breath and spins again, then again, then again.
           Each spin is punctuated by a jab of her foot into the floor.
                         
           THWACK, THWACK. THWACK.
                         
           She jabs her toe down, hard...
                         
                          NINA
           Ow!
                         
           She winces in pain and automatically grabs her foot.
                         
           ERICA (O.S.)
           Everything alright?
                         
                          NINA
           I'm fine!
                         
           Nina leans her back against the mirror and removes her shoe.
           Her right big toenail has split, oozing blood.
                         
           Nina breathes through the pain and puts her shoe back on.
                         
           She reassumes the position, takes a couple breaths, and
           starts spinning again.
                         
           Her toe jabs into the floor. She winces a little with pain,
           but keeps pushing.
                         
           Her face grows more determined, focused. 20, 21, 22 spins....
                         
           She starts to look powerful, willing herself to succeed.
           14A.
                         
          At the end of the 32nd spin, Nina jabs her foot down hard.
                         
          She's done it!
                         
          Nina looks at herself in the mirror, glazed in sweat, a
          slight smile of satisfaction.
           15.
                         
          18 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 18
                         
           Nina sits on the edge of the bed, as Erica douses some GAUZE
           with PEROXIDE and dabs it on the split toenail. Nina reacts
           to the sting.
                         
                          ERICA
           Shhh. Almost done...You're working
           yourself too hard. We all have off
           days.
                         
                          NINA
           If that girl hadn't barged in.
                         
                          ERICA
           I'm sure she didn't mean to.
           Remember when you started? If I
           hadn't taken you to each of your
           classes, you would have been
           completely lost.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm gonna talk to him. Tell him I
           finished it.
                         
                          ERICA
           He knows you can do the coda. It
           won't convince him one way or the
           other.
                         
           Annoyed, Nina lies down, looking away from her mother. 
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D) 
           Oh, sweetheart, I know it's 
           disappointing. When you start to 
           get older, there's all this 
           ridiculous pressure. God knows, I 
           understand. 
                         
           Erica squeezes some arnica gel into her palm and massages it
           into Nina's calves.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           But it's alright. No matter what. 
           You'll probably get to dance the
           Pas de Quatre again. That's such a
           wonderful part. Or maybe he'll make
           you a Big Swan. Either way, you'll
           shine.
                         
                          NINA
           I know, mom.
           15A.
                         
          Erica removes Nina's EARRINGS, then opens a JEWELRY BOX
          sitting on the night stand and drops them inside. A TOY
          BALLERINA spins to TINNY MUSIC.
                         
          Nina gets under the covers. Erica tucks her in and sits down
          on the edge of the bed.
           16.
                         
                          ERICA
           Everything will be better in the
           morning. It always is.
                         
           She strokes Nina's hair, humming along to the music.
                         
           Nina watches the ballerina spin and spin with a determined
           stare.
                         
                         
                         19 OMITTED 19

          21 INT. SUBWAY - DAY 21
                         
           Nina applies the lipstick she stole from Beth, using the side
           window as a mirror. The jerky motion of the train makes it
           difficult, but she manages.
                         
                         
          22 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 22
                         
           Nina waits anxiously outside Leroy's office.
                         
           She hears someone approach, looks up and sees Leroy coming
           down the hall.
                         
           She puts on a nervous smile. He doesn't reciprocate.
                         
                          LEROY
           Yes, Nina?
                         
                          NINA
           Do you have a minute?
                         
           He doesn't answer, just opens the door to the office and
           walks in.
                         
           She takes a breath and then follows.
                         
                         
          23 INT. LEROY'S OFFICE - SAME 23
                         
           Nina closes the door and faces the cozy, dark space. Large
           couch, posters from the ballet on the wall--several featuring
           Beth.
                         
           Leroy lights a cigarette, quietly studying her and not making
           this easy. He takes a drag, and exhales.
           17.
                         
                          NINA
           If now's not a good time...
                         
                          LEROY
           Now's fine, what is it?
                         
                          NINA
           I just wanted to tell you, I
           practiced the coda last night, and
           I did it.
                         
                          LEROY
           How thrilling for you.
                         
                          NINA
                          (THROWN)
           Well...
                         
                          LEROY
           Okay, Nina, listen, I honestly
           don't care about your technique,
           you should know that by now.
                         
                          NINA
           Yes, but-
                         
                          LEROY
           Anyway, I've already chosen
           Veronica, so...
                         
          He lifts his hands in the air, "there you go."
                         
                          NINA
                          (DEVASTATED)
           I see.
                         
          She makes a move towards the door.
                         
                          LEROY
           You're not going to try and change
           my mind?
                         
          She looks back at him, uncertain.
                         
          Leroy nonchalantly stubs out his cigarette.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           You must have thought it was
           possible, coming to find me like
           this.
                         
          He pauses, looks her up and down as if trying to decipher
          her.
           18.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Why are you here? All dolled up?
                         
                          NINA
                          (UNSURE)
           I came to ask you to give me the
           part.
                         
                          LEROY
           That all?
                         
          She doesn't know what he means. He comes around his desk and
          approaches her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Truth is, when I look at you, all I
           see is the White Swan. Yes, you're
           beautiful, fragile, fearful. Ideal
           casting. But the Black Swan...it's
           a hard fucking job to dance both.
                         
                          NINA
           I can be the Black Swan too.
                         
                          LEROY
           Really? She's hungry, volatile. In
           four years, every time you dance, I
           see you obsess over getting each
           move exactly right, but I never see
           you lose yourself.
                         
          Insecure, she looks like she wants to run out of the room.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           All that discipline, for what?
                         
                          NINA
           I want to be perfect.
                         
          He laughs.
                         
                          LEROY
           Perfection's not just about
           control. It's also about letting
           go. Surprising the audience.
           Surprising yourself. Transcendence.
                         
          He considers her for a moment.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Very few have it in them.
                         
                          NINA
                          I-
           18A.
                         
          Without warning, he slowly plants a kiss on her mouth.
                         
          It lasts for a moment, but he suddenly jerks away.
                         
                          LEROY
           Ow! Fuck!
                         
          He touches his lip, stunned.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           You bit me.
           19.
                         
           She's too scared to respond.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
                          (AMUSED)
           I can't believe it. That fucking
           hurt.
                         
           He goes to the mirror to check for damage. He glances back at
           Nina.
                         
                          NINA
                          (MUMBLED)
           Sorry.
                         
           She quickly leaves, shell-shocked.
                         
                         
          24 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 24
                         
           The company stretch and go through their usual warm-up
           routine, a tension in the air. The casting decision still
           uncertain.
                         
           Nina touches her lips, thinking about the encounter. Then
           looks over at Veronica, knowing the good news in store.
           Veronica notices. Nina looks away.
                         
                          VERONICA
                          (IRKED)
           What?
                         
           Nina shakes her head.
                         
           A sudden energy sweeps the room, and she hears the sound of
           scuffling feet and whispering. "It's up." "She just posted
           it." "C'mon."
                         
           The dancers start exiting into the hallway. Veronica turns to
           follow.
                         
                          NINA
           Veronica?
                         
           Veronica turns around. It's hard, but Nina decides to be a
           good loser.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Congratulations.
                         
           Nina subtly glances at the exiting girls and Veronica
           immediately gets it.
                         
           She excitedly pushes through the crowd of girls, wanting to
           see for herself.
           20.
                         
           Knowing the outcome already, Nina continues stretching in the
           deserted space, resigned to her fate. She finishes, grabs
           her belongings and walks out.
                         
                         
          25 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - SAME 25
                         
           A crowd of dancers surround the bulletin board, jostling to
           get a look.
                         
           Nina starts walking down the hall in the opposite direction.
                         
           Behind her, she can hear a small commotion and then:
                         
           VERONICA (O.S.)
           Why did you tell me that?
                         
           She turns and sees Veronica, her face flushed with anger.
                         
                          VERONICA (CONT'D)
           Your idea of a joke?
                         
                          NINA
                          (CONFUSED)
           What?
                         
                          VERONICA
           Fuck you.
                         
           Veronica storms away.
                         
           The group of girls stares at Nina, making her very self-
           conscious.
                         
           Nina tentatively approaches the bulletin board, to see what
           Veronica's outburst was all about.
                         
           First a few, then more and more of the girls smile at her.
           They make room for her as she pushes through.
                         
           She finally gets to the CASTING NOTICE, finds "Swan Queen"
                          AND UNDERNEATH:
                         
                          NINA SAYERS
                         
           Stunned, she turns around to face the mass of ballerinas.
                         
           She sees Lily eyeing her with a flat expression, which turns
           into a smile to mask her disappointment.
                         
           The other girls start congratulating and hugging Nina, some
           more sincerely than others.
           21.
                         
          26 INT. THEATER BATHROOM - DAY 26
                         
           Nina bursts in through the door and heads directly for one of
           the stalls.
                         
           She locks herself in for privacy and dials a number on her
           CELL PHONE. She holds it to her ear, anxiously waiting for
           the person to answer.
                         
                          NINA
           Hey...Everything's fine...He picked
           me, mommy.
                         
           She waits for a response.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Did you hear me?...Yes, I'm going
           to be the Swan Queen.
                         
           Nina laughs at her mother's response and can't help but start
           crying.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I'll be home soon, okay? I just had
           to tell you.
                         
           Nina hangs up and the tears really start flowing. She's
           dreamt of this for so long, it's almost too much to bear.
                         
           She wipes the tears off with the back of her hand and pulls
           herself together. She comes out of the stall...
                         
           Horrified to discover "WHORE" written on the mirror in RED
           LIPSTICK.
                         
           Nina looks around the bathroom, to make sure she's alone.
                         
           She snags a paper towel and wipes off the insult, smearing
           the mirror with red streaks.
                         
                         
          27 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 27
                         
           Nina unlocks the door to the apartment.
                         
                          NINA
           Mom?
                         
           Nina looks around, puzzled she isn't there.
                         
                         
          28 INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATER 28
                         
           Nina opens the door and pokes her head in.
           22.
                         
           But Erica's not in there either. Nina glances at the walls.
                         
           Where several homemade PAINTINGS hang, all of the same
           subject: Nina as a young girl, posing in a tutu. On a desk,
           the ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPH is clipped to a painting in progress.
                         
           Out of the corner of her eye, one of the portraits seems to
           shift. Nina turns towards it, but the painting's now
           perfectly still.
                         
           Unsettled, Nina withdraws.
                         
                         
          29 INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 29
                         
           Post-shower, Nina's fuzzy reflection stares back in a steam
           covered mirror.
                         
           Nina takes her hand and wipes a streak across, to see herself
           more clearly.
                         
           She looks nervous. The enormity of what's in front of her
           setting in.
                         
           She turns side-to-side, scrutinizing her body. She lifts her
           arm and pinches the skin to check her weight.
                         
           She notices a small cluster of RED BUMPS on her shoulder. A
           small RASH.
                         
           She feels the bumps with her fingers, bothered.
                         
           She checks the same place on her other shoulder.
                         
           There's no rash, just faint streaks of SCAR TISSUE.
                         
           Nina slides the hamper in front of the door to block it.
                         
           In the mirror now, one of the bumps is scratched and
           bleeding.
                         
           Nina quickly wipes the blood off with her finger.
                         
           The sound of the front door opening steals her attention.
                         
                         
          30 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 30
                         
           Nina exits the bathroom wearing a robe.
                         
           In the kitchen, she sees a CAKE with a lit SPARKLER sitting
           on the table. Her mother smiles anxiously.
           23.
                         
                          ERICA
           My daughter, the Swan Queen.
                         
           She opens her arms and Nina falls into a hug.
                         
           She looks at the cake. It has a ballerina sketched with
           frosting. Nina hides her disdain.
                         
                          NINA
           Oh, mom.
                         
                          ERICA
           It's our favorite, vanilla with
           strawberry filling.
                         
           Erica picks up a knife and slices into the cake.
                         
                          NINA
           Just a little piece.
                         
           Erica ignores her and starts cutting a very large piece.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           That's way too much.
                         
                          ERICA
           It's a celebration.
                         
                          NINA
           My stomach's still in knots.
                         
                          ERICA
                          (OFFENDED)
           Fine then.
                         
           Erica grabs the whole cake and heads towards the trash.
                         
                          NINA
                          (GUILTY)
           Mom, don't. I'm sorry.
                         
           Erica hesitates, but returns. She sets the cake back down.
                         
                          ERICA
           I'm just so proud of you.
                         
           Erica lifts the slice onto a plate.
                         
                          NINA
           It looks yummy.
                         
                         
                         31 OMITTED 31
           24.
                         
          32 INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 32
                         
           First day in the new role, Nina stretches alone.
                         
           Muffled sounds of other ballerinas chatting and giggling
           drift in from the large rehearsal space. Makes Nina feel a
           little isolated.
                         
           DAVID (O.S.)
           Hey there...
                         
           Nina turns and sees DAVID, the high-cheeked, cocky dancer
           playing Prince Siegfried.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           It is so full, where do I stand.
                         
           It is his version of a joke. Nina politely laughs.
                         
                          NINA
           Yeah...good luck finding a spot.
                         
                          DAVID
           I am David.
                         
                          NINA
           I know you are. I'm Nina.
                         
                          DAVID
           Yes. Here we go, huh?
                         
           She nods, nervous.
                         
                         
          33 INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - LATER 33
                         
           David dances around the space, miming a hunt with a cross-
           bow.
                         
           Nina enters, stretches her body to illustrate her
           transformation into human, then sees David and acts spooked.
           25.
                         
           She dances away from him, a scared look on her face,
           undulating her arms to resemble a bird's flapping.
                         
           David gives chase, but Nina spins out of his grasp,
           disentangles from him.
                         
           But he eventually snags her, and they come very close
           together.
                         
                          LEROY
           Okay!
                         
           The music stops. Nina breaks out of character and looks at
           Leroy, anxious for his reaction.
                         
           The Russian ballet mistress nods and smiles, clearly pleased.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Okay, Nina. Very good.
                         
           Nina smiles, relieved. Leroy hops out of his chair and
           approaches.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But I knew the White Swan wouldn't
           be a problem. The real work will be
           your metamorphosis into the Black
           Swan.
                         
                          NINA
           Okay.
                         
                          LEROY
           I saw a flash of her yesterday. Get
           ready to show me more of that bite.
                         
           He gives her an impish smirk. She looks down, embarrassed.
                         
                         
          34 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 34
                         
           Nina takes a drink from the water fountain. She hears music
           emanating from the large rehearsal studio.
                         
           Curious, she walks to the open doorway and stops to watch.
                         
           CORPS MEMBERS and a few soloists form two lines on both sides
           of the room. In the middle, Veronica dances along with Lily.
                         
           Nina pays close attention to Lily, sizing her up. Her dancing
           is explosive, exudes sex.
                         
           LEROY (O.S.)
           Watch the way she moves...
           26.
                         
           Leroy has snuck up behind Nina at the doorway and gets very
           close to her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Imprecise, but sensual. She's not
           faking it. Pay attention.
                         
           Lily makes a small mistake, but cracks up laughing, amused
           rather than bothered by her blunder.
                         
           Nina stares at her, attracted and threatened.
                         
                         
          A35 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - DAY A35
                         
           The company's administrator, SUSIE, shows Nina into the room.
                         
                          SUSIE
           You share with Beth from now on, so
           be considerate.
                         
                          NINA
           Thanks, Susie.
                         
           Awed, Nina looks around the room. She scans Beth's
           photographs and personal belongings, and lands on a large
           bouquet of FRESH FLOWERS.
                         
                          SUSIE
           Those are for you. From Mr. Leroy.
                         
                          NINA
           Beautiful.
                         
           Susie leaves.
                         
           Nina pulls a card out from the flowers and reads. A faint
           smile curls her lips.
                         
           She opens her shoulder bag and removes a SMALL SATCHEL. She
           pulls out a pair of DIAMOND STUD EARRINGS and puts them on.
                         
                         
          35 INT. PATRON OF THE ARTS APARTMENT - NIGHT 35
                         
           Leroy pulls Nina through a fundraiser gala, filled with rich
           looking PATRONS and some DANCERS from the company.
                         
           Bewildered, Nina takes in her high-society surroundings,
           getting the occasional curious glance as she passes.
                         
           Leroy grabs a couple CHAMPAGNE glasses off a WAITER'S tray.
           He hands a glass to Nina with a smile.
           27.
                         
          He leads her up a staircase to a landing that overlooks the
          party.
                         
                          LEROY
           Ready to be thrown to the wolves?
           We need their cash, so smile. 
                         
          She smiles, as instructed.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.
                         
          The crowd turns their gaze towards them. All eyes on her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           As I stand here tonight, I see so
           many familiar faces. Your 
           contribution to the art we all
           cherish profoundly goes straight to
           my heart and I am very grateful.
                         
          Polite applause.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Let me begin with a very important
           announcement. You all have had the
           chance to be enchanted,
           transported, sometimes devastated
           by the performances of this true
           artist of our company. She has been
           an exceptional inspiration to my
           work, a role model to our dancers
           and a deeply satisfying presence on
           our stage. You all know who I am
           talking about...Beth Macintyre
                         
          More applause. Nervous, Nina unconsciously picks at her
          cuticles.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           As we all know, every great career
           comes to an end. Beth is retiring
           at the end of the season. She will
           be giving her farewell performance
           as Melpomene, the role she
           originated in my first ballet.
                         
          People start whispering, stunned by the news. Nina sees Beth
          in the crowd, giving a sad smile to the surrounding guests.
          Trying to remain dignified.
           28.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           She will be greatly missed, but she
           will always be remembered. My
           little princess.
                         
           Amidst the mummering, Nina sees Beth quietly sneak out of the
           crowd and out the front door. Leroy quickly covers.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But as we bid adieu to one star, we
           welcome another!
                         
           He looks at Nina. She stops picking her nails, self-
           conscious.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           As you know, we open our season
           with my new version of Swan Lake.
           Taking the role of our new Swan
           Queen is the exquisite Ms. Nina
           Sayers.
                         
           Restrained APPLAUSE.
                         
           Nina steps forward and curtseys. Someone seems to GIGGLE at
           her. Insecure, Nina glances towards the source and sees Lily
           flirting with a RICH GENT, uninterested in the official
           proceedings.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Soon you will have the pleasure of
           seeing her perform, tonight we
           raise a glass. To all of you, to
           Nina, to Beth, to beauty!
                         
           He downs his drink and the crowd follows suit.
                         
                         
          36 INT. LIVING ROOM, PATRON OF THE ARTS APARTMENT - LATER 36
                         
           PARTY GUESTS surround Nina and Leroy, trying to meet the
           company's newest star. Nina basks in all the attention.
                         
                          LEROY
           Dr. Brinson and his lovely wife,
           Ellen, tonight's sponsors.
                         
           She shakes DR. BRINSON'S hand and curtseys to MRS. BRINSON.
                         
                          NINA
           Such a beautiful event.
           29.
                         
           MRS. BRINSON
           Not as beautiful as you, dear.
                         
           Nina demurs. They're replaced by another HUSBAND and WIFE.
                         
                          LEROY
           And this is Mr. and Mrs. Stein.
                         
           Nina repeats the pleasantries, this time noticing that one of
           her cuticles is bleeding. She awkwardly pulls her hand away.
                         
           Leroy leans in and whispers in her ear.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Relax, you're doing great.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          37 INT. BATHROOM - LATER 37
                         
           Nina washes her hands. She looks at herself in the mirror and
           takes a deep breath.
                         
           Someone KNOCKS on the door.
                         
                          NINA
           Just a second.
                         
           She turns off the water and wipes her damp hands on the back
           of her neck, trying to cool herself.
                         
           She checks her finger. No blood, but there's a HANGNAIL.
                         
           Nina takes hold of the small flap and tries to yank it off.
                         
           Accidentally tearing a strip of skin from the nail to her
           second knuckle.
                         
           More KNOCKING startles her.
                         
           LILY (O.S.)
           Come on! I'm about to burst!
                         
           Nina quickly balls up the peeled skin and throws it away.
                         
           She opens the door.
           30.
                         
          Lily pushes in.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Hey! Look who it is.
                         
          Lily closes the door behind her and locks it.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           I'm Lily, by the way. Don't think
           we've officially met.
                         
                          NINA
                          (RATTLED)
           Nina.
                         
                          LILY
           Our New Swan Queen! That is so
           huge! You must be freaking out.
                         
                          NINA
           Yeah...
                         
          Lily slides her PANTIES out from under her dress and puts
          them in her clutch.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I should probably get back.
                         
                          LILY
           Stay. Keep me company.
                         
          Lily starts to refresh her makeup.
                         
          Nina stays put for a second, uncertain.
                         
                          NINA
           Excuse me.
           31.
                         
           She opens the door and steps out, where she's immediately met
           by Leroy.
                         
           LEROY (O.S.)
           Ah, there you are.
                         
           Lily closes the door behind her.
                         
                         
          38 EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 38
                         
           Leroy escorts Nina out. It's a couple hours later and she's
           tipsy. She stumbles a little and grabs onto Leroy.
                         
                          NINA
           I think I drank too much. All those
           toasts...
                         
                          LEROY
           You did well.
                         
                          NINA
           Really?
                         
                          LEROY
           They tried to eat you alive, but
           here you are, in one piece.
                         
                          NINA
                          (MELTING)
           I guess.
                         
                          LEROY
           I'll get you a cab. Where you
           going?
                         
                          NINA
           Oh, Upper West Side.
                         
                          LEROY
           Why don't you come to my place
           first? It's on the way.
                         
           She gives him a coy glance, reading between the lines and
           hiding her excitement.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           For a drink. Unless you've had
           enough.
                         
                          NINA
           No, that's good.
                         
           He starts to look for a cab.
           32.
                         
           MRS. BRINSON (O.S.)
           Thomas!!!
                         
          They turn, see Mrs. Brinson, the host of the party, standing
          at the door.
                         
           MRS. BRINSON (CONT'D)
           You need to say hello to Karen
           Halloway before you disappear.
           She's from Texas. Correction: she
           is Texas.
                         
                          LEROY
                          (TO NINA)
           A minute more of ass-kissing. Wait
           here.
                         
          He runs back inside to say his goodbyes.
                         
          Nina smiles after him, giddy and anxious.
                         
          She notices a slender figure watching her from the shadows of
          the adjoining doorway. In the dark, she looks like Nina.
                         
                          NINA
                          (CONCERNED)
           Hello?
                         
          Spotted, the figure backs up, seeming to disappear.
                         
          Nina cautiously approaches, but can't see anyone.
                         
          She gets closer to the doorway...and someone JUMPS OUT,
          startling her.
                         
          It's Beth, drunk and shivering. Cheeks streaked with mascara.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Beth? What are you doing out here?
                         
          Beth stares her down. Nina backs up, nervously grabbing her
          earlobe.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I was crushed to hear that you're
           leaving.
                         
                          BETH
           What'd you do to get the role?
           33.
                         
          Nina shakes her head, confused.
                         
                          BETH (CONT'D)
           He always said you were a frigid
           little girl.
                         
          Her words needle Nina, too close to the truth.
                         
                          BETH (CONT'D)
           So what did you do to make him
           change his mind? Suck his cock?
                         
                          NINA
           Some of us don't need to do that.
                         
          Nina's struck a nerve. Beth starts to come at her.
                         
                          BETH
           You fucking little whore.
                         
                          NINA
                          (GUILTY)
           Beth, I'm-
                         
           LEROY (O.S.)
           What's going on?
                         
          They both turn to see Leroy returned.
                         
                          BETH
           I need to talk to you.
                         
                          LEROY
           You're drunk. You should go home.
                         
                          BETH
           Don't do that! Don't just dismiss
           me!
                         
                          LEROY
                          (EXASPERATED)
           Poor, poor little princess. Try to
           hold it together.
                         
                          BETH
           I'm going to drop by later, okay? I
           have something I want to give you.
                         
                          LEROY
                          (IGNORING HER)
           Come on.
                         
          He puts his arm around Nina, starts to lead her away.
           34.
                         
           BETH (O.S.)
           A token of my appreciation.
                         
           He ignores her and raises his arm to hail a cab. As they
           enter the cab, Beth calls after them.
                         
                          BETH (CONT'D)
           Make the most of it Nina.
                         
           Through the cab window Nina looks at Beth, troubled by her
           words.
                         
                         
          39 INT. LEROY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 39
                         
           Tasteful but spare loft. Modern and expensive furniture.
           Large windows.
                         
           Nina stands alone, looking around his inner sanctum, wide-
           eyed.
                         
           She explores the pieces of art, the furniture. She touches
           some of it, in awe.
                         
           LEROY (O.S.)
           Here.
                         
           She turns, finds Leroy holding out yet another flute of
           champagne. For himself, a scotch.
                         
                          NINA
           Thanks.
                         
           She looks up at him, expecting him to make a move. Instead,
           he walks away, and sits in a chair. He gestures for her to
           sit as well.
                         
           Confused, she sits across from him, alone on the large couch.
                         
           He takes an unceremonious sip of his drink and studies her.
           Uncomfortable, she takes a drink as well.
                         
                          LEROY
           I thought it'd be good to talk
           about the role. Ground us a little.
                         
                          NINA
           Yes.
                         
                          LEROY
           The better we get to know each
           other, the more productive we'll
           be. I don't want there to be any
           boundaries between us.
           35.
                         
                          NINA
           Me neither.
                         
                          LEROY
           Good. So, do you have a boyfriend?
                         
          She's caught off guard by his question and just smiles
          uncomfortably. He waits for an answer. Finally she manages a
          reply.
                         
                          NINA
           No...
                         
                          LEROY
           Have you had many in the past?
                         
                          NINA
           A few. But no one serious.
                         
                          LEROY
           You're not a virgin, are you?
                         
          Her expression sours at this line of questioning. She shakes
          her head.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Then there's nothing to be
           embarrassed about, is there?
           (she shakes her head)
           And you enjoy making love?
                         
                          NINA
           Excuse me?
                         
                          LEROY
           Sex. Do you enjoy it?
                         
          Blushing and feeling awkward, she takes a sip of champagne.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           We need to be able to talk about
           this.
                         
                          NINA
           Okay.
                         
                          LEROY
           So?
                         
          Nina looks at him, embarrassed, and shrugs.
                         
          He smirks, and joins her on the couch.
           36.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           I have a homework assignment for
           you.
                         
                          NINA
           Yes?
                         
                          LEROY
           Go home and masturbate. Live a
           little.
                         
           She blanches, scandalized. He finishes off his scotch and
           stands.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           It's late. Lots of work tomorrow.
           The doorman will find you a cab.
                         
           He leaves her alone in the living room.
                         
                         
          40 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 40
                         
           Nina looks at herself in the mirror, removing bobbie-pins, as
           Erica folds clothing and puts it away.
                         
                          ERICA
           Sounds like quite an evening. Wish
           I could have been there.
                         
                          NINA
           You know I asked.
                         
                          ERICA
           I know, Susie told me. Guess he
           wanted you all to himself.
                         
                          NINA
           That's not why.
                         
           Erica looks adoringly at Nina's reflection in the mirror.
                         
                          ERICA
           I don't blame him.
                         
           Erica starts to remove Nina's DIAMOND EARRINGS, but pauses.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Where did you get these?
                         
                          NINA
           They're fake.
           37.
                         
                          ERICA
           Fooled me.
                         
           Erica removes the earrings, then walks behind Nina to unzip
           her. Nina faces her.
                         
                          NINA
           I can do it.
                         
                          ERICA
           Turn.
                         
           Nina turns back around, reticent.
                         
           ERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           He must have been at your side all
           night, showing you off.
                         
           Erica finishes unzipping the red dress and sees Nina's
           shoulder.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Oh Nina...
                         
           Remembering, Nina pulls away from her.
                         
                          NINA
           It's just a rash.
                         
           Erica gruffly pulls Nina to the mirror and turns her around.
                         
                          ERICA
           What are you talking about?
                         
           Nina checks her reflection and sees the RASH, red and
           irritated from scratching.
                         
                          NINA
           It was worse a couple days ago.
           It's already getting better.
                         
                          ERICA
           You've been scratching again.
                         
                          NINA
                          NO-
                         
           Erica yanks her out of the room.
                         
                         
          41 INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 41
                         
           Nina sits on the toilet, stripped to her underwear. She does
           her best to cover herself.
           38.
                         
           Erica finishes dabbing her back with HYDROGEN PEROXIDE and
           replaces the cap on the bottle.
                         
           She pulls out NAIL CLIPPERS and cuts Nina's nails down to
           their base. Each CLICK makes Nina twitch.
                         
                          ERICA
           I thought you'd outgrown this
           disgusting habit.(click) You
           haven't done it for years. (click)
                         
                          NINA
           Mom, please.
                         
           Erica grabs Nina's other hand.
                         
                          ERICA
           It's the role, isn't it? All this
           pressure... I was worried it'd be
           too much.
                         
           Nina stares at her, seething.
                         
                         
          42 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - LATER 42
                         
           Nina crawls into bed, avoiding her mother's eyes.
                         
                          ERICA
           Don't be mad at me. You know I love
           you, you know I want what's best.
           But we have to take care of you.
                         
           Nina doesn't respond.
                         
           Erica opens the JEWELRY BOX and the tinny music begins
           playing.
                         
           She hums and starts to stroke Nina's hair.
                         
           Nina tries to brush her hand away.
                         
           But Erica brings it back and keeps stroking.
                         
                         
          43 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 43
                         
           Nina lies wide awake after a restless night.
                         
           She slowly reaches down under the covers, down between her
           legs, to complete Leroy's "homework assignment."
                         
           She closes her eyes and starts to maneuver.
           39.
                         
           She suddenly hears a RUSTLING sound and a short SNORE.
                         
           She freezes and opens her eyes. She slowly sits up in bed and
           sees Erica SLEEPING on a chair in the corner of the room.
                         
           Nina glares at her.
                         
                         
          44 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 44
                         
           Nina waits her turn as a row of DANCERS perform grand jetes
           diagonally across the room.
                         
           She watches Veronica perform her leaps. She rejoins the
           group, giving Nina a nasty stare.
                         
           Nina avoids it, looking towards Lily, who gives her a small
           smile.
                         
           Just as Nina's turn arrives, a panicked YOUNG CORPS DANCER
           rushes in and makes a beeline for the severe ballet mistress.
                         
           Nina takes one leap and then stops dancing, sensing
           something's wrong.
                         
           The corps dancer whispers into the ballet mistress' ear. A
           look of shock on the mistress' face.
                         
           The dancer collapses into the older woman's arms.
                         
           The piano music trickles to a halt.
                         
           Nina exchanges glances with some of the other dancers.
                         
           First a few, then more dancers approach the two women,
           wanting to find out what's happened.
                         
           Nina hangs back, filled with a sinking feeling.
                         
                         
          45 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER FOUNTAIN - DAY 45
                         
           Nina sits as Leroy, worse for the wear, stares at the jets of
           water.
                         
                          NINA
           What happened?
           40.
                         
                          LEROY
           She walked into the street, got hit
           by a car.
                         
                          NINA
           Oh my god...
                         
                          LEROY
           I'm sure she did it on purpose.
                         
                          NINA
           How do you know?
                         
                          LEROY
           Everything Beth ever did came from
           within. From some dark impulse.
           It's what could make her so
           thrilling to watch. Even perfect at
           times. But also destructive.
                         
           Nina hesitates, but has to ask.
                         
                          NINA
           Was it right after we saw her?
                         
                          LEROY
           It's not your problem. This has
           nothing to do with you.
                         
           She looks away, not so sure.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Nina, don't let yourself be
           distracted. Dance is not
           immortalized like music, poetry or
           art. It lives for now. For this
           moment only. And this is your
           moment.
                         
           She attempts a nod.
                         
                         
          A46 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - DAY A46
                         
           Beth's belongings have already been packed up and cleared.
           Guilt-ridden, Nina tries to get ready.
                         
           She picks up her duffel bag, and removes her SATCHEL. She
           unpacks its contents onto the counter: needle and thread,
           cigarettes, a makeup compact, and the tube of lipstick.
                         
           She looks over at the vase of flowers. A few have wilted.
                         
           She pulls them out to make the bouquet look fresh again.
           41.
                         
          46 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 46
                         
           Nina exits the elevator with a BROWN SHOPPING BAG. She walks
           down a stark hallway and approaches Beth's hospital room.
                         
           Members of BETH'S FAMILY surround the bed, blocking Beth from
           view.
                         
           Nina considers going in, but shyly sulks past, drawing the
           attention of an OLDER NURSE.
                         
                          OLDER NURSE
           You can go in.
                         
                          NINA
           It's okay.
                         
           The older nurse gives her a skeptical glance and continues on
           her rounds.
                         
           Nina walks a little further and leans against the wall to
           wait.
                         
           She hears the sound of shuffling feet, looks over, and sees
           the group of people exit the room and walk down the hall,
           comforting one another.
                         
           Nina steps out from hiding and goes inside.
                         
                         
          47 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM- DAY 47
                         
           Beth is bandaged and unconscious, attached to MACHINES.
                         
           Nina stands at a distance, too intimidated to approach at
           first.
                         
           She looks around the room. It is lined with large, EXPENSIVE-
           LOOKING BOUQUETS.
                         
           She removes the flowers Leroy gave her from the brown bag,
           and sets them next to the others.
                         
           Nina slowly approaches Beth's bedside.
                         
           Beth's face is heavily wrapped with bandages. Only her closed
           eyes and pale lips can be seen.
                         
           She scans down her body, sees a sliver of her thigh, purple
           with bruises.
                         
           Curious, Nina lifts the top edge of the blanket and peeks
           underneath.
           42.
                         
           The legs are bloated and horribly bruised, pierced with large
           pins to reset the shattered bones.
                         
           She looks lower and lower, and discovers MAGGOTS feeding on
           her ankles.
                         
           Nina turns away, confronted by the Older Nurse.
                         
                          OLDER NURSE
           What are you doing?!
                         
           Nina doesn't have an answer. She just stumbles out the door.
                         
                         
          A48 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT A48
                         
           Nina steps out of her apartment into the dim hallway, lugging
           a bag of trash.
                         
           She notices some WOODEN DEBRIS from an apartment renovation
           sitting near the trash chute.
                         
           Nina drops the trash bag in the chute, then picks up a piece
           of BROKEN WOOD.
                         
           She considers it for a moment, and hides it inside the sleeve
           of her sweatshirt.
                         
                         
          B48 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - LATER B48
                         
           Nina quietly steps inside and heads towards her bedroom.
                         
           Through Erica's open bedroom door, Nina can see Erica busily
           sewing ribbon onto pointe shoes, humming to herself.
                         
           Nina quietly slips back inside her room.
                         
           She removes the wood piece and jams it between the door
           closet, creating a makeshift doorjamb
                         
           She tests it. Holds pretty well.
                         
           She hears a creek. FOOTSTEPS approach. She removes the wood
           and sticks it inside her dresser, not ready just yet.
                         
           She quickly lies down on her bed and waits to be tucked in.
                         
           The door SQUEAKS open, and Nina looks towards it.
           42A.
                         
          48A INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 48A
                         
           Nina, David, and the dancer playing ROTHBART rehearse the
           Black Swan and Prince Siegfried's Pas De Deux from Act 3.
                         
           David lifts her, then sets her down, and they lean-in towards
           each other, almost kissing.
                         
                          LEROY
           No, no, not so stiff. Don't be
           scared of him.
                         
           She pulls away from David, not at all coyly. Leroy exhales,
           frustrated.
           43-46.

           Nina and David dance the next part of the section, looking
           more worn out.
                         
                          LEROY
           Forget about control. I want to see
           passion.
                         
           She still looks tense, not getting it.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)

           Nina practices with an OLDER BALLET MISTRESS. She
           demonstrates a movement, and Nina mimics her. The mistress
           scrutinizes, unimpressed.

           muscle aches, but Nina breathes through the pain.

           Nina and David finish the section, completely soaked with
           sweat.
                         
           They look at Leroy, heaving breaths.
                         
                          LEROY
           David, answer me this question: are
           you interested in fucking her?
                         
           David snickers, embarrassed, shakes his head.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           No, of course not. No one would be.
                         
           Leroy comes face to face with her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Nina, your Black Swan still looks
           no different than your White Swan.
           She's's just as...frigid.
                         
          49B Suddenly, the lights turn off, throwing them into total 49B
           darkness.

           Fuck!
                         
           Leroy angrily marches to the door and whips it open.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           (to someone in hall)
           Hey! We're still working in here.
           Lights back on.
                         
           There's a momentary pause, and then the lights return.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Thank you!
           (to David, Piano Player)
           Okay, you guys can go. Thank you
           for your patience.
                          (TO NINA)
           You stay.
                         
           David gives her an insinuating glance, then shakes his head.
           Very used to Leroy's "methods."
                         
                          DAVID
           Have fun.
                         
           David and the Piano Player leave them alone.
                         
          49C Leroy approaches Nina and takes her hands in his. 49C
                         
                          LEROY
           I'll be the Prince.
                         
           Made nervous by his touch, she nods.
                         
           He walks behind her and puts his hands on her waist.
                         
           He starts humming the score. And then they begin.
                         
           They do a series of lifts and spins, Leroy bracing her.
                         
           He lets go, she moves away from him.
                         
                          LEROY
           Use each finger, your face, your
           tits, everything. Entice me!
                         
           He grabs her wrist. She spins. He lets go. He grabs her other
           wrist, she spins to face him.
                         
           They get very close.
                         
           Just before they kiss she dips, pulls away.
           43-46B.
                         
          He grabs her arm again, she spins, then he stops her, her
          back to him.
                         
          He runs his hands down her arms. Slowly, seductively. She
          trembles.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Just feel my touch and respond.
                         
          She turns and leans in close, as though to kiss him... almost
          touching lips...but then she tries to push off again. He
          tightens his grip, holds her there.
                         
          She looks back at him, questioning. He looks at her
          intently, pulls her to him, and kisses her.
                         
          She melts and eagerly kisses him back. He pulls away,
          momentarily.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Slow down. Open your mouth.
                         
          She doesn't.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
                          (INSISTENT)
           Open it.
                         
          Nina follows his instruction.
                         
          The kiss grows more heated and he wraps his arms around her.
                         
          He pushes her back against the mirror. She whimpers.
                         
          He runs his hand down her body, then reaches between her
          legs. She GASPS, tries to pull his hand out, but he persists.
                         
          She throws her head back as he kisses her neck. She breathes
          deep, emits short MOANS, succumbing...
                         
          Suddenly, he pulls away from her. She looks at him confused,
          flushed and breathing hard.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           That was me seducing you. It needs
           to be the other way around.
                         
          He turns and starts to walk away. She can't believe it.
                         
                          NINA
           Please don't...
                         
          He ignores her and walks out of the room.

           watching her from the doorway. Looks like HERSELF.
                         
                          NINA
           Who's that?
                         
           Lily emerges from the darkness, dressed to leave.
                         
                          LILY
           You okay?
                         
                          NINA
           I'm fine.
                         
                          LILY
           You sure?
                         
          50B Lily sits down beside her, oblivious of Nina's desire 50B
           to be left alone.
                         
           She digs out a cigarette from her bag. Offers it to Nina.
           Nina doesn't take it.
                         
                          NINA
           We can't smoke in here.
                         
                          LILY
           I won't tell if you won't.
           48.
                         
          Nina reluctantly takes the cigarette, holds it a little
          awkwardly, clearly not a regular smoker.
                         
          Lily sparks a flame for her and then lights one for herself.
          Nina puffs, but doesn't inhale. Lily smirks.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Big day's getting closer and
           closer, huh? I can't wait. You're
           going to be amazing.
                         
                          NINA
           Thanks...
                         
          Nina wipes off her tears with her hand.
                         
                          LILY
           So, want to talk about it?
                         
                          NINA
           Just had a hard day.
                         
                          LILY
           Leroy play too rough?
                         
          Nina looks at her surprised.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           He seems like a prick.
                         
                          NINA
           He's brilliant.
                         
                          LILY
           Sure, but not exactly warm and
           fuzzy.
                         
                          NINA
           You don't know him.
                         
          Lily smirks with a realization.
                         
                          LILY
           Someone's hot for teacher.
                         
          Nina gives her a withering glance.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           It's okay. I don't blame you.
                         
          Nina stands up.
           49.
                         
                          NINA
           I should go. It's getting late.
                         
                          LILY
           Hey, I was only playing.
                         
           Nina walks towards the door.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Nina?
                         
           She ignores Lily and exits.

          52A INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 52A
                         
           Nina lies in the bath, eyes closed, concentrating.
                         
           Her body jostles slightly, moving her hand between her legs,
           seeking release.
                         
           Growing frustrated, she moves more and more aggressively.
                         
           She abruptly stops and submerges herself under the water,
           defeated.
                         
           She lies still, her arms wrapped around her chest.
                         
           She opens her eyes, her vision distorted by the water.
                         
           Suddenly, her blurred Double appears, staring down at her.
                         
           Nina shoots up.
                         
           The Double is gone.
                         
           Nina scans the bathroom, but she is alone.
                         
           Nina notices some water dropping off her fingers, onto the
           lip of the tub.
                         
           Then a few drops of RED land on the white porcelain.
                         
           Worried, she examines her fingernails, which have started to
           grow back. She discovers blood and bits of skin.
           50.
                         
          52B LATER 52B
                         
           Out of the tub, Nina checks herself in the mirror. Her
           shoulder is streaked with deep SCRATCHES.
                         
           She grabs a pair of little SCISSORS from the medicine cabinet
           and starts trimming her fingernails.
                         
           She looks up at the mirror and sees her reflection snip off
           the tip of her index finger.
                         
           Nina GASPS and drops the scissors, CLANGING in the sink. Two
           of her fingers are bleeding, their tips sliced.

           Nina?
                         
           Nina looks at the door, already blocked by the hamper.
                         
                          NINA
           I'll be out in a second.
                         
           She stays still, hoping she won't try to come in.
                         
           Footsteps recede and Nina breathes.
                         
           She runs her hands under some water to clean off the blood.

           David and Nina dance the Black Swan's Pas de Deux. Once
           again, Nina's rigid and self-conscious.
           51.
                         
                          LEROY
           Try it again.
                         
          They resume dancing. She finishes, out of breath, and looks
          at Leroy and the Russian ballet mistress.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Again.
                         
          The piano music starts up again, and she begins dancing.
                         
          When she finishes, she looks at him, eager for feedback.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Again.
                         
          The music starts up again. Nina stays still, frustrated.
                         
                          NINA
           Do you have any corrections?
                         
                          LEROY
           No.
                         
          She doesn't understand. He gets up from his chair and goes to
          her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Lily talked to me. Said she saw you
           crying.
                         
          Nina looks away. Can't believe Lily talked to him.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           She said you were upset and I
           should "take it easy" on you.
                         
                          NINA
           I didn't tell her that.
                         
                          LEROY
           Maybe you'd like a break for a day
           or two.

                          NINA
           She shouldn't have said anything!
                         
                          LEROY
           I don't care! You shouldn't be
           whining to her!
                         
                          NINA
           I didn't.
                         
                          LEROY
           You could be brilliant. Taking it
           easy would be a betrayal.
                         
           He walks away from her.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
                         
                          LEROY
           Stop saying that! Stop being so
           damn weak!
                         
           He tosses his chair across the room. SMASHING into the wall.

           Furious, Nina heads towards the soloists' dressing room.
           Hears them chatting in their usual manner.
                         
           Nina KNOCKS loudly at the door, interrupting them.

           Shut up.
                         
           And they do.

           Nina leads Lily to a private nook, fuming.
                         
                          LILY
           What's wrong?
                         
                          NINA
           You told Thomas about last night?
                         
           Lily falters, guilty.
                         
                          LILY
           I ran into him this morning. He
           said you guys were having some
           trouble.
                         
                          NINA
           Why would he talk to you?
                         
                          LILY
           Whoa your highness, I just told him
           you're working your ass off and I'm
           sure you'll be great.
                         
                          NINA
           You shouldn't have done that.
                         
                          LILY
           I didn't fucking do anything.
                         
           Lily takes off. Nina stares after her, at a loss.
                         
                         
          A58 INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT A58
                         
           Nina sits on the subway, going home. She notices that one of
           her fingernails has a jagged edge. She removes an EMORY BOARD
           from her bag and begins filing it down.
                         
           A SKEEZY MAN across the aisle ogles her.
           54.
                         
           Nina keeps her eyes down, trying to ignore him. He starts to
           sing an OLD LOVE SONG from the 20's.
                         
           Nina stands and goes to the other end of the car. He
           continues singing, undeterred.

          59 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 59
                         
           Nina sits on the floor in a loose sweatshirt, sewing ribbon 
           onto pointe shoes. 
                         
           Erica sits across from her, sewing ribbon onto another pair. 
                         
                          ERICA
           Has he tried anything with you?
                         
           Nina doesn't respond. 
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           He has a reputation...
                         
           Nina tries to ignore her.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           I have a right to be concerned,
           Nina. You've been staying late so
           many nights. "Rehearsing." I hope
           he's not taking advantage, that's
           all.
                         
                          NINA
           He's not. 
                         
                          ERICA
           Good. I don't want you making the
           same mistake I did.
                         
                          NINA
                          (INSULTED)
           Thanks.
                         
                          ERICA
           Not like that. I just mean as far
           as my career was concerned.
                         
                          NINA
           What career?
                         
                          ERICA
           The one I gave up to have you.
           55.
                         
                          NINA
           You were 28.
                         
                          ERICA
           So?
                         
                          NINA
           And only...
                         
          Nina bites her tongue.
                         
                          ERICA
           Only what?
                         
                          NINA
           Nothing.
                         
                          ERICA
           What?
                         
                          NINA
                          (DEFIANT)
           Nothing.
                         
          Erica glares at her.
                         
                          ERICA
           How's your skin?
                         
                          NINA
           It's fine.
                         
                          ERICA
           We leaving it alone?
                         
                          NINA
           Yes.
                         
                          ERICA
           Let me see. 
                         
          Nina stares back defiantly. 
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D) 
           Take off your shirt. 
                         
                          NINA 
           No. 
                         
          Erica starts to come towards her. 
                         
          The DOORBELL RINGS. 
                         
          Erica looks at Nina questioningly. Nina shakes her head.
           56.
                         
           Erica goes to the door and cracks it open, keeping the chain
           engaged.
                         
                          ERICA
           (to person outside)
           Can I help you? (pause) I'm sorry,
           she's not in.
                         
           Erica shuts the door. Nina rushes out to see who it was.
                         
                          NINA
           Who was it?
                         
           Erica doesn't answer.
                         
           Irritated, Nina walks around Erica and quickly opens the door
           to find out.
                         
                          ERICA
           It's no one.
                         
                         
          60 INT. BUILDING HALLWAY- NIGHT 60
                         
           Nina sees a ballerina walking away from the door.
                         
                          NINA
           Hello?
                         
           Lily turns.
                         
                          LILY
           Hey.
                         
                          NINA
                          (SUSPICIOUS)
           What are you doing here?
                         
           Nina steps out of her apartment and closes the door.
                         
                          LILY
           I wanted to apologize.
                         
           Nina just stares, incredulous.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           You were right, I shouldn't have
           talked to him about you.
                         
           Erica opens the door and sticks her head out.
                         
                          ERICA
           Sweetheart?
           57.
                         
                          NINA
           Give me a second.
                         
                          ERICA
           Your dinner...
                         
                          NINA
           Mom, please!
                         
          Erica closes the door.
                         
                          LILY
           She's a trip...
                         
                          NINA
           How did you know where I live?
                         
                          LILY
           I have my ways.
                         
          Nina looks at her, darkly.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Relax, I got it from Susie in the
           office. I feel really shitty. Can I
           make it up to you? Take you out to
           dinner?
                         
                          NINA
           I don't think-
                         
                          LILY
           A drink?
                         
          Nina's tempted. Erica pokes her head out again.
                         
                          ERICA
           Sweetie, you need to rest.
                         
                          LILY
           Jesus.
                         
          Nina pushes the elevator call button.
                         
                          NINA
                          (TO LILY)
           Wait.
                         
          Nina walks to the door, and grabs her coat.
                         
                          ERICA
           What are you doing?
           58.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm going out.
                         
                          ERICA
           What?
                         
           Nina ignores her and shuts the door.
                         
                          NINA
                          (TO LILY)
           Let's go.
                         
                         
          61 INT. CORNER BISTRO - NIGHT 61
                         
           A noisy bar and burger joint, packed to the brim. Lily and
           Nina sit at a small table.
                         
                          LILY
           Can't believe that's what he called
           her. So gross!
                         
                          NINA
           I think it's sweet.
                         
                          LILY
           Little princess? He probably calls
           every girl that.
                         
                          NINA
           Only Beth.
                         
                          LILY
           Well, I'm sure she lost the title
           after her game of chicken.
                         
           Nina's smile fades.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Bet he'll be calling you little
           princes any day now.
                         
                          NINA
           I don't think so.
           59.
                         
                          LILY
           Sure, just gotta let him eat the
           pussy.
                         
          Nina blushes, embarrassed, and Lily cracks up. A WAITER drops
          a plate in front of her.
                         
                          WAITER
                          (TO LILY)
           Cheese burger, extra bloody.
                         
                          LILY
           Danke schoen.
                         
                          WAITER
           Let me know if it's not juicy
           enough.
                         
                          LILY
           Oh, I will.
                         
          He smiles, keeping his eyes locked on Lily, as he rudely
          plops down Nina's plate.
                         
                          WAITER
           Enjoy.
                         
          Lily watches him go, then notices Nina looking annoyed.
                         
                          LILY
           What?
                         
                          NINA
           Guess I'm invisible.
                         
          Lily studies her and digs into her purse. Pulls out a SEXY
          SHIRT.
                         
                          LILY
           Here, wanna spruce up?
                         
          Nina gives her a puzzled look.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           I always carry a spare, case I wake
           up somewhere unexpected.
                         
          Lily picks up her ungainly burger and takes a big bite, a
          little grease dripping down her chin. Nina cuts into her dry
          chicken breast.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Not like you need more attention
           these days. How is he?
           60.
                         
          Nina doesn't understand the question.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Thomas?
                         
                          NINA
           I wouldn't know.
                         
                          LILY
           Yeah, right.
                         
                          NINA
           I don't want to talk about it.
                         
                          LILY
           Relax, you're so tense.
                         
          Lily pulls out a cigarette case and clicks it open. Inside,
          CIGARETTES and a couple PILLS.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           One for you...
                         
          Lily grabs one of the pills and slides it over.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           And one for me.
                         
          Lily grabs her pill and downs it with a beer.
                         
          Nina stares at her pill, too embarrassed to admit she doesn't
          know what it is.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Don't worry, it's pure. Brought it
           with me straight from San
           Francisco.
                         
                          NINA
           What is it?
                         
                          LILY
           You're kidding? You never rolled?
                         
          Nina blinks.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Oh boy. It'll just make you have a
           good time. Loosen up. See the night
           sky.
                         
                          NINA
                          (CURIOUS)
           How long does it last?
           61.
                         
                          LILY
           Couple hours. Tops.
                         
           Nina looks at the pill, thinks about it for a second...
                         
                          NINA
           That's okay.
                         
                          LILY
           Sure?
                         
           Nina nods. Lily puts the pill back, and SNAPS the case
           closed.
                         
                         
          62 INT. GRUNGY BATHROOM - NIGHT 62
                         
           Wearing the SKIMPY SHIRT Lily offered her, Nina rinses her
           mouth out with water from the sink, then checks herself out
           in the mirror.
                         
           It's broken and covered with graffiti and stickers. One
           particularly bright one says, "Seize the Day-glo."
                         
           Nina's cell phone RINGS. She checks the ID--"MOM"--and
           silences it.
                         
           Nina puts her SWEATSHIRT back on over the shirt, and exits.
                         
                         
          63 INT. CORNER BISTRO - NIGHT 63
                         
           Nina returns to her table, but when she gets there, Lily is
           gone and the table is cleared.
                         
           She looks around the crowded room, doesn't see her anywhere.
                         
           She heads towards the exit, and sees Lily at the bar,
           flirting with TWO ATTRACTIVE MEN. She's very touchy-feely.
                         
           Intrigued, Nina stays put, wanting to observe Lily from a
           distance.
                         
           The BARTENDER sets a drink down in front of Lily. The men
           compete to pay for it.
                         
           Lily takes out the CIGARETTE CASE from her purse, and removes
           the pill.
                         
           Nina looks on, suspicious.
                         
           Lily opens the pill, and dumps its contents into the drink.
           She stirs it with her finger.
           62.
                         
          She holds out her finger to one of the men, he sucks off the
          liquid.
                         
          Lily looks over and catches Nina watching. She waves for her
          to join them.
                         
          Nina reluctantly walks to her.
                         
                          LILY
           Heeey, thought we could use some
           drinks.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm gonna go.
                         
                          LILY
           This is Tom and this is Jerry.
                         
          The guys laugh.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Actually it's Andrew.
                         
                          TOM
           Tom.
                         
                          NINA
           Hi.
                         
                          LILY
           You can't leave, I bought you a
           drink.
                         
          Lily holds out the doctored beverage. Nina eyes it, tempted
          to go down the rabbit hole...
                         
                          NINA
           I really shouldn't, we're on the
           stage tomorrow.
                         
                          LILY
           What, you gonna go home to mommy?
           Live a little.
                         
          Nina grins sheepishly and takes the drink. Lily smiles.
                         
                          NINA
           Just a couple of hours?
                         
                          LILY
           Tops.
                         
          Nina takes a tiny sip.
           63.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Go on.
                         
           Nina takes another sip and smiles.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Let's go sit somewhere a little
           more comfortable. Gentlemen?
                         
           She gets up and holds out her hands. The two men each grab
           one and she leads them deeper into the bar.
                         
                         
          64 INT. CORNER BISTRO - MOMENTS LATER 64
                         
           Nina's drink is half gone. The foursome sits snugly at a
           booth. Nina next to Andrew, shyly avoiding his gaze. She
           takes another tentative sip of her drink.
                         
                          ANDREW
           You haven't told me who you are.
                         
                          NINA
           Oh, I'm a dancer.
                         
                          ANDREW
           No, I mean your name.
                         
                          NINA
           Nina.
                         
                          TOM
           You two sisters?
                          LILY NINA
           Yes. No.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Well?
                         
                          LILY
           We're blood sisters.
                         
                          NINA
           We dance in the same company.
                         
                          TOM
                          (PLEASED)
           Ahh, ballerinas. So that's why you
           look alike.
                         
                          LILY
           Tom and Jerry are gay lovers.
           64.
                         
                          TOM
           Very funny.
                         
                          LILY
           Oh, I just assumed.
                         
                          ANDREW
           I've never been to the ballet.
                         
                          LILY
           In that case you're definitely NOT
           gay.
                         
                          TOM
           It's pretty boring, isn't it?
                         
                          NINA
                          (OFFENDED)
           No, it's not.
                         
                          LILY
                          (FLIRTY)
           It's not for everyone. You probably
           aren't sophisticated enough.
                         
                          TOM
           You've got some mouth, you know
           that?
                         
                          LILY
           Isn't that compliment a little
           premature?
                         
          Lily sips her drink, staring at Tom flirtatiously.
                         
                          NINA
           You guys should come sometime. I
           can comp you tickets.
                         
          Tom laughs, amused by Nina's earnestness.
                         
                          TOM
           Yeah...that'd be neat.
                         
                          LILY
           I think we all need another round.
           Bottom's up.
                         
          She looks at Nina and sucks down her drink, challenging her
          to follow suit. Nina takes a breath of courage and empties
          her glass.
                         
          She waits for something to kick in.
           65.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Tom, come with me?
                         
          Lily slips out of the booth and Tom follows, leaving Nina and
          Andrew alone. She avoids his gaze, nervous.
                         
                          ANDREW
           So...what are you guys working on
           these days?
                         
          Her cell phone RINGS, interrupting him. She quickly turns it
          off and gives him an embarrassed smile.
                         
                          NINA
           Sorry. Swan Lake.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Yeah?
                         
                          NINA
           You know it?
                         
                          ANDREW
           Oh, no, not really. Heard of it
           though. What's it about?
                         
                          NINA
           It's about a girl who's been turned
           into a swan. She needs love to
           break the spell.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Okay.
                         
                          NINA
           Yeah, but her prince falls for the
           wrong girl and she kills herself.
                         
                          ANDREW
           So a happy ending, then?
                         
                          NINA
           It's beautiful, actually.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Like you.
                         
          She starts to feel the initial tingles of the drug.
                         
                          NINA
           Huh?
                         
                          ANDREW
           I said you're beautiful.
           66.
                         
           She giggles.
                         
                          ANDREW (CONT'D)
           That funny?
                         
           She gives him a flirtatious glance.
                         
                          NINA
           My hands are all sweaty.
                         
           Andrew touches them. She grabs onto his hands. She looks at
           his face. His eyes twinkle at her.
                         
           Lily slides in next to her. Nina sees her and melts into her
           body. Lily hugs her back.
                         
                          LILY
           Uh oh! Looks like someone's
           rolling. Let's get you dancing.
                         
                         
          A65 OMITTED A65 
                         
                         
          65 INT. DANCE CLUB - NIGHT 65
                         
           Nina kisses Tom on the floor of a crowded dance club. The
           drug is in full effect.
                         
           The world has soft edges, colors are vivid and bleed into one
           another.
                         
           Lily twirls her around.
                         
           Nina attaches herself to her, hungry for the attention. A
           cheering section of guys surrounds them.
                         
           Nina lets loose. Dances with abandon.
                         
                         
          66 INT. CLUB BATHROOM - LATER 66
                         
           Nina makes out with someone, her back pushed up against the
           wall. Her eyes are closed, she's shiny with sweat.
                         
           She opens her eyes, confused to find that it's not Andrew or
           even Tom, just a STRANGE MAN.
                         
           She backs away. He reaches for her, but she swats him off.

          67 INT. DANCE CLUB - SAME 67
                         
           She stumbles around the dance floor, looking for Lily, but
           only sees a mass of moving bodies.
                         
           She finally spots a girl that looks like her from behind.
           Nina grabs her shoulder and the GIRL spins around. Not Lily.
                         
                         
          68 EXT. DANCE CLUB - LATER 68
                         
           Nina pushes her way out of the club, starting to panic. She
           looks around, trying to figure out where she is, but the city
           is dark and non-descript.
                         
           LILY (O.S.)
           Nina!
                         
           Nina turns towards the voice and, with relief, sees Lily exit
           the club.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Where you goin'?
                         
                         
          69 INT. TAXI - NIGHT 69
                         
           Nina stares adoringly at Lily, who has her eyes closed,
           enjoying the cool air blowing in from her open window.
                         
           Lily opens her eyes and catches Nina staring. Lily smirks.
                         
           Using her index and middle finger as "legs," she "walks" her
           hand over the vinyl seat, all the way to Nina's leg and pokes
           it.
                         
           Nina watches her hand with a smile on her face, glances at
           Lily.
                         
           Lily smiles back, and then "walks" her hand up the leg, until
           it reaches the edge of Nina's dress.
                         
           Lily looks at Nina questioningly. Nina doesn't protest.
                         
           Lily slips her hand underneath the dress, gently makes
           contact...
                         
           Nina shudders, but pulls Lily's hand back out and holds it.
                         
           Lily snickers and looks out her window.
                         
           Nina looks at their clasped hands, then out her own window,
           happy.

          70 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT HALLWAY - LATER 70
                         
           Nina quietly opens the front door.
                         
           Lily GIGGLES. Nina SHUSHES her.
                         
           They slip off their shoes and tip-toe inside.

           Nina eases the door shut.
                         
           Lily taps her on the shoulder and points towards the hallway.
                         
           Erica emerges from the darkness, approaching them slowly.
           Distraught.
                         
                          ERICA
           Do you have any idea what time it
           is?
                         
                          NINA
           Mmm-hmm. Late.
                         
                          ERICA
           Where have you been?
                         
                          NINA
           To the moon and back.
                         
                          ERICA
           You've been drinking.

           Ding ding ding.
                         
           Lily snickers, Nina tries to keep a straight face, but ends
           up laughing.
                         
                          ERICA
           What else?
                         
                          NINA
           Huh?
                         
                          ERICA
           What else have you been doing?
                         
           Nina smiles coyly.
                         
                          NINA
           You want to know their names?
           69.
                         
           Erica grabs Nina's wrist.
                         
                          ERICA
           You need to sleep it off.
                         
                          NINA
           There were two. Tom and Jerry...
                         
                          ERICA
           Be quiet, Nina.
                         
                          NINA
                          (GIGGLING)
           I fucked both of them.
                         
                          ERICA
           Shut your mouth!
                         
           Erica violently jams her fingers over Nina's lips, trying to
           silence her.
                         
           Nina runs into her room and SLAMS the door.
                         
                         
          72A INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - SAME 72A
                         
           She grabs the broken PIECE OF WOOD from the dresser and jams
           the door. She backs Lily away, preparing for the storm.
                         
                          NINA
           Don't come in here!
                         
           Erica tries to open the door, but it gets stuck. She peers
           her eye through the crack.
                         
                          ERICA
           What's this?
                         
                          NINA
           It's called privacy! I'm not
           fucking twelve years old anymore!
                         
           Erica struggles a little with the door, but can't get it to
           budge.
                         
                          ERICA

           LEAVE ME ALONE!!!
                         
           Nina SHOVES the door shut.
                         
           Erica's FOOTSTEPS retreat, followed by the SLAM of her
           bedroom door.
                         
          72B Nina is worked up, breathing hard. 72B
                         
           LILY (O.S.)
           Whoa...
                         
           Nina turns around and sees her Double smiling at her.
                         
           Nina flees to the door. Pauses. She peeks back and sees that
           it's actually Lily.
                         
           Relieved, she grabs Lily and kisses her, revved-up.
                         
           Lily responds with equal force. They claw at each other,
           passion exceeding coordination.
                         
           Lily pulls Nina's shirt off and throws her onto the bed.
                         
           She straddles Nina, who looks up at her carnivorously.
                         
           Lily takes her own top off, plunges down and kisses Nina.
                         
           Nina flips Lily over, becomes the dominant one.
                         
           Lily scratches Nina's back, over some of the rash.
                         
           There's subtle movement underneath the skin. Little pin
           pricks push up the flesh, trailing behind her hand.
                         
           Self-conscious, Nina grabs Lily's hand and holds her wrists
           down.
                         
           She bites her neck. Lily smiles, likes the violence.
                         
           She digs her nails into Nina's hands.
                         
           Then Lily gets back on top of Nina. The tattooed lilies on
           her back undulate and spread out. Morphing into dark wings.
                         
           She kisses down Nina's body. Further and further...
           71.
                         
           Lily starts to go down on Nina.
                         
           Nervous, Nina whimpers. Glances down and sees the DOUBLE.
                         
           She tries to pull away.
                         
           LILY shushes her.
                         
           Nina calms back down, seeing that it's her. She takes a
           breath and succumbs.
                         
           Bumps shoot up all over her skin as her breath quickens.
                         
           She closes her eyes, allows the sensation to invade her body
           and CLIMAXES.
                         
           She breathes her way back to earth. Slowly her eyes open.
           She rolls over towards Lily. But Lily is gone.
                         
           Instead her DOUBLE hovers over her.
                         
                          DOUBLE
           Sweet girl.
                         
           She SMASHES a pillow over Nina's face.

           Nina lies alone in bed, the sheets and comforter in disarray.
                         
           She sits up, clutches her head in pain.
                         
           She looks around, but there's no sign of Lily or the Double.
                         
           Then her eyes drift to the alarm clock: 11:36.
           72.
                         
           She snaps out of bed.

           Dishevelled, Nina races towards the front door. She sees
           Erica brooding at the kitchen table, watching her.
                         
                          NINA
           Why didn't you wake me up?
                         
           Erica just stares at her, devastated.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I'm moving out.
                         
           Nina whips out the front door and leaves her.
                         
                         
          75 INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY 75
                         
           Nina races. She hears muffled Black Swan music playing,
           rehearsal clearly in progress.
                         
                          NINA
                          (TO HERSELF)
           My music.
                         
           She runs into the wings and sees the full company rehearsing
           on stage for the first time...
                         
           Another girl dancing her part.
                         
           The girl spins and Nina sees her face. It's Lily!
                         
           Horrified, Nina runs onto

           and makes a beeline for Leroy, looking beyond apologetic.
                         
           The dancers and piano player stop at the interruption.
                         
                          LEROY
           Keep going. Let's finish the Act.
                         
           The piano music resumes, and the dancers pick up where they
           left off.
           73.
                         
          Nina meets Lily's eyes. She makes a sorry face, but then
          continues dancing.
                         
          Nina is forced to watch from the sidelines as Lily and David
          finish the Black Swan's Pas de Deux.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           That was good. Let's take 10, then
           we'll move on to Act 4.
                         
          He turns to Nina and his smile fades.

           Thomas, I'm sor-
                         
          He ignores her, and walks off stage.
                         
          Lily tentatively approaches with the PRACTICE TUTU.
                         
                          LILY
           Hey...
                         
          Nina snatches it, avoiding eye contact. She puts it on.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           He wanted to go through the
           spacing. Asked me to step in.
                         
          Nina starts stretching.
                         
                          NINA
                          (LOADED)
           I overslept.
                         
                          LILY
           Oops... Least you had a good time,
           right?
                         
          Nina doesn't answer.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Hello?
                         
                          NINA
           You put something in my drink.
           74-76.
                         
                          LILY
                          (OBVIOUSLY)
           Yeah...
                         
                          NINA
           And took off this morning.
                         
                          LILY
           This morning?
                         
                          NINA
           Yeah, you slept over.
                         
                          LILY
           Uh, no. Unless your name's Tom and
           you have a dick.
                         
                          NINA
           But we...
                         
          Nina stops herself.
                         
                          LILY
           We what, Nina?
                         
          Lily can read something on her face.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           What, you have some kind of lezzy
           wet dream?
                         
          Nina glances at the dancers, nervous they've heard.
                         
                          NINA
           You're lying.
                         
                          LILY
                          (TICKLED)
           Oh my god, you totally fantasized
           about me.
                         
                          NINA
           Stop.
                         
                          LILY
           Was I good?
                         
                          NINA
                          (BARKS)
           Shut up!
                         
          Other dancers look over.
                         
          Nina resumes stretching. Lily just walks away.
           74-76A.
                         
          A77 INT. STAGE - DAY A77
                         
           Nina dances the end of the ballet, the White Swan's suicide.
                         
                          LEROY
           The Black Swan has stolen your
           love. There's only one way to end
           the pain.
                         
           Nina climbs the stairs of the set and arrives at the "cliff,"
           stopping at the precipice.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           You're not at all fearful. Filled
           with acceptance.
                         
           Nina looks down. It's a short drop to a stack of pads, but a
           HARD FLOOR surrounds it.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           You look at the Prince, then down
           at Rothbart, and, yes, up at the
           audience...And jump!
                         
           She hesitates, fearful.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Go ahead. You'll be fine.
                         
           Nina takes a breath and leaps in a swan dive.
                         
           She falls...and lands in the pads, unhurt. Slight applause
           from the other dancers.
                         
           LEROY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Everybody get a drink then it's
           notes.
                         
           Nina lies in the pads, completely exhausted.
                         
                         
          B77 INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER B77
                         
           Nina sits backstage, toweling herself off.
                         
           She pauses, noticing Leroy and Lily conversing near the
           doorway.
                         
           Lily nods and touches his arm. He smiles warmly, then notices
           Nina watching. His serious demeanor returns and he pulls
           away. He says goodbye to Lily.
                         
           Lily follows his gaze and smirks at Nina, rubbing it in,
           before exiting herself.
           74-76B.

          A81 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT A81
                         
           Nina kneels in front of the toilet, a finger down her throat.
           She gags, but nothing comes up.
                         
           Her eyes tear up, and she tries again, but still just heaves.
                         
           Frustrated, she wipes her mouth and flushes.
                         
                         
          81 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 81
                         
           Nina exits the bathroom and approaches her mother's bedroom
           door. It's closed, but the light's on underneath.
                         
           She's about to knock, but hesitates. Through the door, she
           can hear the sound of her mother watching an INFOMERCIAL on
           TV. An unfamiliar, lonely noise.
                         
           Nina stands there for a moment, just breathing. She
           strengthens her resolve and backs away from the door.
                         
                         
          82 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 82
                         
           Nina collapses on her bed.
                         
           She opens the JEWELRY BOX sitting on her night stand.
                         
           She watches the ballerina spin for a moment...
                         
           Then suddenly SLAMS the lid shut and throws the box hard
           against the wall.
                         
           She shoots out of bed and starts gathering all her childish
           possessions--stuffed animals, dolls, keepsakes, etc.
                         
                         
          83 INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT 83
                         
           Nina shoves her belongings into the TRASH CHUTE, a pile of
           her next victims strewn at her feet.
                         
           She grabs a TEDDY BEAR IN A TUTU, and jams him in.
           77-78A.
                         
          A84 INT. STAGE - DAY A84
                         
           Nina dances the Black Swan in front of the nearly completed
           scenery.
                         
           A few TECHNICIANS complete last minute touch-ups.
                         
           Leroy watches from his down-stage post, his focus split
           between her and...
                         
           Lily, stretching with the other ballerinas. She stares at
           Nina with a dark expression.
                         
           Fueled by the competition, Nina pushes herself. Her dancing
           becomes more impassioned and aggressive.
                         
           She finishes the section, breathing deeply, covered in sweat.
           The company enthusiastically claps.
                         
           She stares intently at Leroy, awaiting his response.
                         
                          LEROY
           At last, I saw the Black Swan.
                         
                         
          B84 INT. COSTUME SHOP - DAY B84
                         
           Nina wears the BLACK SWAN COSTUME, facing a mirror. Another
           mirror behind her creates an infinite array of reflections.
                         
           The overworked COSTUMER checks each seam, pulling the costume
           taut, analyzing what needs to be taken in and let out.
                         
           Nina looks uncomfortable, disliking the scrutiny of her body.
                         
           She hears a sharp RUSTLE. Like someone's scratching.
                         
           She looks up at the mirror. Her reflection stares back.
                         
           Behind the first reflection, another Nina has her arm behind
           her back, like she's scratching her shoulder.
                         
           Nina leans to get a better look...
                         
                          COSTUMER
           Sit still, I'm almost done.
                         
           Nina startles. The reflection has returned to normal, its
           hand back at its side.
                         
           Costumer checks one more thing, makes one more note.
                         
                          COSTUMER (CONT'D)
           Okay, all set.
           77-78B.
                         
           The costumer leaves her to change.
                         
           Relieved, Nina quickly takes off the costume and starts to
           dress in her sweats.
                         
           She hears someone enter the costume shop.
                         
           LILY (O.S.)
           Hey...Thomas sent me.
                         
           Nina pauses, recognizing her voice.
                         
           COSTUMER (O.S.)
           Yeah, need to get you measured for
           your Swan Queen costumes.
                         
           Nina steps out from behind the privacy curtain, and finds
           Lily waiting.
                         
                          NINA
                          (TO COSTUMER)
           What's she doing here?
                         
                          LILY
           He made me your alternate.
           (can't help it)
           Just in case...
                         
           Nina pushes past her.
                         
                         
          C84 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY C84
                         
           Nina chases after Leroy, in mid-conversation with the STAGE
           MANAGER and two STAGEHANDS.
                         
                          NINA
           Thomas!
                         
           He stops and faces her.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           She's trying to replace me.

           They continue walking.

           There's always an alternate, you
           know that. Lily's the best choice.
                         
                          NINA
           She wants my role.

           No, she's different. She's after
           me. She's trying to replace me.

           Please believe me.
                         
           He studies her for a moment, not sure what to make of this.
                         
                          LEROY
           Listen, I know it's been a
           struggle. But you had a
           breakthrough this morning.
                         
           Nina starts to speak, he holds up his hand to silence her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Tomorrow is yours. Give a great
           performance, and you won't have to
           worry about Lily, or anyone else.

                          LEROY
           No more. Go home and rest.
                         
           Shut down, she watches him walk away.
                         
                         
                         84 OMITTED 84
           79.
                         
                         
                         
                         
          85A INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - NIGHT 85A
                         
           Nina practices the Black Swan, alone with the jaded piano
           player, working herself hard.
                         
           He suddenly stops playing.
                         
                          NINA
           What happened?
                         
                          PIANO PLAYER
           I gotta life, deary.
                         
           He closes the music book and stands.
                         
           PIANO PLAYER (CONT'D)
           Don't work too hard. It's your big
           day tomorrow.
                         
           Annoyed, she watches him leave.
                         
          85B She faces herself in the mirror and takes a breath. 85B
                         
           She resumes dancing without music, her feet CLICKING on the
           floor.
                         
           As she moves, she notices something strange out of the corner
           of her eye:
                         
           The reflection's dancing lags a little behind hers.
                         
           Nina stops. The sound of her footsteps stops a second later.
           She stares at the mirror...troubled.
                         
           The door to the room BANGS shut.
                         
           She whips towards it and she's suddenly plunged into
           DARKNESS.
                         
           Freaked, she stumbles towards the door, and pushes out into
                          THE
           80.
                         
          86A INT. STAGE - NIGHT 86A
                         
           Where it's equally dark. Lit only by the stage's "ghost
           light," a single bulb on a stand.
                         
                          NINA
           Hey! Hey! I'm still in here.
                         
           No one answers.
                         
           She looks at the cavernous auditorium. All those empty
           seats, faced towards her. Very overwhelming...
                         
           She hears a noise in the wings.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Hey! Turn the lights back on!
                         
           She gets to the other side of the stage, but the wings seem
           empty. Quiet.
                         
          86B Then she hears the faint sound of MUFFLED BANGING. 86B
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Hello?
                         
           No one answers.
                         
           She heads towards the noise. The banging now accompanied by a
           GIGGLE.
                         
                         
          87 INT. WINGS - SAME 87
                         
           It's pretty dark but the sound is unmistakable: two people
           going at it.
                         
           Nina tiptoes past some off-stage SETS and LIGHTING EQUIPMENT.
                         
           And peeks around a piece of SCENERY...
                         
           Catching a glimpse of Leroy fucking Lily further backstage.
           She's wild, clearly enjoying it.
                         
           Nina looks away, disgusted. She peeks back one more time.
                         
           Leroy has become the demon Rothbart, ravishing the Double.
           She meets Nina's eyes and smiles.
                         
           Nina jumps back, knocking into a piece of the set. The
           lovemaking pauses at the sound.
                         
           Nina flees.
           81.
                         
          A88 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT A88
                         
           Nina runs in and quickly jams her belongings into her bag.
                         
           She notices her reflection in the mirror and removes her
           diamond earrings.
                         
           Then gathers the other trinkets sitting on the counter and
           puts them all inside her bag.
                         
                         
          B88 EXT. THEATER - NIGHT B88
                         
           Nina pushes out the stage door, and passes the ROW OF
           POSTERS.
                         
           They now advertise Swan Lake and feature a beautiful
           photograph of Nina.
                         
           Nina stops and looks at them.
                         
                         
          88 INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 88
                         
           Nina slowly enters Beth's room, but remains at the threshold.
                         
           Beth sits in a wheelchair faced towards the window. Sleeping.
                         
           Nina gets up the nerve and quietly walks further in, trying
           not to wake her.
                         
           Nina pulls out the tube of lipstick from her bag and gently
           places it on the hospital table.
                         
           She pulls out the diamond earrings, sets them down.
                         
           Followed by the makeup compact, the pack of cigarettes, a
           needle and thread, and an emory board.
                         
           A hand suddenly GRABS Nina's arm.
                         
           Awake, Beth stares Nina down.
                         
                          BETH
           What are you doing here?
                         
           Stunned, Nina's unable to answer.
                         
           Beth follows her gaze to the random items on her table.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm so sorry.
                         
           Beth begins touching the objects, vaguely remembering.
           82.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I didn't mean to make you feel this
           way. It's happening to me now.
           She's trying to replace me.
                         
          Beth sees the earrings and it all clicks in.
                         
                          BETH
           You stole all these things?
                         
                          NINA
           I just wanted to be like you.
           Perfect.
                         
          Beth shoots Nina a dark look and turns away.
                         
                          BETH
           I'm not perfect. I'm nothing.
                         
                          NINA
           It's not true.
                         
                          BETH
           Fucking nothing!
                         
          Beth grabs the emory board and stabs herself in the face.
                         
                          BETH (CONT'D)
           Nothing! Nothing!!!
                         
                          NINA
           Beth?!
                         
          Nina spins Beth around. She is now a bloody version of THE
          DOUBLE! She continues stabbing herself.
                         
          Nina grabs the Double's hand and struggles to restrain her.
                         
                          DOUBLE
           NOTHING!
                         
                          NINA
           Stop it! Stop!
                         
          The emory board stabs into Nina's arm.
                         
          Nina rushes from the room.
           83.
                         
          89 INT. HALLWAY - SAME 89
                         
           She BANGS into a empty stretcher sitting in the hallway,
           causing a CLAMOR.
                         
           The older nurse looks up.
                         
           Nina jumps into an open elevator.
                         
                         
          90 INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR - SAME 90
                         
           She hits the GROUND FLOOR BUTTON, and hides in the corner.
                         
           As the doors close, she looks down and sees that, in one
           hand, she holds the BLOODY EMORY BOARD.
                         
           She drops it, disgusted.
                         
                         
          91 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 91
                         
           Nina runs in and quickly shuts the door behind her. Takes a
           breath, and notices some blood still on her hands.
                         
                         
          A92 INT. KITCHEN - SAME A92
                         
           She flips on the light. The room's empty.
                         
           She goes to the sink and washes her hands.
                         
           She finishes, and flips the light off as she walks out of the
           room.
                         
           She pauses, rushes back and flips on the light. The Double
           stares at her from the corner, her face covered in blood.
           Terrified, Nina runs.
                         
                         
          B92 INT. BATHROOM - SAME B92
                         
           She goes straight to the toilet and VOMITS.
                         
           She hears a creaking sound in the apartment and looks towards
           the open door.
                         
                          NINA
           Mommy?!
                         
           She goes out to investigate.
           83A.
                         
          92 INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - SAME 92
                         
           Nina flings open the door, but Erica's not in there.
                         
           She hears RUSTLING, then WHISPERING.
                         
           Nina looks around the room. The paintings of herself seem to
           move slightly. Blink. Mouths move.
                         
           They whisper: "Sweet girl" and then start chanting "My turn,
           my turn, my turn!"
                         
           Nina cups her hands over her ears, trying to block it out.
                         
           She hears a BANG and looks towards the door. No one's there.
                         
           She glimpses the mirror, which reflects down the hallway. She
           sees her Double rushing towards the room.
                         
           Scared, Nina whips around, just as her mother arrives in the
           doorway.
           84.
                         
                          ERICA
           What are you doing?
                         
           Nina pushes past her, in a frenzy.
                         
                         
          93 INT. BEDROOM - SAME 93
                         
           Nina closes the door. Sticks in the broken piece of wood.
                         
           A pain shoots through her shoulder. She SCREAMS,
           instinctively reaching for it.
                         
           She quickly yanks off the sweater and looks at the vanity
           mirror.
                         
           Her back pulsates unnaturally. Tiny black tips poke through.
                         
           The door opens and catches on the doorjamb.
                         
           Erica starts POUNDING.
                         
                          NINA
           GO AWAY!
                         
           She digs into the open bump on her shoulder with her
           fingernails.
                         
                          ERICA
           Open the door!!!
                         
           Erica violently pushes and pulls, jostling the piece of wood.
                         
           Nina concentrates, takes hold of the growth and yanks.
                         
           Blood vessels in her eyes explode, making the white turn red.
                         
           Nina looks at the object held in her fingers: a sharp, TINY
           BLACK SPINE. Like that of a sea urchin. Damp, feathery wisps
           hang off of it.
                         
           The door flings open.
                         
           Erica rushes in and finds Nina half-naked, her skin inflamed.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Oh my god...
                         
           Nina starts forcing her out the door. Erica pushes back.
           85.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Stop, you're sick!
                         
                          NINA
           Get OUT!
                         
           She manages to get her all the way out the door.
                         
           But ROTHBART'S HAND grabs the door frame.
                         
           Nina SLAMS the door, SMASHING the hand.
                         
           Erica SCREAMS in pain.
                         
           Nina slams the door again, and again. The hand now human.
                         
           She finally gets the door all the way shut.
                         
           She steps away from it, nervous...
                         
           She looks down, sees one of her knees SNAP backwards, like
           that of a bird. Then the other knee SNAPS back.
                         
           Nina stumbles and falls.
                         
           And SLAMS her head into the radiator.
                         
           SMASH TO BLACK.
                         
           TINNY MUSIC plays in the darkness.
                         
                          FADE IN:
                         
                         
          94 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - EVENING 94
                         
           Nina flutters open her eyes. The world comes into focus and
           she sees her mother hovering over her, stroking her hair.
                         
                          ERICA
           Sshh, shhh, it's okay. I'm here.
                         
           Nina looks around, disoriented. Sees her hands jammed inside
           thick socks, held on by rubber bands. Groggy, she tries to
           pull them off.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           You were scratching all night.
                         
           Erica helps remove the socks, her smashed hand wrapped in
           bandages.
                         
           Nina weakly tries to sit up, but Erica pushes her back down.
           86.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Rest. Shhh, rest.
                         
          Nina gives in, too tired to fight her. Her eyes drift to the
          source of the tinny music: the open jewelry box. The
          ballerina's been broken off, all that remains is a single
          amputated leg, spinning morbidly on the base.
                         
           ERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           That's good. Rest.
                         
          Nina's eyes drift to the alarm clock. It's gone.
                         
                          NINA
           Where's the clock?
                         
                          ERICA
           Don't worry.
                         
          Nina looks at the dark window.
                         
                          NINA
           It's dark. What night is it?
                         
          Nina reads Erica's face. Reality clicks in.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
                          (PANICKING)
           What time is it?!
                         
          Nina tries to sit up, but her mother pushes her back down.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I have to go.
                         
                          ERICA
           Don't worry. I called the theater
           and told them you weren't feeling
           well.
                         
          Nina freaks, struggles more violently.
                         
                          NINA
           No, I want to.
                         
                          ERICA
           Lie down!
                         
                          NINA
           Get off me!
                         
          Nina squirms free of Erica's grasp and gets out of bed. She
          gets to the door...
           87.
                         
          But the doorknob's been knocked-off, leaving just a metal
          post sticking out of the hole.
                         
                          ERICA
           We're staying in here until you
           feel better.
                         
          Nina grips the metal post and pulls and pulls, shaking the
          door.
                         
                          NINA
           Where is it?
                         
          Erica calmly sits down in her CHAIR, waiting for the storm to
          pass.
                         
                          ERICA
           This role is destroying you.
                         
          Nina rifles through her dresser drawers.
                         
          She notices her mother sitting calmly.
                         
                          NINA
           Move.
                         
                          ERICA
           Nina...
                         
          Nina grabs her by the wrist.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Stop it.
                         
                          NINA
           You're crazy!
                         
                          ERICA
           What happened to my sweet girl?
                         
          Nina yanks Erica off the chair onto the floor.
                         
                          NINA
           She's gone.
                         
                          ERICA
           Please, you're not well.
                         
          Under the cushion Nina grabs the hidden brass DOORKNOB.
                         
          Erica lunges for her daughter's legs.
                         
                          NINA
           Let go!
           87A.
                         
                          ERICA
           You can't handle it!
                         
                          NINA
           I can't?! I'm the fucking swan
           queen! You never even got out of
           the corps.
                         
                          ERICA
           You fucking ungrateful-
                         
          Nina jams the knob onto the post, opens the door.
                         
           ERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Don't leave! Nina!
           88.
                         
          95 EXT. THEATER - EVENING 95
                         
           Nina approaches the theater with harried steps.
                         
           Quickly past the row of SWAN LAKE posters.
                         
           She reaches the side of the building, flings open the stage
           door and enters.
                         
                         
          96 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - EVENING 96
                         
           Nina frantically makes her way down the bustling hallway,
           chaotic with dancers. Excitement in the air.
                         
           She nears the soloists' dressing room.
                         
           Just outside of it, she spots a group of DANCERS excitedly
           chatting around a smiling Lily.
                         
           Nina stops in her tracks.
                         
           Lily glances in her direction, and her smile quickly fades
           into a sneer.
                         
                          LILY
           What are you doing here?
                         
           The other girls follow her gaze towards Nina, and their
           smiles turn to confusion.
                         
           LEROY (O.S.)
           Nina?
                         
           She turns and finds that Leroy has approached from behind
           her.
                         
                          LILY
           You're supposed to be sick.
                         
                          LEROY
           Lily, give us a minute.
                         
           Leroy pulls Nina towards her room. Lily glares at Nina as she
           passes.
                         
                         
          97 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 97
                         
           Leroy closes the door behind them. He looks at Nina, wheels
           spinning.
           89.
                         
                          LEROY
           Are you okay?
                         
                          NINA
           I'm fine.
                         
          Nina goes to her wardrobe, finds her two costumes hanging.
          One for the White Swan, one for the Black Swan.
                         
                          LEROY
           Nina?
                         
          She doesn't heed him, pulls out the White Swan leotard and
          sets it on her chair.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Nina!
                         
                          NINA
           What?
                         
                          LEROY
           I already asked Lily-
                         
                          NINA
           Fuck. Have you announced it?
                         
          He hasn't.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           After Beth, do you need more
           controversy?
                         
          Leroy smirks at her directness.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I'm here, Thomas. I'm doing it.
                         
          He looks at her, considering, and gives her a reluctant nod.
          She smiles.
           90.
                         
                          LEROY
           The only person standing in your
           way is you. It's time to let her
           go. Lose yourself.
                         
           She nods. He takes one last look at her and leaves. She
           breathes a sigh of relief.
                         
           Curious, she cracks open the door and peeks outside:
                         
                         
          98 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY (NINA'S POV) 98
                         
           Leroy has pulled Lily down the corridor to break the news.
           Lily takes off, furious.
                         
                         
                         99 OMITTED 99
           91.
                         
          100 INT. PRINCIPLE'S DRESSING ROOM - LATER 100
                         
           Through the PA, music from ACT 1 plays.
                         
           Nina sits at her vanity in a robe, wearing the full White
           Swan makeup and FEATHER CROWN. Pale, with red lipstick and
           dark eyeliner, she looks like a porcelain doll.
                         
           She drops the robe off her shoulder and covers her rash with
           white makeup.
                         
           The STAGE MANAGER'S voice comes through the PA speaker:
                         
           STAGE MANAGER (V.O.)
           Act 2's starting. Ten minutes.
                         
           She removes a slipper off one foot. Her big and second toe,
           and her pinky and fourth toe are stuck together. Puzzled, she
           peels them apart.
                         
           She removes her other slipper and finds the same toes
           completely FUSED, forming two large toes with double toenails
           on either side of the middle toe.
                         
           She touches the bird-like foot, concerned, but slips on her
           tights and hides the feet.
                         
                         
          101 INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 101
                         
           Nina stretches nervously in the wings, awaiting her entrance.
                         
           She peeks out through a small hole in the wall, sees the
           AUDIENCE sitting expectantly in their seats.
                         
           The music begins and they shift and mummer in anticipation.
                         
           Nina pulls away, taking deep breaths and clenching her hands,
           trying to stay calm.
                         
           On stage, David enters, beginning the Act. He traverses the
           stage, "hunting" with a crossbow.
                         
                          STAGE MANAGER
                          (TO NINA)
           Go.
                         
           Nina takes a last breath and runs on.
                         
                         
                         102 STAGE 102
                         
           Under the spotlight, she begins dancing her intro.
           92.
                         
           David runs towards her and she startles away from him,
           afraid.
                         
           He grabs her and they begin their first Pas de Deux.
                         
                         
          103 INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER 103
                         
           Nina comes offstage, catching her breath. All around her,
           CORPS MEMBERS dressed as little swans rush back on stage,
           where FOUR LITTLE SWANS begin the Pas de Quatre.
                         
           Nina looks into the opposite wing and sees Leroy watching
           her. He gives her a small, contented nod, then disappears
           behind a swarm of dancers.
                         
           On stage, the Four Little Swans perform. In their identical
           makeup and costumes, they look disturbingly alike.
                         
           During the applause, Nina catches a glimpse of David
           backstage, sweaty, laughing and holding someone's hands. Nina
           can't see who, her view obscured by moving bodies and limbs.
                         
           Suspicious, Nina moves to get a better look.
                         
           Revealing that David's flirting with Lily.
                         
           Nina tenses.
                         
           Then the Four Little Swans rush offstage past Nina. She
           watches them go, unsettled.
                         
                          STAGE MANAGER
           What are you doing? You're on!
                         
           He gently nudges her, and she has to run back on.
                         
                         
                         104 STAGE 104
                         
           Nina rushes from the wings, directly into David's arms.
                         
           All the swans are frozen in two rows on each side of the
           stage, looking downstage.
                         
           David launches Nina into the air, hands around her waist.
           93.
                         
           He slowly turns her around, keeping her held high.
                         
           From her swirling, bird's eye view, Nina sees the rows of
           identically dressed Little Swans glaring at her...
                         
           Nina freaks, jerking her body.
                         
           David's grip SLIPS and Nina SLAMS onto the stage.
                         
           It's a horrific moment that feels like an eternity.
                         
           Gritting her teeth, Nina looks up around her, sees the faces
           of the other ballerinas. Staring at her sadistically.
                         
           Nina finds Lily, glancing at David. He snaps to and quickly
           helps Nina up.
                         
                          DAVID
           What the fuck?
                         
           She's too freaked to respond.
                         
           They resume dancing, Nina barely keeping it together.
                         
           Behind them, Rothbart appears and commands his flock to exit.
           The Little Swans start swirling off stage.
                         
           Leaving Nina and David alone.
                         
           David tries to pull her in one direction, but the dark hand
           of Rothbart summons her, transforming her back into a swan.
                         
           She pulls away from David, frantically flapping, until she
           disappears into the wings.
                         
                         
          105 INT. BACKSTAGE - SAME 105
                         
           As soon as she's off, she breaks down, hyperventilating. The
           dancer playing ROTHBART eyes her with concern.
                         
                          ROTHBART
           You alright?
                         
           She looks up, sees his creepy MASK, and backs away.
                         
           Rothbart has to go back on stage to finish the Act.
                         
           Other CORPS MEMBERS surround her, chirping "You okay?, "What
           happened?" etc.
                         
           Dazed, Nina doesn't answer. The music ends and there's a weak
           smattering of applause.
           94.
                         
                          STAGE MANAGER
           That's intermission! Act 3 in
           fifteen.
                         
           The other dancers scurry to get ready, abandoning her.
                         
           Nina sees Leroy on stage chewing David out, behind the closed
           curtain.
                         
           David spots Nina, glares at her, and sulks away.
                         
           Leroy runs his fingers through his hair, his back to Nina.
                         
           Nina cautiously approaches.
                         
                          NINA
           It wasn't my fault. He dropped me.
                         
           He can't even look at her.
                         
                          LEROY
                          (RAGING)
           What a fucking disaster!
                         
           He walks away.
                         
           All alone, Nina sees everyone backstage looking at her.
                         
           She runs, escaping their stares.

          107 INT. PRINCIPLE'S DRESSING ROOM - SAME 107
                         
           She closes the door behind her, ready to cry.
                         
           She looks up, and finds Lily putting on makeup and wearing
           the Black Swan costume.
                         
                          LILY
           Rough start, huh? Pretty
           humiliating...
           95.
                         
                          NINA
           Get out of here.
                         
                          LILY
           Wow...rude.
                         
          Lily coyly smiles, and continues applying makeup.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           I'm worried about the next act. Not
           sure you're feeling up to it.
                         
                          NINA
           Stop. Just stop.
                         
                          LILY
           How about...I dance the Black Swan
           for you?
                         
          Nina looks into the mirror. Instead of Lily's reflection
          there's the Double.
                         
                          NINA
           Leave me alone. Leave me alone.
                         
                          DOUBLE
                          (IN MIRROR)
           But it's my turn.
                         
          Nina's fury rises up from inside.
                         
                          NINA
           Leave me alone!!!
                         
          She charges...
                         
          And smashes her into the WALL LENGTH MIRROR, shattering it.
          Shards fall everywhere.
                         
          The Double flips Nina over and wails on her. Punch after
          punch.
                         
          Nina does her best to block the onslaught.
                         
          They scuffle, knocking things over, bumping into walls.
                         
          The Double gets her hands around Nina's neck...
                         
          Gasping for air, Nina tries to pull the hands free, but she's
          too strong.
           96.
                         
           Her hands frantically scramble along the surface of the
           floor. The fingers barely touch the edge of a MIRROR SHARD,
           but can't grasp it.
                         
           The Double squeezes down.
                         
           The blood vessels in Nina's eyes BURST again. Her neck starts
           to stretch unnaturally. Strength surges through her body and
           she lunges...
                         
           Finally grabbing the SHARD.
                         
           And DRIVES it into the Double's stomach.
                         
           Nina glances at her hand, cut by the mirror, then back up.
                         
           The Double is now LILY. Stunned, Lily looks down and touches
           the stab wound.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           It's my turn.
                         
           Lily coughs up blood and collapses, dead.
                         
           Nina stares at her, breathing heavily, high on adrenaline.
                         
           A KNOCK on the door.
                         
           STAGE MANAGER (O.S.)
           Black Swan, places in 5.
                         
           Nina drags the stiffening body into the wardrobe closet.
                         
                         
          108 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 108
                         
           Nina zips up the back to the Black Swan costume.
                         
           She deliberately applies the Black Swan makeup. Dark eye
           shadow and rouge, maroon lipstick.
                         
           Dressed in black and wearing the dark make-up of the Black
           Swan, she looks fierce.
                         
           She stares at her reflection, her eyes burning RED. New
           rash bumps pop up on her arms, the intensity building within.
           97.

           Nina bursts onto stage as the Black Swan, accompanied by
           Rothbart.
                         
           She looks powerful, intense as she moves towards David.
                         
           His face shows his surprise.
                         
           Nina dances the first Pas de Deux with him. They finish and
                          EXIT

                          WOW-
                         
           She walks away from him.
                         
           Alone, she looks at her arms, sees black points trying to
           push through again.
                         
           Some fully emerge as shiny BLACK FEATHERS.
                         
           She just watches them, not panicking, but accepting the
           transformation taking place. Even beckoning it.
                         
           Her second entrance cue is played.
                         
                          STAGE MANAGER
           That's you!
                         
           She leaps back on
                         
                         
          111C STAGE 111C
                         
           For the Coda. She takes a brief pause, closing her eyes once
           more, and then completely lets herself go.
                         
           She spins with ferocity. More BLACK FEATHERS burst out from
           her shoulders and back.
                         
           At last, she truly embodies the Black Swan.
           98.
                         
           She finishes the Coda, punctuating her last spin with a sharp
           step that echoes through the theater.
                         
           The audience looks on, mesmerized. Too stunned to clap at
           first.
                         
          111D Nina looks down at the stage, her face glazed with sweat 111D
                         
           She has returned to normal. No feathers. Normal eyes. A
           woman.
                         
           She finally looks up at the audience, and they ERUPT in a
           standing ovation.
                         
           Nina walks to the front of the stage, takes her bow.
                         
           Nina looks up at the MASS OF BODIES filling the auditorium,
           vibrating with applause.
                         
           Proud, Nina smiles and bows again. Again and again.
                         
           She finally runs off stage, the applause still going strong.
                         
                         
          112 INT. BACKSTAGE - SAME 112
                         
           Nina enters the wings, other dancers cheer loudly. Even
           Veronica and Galina.
                         
           She pushes past all the smiling faces. It feels very
           surreal.
                         
           She sees Leroy clapping and shaking his head. Blown away.
                         
                          LEROY
           Get back out there! Get back-
                         
           She stops his mouth with a kiss. The kind of kiss that you
           can't stop. Not desperate, but adamant.
                         
           Finally she disengages, staring at him in the eyes, but
           before he can say anything...
                         
           She turns and rushes back on stage. He's stunned. Like he's
           been run over by a truck.
                         
                         
          113 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - LATER 113
                         
           She walks towards her dressing room, a satisfied smile on her
           face.
                         
           She passes the stage manager.
           99.
                         
                          STAGE MANAGER
           Great job. You got fifteen til the
           last act.
                         
           She nods and arrives at her room.
                         
           She opens the door, makes sure no ones looking, and enters
           quickly.
                         
                         
          114 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 114
                         
           She closes the door behind her, locks it. Turns and sees the
           broken glass all over the floor.
                         
           She eyes the closed wardrobe. A pool of blood drips out from
           under the door.
                         
           She picks up a towel and lays it over the blood.
                         
           She starts to undress.
                         
                         
          115 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 115
                         
           Back in the White Swan costume, she re-applies the makeup.
                         
           There's a KNOCK on the door. She looks towards it, her face
           only halfway made-up.
                         
                          NINA
           One second.
                         
           She goes to the door, opens it just a crack.
                         
           She peeks through and finds...
                         
           LILY looking back at her.
                         
                          LILY
           Hey...you were amazing.
                         
           Nina's petrified.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Seriously. I'm sorry things got so
           messed up between us. Just, holy
           shit, totally blown away...
           100.
                         
          Nina barely manages a nod.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Anyway, wanted to tell you. I'll
           let you finish. Merde.
                         
          Lily turns and walks away.
                         
          Nina swiftly shuts the door.
                         
          She turns around, stares at the wardrobe.
                         
          She steps cautiously towards it, her face repeated
          countlessly in all the reflective shards.
                         
          She lifts the towel from the ground and looks at it.
                         
          It is clean. No blood. She looks down at the floor. No blood
          there either.
                         
          She slowly opens the door to the wardrobe...
                         
          And finds it empty. No body whatsoever.
                         
          She looks over at the broken mirror. Sees her reflection
          staring back at her.
                         
          She stares at it for a long beat, and realizes something.
                         
          She touches her stomach and winces a little. Pulls back her
          hand. It's coated with red liquid. Blood.
                         
          It's started to soak through the costume, creating a faint
          red spot. The fabric is ripped at the center of the stain.
                         
          She feels inside for confirmation.
                         
          And discovers a stab wound, in her own stomach.
                         
          She pulls out the sharp tip of mirror still stuck inside.
          Blood begins flowing more rapidly.
                         
          She drops the mirror.
                         
           STAGE MANAGER (V.O.)
           (On the PA)
           White Swan in 5.
                         
          In a daze, she sits down at the vanity, and finishes applying
          the rest of the White Swan's makeup.
           101.
                         
          116A INT. STAGE - LATER 116A
                         
           Nina dances the final Pas de Deux as the White Swan. Losing
           blood by the second, everything is woozy and blurry.
                         
           She can't do all the steps, but her performance is pained,
           making it poignant.
                         
           A spot of red begins to soak through at the center of her
           costume.
                         
           The music turns ominous, and VON ROTHBART, the evil sorcerer,
           comes onto stage.
                         
           Nina dances away from him, back upstage, towards the cliff.
           It's time for her final leap.
                         
           Her energy fading, she teeters up the stairs of the set. One
           step at a time...
                         
           She gets to the top, takes one last look around, at all the
           eyes watching her.
                         
           She notices a familiar face in the audience: HER MOTHER. She
           watches with a profound sadness, tears streaking her cheeks.
                         
           In the front of Nina's costume, a dark circle has started to
           form. Her blood fully seeping through.
                         
           And Nina leaps...
                         
          116B INTO BLACKNESS 116B
                         
           She falls through an endless void, her eyes closed.
                         
           She slowly twists around in the air, so that she's falling
           backwards.
                         
           She hears something. Soft and muffled.
                         
           The faint sound of applause.
                         
          116C She lands slowly and comfortably on PADDING. 116C
                         
           The sound of applause is now loud, uproarious.
                         
           A group of BALLERINAS surround the mattress, clapping for
           her, each one dressed as a WHITE SWAN.
                         
           Leroy pushes through the group to get to her.
                         
                          LEROY
           Listen to them! They love you! Get
           up, get up!
                          (MORE)
           102.
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           I always knew you had it in you,
           little princess. Go take your bow!
                         
          Nina is too weak to move.
                         
          Lily pushes her way into the group and GASPS, pointing at
          Nina's abdomen.
                         
          Leroy follows her gaze and discovers the spot of blood, which
          has grown in size.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           What did you do?
                         
                          NINA
           I felt it.
                         
                          LEROY
           Oh my god.
                         
                          NINA
           ...perfect.
                         
                          LEROY
           Someone, get help.
                         
                          NINA
           Shhh...
                         
          Leroy looks back at her. She smiles.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           It was perfect.
                         
          He understands.
                         
          The APPLAUSE grows more and more faint. Her eyes glaze over
          and everything goes completely SILENT.
                         
          Nina lies there motionless, a smile frozen on her face.
                         
          CUT TO BLACK.

FOLDS OF BLUE VELVET UNDULATE EVER SO SLOWLY.

WITH TITLES

									DISSOLVE TO:

1. EXT. BEAUMONTS' FRONT LAWN - DAY

Blue skies. PAN SLOWLY DOWN to clean white picket fence, with beautiful 
red roses in front of it. Birds CHIRP in the distance. A faint sprinkler 
SOUND is heard. Very sweet MUSIC is playing.

									DISSOLVE TO:

2. EXT. TREE - DAY

A songbird SINGS in the tree.

Yellow tulips sway in a warm afternoon breeze.

									DISSOLVE TO:

6. EXT. BEAUMONTS' FRONT LAWN - DAY

The same white picket fence with roses in front of it. 

PANNING SLOWLY now away from the roses down to the rich green lawn 
and over to the sprinkler which goes around and around shooting water 
droplets sparkling in the light. 

This is slightly SLOW MOTION and DREAMY.

									DISSOLVE TO:

7. EXT. BEAUMONTS' FRONT LAWN - DAY

CLOSER ON WATER DROPLETS. The water droplets are somewhat abstracted 
as they dance in the light.

PAN DOWN now to the green grass, traveling along the grass. 

The MUSIC becomes fainter as we MOVE SUDDENLY under the grass, now as 
if in a dark forest. 

SLOWLY MOVING THROUGH. 

The grass is like great timbers.

It is GETTING DARKER and ominous SOUNDS come up as we discover black 
insects crawling and scratching in the darkness.

FADE TO:

8. EXT. BEAUMONT'S FRONT LAWN - DAY

MR. BEAUMONT is watering flowers and grass with the hose.

He is dressed in khaki trousers, canvas shoes, old white shirt, straw 
hat and dark glasses.

CLOSE - MR. BEAUMONT

watches his watering, then looks up.

The sky and the neighborhood are reflected in his dark glasses.  He 
moves his false teeth around a little in his mouth, jutting out his chin 
in the process.  He's thinking about who knows what.

He looks back down at his lawn.

CLOSEUP - WATER ON GRASS

The water hits the grass and mats it down.

WIDER - MR. BEAUMONT

moves the hose over a bush and gets a kink in it.

Water stops coming out of the nozzle and there is a LOUD HISSING NOISE 
of water under pressure.

CLOSEUP - KINK IN HOSE

Loud HISSING NOISE.

Mr. Beaumont goes around the bush and is undoing the kink when he is 
suddenly hit with a tremendous seizure.

CLOSEUP - MR. BEAUMONT
He's doubling over and falls to the ground.  He continues to grasp onto 
the hose.

Water shoots crazily onto the driveway and his car.

Mr. Beaumont seems to be in tremendous pain. 

									CUT TO:

9. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - DAY

Mrs. Beaumont is curled up on the couch, smoking a cigarette and watching 
T.V.  It's a daytime soap.

CLOSEUP - MRS. BEAUMONT

quantity of blue smoke.  She's enjoying her show.

									CUT TO:

10. EXT. BEAUMONTS' FRONT LAWN - DAY

CLOSEUP - MR. BEAUMONT

His teeth are crooked in his mouth now as he tries to scream.

No sound is coming out.

WATER SOUND is loud.

WIDER - MR. BEAUMONT

Water is still spraying out over the driveway and onto the car and into 
the yard beyond.

A small boy, GREGG, appears wearing only white underpants and a white 
t-shirt.  He holds a large red popsicle.

Gregg waddles around looking at the crazy water show.  He holds his hand 
out to get it wet in the spray.  This makes him screw up his face in a 
laugh.

He waddles over and looks at Mr. Beaumont on the ground.

Mr. Beaumont seems to be worse now, unconscious, but still gripping the 
hose tightly. His clothes are sopping wet.

11. EXT. GREGG'S HOUSE - DAY

Screen window of Gregg's house. Gregg's mother calls out but remains 
looking at a bowl she is holding in her hands.

					GREGG'S MOTHER
					(calling out)
Gregg. Billy's waiting for his teddy.

She then turns to look out.

					GREGG'S MOTHER
					 (continuing)
GREGG! Billy's waiting for his teddy, honey.

									CUT TO:

12. EXT. BEAUMONTS' FRONT LAWN - DAY

GREGG'S MOTHER P.O.V. THROUGH SCREEN WINDOW

IN THE DISTANCE, she sees Gregg's back, a bush, some legs with wet khaki 
trousers and water squirting up in the air.

			TOM!!!

									CUT TO:

13. EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS BUILDING - NIGHT

TRAVELING along sidewalk, bushes, to lighted windows of an auditorium. 
MUSIC is heard.

14. INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

A dance is going on.  Sixties MUSIC plays, performed by a live band on 
stage.  College kids dance.

A COLLEGE BOY enters the auditorium, urgently looking for someone.  He 
quickly approaches a GIRL.

					COLLEGE BOY
			Louise? Where's Jeffrey? His mother's on
			the phone - it's an emergency.

					  LOUISE
			He disappeared to the men's room a little
			while ago. I'm getting very tired of 
			waiting - let's go find him.

15. INT. JANITOR'S QUARTERS - COLLEGE - NIGHT

We MOVE INTO the face of JEFFREY. He is hiding behind a furnace.  He is 
fascinated by a sight beyond in the darkness of this basement room.

He sees a male student trying to rape his girlfriend.  She is crying and 
telling him to stop but the boy keeps forcing her down toward the ground. 
forcing her clothes off her.  Jeffrey at this point hears his name being 
called.  Each time he hears his name the caller is closer.  The boy is now
hurting the girl.  Before Jeffrey leaves the furnace room he yells out:

					 JEFFREY
			Hey, shit head. Leave her alone. Don't 
			force girls!

The couple looks up but cannot see Jeffrey.  The boy is scared and releases
the girl who promptly pulls farther away, crying.

Jeffrey leaves the furnace room.

16. INT. HALLWAY - COLLEGE - NIGHT

Louise and the college student see him and move quickly toward him.


				     COLLEGE BOY
			Jeffrey, your mother's on the phone. It's
			an emergency.

					  LOUISE
			Thanks for keeping me waiting so long.

As Jeffrey moves quickly toward the telephone.

				 	 JEFFREY
I'm sorry, Louise.

17. INT. PHONE/HALLWAY - COLLEGE - NIGHT

The phone dangles on its cord in the foreground as Jeffrey moves toward 
it in the background.  Louise slowly follows Jeffrey, but stays in back 
of him.  Jeffrey picks up the phone.

					 JEFFREY
			Hello. Mom? What's wrong with Dad?. 
			What's happening?. Come home? Sure I will.

18. INT. BEAUMONT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Mrs. Beaumont sits talking on the phone in a dark quiet bedroom.

Jeffrey comes walking out of the airport, where his Mother and AUNT 
BARBARA, who is a very absent-minded little woman with very thick glasses, 
are waiting for him.  

They are parked illegally and another car is honking at them.  Their 
trunk is open in anticipation of Jeffrey's things.  They are waving and 
yelling at Jeffrey to get his attention.  He finally joins them and kisses 
his Mother, then his Aunt.

			He had a cerebral hemorrhage and they think

Jeffrey comes down the stairs.  Everyone says their "good mornings," and 
Jeffrey sits down to breakfast.

					 JEFFREY
			What time are visiting hours?

				    MRS. BEAUMONT
			I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for

					 JEFFREY
			Well. Okay.

				    MRS. BEAUMONT
			Jeffrey, when you see your father.

					 JEFFREY
			Yeah?

				    MRS. BEAUMONT
			He doesn't know you're out of school. He

					 JEFFREY
			What?

				    MRS. BEAUMONT
			It would be too much for him. So please

					 JEFFREY
			Thanks a lot, Mom.

			.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave 
school and go to work in the store. maybe
going back to school will be an option one

She peers into the room.  Jeffrey does too.

34. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

All he can see are curtains surrounding a bed and stacks of medical 
machinery.  Doctor Gynde comes out from behind the curtains and walks to 
Jeffrey.

					DR. GYNDE
			Hello Jeffrey.

					 JEFFREY
			Hello, Doctor Gynde. How is he?

					DR. GYNDE
			He's fighting hard. Jeffrey. it's very
			important that your father doesn't try
			to move. he's been immobilized. It would
			be very painful for him. sit close. you do
			the talking and moving. He knows you're 
			here. He became very emotional. I don't 
			think he likes the idea of you seeing him
			like this.

Nurse Cindy goes to the bed.  She begins to pull the curtains back 
revealing Mr. Beaumont.

				    NURSE CINDY
				(smiling a big smile)
			Mr. Beaumont! Your son is here to visit you.

Then we see Mr. Beaumont.  He has numerous tubes and needles going into 
different parts of him.  A stainless steel device holds his head perfectly
still.  Nurse Cindy picks up a tray and leaves.

					 JEFFREY
			    (shocked but concealing it)
			Hi Dad.

				     MR. BEAUMONT
			 (speaking as plainly as possible,
  but sounds like mumbling)
			Hey Jeff.

Jeffrey goes to him and puts out his hand to shake his father's hand but 
remembers his father cannot move.  Jeffrey pats him on the shoulder.

					 JEFFREY
			Looks like they've got you strapped in
			pretty good.

				     MR. BEAUMONT
			 (lips moving but hardly any sound)
			uh uh.

					 JEFFREY
			Are you feeling okay?

				     MR. BEAUMONT
				    (more mumbling)
			uh uh.

Tears well up in Mr. Beaumont's eyes.  Before Jeffrey can stop him he 
reaches for Jeffrey's hand, then struggling against tremendous pain he 
manages to form words.

				     MR. BEAUMONT
			 (more plainly but under strain)
			Good to see you, son.

					 JEFFREY
				 (holding back tears)
			It's good to see you, Dad.

Jeffrey squeezes his father's hand.

35. EXT. VACANT FIELD - DAY

Jeffrey is walking down a dirt road on his way home.  He kicks up little 
clouds of dust as he walks.  He has some time to think about things. He 
sees a green bottle in the distance. He gathers up a few more rocks and 
pitches them one by one at the bottle.  He misses.

He looks for a few more good rocks to throw and while looking through some
tall grass and weeds, he sees something strange.

He looks closer.  It is a HUMAN EAR, covered with crawling ants.

Jeffrey immediately stands up and looks around.  All he sees are houses 
- some laundry drying - a very peaceful scene.  No one seems to be around -
No one seems to be watching him.

He looks again at the ear.

We are so close we can hear ants racing frantically around the ear into it.
There is dried blood on part of it.

Jeffrey finds a brown paper bad and using a twig, he pushes the ear onto 
it.  Again, he stands up and looks around.

IN THE DISTANCE, a MAN goes into the back door of a house.  Nothing more.

Jeffery hurries off, carrying the bag with the ear in it.

of the room; one of them comes toward Jeffrey.

					JEFFREY
			Are you Detective Williams?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Yes.

					JEFFREY
			My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near
			you. I believe you know my father, Tom
			Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Sure I do. I understand he's in the
			hospital. How is he?

					JEFFREY
			He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're
			doing tests, that's why I'm home from 
			school. I was over at the hospital this
			morning and I was going home and in the
			field behind our neighborhood. there
			behind Vista, I found an ear.

				DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
				(matter of factly)
			You did? A human ear?

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I
			thought I should bring it to you.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.

Jeffrey opens the bag and lets Detective Williams look inside.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
					  (continuing)
			That sure looks like a human ear, doesn't
			it?. Let's run it down to the Coroner's
			Office and see what they make of it. Then,
			I want you to show me exactly where you
			found it.

39. INT. CORONER'S OFFICE - DAY

Jeffrey, Detective Williams, and an OLD CORONER'S OFFICER are looking at 
the ear, which is sitting in a medical dish on a table.

					CORONER'S OFFICER
			The tests will take awhile. Meanwhile,
			we'll check the morgue records. I don't
			recall anything coming in minus an ear.

The Coroner's Officer turns to Jeffrey.

					CORONER'S OFFICER
					   (continuing)
			Now if you'd found a jaw or let's say, a
			heart, or even an arm, we would assume
			that there was a corpse, however, a finger
			or an ear. the person may very well be 
			alive somewhere.

					JEFFREY
			What can you tell about the person from the
			ear?

					CORONER'S OFFICER
			Well. when the tests are done, quite a lot
			. Sex, blood type, whether or not the ear
			came off a dead person. Right now, I know
			what you know. It's a real human ear. The
			human was, or is, Caucasian.
			. also. It looks like the ear was cut off
			with scissors.

40. EXT. VACANT FIELD - DAY

Jeffrey is out with Detective Williams and a CREW OF OFFICERS who have 
roped off the area and are doing a grid search.

A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER is also there taking flash pictures all around the 
field, especially where Jeffrey has told them he found the ear.

Detective Williams takes Jeffrey aside.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going
			to the press and I'm going to ask you to 
			consider all you've heard strictly 
			confidential. Do not discuss this business
			with anyone, but me, or other police

					SANDY
			That's too bad.

					JEFFREY
			What do you know about the ear?. anything?

					SANDY
			Didn't my father tell you not to talk about
			it?
				  (she smiles)

					JEFFREY
			Come on. you brought it up. Do you know 
			anything?

					SANDY
			I don't really know much but bits and pieces
			. I hear things. My room is right above my
			father's office. The ear. there's no corpse
			in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come
			off a living person. That's direct from the
			Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. 
			There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, 
			but I think there are some people who were 
			brought in for questioning on a murder case 
			that could have something to do with the ear. 
			I heard some of the same names.

					JEFFREY
			Do you know who was brought in for 
			questioning?

					SANDY
			There were at least three, maybe four. But
			a name that keeps coming up is this woman
			who lives in an apartment building very
			close to your house and also close to the 	
			field where you found the ear. There's 
			also a business man over by the Franklin
			factory district that was questioned. and
			a musician. and some others.

					JEFFREY
			Were all these people questioned this
			afternoon?

					SANDY
			No. this has been going on for some time
			. several months. About six months ago
			some parts of bodies were found down by
			the river. They were from people who were
			reported missing. They never found one
			complete body. only parts.

					JEFFREY
			The ear is from a missing person maybe?

					SANDY
			Maybe so.

					JEFFREY
			It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know
			what building the woman lives in?

					SANDY
			Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy.
			They've had her under surveillance for a 
			couple of months, except I don't know what
			they've found out because my father isn't
			in charge of her.

					JEFFREY
			I guess you have to get back home soon?

			Not really, why?
				(then she understands)
			You want to see the building?. Come on,
			I'll show you.

			. Anything?

					SANDY
			My father is watching the businessman.
			The businessman had a partner who 
			disappeared. left his whole business and

					JEFFREY
			You really do hear a lot, don't you?

60. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR - DAY

Jeffrey driving.  He looks at his watch.  It is 3:30.

61. EXT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Jeffrey is parked across the street from the school.  High school kids 
are pouring out the front door.  In a moment he sees Sandy come out with 
two or three other girls.  They walk down the sidewalk away from Jeffrey.

He starts the car and slowly follows them to the corner, where he pulls 
up alongside of them. very close. Sandy suddenly recognizes him.

					JEFFREY
			You hungry or thirsty, or both?

					SANDY
				   (taken back)
			I don't know.

					JEFFREY
			I'd like to talk to you about something.

					SANDY
			Just a minute. pull over and wait a 
			minute.

Sandy pulls her girlfriends away from Jeffrey's car and says something to 
them.  There is some whispering and giggling and then,

					SANDY
				  (to the girls)
			Please, don't say anything to Mike.
			promise?

The girls promise.  Sandy goes around and gets in the car.

					JEFFREY
			I don't want to cause any trouble.

					SANDY
			I'm here, aren't I?

					JEFFREY
			    (smiling as though he knew)
			I guess Mike's got some sort of sports
			practice in the afternoon.

					SANDY
			Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too
			smart.

									CUT TO:

62. INT. DINER - DAY

Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting in a booth.  Jeffrey's grilled cheese on 
white bread and a coke have just arrived along with Sandy's coke.

					SANDY
			Alright, now tell me. What is it?

					JEFFREY
			There are opportunities in life for gaining
			knowledge and experience. sometimes, in
			some cases. it's necessary to take a risk.
			I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could
			learn a lot by getting into that woman's 
			apartment. you know. sneak in and hide
			and observe.

					SANDY
			You said it was a strange world. 
			and you're the strangest part of it. Are 
			you crazy.she is possibly involved in 
			murder. This gives me the creeps.

					JEFFREY
			Settle down. I have a plan which I think
			will work. There is very little for you
			to do, but I do need your help.
			.Aren't you curious about my plan?

					SANDY
			  (thinking and intrigued, plus she 
  			   is beginning to like Jeffrey)
			It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.

					JEFFREY
				  (getting excited)
			Alright. the first thing is to get into her
			apartment and open a window that I could 
			crawl into later.

					SANDY
			Now, how are you going to do that?

					JEFFREY
			Right out in the car I happen to have some
			old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will
			go to her apartment and be the pest control
			man. I will spray her apartment. After a 
			few minutes you will knock on her door, 
			drawing her attention away from me and I 
			will then jimmy a window.

					SANDY
			What will I say when she comes to the door?

					JEFFREY
			You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a 
			few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't 
			have to keep her very long. a few seconds 
			is all I'll need. Whatiya think?

					SANDY
			I don't know. it sounds like a good 
			daydream, . but actually doing it is too
			weird. too dangerous.

					JEFFREY
			Let's just try the first part. If that
			goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one
			will suspect us, because no one would 
			believe two people like us would be crazy
			enough to do something like this.

					SANDY
			You've got a point there.

									CUT TO:

63. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET-DAY

Jeffrey and Sandy are in the car.  Jeffrey is struggling to put on the old overalls.

					JEFFREY
			Now. we'll walk over so there's no license
			plates and you give me at least three 
			minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I
			need time to find a good window .alright?

					SANDY
			Alright.

					JEFFREY
			Let's go.

64. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - DAY

They get out of the car. Sandy has the "Awake" magazines.

					JEFFREY
			Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute,
			what's her name?

					SANDY
			Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh
			Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number,
			bright boy.

					JEFFREY
			Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good
			luck . three minutes, no sooner.

					SANDY
			Alright. Good luck, yourself.

Jeffrey takes off in the direction of the apartment building.

									CUT TO:

65. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Jeffrey walks up the front steps and goes in the double outer doors.

66. INT. LOBBY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

He looks up and down the mailboxes and finally finds "D. Vallens, 
Apartment Number 710."

Jeffrey goes into the lobby.

									CUT TO:

67. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Jeffrey climbs the stairs.  An OLD LADY is making her way down the stairs.
She sees Jeffrey and his rig.

					OLD LADY
			Well, it's about time you came.

Jeffrey forces a smile at her and after she's gone.

					JEFFREY
				    (to himself)
			That's a good sign.

He keeps climbing.  He arrives at the Seventh Floor. and finds Number 710. 
He knocks and waits.  He looks around. the hallway is empty.

DOROTHY VALLENS opens the door.  She is a very beautiful woman in her 
late thirties.  She has a beautiful full figure, dark eyes, black thick 
wavy hair.  Full red lips.  Right now, however, she looks a bit tired and 
a bit frumpy in an old terrycloth robe.

					DOROTHY
			Yes? What is it?

					JEFFREY
			Pest control. gotta do your apartment.

					DOROTHY
			Oh God, that stuff stinks.

					JEFFREY
				 (as he goes in)
			Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.

					DOROTHY
			Oh yeah, that's good.

68. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jeffrey goes all around the baseboards, spraying.  All the while he's 
getting a good look around the apartment.

There is a window above the kitchen sink out to the fire escape.  Jeffrey 
looks around to see what Dorothy is doing and she is watching him spraying.
The apartment is smaller than he thought, so he sprays the kitchen very 
slowly and makes believe the sprayer is jammed.

Suddenly, there is knocking at the door.

					DOROTHY
			What is this. Grand Central Station?

She opens the door.  Jeffrey looks. It's not Sandy. A MAN, with a yellow 
sports coat, is standing there.  Jeffrey begins to sweat, because the MAN 
looked around Dorothy to see him.  Dorothy says something to the Man which 
Jeffrey cannot hear.

The next time Jeffrey looks up, the Man is gone.  The whole thing looks 
to be turning out badly when Jeffrey spots a key on the counter.  On a 
long shot, he steals it just as the front door shuts. He wraps things up 
and gets out.

					JEFFREY
				    (to Dorothy)
			That oughta do it.

					DOROTHY
			Yeah.


69. 	INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Jeffrey leaves.  Out on the stairs, he finds Sandy with her "Awake" 
magazines.

					SANDY
			Are you alright?

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. let's get outta here. What
			happened?

As they go downstairs,

					SANDY
			I was just about to go to the door, when
			that man did my job for me. Was it alright?

					JEFFREY
			Yes and no. Did you recognize him?

					SANDY
			No. I only saw his back. He went down 
			another stairwell at the end of the hall.

					JEFFREY
			I didn't get a good look at him either, but
			he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to 
			get a window, but I found this key.
				 (he shows it to her)
			Pretty nifty, huh?

					SANDY
			Yeah, if it opens the door.

					JEFFREY
			Yeah.

70. 	INT. LOBBY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

They get to the door of the apartment building.

					JEFFREY
			You go first.

71. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - DAY

They leave the building separately.  When Jeffrey gets to the car, 
Sandy isn't there.  He looks around.  He starts the car and drives off.

There, up ahead, he spots her.  He pulls over and she gets in.

					SANDY
			So. what's next?

					JEFFREY
			Pretty clever. Are you game for more?

					SANDY
			I owe you. since I goofed up this one.

					JEFFREY
			You didn't goof it up, but. you still
			owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. 
			It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?

					SANDY
			Yes. I do.

					JEFFREY
			Well, it's Friday night and you're a 
			beautiful girl. I guess you would have
			a date. that does that.

72. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/WILLIAMS HOME - DAY

Jeffrey is driving Sandy home.

					SANDY
			You really want to do this, don't you?

					JEFFREY
			I don't want you to get involved, really,
			I mean, I do, but if something went wrong
			I mean, like you said, they may be involved
			in murder.

They pull up in front of Sandy's house.

					SANDY
			   (making up her mind - against
    			    her better judgment)
			I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game
			tonight anyway and he'll never miss me.
			Afterwards he can go out with the guys.
			Just so the record is kept straight though,
			I love Mike. What do want me to do?

					JEFFREY
			    (studies her a moment, then)
			First of all, we'll have a nice dinner.
			Try to find out where Dorothy sings.

					SANDY
			I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on
			Route 7.

					JEFFREY
			Great. I'll pick you up around eight
			o'clock. Is that good?

					SANDY
			Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may
			think it's strange. I'll walk over to your
			house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.

					JEFFREY
			Okay. You better get out before someone
			sees us.

Sandy gets out of the car and without turning around walks into her 
house.  Jeffrey calls out after her.

					JEFFREY
			See ya!

The television is on.  Some crime show is playing, but the SOUND is 
very low.

The FAMILY DOCTOR is over and is giving Mrs. Beaumont an injection of 
medicine.  Aunt Barbara is sitting nearby.

					DR. GYNDE
			That will take care of you, Frances, for

					AUNT BARBARA
			I'll see to it, Bill.

			Good.

					MRS. BEAUMONT
			I feel fine.

					DR. GYNDE
			That's not the point. You're under a great

			be foolish.

Jeffrey enters the room - to say goodnight.

					JEFFREY
			Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick.
			What's going on?

					AUNT BARBARA
			I'm not sick.

Jeffrey points to his head and makes a circular "crazy" gesture.  They 
all laugh, except Aunt Barbara.

					AUNT BARBARA
					(continuing)
			We'll see who stays in my will.

They laugh again.

					JEFFREY
				  (to his mother)
			Can I use the car tonight?

					MRS. BEAUMONT
			Of course, Jeffrey.

They say their goodnights.

74. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR - NIGHT

Jeffrey and Sandy are looking at each other.  Jeffrey turns back to 
driving.

Sandy watches Jeffrey drive then she turns and watches the stores and 
shops go by.

When she is turned away, Jeffrey turns and look at her.  Sandy is 
thinking.

					SANDY
			What's the plan.

					JEFFREY
			First of all, we're going to the Slow Club
			to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for
			awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway,
			and then also we'll know she is there and
			not in her apartment.

					SANDY
			Brilliant.

					JEFFREY
			Then we'll drive back to her apartment and 
			I will plant myself there.

					SANDY
			This is not my usual Friday night!

75. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

The SLOW CLUB is a sleazy night club on the outskirts of town.  It

			Good evening. two?

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. Could we get a small table in the

					SLEZY MAITRE D'
			Surely, come this way.

They follow him and are seated.

					MAITRE D'
			May I get you something to drink?


					JEFFREY
			I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.

					SANDY
			    (she might as well)
			That sounds good.

					JEFFREY
			Two.

					MAITRE D'
			Two Heinekens, thank you.

The Maitre d' leaves.

On stage a FAT COMIC is telling jokes.  The jokes are tailored for this 
kind of working-class crowd.  The people are laughing.  The place is 
almost full.  Jeffrey and Sandy are taking it all in.

					JEFFREY
				    (to Waiter)
			When does Dorothy Vallens come on?

					WAITER
				(flustered; overworked)
			I don't know. pretty soon. Who knows.

After the Waiter leaves,

					SANDY
			That guy was filled with information.

They pour their beers.

					JEFFREY
				 (raising his glass)
			Here's to. an interesting experience.

					SANDY
			I'll drink to that.

They drink.

77. INT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

Later. Jeffrey and Sandy have just finished dinner.  The M.C. is arranging 
a floral art deco microphone and a SAXOPHONE PLAYER, a BASS PLAYER, and a 
DRUMMER are on stage.

					M.C.
				 (very low key)
			Ladies and gentlemen. The Blue Lady.
			Miss Dorothy Vallens.

There is quite a round of applause, even though most people continue 
laughing, talking, and drinking.  Dorothy Vallens comes out on stage.



She smiles. The house lights are still up. As she sings the first lines 
of "BLUE MOON" the house lights go down and a blue spot light comes up on 
her as she sings the word, "Blue." This is a very sexy and slow version of 
the song.

During the song, Jeffrey and Sandy look at one another with the thought 
that this is the woman whose apartment they are about to break into.

Jeffrey and Sandy leave as Dorothy starts her next song, "BLUE VELVET."  
They hear the first few lines before they get out the door.

78. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

They hurry to the car, get in, and drive off.

									CUT TO:

79. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR - NIGHT

Jeffrey and Sandy drive through dark areas of the city.  They don't talk 
as they drive, but again they sneak glances at one another.

80. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

They turn in to the street where Dorothy Vallens lives and glide to a stop 
close to the building.  Jeffery cuts the engine.

It is very quiet.  Both are looking around to see if anyone is out or 
watching.  Jeffrey tries to look up out the front windshield to the 
Seventh Floor.  It is dark.  Sandy moves.  Every tiny sound is heard.  
Sandy looks at Jeffrey for some time, then back at the building.

					SANDY
			Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.

					JEFFREY
			Why not?

					SANDY
			It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I 
			shouldn't have told you.

					JEFFREY
			It'll be okay. I don't think you should
			wait out here though. I think you should 
			go home. Can you drive this car?

					SANDY
			Yeah. but.

					JEFFREY
			Leave it in the front of your house for me.
			okay?

					SANDY
			O.K.

					JEFFREY
			Could you wait a little while. this key may
			not fit.

					SANDY
			. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't
			make any sense. Let's go somewhere and 
			have some coffee.

					JEFFREY
			I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow
			and tell you how it went.

					SANDY
			I. I don't want to see you tomorrow.
			Mike's coming over.

					JEFFREY
			Oh, okay. can I call?

					SANDY
			Okay. yeah, call.

					JEFFREY
			Look. it can wait till Sunday.

					SANDY
			Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope
			you can sneak out okay. You're going to 
			wait until she's asleep?

					JEFFREY
			Yeah.

					SANDY
			I'm going to wait here until she comes.

					JEFFREY
			Are you sure?

					SANDY
			I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and
			know she's on her way up. Okay?

Jeffrey nods.

					JEFFREY
			Okay. thanks.

					SANDY
			I don't know if you're a detective or a 
			pervert.

					JEFFREY
			That's for me to know and for you to find
			out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?

					SANDY
			Okay, okay. Bye.

Jeffrey gets out of the car and shuts the door.  He looks in one more time 
at Sandy.  They stare at each other silently.

Jeffrey can see her lips in the black darkness of the car.  Sandy watches 
him cross the lawn and go into the apartment building.  She slides over and
sits in the driver's seat.

									CUT TO:

81. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jeffrey hurries up the stairs to the Seventh Floor.

SOMEONE comes out of an apartment just as Jeffrey gets to the Seventh Floor.

He goes up another flight of stairs to the Eighth Floor and waits until 
the man goes downstairs.

Jeffrey then goes back to the Seventh Floor and goes to Door 710.  
He takes out the key and looks around. No one.  He inserts the key.  
It fits.  He turns it.  The door opens.

82. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

He quickly enters the very dark apartment and shuts the door.  It takes a 
moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness.  Soon he finds his way 
around.  He decides on the closet to hide in.  However before he goes in 
to the closet he slowly surveys the apartment as well as he can in the 
darkness.  He goes down the hallway to the back bedroom.  

Across the hallway he opens another door and is surprised to find an empty 
child's room.  In the child's room he sees a small pointed hat with a 
propeller on top.  The kind that plays music when the propeller turns.  
The hat is sitting silently on the bed post.  He quietly closes the door.  
He returns to the closet.  Once inside, he checks out how much he can see. 
Through the slats he has a view of half the apartment.  This is where he 
will stay.  He moves around some to relax.  He takes several deep breaths. 
He looks at his watch.  It says "10:17."

83. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Sandy sits in the car, carefully watching the apartment building and 
street.

84. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

In the closet, Jeffrey shakes his shoulders and moves around some to 
stretch his muscles which are getting tired.  Again, he takes several 
deep breaths.  He looks at his watch - it says 12:45.

					JEFFREY
				    (to himself)
			Oh no, hurry up Dorothy. Come on!. and I
			gotta pee. Great. it's now or never.

Jeffrey sneaks out of the closet and makes his way across the bedroom to 
the door of the bathroom.  His foot hits the door and it makes a loud 
noise.  He freezes.

85. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

He moves again into the bathroom.  He starts to pee.

					JEFFREY
			Heineken.

									CUT TO:

86. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Suddenly Sandy sits up alert.

87. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

A car drives up and a MAN helps Dorothy Vallens get out.  They walk into 
the building.

									CUT TO:

88. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey instinctively has flushed the toilet and because everything else 
is so quiet the water SOUNDS seem very loud.

89. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Sandy begins to honk the horn.

90. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Unable to hear the warning horn, Jeffrey nonchalantly leaves the bathroom 
as the tank is still filling.

SUDDENLY, he hears something. a key going in the door.  He bolts toward 
the closet.  He flies inside it and is swinging the door shut as the front 
door opens.

Just as suddenly, the toilet tank gets full and the water shuts off - 
SILENCE, except for Dorothy Vallens at the front door.

					DOROTHY (V.O.)
				(we're watching Jeffrey trying to 
  				 control frightened breathing in
			  the dark closet)
			Thanks Jimmy, see you tomorrow. You want a
			drink, or something?

					JIMMY (V.O.)
			I better get back. thanks anyway.

					DOROTHY
			Goodnight.

					JIMMY
			Goodnight now.

The front door shuts and the living room lights go on.  Jeffrey can see 
Dorothy come toward him.  She walks RIGHT UP, almost to his face, when 
the phone RINGS.

She turns immediately and goes to answer it.  Jeffrey almost passes out. 
He thought he'd had it.  He overhears.


					DOROTHY
				    (on the phone)
			Hello. yes. yes sir, Frank. Let me
			talk to him. Please Frank, sir. I like
			to sing Blue Velvet. Don? It's okay.
			Don't worry. Don??. can you hear me?
			Is little Donny OK? Is he there? Don? You
			mean Meadow Lane? Frank?! What's the
			matter with him? I know. When? Okay. In
			an hour. I'll be sweet. Momma loves you.
			Okay Frank, sir.

She hangs up the phone hard and puts her head in her hands.

					DOROTHY
				    (to herself)
			Frank, you son of a bitch!

She goes and sits down and starts chewing a fingernail.  She nervously 
gets up again and looks at a framed photograph for a moment then hides 
the photograph under a pillow on the couch.  She puts on a record, "FOR 
YOUR PRECIOUS LOVE."  She sits back down and chews her nail again, 
listening to the MUSIC; she starts to cry.  She stops herself and takes 
the record off.  She starts taking off her stocking.  She then takes off 
her dress.

Underneath, she has on a bra and panties.  She crosses the living room, 
goes down the hallway into the bathroom.

Jeffrey can't see her too well now.  She takes off her panties in the 
bathroom.  She is now naked.  She looks at herself in the mirror.  We see 
Jeffrey's face as he watches her.  She disappears from view completely and 
we HEAR her start a SHOWER.

									DISSOLVE TO:

91. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey's face.  He sees Dorothy - in a towel - come toward him again.  
He quickly moves back into the closet as far as he can.

She opens the door, reaches in and gets a blue velvet robe.  She doesn't 
see Jeffrey even though he isn't well hidden.  She closes the door.  It 
CLICKS shut.

Jeffrey is in almost total darkness.  He listens.  He can HEAR WALKING 
around, then silence.  He hears the kitchen sink WATER RUNNING.

He HEARS her WALKING AGAIN.  Now he can see her.  She sits down on her 
bed.  She looks up.  Just as Jeffrey shifts his weight.  She looks at the
closet strangely, but then calmly picks up a book and thumbs through it.  
She slowly gets up.

Jeffrey doesn't know what is up.  He looks but she walks out of view.

SUDDENLY, he hears a DRAWER OPEN, and just as suddenly, the CLOSET DOOR 
FLIES OPEN, and there she is with a pistol pointed right at him.  When 
she realizes that SOMEONE IS REALLY THERE, she SCREAMS ONCE, very loud.

					DOROTHY
				 (crazy scream, then)
			GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your
			hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down
			on your knees - DO IT!! What are you 
			doing? Who are you? What's your name?.
			WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

					JEFFREY
			Jeffrey.

					DOROTHY
			Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?

					JEFFREY
			Jeffrey nothing.

					DOROTHY
			You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.
				 (reads his license)
			Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in
			my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?

					JEFFREY
			I wanted to see you.

					DOROTHY
			What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you 
			here?

					JEFFREY
			Nobody.

					DOROTHY
			Shit. You better tell me something.

					JEFFREY
			I was. an experiment. Just to see if
			I could do it.

					DOROTHY
			An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.

					JEFFREY
			I sprayed your apartment. I took your key.
			I really didn't mean to do anything but 
			see you.

					DOROTHY
			Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.

					JEFFREY
				 (scared, nervous)
			. I saw you come in, talk on the phone.
			get undressed.

					DOROTHY
				   (interrupting)
			The phone. What did you hear on the phone
			. Tell me. Word for word.

					JEFFREY
				 (trying to remember)
			You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to 
			talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny.
			You said something about Momma loves you.
			and something about a Meadow Lane.
			something in an hour. I don't remember
			any more.

Dorothy stares at Jeffrey studying him for some time thinking.

					DOROTHY
			That's right. That's what I said. You
			have a good memory. Then what?

					JEFFREY
			Well.

					DOROTHY
			THEN WHAT?

					JEFFREY
			Then you got undressed.

					DOROTHY
			How many times have you sneaked into girls'
			apartments and watched them undress?

					JEFFREY
			    (quietly; feeling guilty)
			Never before this.

					DOROTHY
			How'd you like it if someone sneaked into
			your house and watched you.
				   (gets an idea)
			Get undressed. I want to see you.

					JEFFREY
			No. Come on.

					DOROTHY
			NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I
			want to see you.

					JEFFREY
			Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

					DOROTHY
			No way.

Dorothy moves to the kitchen counter and gets a knife.  She goes to 
Jeffrey.  Now she has a knife and a gun.  He's scared.

					DOROTHY
			Get undressed. I want to see you.

Jeffrey begins to undress. First he takes off his shoes and socks, 
Then his shirt.  He undoes his belt and unzips his pants and takes them 
off.  Now he is only in his underwear.

					DOROTHY
			STAND UP.

He does.

					DOROTHY
				    (continuing)
			Come closer.

Dorothy has a strange look on her face.  She reaches out and pulls 
Jeffrey's underpants down to his knees.  She looks at him.

					DOROTHY
				    (whispering)
			What do you want from me?

					JEFFREY
			   (quietly, getting very hot)
			I . I don't know.

					DOROTHY
				    (whispering)
			What do you want?

Dorothy is getting very DREAMY and begins to talk in a childlike voice.  
She opens her robe and pulls Jeffrey to her breasts.

					DOROTHY
			Don't move. don't look at me.

Jeffrey's eyes close with nervous ecstasy as Dorothy begins touching him.

					DOROTHY
			Do you like that?

					JEFFREY
			Yes.

He tries to touch her.

					DOROTHY
			Don't move or I'll kill you.

She looks at him.

					DOROTHY
				   (continuing)
			Do you like talk like that?

					JEFFREY
			No.

					DOROTHY
			Lie down on the bed.

He lies down.  He looks frightened.

There's a KNOCK, KNOCK on the door.  Dorothy looks VERY frightened.  She 
quickly moves a finger to her lips in a "quiet" sign and whispers to 
Jeffrey.

					DOROTHY
				 (whispers, frantic)
			Shut up. Hurry! Go in the closet. Don't
			say anything or you'll get killed. I mean
			it.

KNOCKING is heard louder at the door.  Jeffrey picks up all his clothes 
and gets in the closet.  He's naked and hiding in the closet.  Dorothy 
closes her robe and glides to the front door.

Jeffrey sees FRANK come in.

Frank is medium height and stocky with a burr hair cut.  He is wearing a 
tight blue t-shirt and an old black sports jacket.  He's got on a pair of 
blue jeans and boots.  He has a raw, mean sexuality - a "bomb about to go 
off" - presence. 

He comes into the room slowly, always looking at Dorothy.  He sits on the 
couch.

					DOROTHY
			Hello, baby.

					FRANK
                      (annoyed, condescending)
			Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.

					DOROTHY
			Hello, daddy.

					FRANK
			  (can't-you-remember-
			   anything-attitude)
			. my bourbon.

Dorothy goes into the kitchen to get Frank his drink.  As she passes the 
closet, Jeffrey can see the fear in her face.

She returns with a small glass of bourbon and hands it to Frank.  Frank 
sips on it.

					FRANK
			. sit down. get your chair.

Dorothy brings a small chair over from the wall and sits down.  She 
adjusts her robe.

					FRANK
				 (studying her)
			. spread your legs.

Dorothy slowly spreads her legs.  She can see Jeffrey staring out of the 
darkness of the closet at her.

					FRANK
			wider.

She opens her legs wider.  Frank looks at her crotch and drinks his 
bourbon.  He stares at the floor for a moment, then slowly looks back at 
Dorothy, her body - her crotch.

Dorothy looks up at the ceiling, waiting.  Frank suddenly reaches to his 
belt, where he has a small canister and a mask.  He opens a valve on the 
canister and places the mask over his nose and mouth.  The canister is 
filled with helium, which makes Frank's voice very high and strange 
sounding.  The result is frightening.

					FRANK
				   (high voice)
			. mommy.

Dorothy jumps.  She keeps looking at the ceiling.

					FRANK
			   (continuing, with high voice)
			. MOMMY!.

					DOROTHY
				    (frightened)
			. mommy's here.

					FRANK
				  (high voice)
			Baby wants to fuck.

Then, Frank's voice goes to normal.

					FRANK
			(normal voice, but loud - like
    			 an army order to himself)
			GET READY TO FUCK!

Frank goes to Dorothy and kneels down in front of her.  He takes one more 
gasp of helium.

					FRANK
				   (high voice)
			Baby wants blue velvet.

Dorothy opens her robe and gives a part of the robe to Frank.

					DOROTHY
				   (whispering)
			Okay.

Frank slowly moves

Frank slowly moves his mouth to the robe and runs his lips along the 
texture of the velvet.  His hands rub the velvet and feel Dorothy's body 
underneath.  His hands start feeling her breasts as he sucks and bites the 
velvet robe.

Dorothy is very frightened but she is getting hot in spite of her fear.  
Then Frank, in a sort of sickening way, pulls Dorothy down to rug.  He 
warns her.

					FRANK
			Don't look at me!

He begins stuffing part of the robe into her mouth.  Then, he pushes her 
arms back and she keeps them back, letting Frank have his way.  Frank 
sucks and bites the velvet coming out of her mouth, while he pinches and 
feels her breasts in a strange, compulsive, timidly sickening way.  
Dorothy is moaning.  Frank is breathing very heavily. He feels her crotch.

					FRANK
			Don't look at me!!!
			     (heavy breathing)
			Daddy's home.

He starts stuffing the robe in his mouth now and he gets on top of Dorothy.
He starts humping her and pulling her nude body up and down him.  Faster 
and faster, then he has a climax in his pants.  Dorothy's head is falling 
back.  She can see Jeffrey blurred in the distance - in the closet.  
Cautiously, she looks sideways at Frank.

					FRANK
				    (screaming)
			Don't look at me!!!

He slugs her in the face.  His nose is running and he's stifling sobs from 
deep within him.  On his hands and knees, he moves away.  The robe pulls 
out of his mouth.  His breathing is even heavier now.  He stands and 
begins to move around the apartment.  He goes to a wall, turns off the 
lights, then turns and walks into the bathroom, all the while breathing 
big, heavy breaths, trying to stop the crying.  Dorothy moans softly.

It gets very quiet and still for a moment.  Then, Jeffrey hears Frank 
with his high helium voice talking to himself in the bathroom.  The high, 
strange sound reverberates in the distance.  Jeffrey can't make it out - 
soon, he hears Frank's high laughing.  Frank comes back into the living 
room.  The mask is around his face.  All his breathing - every sound is 
high . He laughs a little and crosses the darkened room to the door.

					FRANK
			Stay alive baby. See you next Christmas!

Frank leaves and shuts the door.  The apartment is silent except for 
Dorothy's moans.  

Jeffrey is stunned.  He doesn't move.  He watches Dorothy in the 
half-light.  She rolls over and starts crying.  The crying is deep and 
genuine.

Slowly, Jeffrey emerges from the closet and goes to her.  He bends down 
and touches her.  She flinches and turns to see him.  She turns back 
sobbing.  He tries to get her up.

					JEFFREY
			Why don't you come lie down. Come on, I'll
			help you.

She struggles up with Jeffrey's help and he takes her over to the bed.  
She falls down on her side, turned toward the wall.  He covers her with 
the sheet.

					DOROTHY
			Don't.
			    (referring to the sheet)
			I don't like that. What do you want?

					JEFFREY
			Nothing. Are you alright?

					DOROTHY
			Sure I'm alright.
			   (she starts crying again)

					JEFFREY
			I'll go then.

He starts to put on his underwear.  They're inside out.  He tries to turn 
them around.

					DOROTHY
			Don?

					JEFFREY
			No.

					DOROTHY
			Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me.
			Please.

Jeffrey turns to her.  He studies her.  He reaches out and takes her 
shoulders.  He moves down and holds her.

					DOROTHY
				    (whispering)
			Thank you. honey.

					JEFFREY
				    (whispering)
			It's okay. It's okay.

They lie together for a long silent moment.

					DOROTHY
			Do you like the way I feel?

					JEFFREY
				    (hesitates)
			Yes.

					DOROTHY
			See my breasts?  . See?

Jeffrey looks.

					JEFFREY
			Yes.

					DOROTHY
			See my nipples?

					JEFFREY
			Yes.

					DOROTHY
				    (whispering)
			You can kiss them if you want. Fell them
			. They're getting hard.

Jeffrey starts to move closer.  Dorothy closes her eyes.

					DOROTHY
				    (continuing)
			Go ahead. I don't mind.

Jeffrey can't help himself.  He licks and sucks her nipples and feels her 
breasts.  They both are getting very hot.

					DOROTHY
			Feel me.

Jeffrey is all over her now.  Dorothy suddenly seems to recognize him.

					DOROTHY
			You can hit me, if you want to.

					JEFFREY
			No. please. I won't.

Dorothy arches back and whining she throws her head back hard against the 
wall.

					JEFFREY
			Stop it!

She moves and won't let him feel her anymore.  She holds his hands away.

					DOROTHY
				    (whispering)
			Do you like me?

					JEFFREY
				    (whispering)
			Yes, I like you.

					DOROTHY
				    (whispering)
			You can be my special friend and come and
			put that in me.

They start making love.  Suddenly, Dorothy starts crying.

					JEFFREY
			What's the matter?

Suddenly Dorothy slaps Jeffrey in the face. very hard.

					DOROTHY
			Get off me.

Jeffrey gets off her, pressing his hand to his face.  Dorothy goes into 
the bathroom crying all the way.  Jeffrey sits, confused.

Suddenly Jeffrey hears a horrible scream from Dorothy.  A true scream of 
horror.  He rushes into the bathroom to see what is wrong.

92. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

She is just flushing something down the toilet.  The water SOUND rushes.  
He turns to her.  She is trembling and in a state of shock.

					DOROTHY
			I made it go down the toilet.

					JEFFREY
			What?

He looks in the swirling water. It looks like an ear revolving around and 
around then whatever it is disappears.

					DOROTHY
			I made it go down the toilet.

Jeffrey looks up. he sees written with a bar of soap the words "look down" 
on the mirror.

He looks down into the sink.  At the bottom he sees a small clot of blood 
and a smear of fresher blood.

Jeffrey suddenly remembers mentally Frank's high helium voice reverberating
in the bathroom.

93. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

FLASHBACK

Frank in bathroom.

94. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

FLASHBACK

Frank at door saying "see you next Christmas."

95. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

					JEFFREY
				   (inner voice)
			Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has
			left a present for Dorothy? What was it?
			An ear? Another ear?!!
				(out loud, to Dorothy)
			What was it?

					DOROTHY
			(strangely - extremely frightened
  			 now that Jeffrey may have left it)
			Do you know?

					JEFFREY
			No.



					DOROTHY
			  (breathing heavily, strangely)
			You don't?

					JEFFREY
			No. What is happening?

					DOROTHY
			Maybe you don't know. I know you though.
			You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where
			you live and I know ways to get you and I
			know ways to kill you.

					JEFFREY
			Please don't talk like that. You're upset.
			I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I
			did. I better go.

					DOROTHY
			Go then. I can't let you put it in me now
			but I want you. I like you.
	
					JEFFREY
			Then don't talk about killing.

					DOROTHY
			Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?
				     (laughs)
			Sometimes I think it would be fun.
				  (strange smile)
			Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't
			open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little
			secret.
				  (she leans close)
			I want to die.

					JEFFREY
			Don't say that.

					DOROTHY
			It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day
			I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep 
			now.

					JEFFREY
			 (frightened by her craziness)
			O.K.

He takes another look at the blood in the bottom of the sink.  He takes 
another look at the beautiful dark troubled eyes of Dorothy Vallens, and 
turns, goes through the hall to the living room.  He crosses slowly to the 
door, suddenly he turns back and enters the hallway going down to the 
bathroom.  He stops and looks at Dorothy who is turned away from him.  
She stares into the sink.  Jeffrey notices that a square of fabric has 
been cut from the bottom of her blue velvet robe

					JEFFREY
			I'm leaving now.

She is whispering something to herself.

					DOROTHY
				 (very faint whisper)
			Help me. help me. please help me.

Jeffrey doesn't know what he can do.

96. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey turns back, goes through the living room.  He looks around and 
sees the empty bourbon glass of Frank's.  Suddenly he remembers the 
photograph that Dorothy hid.  He picks up the pillow and sees a picture 
of a smiling man and a small boy standing next to him wearing a pointed 
hat with a propeller. He turns the photo over and finds an old marriage 
license.  It reads: Dorothy Vallens to Don.

					JEFFREY (V.O.)
			Don. Oh my God.

He hides the photo again.  He sees Dorothy's telephone.  He memorizes the 
number - moving his lips with each digit.  He goes to the front door and 
opens it quietly.

97. EXT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

He looks out into the hall.  It's empty.

97A. INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

He quickly goes to the back stairway and down the stairs.  These steps are 
cement and his feet make echoing sounds which seem very loud.  He goes 
through a door marked "EXIT".

98. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

. and comes out, crosses a lawn and goes out onto the sidewalk.

He walks along taking in deep cleansing breaths.  He looks at his watch.  
2:30.  He feels so confused, exhilarated, so uneasy.  He secretly worries 
about what he's gotten into.

99. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey enters the house. THE CAMERA RUSHES along the rug in the dark to a 
foot.  The lights come on.  PAN UP the leg to Mrs. Beaumont waiting in a 
chair, staring.

					JEFFREY
				     (startled)
			God. you scared me.

					MRS. BEAUMONT
			Is something wrong? What's happened to 
			your face?

					JEFFREY
			Nothing. I'm fine.

					MRS. BEAUMONT
			You can't just stay out half the night and
			carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some
			order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have
			been nice to call your father when you got 
			home but now it is much too late.

FADE TO:

100. INT. JEFFREY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jeffrey gets out of bed and goes to the phone.  He dials a number.

					JEFFREY
			Louise Wertham, please. okay.
					(waits)
			Louise?. Jeffrey. Hi. What's up?
					(pause)
			MARRIED?! Good night! Louise! Are 
			you kidding?
				    (long pause)
			Well, Louise, I wish you a lot of
			luck and if things don't work out, 
I think you should go into comedy.

Jeffrey hangs up the phone hard.  He shakes his head.

101. INT. BEAUMONTS' HARDWARE STORE - DAY

Jeffrey's drinking a cup of coffee behind the counter in the store.  
He thinks.  He takes another drink of coffee and sets the cup down.  
He clasps his hands behind his back and begins pacing up and down.

					JEFFREY
				(to himself, out loud)
			How can I help her? I can't tell her to go
			to Detective Williams. She'll think I'm a
			policeman. She has my address. She can go	
			there. if she has to. I'll tell her. and 
			her. and she thinks I'm Don. her husband?
			Where the hell is Don? - maybe he died.

Jeffrey dials the phone.

					JEFFREY
			Hello?. Mrs. Williams?. This is Jeffrey
			Beaumont. Fine. Okay. Is Sandy there? 
			Okay. Hi Sandy. Can you talk? He is?.
			Well, I guess I'll talk to you later on.
			It went okay. I'll tell you about it.
			Dinner?. Tomorrow night? Seven o'clock,
			yeah, sounds good. Okay. he's still in
			the hospital. Okay, yeah. See you 
			tomorrow. thanks.

102. INT. HOSPITAL LABORATORY - DAY

The searching, mysterious MUSIC plays over while,

A DOCTOR is looking at various blood samples under a powerful microscope.  
Various sophisticated gadgets are seen in CLOSEUPS.

					JEFFREY (V.O.)
			This is what my father's disease looks like?

					DR. GYNDE
			Yes.

The BLOOD is seen in CLOSEUP. Cells are moving.

The Doctor makes a change in magnification.  The cells are huge - then, 
even bigger.  They are so big we can hear them moving.

103. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

The parking lot is half-full.  A strong wind is blowing trash around.  
Jeffrey parks his car.

104. INT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

. and enters the club. He speaks to the Maitre d'.

					JEFFREY
			A table in back, please.

					MAITRE D'
			Certainly

Dorothy is singing her opening song as the Maitre d' seats Jeffrey.

					JEFFREY
			I'll have an ice-cold Heineken.

					MAITRE D'
			One Heineken, certainly, sir.

Jeffrey surveys the place after the Maitre d' leaves.  It is very dark and 
smoky inside.  He has trouble seeing, but suddenly he spots Frank sitting 
with some other GUYS watching Dorothy sing.  They are sitting two tables 
away.

Frank is totally captivated by Dorothy's singing and is very serious-
looking.  He looks right up to her eyes.  In his hand he works a small 
piece of blue velvet cloth with his fingers.  Again her first number, 
"BLUE MOON," segues into "BLUE VELVET."  This song she sings mainly to 
Frank.  When it is over Frank continues watching Dorothy and everyone else 
applauds loudly.

Jeffrey drinks up his Heineken and goes back outside.

EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

He looks around at all the cars but none stand out as Frank's.  He gets 
into his car and pulls out across the street, re-parks the car and waits.

									DISSOLVE TO:

106. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

Traffic roars past Jeffrey and in the distance several people exit the 
SLOW CLUB.  Among them are Frank and his friends.  They get into a black 
Ford Fairlane and drive out of the parking lot - down the highway.  
Jeffrey starts his engine and moves out after them.  He has to gun the car 
up to sixty-five to catch up with them.

107. EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

The mysterious MUSIC plays.

He follows them to an intersection where they turn off to the right.  
He waits at a light right behind them.  Inside they are lighting 
cigarettes.  The light turns green and Frank takes off.  Jeffrey follows 
them through a dark area down by the docks.  He follows them up a narrow 
street through dark factories.

108. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT

Dark, low MUSIC now.

Up ahead, Frank parks his car.  Jeffrey quickly pulls over and kills his 
lights and engine.  He watches Frank and his friends enter an old apartment
building next to a bookbinding factory.  They disappear within.  The 
electric lines above buzz loudly.

Jeffrey gets out of his car and walks up the deserted street.  He reaches 
Frank's car which is making popping and clicking NOISES as it cools down.  
He looks at the license plates - walks a few paces ahead and then writes it
down in his notebook.  He continues on to the apartment building.

109. 	INT. LOBBY - FRANK'S BUILDING - NIGHT

Inside he looks at the names on the mailboxes.  He sees a name - Frank 
Booth.  The name gives him the chills.  The apartment number is 26.

In the distance, he hears footsteps.  He quickly leaves.

110. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT

. and crosses the street down to his car.  He gets in and waits.  Frank 
comes out of the building and crosses to his car.

					JEFFREY
			     (out loud to himself)
			I'll bet I know where you're going.

He follows Frank as he pulls out.

									DISSOLVE TO:

111. 	EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Jeffrey discreetly parks just after Frank kills the engine on his car.  
He watches Frank leave the parking lot.

112. EXT. VACANT FIELD - NIGHT

He follows Frank through the same vacant lot where he found the ear.  He 
seems to use the lot as a secret short cut to Dorothy's apartment.


113. EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Jeffrey goes back to his car to wait.

									DISSOLVE TO:

114. EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT

A storm is building.  There is a roar of thunder as Frank slams his car 
door as he gets in.  His mouth twists into a smile as he guns the engine 
and leaves.  Jeffrey waits till Frank is safely gone.

					JEFFREY
			       (thinking out loud)
			I shouldn't go in. I shouldn't. but I'm
			too curious. and I have to try to help her.

He then gets out of his car as the wind is building.

115. EXT. VACANT FIELD - NIGHT

. and runs through the vacant lot.

116. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

. to Dorothy's building.

117. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

He goes up to the seventh floor and knocks twice on 710.  A moment passes, 
then the door flies open.

Dorothy looks as if she was expecting Frank to be coming back.  Dorothy 
LOOKS BAD.

					JEFFREY
			Hi. can I come in?

					DOROTHY
			  (looking around the hallway)
			Yeah. hurry up though.

They go inside.

118. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

					JEFFREY
			Are you alright?

Dorothy breaks down crying.

					DOROTHY
			No. I'm not.

Jeffrey goes to her.

					DOROTHY
			Why are you here. whatiya want?


					JEFFREY
			. I. uh.

					DOROTHY
				   (still crying)
			I looked for you in my closet tonight.
				  (a little laugh)
			It's crazy, I don't know where you came
			from but. I like you.

					JEFFREY
			That's not crazy. I like you too.

Dorothy looks up.  They stare at each other for some time.

					DOROTHY
			I liked being with you last night.

					JEFFREY
			. same here.

There is a loud knocking on the door.

					DOROTHY
				(she starts to stagger)
			Oh shit.

					JEFFREY
				    (frightened)
			Frank? .can you stand up?

					DOROTHY
			I'm alright. go hide. This won't 
			take long. Be quiet.

Jeffrey gets in the closet and Dorothy closes the door.  She holds her 
head collecting her fragile self.  Dorothy goes to the door and opens it.
It's the Man with the Yellow Sports Coat - tonight he's wearing a purple 
sports coat and light blue double knit pants.  His eyes are glazed and his 
face is broken out in a sweat.

					YELLOW MAN
			Frank gone?

					DOROTHY
			Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin'
			back.

					YELLOW MAN
			Bull.

					DOROTHY
			Alright, suit yourself.

					YELLOW MAN
			He's comin' back?. What for?

					DOROTHY
				     (shaking)
			'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for.
			Frank's got you really loaded tonight.

					YELLOW MAN
				    (getting upset)
			Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you.
			and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't
			it. remember that. Your husband was the
			one who started fucking my mind with drugs.

					DOROTHY
			Oh he forced you, huh?

					YELLOW MAN
			He's the reformed dealer though who wanted
			to turn himself in. he's the one that caused
			Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real
			good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to
			be here watching you why can't I be here 
			fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the 
			size of a pin - let me give you the real 
			thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.

					DOROTHY
				 (cool, but real mad)
			No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank.
			I'm gonna tell him what you said.

					YELLOW MAN
			Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see. I'll get you.

Dorothy kicks the door after he closes it, then she chains it.  Jeffrey 
comes out of the closet.

					JEFFREY
				 (talking softly)
			Nice guy.  Who's he?

					DOROTHY
			Who's it, you mean.

SUDDENLY, Dorothy starts to shake and cry.

Jeffrey grabs her and shakes her and holds her tight to him.  She starts 
sobbing again.

					DOROTHY
				    (continuing)
			Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.

					JEFFREY
				(quietly, soothing her)
			There you go again. stop saying that.
			You can make it.

					DOROTHY
			I can't. I can't. You think you know 
			so much.

					JEFFREY
			Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?.
			Why are you in so much trouble?

Dorothy is sobbing and Jeffrey is holding her.  There is a long silence 
and she calms down.  

					DOROTHY
				   (whispering)
			I. don't. okay. Just don't. just be
			with me.
				(now very strangely)
			Oh God. Come with me. Who are you.
			Come up here.

Dorothy takes Jeffrey through the kitchen and out the back.

119. INT. BACK STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

. to a back stairway leading to the roof.

120. EXT. ROOFTOP - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The storm is closer and the dark clouds move violently in front of a full 
moon.  The wind continues to moan.  They move to the roof top and Dorothy 
leads Jeffrey through the chimneys to the edge of the building.  A very 
sad forlorn version of "Somewhere over the Rainbow" - creeps through the 
wind.

					DOROTHY
				 (as she stares down)
			Look.

					JEFFREY
				(turning to her quickly)
			No.

					DOROTHY
			(continuing to look down, her
    			 eyes widening - she whispers)
Falling.

					JEFFREY
			No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so
			much trouble?

He moves closer to her.

					JEFFREY
				    (continuing)
			Who is Don?

					DOROTHY
			      (very crazy and angry)
			Don?. Are you in with them?

					JEFFREY
                            (whispering)
			No. But you're in very big trouble.

					DOROTHY
			Why are you so interested? Why do you
			keep asking me?


					JEFFREY
			I came back to help you. You said do I
			let girls sneak into my house. You know
			where I live. if you need to. come to 
			where I live. O.K.?

					DOROTHY
			Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like
			me, huh?

					JEFFREY
			Yes.

					DOROTHY
				    (whispering)
			. or do you just want me? I'm going to let
			you enter me now.

					JEFFREY
			No. I should go.

					DOROTHY
			Please. please stay.

She makes him kiss her. he really likes it.  Once again, Jeffrey and 
Dorothy get VERY HOT.  Dorothy and Jeffrey lie down on the roof.  Dorothy 
cries out suddenly and bangs her head hard again and again against the 
roof.

					JEFFREY
			Why Dorothy?

We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper 
into it.

					DOROTHY
			Don? I have to make it hurt. I want
			there to be nothing again. Don!!!
				(as she slams her head 
        			 again and again)

She reaches up and clutches Jeffrey then pulls him down with a feverish 
kiss.  Lightening cracks above them and the wind howls.

FADE TO WHITE:

FADE DOWN TO:

121. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Jeffrey leaves the pool of light from a street light and walks into 
darkness.  He continues down the sidewalk.  He looks up at the starry sky.
The stars are so far away - the feeling is cold and lonely.

									DISSOLVE TO:

121A. 

Darkness: There are bell tones sounding, and as each one sounds pin points
of light appear on Mr. Beaumonts distorted dream face.  He is trying to 
speak.  He's trying to say "Jeffrey."

121B. 

Another dark image appears.  A robin sits in a tree at night.  Very close.
There is a slow low reverberating chirping sound.

121C.

Now Dorothy's apartment building at night.  A very low angle looking up 
to the roof.  Suddenly a pinpoint of red appears coming toward us from 
the roof.  It flies toward us very fast growing larger until we see it is 
a red high-heeled shoe.  As it fills the screen it becomes red lips of 
Dorothy's which open into a scream.

121D.

Jeffrey wakes in his room - terrified.

122. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey is talking with Aunt Barbara in the semi-dark living room.

					JEFFREY
			Will you tell Mom when she gets home from 
			the hospital that I've gone to dinner at
			Sandy Williams' house?

					AUNT BARBARA
			Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey.
			I think you've got termites in the house.

					JEFFREY
			Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?

					AUNT BARBARA
			I've seen a few.

					JEFFREY
			Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry
			about it. Look. I better go.

					AUNT BARBARA
			Okay honey.

Jeffrey leaves and Aunt Barbara moves about tapping on the walls.  She 
moves into a dark area and taps.  Something falls.  She reaches down.

In EXTREME CLOSEUP we see a termite walking by her shoe on the thick 
carpet.  Then in EXTREME CLOSEUP we see Aunt Barbara's fingers pinch the 
termite and bring it up in front of her thick glasses for a look.  She 
looks at the termite, then looks back at the walls.

We GLIDE ALONG the dark walls of the house.

									CUT TO:

123. INT. WILLIAMS' DINING ROOM - NIGHT

They all sit around the dining room table.  They have their heads bowed 
in a prayer before dinner.

					SANDY
			We thank you in the name of the Father, the
			Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

They start passing food around.

					MIKE
			Like I was saying. if you toss the ball like
			this, with your fingers just down here, that
			thing'll spin like a beauty. real straight.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
					  (teasing him)
			Yeah? Then how come nobody caught anything
			last week?.

					MIKE
				 (not laughing)
			'Cause we had a bad day.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			You play any sports, Jeffrey?

					JEFFREY
			No.

					MIKE
			Looks like you'd make a good runner.

					JEFFREY
			Well.

					MIKE
			I mean, you don't exactly have the build
			for a football. I mean. no offense.

Jeffrey looks around and sees Sandy looking at him.  She then gives a 
stern look to Mike.  Then Mike and Sandy both look at Jeffrey.

					JEFFREY
				   (not offended)
			No. you're right.

					MIKE
			I mean. some guys play anyway but they
			usually get slaughtered.

					JEFFREY
			Yeah, well I never wanted to get 
			slaughtered much.

					MIKE
				(not getting any humor)
			Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the
			point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			No, Mike. but there are vitamins in the
			food, you know.

Everyone laughs.

					MIKE
			Yeah, but I gotta supplement that. I gotta
			take a bunch of zinc too. The body is like
			a machine. EVERYTHING has got to stay in 
			perfect tune for perfect health. That's 
			what I'm interested in.

Sandy looks at Mike.

					MIKE
			Oh yeah. and a few other things.

Everyone laughs again.

					SANDY
			We've got some Heinekens.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Yeah. I like Bud myself.

					SANDY
			I'll get it. Mike, whatiya want?

					MIKE
			I guess another glass of water.

Sandy and Jeffrey share a look.

									DISSOLVE TO:

124. INT. WILLIAMS' BASEMENT - NIGHT

Mike and Sandy are sitting on a couch in the basement.  Jeffrey is sitting
on a chair nearby.  The television set is on.

					MRS. WILLIAMS
				    (calling downstairs)
			Who wants dessert? It's blueberry pie. and
			ice cream.

Jeffrey and Sandy say "yes."

					MIKE
			None for me, thanks.

Jeffrey looks over at Sandy.  Mike sees this.  There is more tension 
growing.

					MIKE
				 (referring to T.V.)
			What are watchin' this junk for?

					SANDY
			You can change it if you want to.

					MIKE
			I don't know why we have to watch T.V.

					SANDY
			Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come
			on.

Mrs. Williams comes downstairs carrying a tray with dessert.

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?

					JEFFREY
			That sounds great!

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a 
			minute.

Mrs. Williams goes back upstairs.  Jeffrey and Sandy start eating their 
dessert.  Sandy watches Jeffrey happily wolf down his pie.  Mike stands up.

					MIKE
			I'll be right back.

He leaves as if he's going to go upstairs.  Once around the corner he 
stops and listens to see what Jeffery and Sandy will say to one another.

					SANDY
			Well, how did it go?. What happened?

					JEFFREY
			Well. I've found out some things.
			nothing really for certain. There are some
			strange people involved.

					SANDY
			What did you see?

					JEFFREY
			Well.
			  (looking around, feeling funny)
			Maybe we should discuss this somewhere
			else. you know what I mean?

Just then, Mrs. Williams starts down with the coffee for Jeffrey.  
She sees Mike at the bottom of the stairs.  This seems strange to her.

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			Mike?. Are you alright?

Mike starts upstairs.

					MIKE
				   (mumbling)
			Yes.

Downstairs, Jeffrey and Sandy hear that Mike was close by.  Mrs. Williams 
and Mike pass on the stairs and Mrs. Williams enters the basement.  She 
throws Sandy a concerned look.  Just then, Mike calls downstairs.


					MIKE
			Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?

					SANDY
				   (calling up)
			Sure. just a sec.
				   (to Jeffrey)
			Excuse me.

125. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Upstairs, Mike is by the front door.

					MIKE
			Come on out a minute, okay?

					SANDY
			Okay.

They leave.

125A. INT. WILLIAMS' BASEMENT - NIGHT

Downstairs Mrs. Williams picks up some dishes.

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll
			get to the dishes.

					JEFFREY
			Sure thing. please don't worry about me.
			Can I help you with the dishes?

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly
			not. just relax and enjoy your coffee.
			I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.

Detective Williams comes to the top of the stairs and calls down.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Jeffrey?

					JEFFREY
			Yes?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			If you want to come up a minute, I'll show
			you some pictures.

126. INT. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS' STUDY - NIGHT

Jeffrey enters Detective Williams' study.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
					   (continuing)
			Take a look at these. These are the photos
			of the vacant lot where you found the ear.
			You might find them interesting.


Jeffrey begins going through the pictures.  They are 8 X 10 black and 
white prints.  Mostly they are pictures of weeds, but they look quite 
beautiful in an abstract way.  As he goes through them.

					JEFFREY
			These are beautiful. How's the case 
			coming?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Okay.

					JEFFREY
			Anything you can tell me?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			The criminals are winning.

					JEFFREY
			Is that why you say it's horrible?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Yes.

					JEFFREY
			I guess you've seen some bad things.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison
			your mind by telling you.

					JEFFREY
			Why do you do it?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			I won't let the bastards get me up against 
			the wall. It's an act of defiance.

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. I get it.

Suddenly Jeffrey sees something in the black and white photos.  A piece 
of cloth in the grass.  Carefully he asks.

					JEFFREY
			What is this? What color is it?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
				     (leaning over to see)
			Blue. It's Blue Velvet.

Sandy comes into her father's study looking upset.  Detective Williams 
puts the photos away.

					SANDY
			Can I use the car for a while?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Sure. What's up?

					SANDY
			I want to buy Jeffrey a Dairy Queen.

					JEFFREY
			A Dairy Queen?
				(he holds his stomach)
			Oh yeah? Sure, that sounds great.

									CUT TO:

127. INT. WILLIAMS CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

Jeffrey gets in and Sandy starts the car.  She pulls out.  They drive away.

					JEFFREY
			What's with Mike?

					SANDY
			He got a little jealous.

					JEFFREY
			I'm sorry, I didn't.

					SANDY
			It's okay. Don't worry about it.

The car glides along.

Jeffrey and Sandy smile at one another.  They drive on.

					SANDY
			You want a Dairy Queen?

					JEFFREY
			No way. I'm about to blow up.

128. INT. WILLIAMS CAR/CHURCH - NIGHT

Sandy laughs as she pulls the car curbside in a quiet street by a church.
The church pipe-organ music drifts softly into the night.

					SANDY
			You want to tell me about it?

					JEFFREY
			. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy.
			this is what I have found out. What I 
			think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens
			is married to a man named Don. they have
			a son. I think the son and the husband
			have been kidnapped by a man named 
			Frank who has now cut off both of Don's 
			ears. I think he is holding them to make 
			her do things for him. I think she wants 
			to die. the ears were for her a warning 
			to stay alive. there is another man 
			involved. I call him the "yellow man".
			you saw his back the other day in the hall 
			at her door. I don't know what he does but 
			I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. 
			Frank is a very dangerous man.

					SANDY
				    (quietly)
			Wow. Should you tell my father?

					JEFFREY
			I don't see how I can. and I can't prove
			any of this. I got all this information
			illegally. also it could get you in
			trouble.

					SANDY
			You saw a lot in one night.

					JEFFREY
			. Actually. I've been in twice.

					SANDY
				     (uneasy)
			Twice. without her sensing anything?

					JEFFREY
					(lying)
			Yes.

					SANDY
				    (pausing)
			Did you see her undressed?

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.

					SANDY
			Yeah?

					JEFFREY
			    (a searching, slight smile)
			That doesn't bother you, does it?

					SANDY
			Who, me? Why should it?

					JEFFREY
			     (seeing some jealousy and 
            		and happy for it)
			That's what I thought.

					SANDY
			You're sure right. It is a strange world.

					JEFFREY
			Why are there people like Frank. Why is
			there so much trouble in this world.?


					SANDY
			I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the
			night I met you.
				(she reflects silently on 
                         this before proceeding)
			. in the dream the world was dark because
			there weren't any robins. you know, birds.
			robins stood for love. and all of a sudden
			thousands of robins flew down and brought
			this blinding light of love. and it felt
			like that love would be the only thing that
			would make any difference. I guess. until
			the robins come there is trouble.

					JEFFREY
			Yeah I guess so.
			       (he turns to her)
			You're a neat girl.

					SANDY
			So are you.
				     (laughs)
			I mean you're a neat guy. We better
			get back.

					JEFFREY
			I guess so. you want to help me watch
			Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's
			place tomorrow. with a camera.

Sandy starts the car and pulls out into the street.  They begin driving 
back.

129. INT. WILLIAMS CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

					SANDY
			No, silly - I'm still in school you know.
			but I'll meet you after school and you 
			can tell me what you've learned. You better
			be careful, Jeffrey.

					JEFFREY
			I will.  I'll pick you up on the same 
			corner at three thirty-five, okay?

They pull up in front of Jeffrey's house.

					SANDY
			Okay. be careful.

					JEFFREY
			Okay, Sandy.

130. EXT. BEAUMONTS' HOME - NIGHT

Jeffrey gets out of the car.  He goes around to her side and looks down 
at her in the car.  She looks very beautiful.  He stands there for a 
moment.

					JEFFREY
			Can I give you a kiss good night?

					SANDY
				(pauses, trembling)
			You better not, Jeffrey.

					JEFFREY
			Okay. okay.

					SANDY
			Goodnight.

					JEFFREY
			See ya tomorrow.

Sandy slowly drives off.  Jeffrey watches her go then turns and goes 
inside his house.

131. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The house is very dark and quiet.  Jeffrey finds a note by the one table 
light is on.  The note is from his mother.  It reads, "Jeffrey hope you 
enjoyed yourself. See you at breakfast. Love Mom."  A postscript is written
on the note by Aunt Barbara.  "Jeffrey, honey, I found these. Love, Aunt 
Barbara."  Jeffrey sees that Aunt Barbara has left him two dead termites.  
He picks one up and studies it.  Again we see a huge CLOSEUP of a termite 
in the half-light.  Jeffrey shakes his head in amusement.

132. INT. JEFFREY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey paces nervously.  He picks up the phone and mouthing the numbers 
he dials Dorothy's number.  There is a "click" but no one speaks.  
Jeffrey instinctively speaks.

					JEFFREY
			Hello?

					FRANK (telephone V.O.)
			Speak to me Fucker.

Jeffrey hangs up immediately.  He's scared.

					JEFFREY
				   (to himself)
			Stupid!! So stupid. now she might be in
			even more trouble with Frank. I hope not.
			I hope not. tomorrow I have to find out
			more about Frank.

133. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY

Jeffrey has a camera taped and rigged to the dashboard aimed at the front 
door of Frank Booth's apartment building.  The camera is covered with a 
cardboard shoe box.  Jeffrey is eating a sandwich which was 
wrapped in wax paper and is waiting and watching.

A LADY steps out of the building and begins walking down the steps.  
Jeffrey reaches over and removes the shoe box and quickly takes two 
pictures.


We see a MAN walk down the street and turn up the steps.  Jeffrey shoots, 
but really only gets the back of the man.

JEFFREY
			Damn!

He replaces the cardboard box and continues eating.

									DISSOLVE TO:

134. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY

Later in the day.  Jeffrey sits waiting.  He looks at his watch.  It says 
2:00.

As he looks up he sees Frank getting out of a car with another man. the 
Yellow Man.  They head for Frank's building.  Jeffrey hurriedly removes 
the shoe box and begins snapping pictures.  They mount the steps and 
disappear within the old dark structure.

					JEFFREY
			Wow.

									DISSOLVE TO:

135. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY

Jeffrey's watch - the hand - time lapses around to 3:00.

					JEFFREY
			     (out loud to himself)
			Fifteen more minutes.

Just then, he sees movement and takes the box off the camera.  He starts 
shooting as TWO MEN come out the door.  It is the Yellow Man and a man who
is very well dressed with wavy hair and a mustache.  He carries an 
alligator-skin briefcase FRANK HAS DISAPPEARED.  Both are talking together 
and now laughing.  Jeffrey takes five or six pictures and then tries to 
cover the camera as they approach.  The box falls.  The Yellow Man looks, 
but Jeffrey gets the box back in time and pretends to be looking in the 
glove compartment.

The two men walk right by Jeffrey and get into the car behind his.  
Jeffrey decides to follow them.  He waits a few seconds and starts off.

136. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

They drive through town.

137. FACTORY BUILDING - DAY

. to a large factory building, park and go up a flight of metal stairs on the side of the building.  Jeffrey steps into the shadows and watches them.  At a metal landing they stop.  He sees them standing on their tip toes in order to see something in the distance.  The man with the alligator briefcase is laughing with the Yellow Man at what he sees.  He grips the Yellow Man on the shoulder.  Jeffrey cannot see what they see from his vintage point.  He looks at his watch. "3:25".

					JEFFREY
			You gotta wait for me Sandy. I'm on a real roll.

He quickly takes a picture of the two of them on the staircase.

138. EXT. ALLEY - DAY

. then he goes down an alley in the direction they were looking.  At the 
end of the alley he turns left and stops short.

139. EXT. COLD STORAGE COMPANY - DAY

He sees a crowd of people, an ambulance, and two police cars.  He walks 
closer.  Through the crowd he sees a broken window.  Hanging in the window
is a dead man.  Blood is dripping out of a huge wound to the head.

On the sidewalk in front of the building a woman is lying in shock.  
Her legs have been brutally broken and are angled back toward her head 
in horrible positions.  Jeffrey stands next to two black guys.  Suddenly 
one of the police officers start pushing everyone away.  Jeffrey turns to 
them.

					JEFFREY
			What happened?

					GUY #1
			He was blown away man. can't you see?

					GUY #2
			That cracker was the biggest dealer in 
			this section of the city, brother. the
			police are going to find more drugs in
			there than you can believe. It's a 
			speedball heaven in there.

					JEFFREY
			Oh yeah? What about the woman?

					GUY #1
			Probably just a whore he happened to be
			with at the time.

					JEFFREY
			Man oh brother.

					GUY #1
			This is the way the world is my man. take
			a good look.

Jeffrey takes a last look before checking his watch and hurrying off.

									CUT TO:

140. EXT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Jeffrey drives up to the corner where Sandy is standing.  She is 
frantically looking around.  Jeffrey stops for her.

					SANDY
			    (looking beyond the car)
			GO ON!!!. GO!

Jeffrey looks around.  A big FOOTBALL PLAYER is running up to a chain 
link fence across the street, but it's too late - Mike sees Jeffrey.  
Everything stops for a moment.  Then, Mike runs off.

					SANDY
			Oh great.

141. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Sandy goes around and gets in the car.

					SANDY
				   (continuing)
			You were late.

					JEFFREY
			I'm really sorry.

					SANDY
			What am I going to do?

					JEFFREY
			You want to go talk to him?

					SANDY
			Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do
			much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to 
			him later.

									CUT TO:

142. INT. DINER - DAY

Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting in the diner in a different booth, but 
having the same things as before.

					SANDY
			You know, that cheese is practically
			all chemicals.

					JEFFREY
			That's what makes it so good. You wanta
			hear what I saw today?

					SANDY
			Shoot.

					JEFFREY
			Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into 
			Frank's building, laughing with Frank.
			Now. the only trouble is. what does this
			prove?

					SANDY
				    (thinking)
			Nothing really, but it's interesting.
			they know each other. they seem to like
			each other.



					JEFFREY
			Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on 
			drugs. I think Frank supplies him.

					SANDY
			Oh yeah?

					JEFFREY
			Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out.
			This time with a well-dressed man with an
			alligator briefcase. They drove down this
			factory building and stood on a staircase
			looking at something in the distance. 
			Number three. now get this. In the distance
			was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death
			and a woman with her legs broken.

					SANDY
			Jeffrey!!

					JEFFREY
			Then these guys told me the police will
			find a huge amount of drugs inside the 
			dead man's place.

					SANDY
			I can't believe what you are finding out.
			Are you going to continue with this. Are
			you going back to her apartment?

					JEFFREY
			Yeah.

					SANDY
			Jeffrey?. Why?

					JEFFREY
			I'm seeing something that was always hidden.
			I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning.
			and it's all secret.

					SANDY
			You like mysteries that much?

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you.
			very much.

Jeffrey stands up and moves to her side of the booth.  They stare at each 
other.

					SANDY
			Oh yeah?

Jeffrey leans over and kisses her gently.  She pulls away.

					SANDY
			Don't. please, Jeffrey.

Jeffrey looks at her for a moment.

					JEFFREY
			You worry about me really?

					SANDY
			Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I
			worry. a lot. I got you into this.

									CUT TO:

143. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jeffrey winds his way up the staircase of Dorothy's apartment building.  
He hesitates before crossing to Dorothy's door.  He knocks on the door and 
Dorothy opens it.

					DOROTHY
			Come in.

					JEFFREY
			Hello.

144. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dorothy closes the door.  She chains it.

They kiss.  The kiss gets hotter.  The feeling begins.

They move down the hall to the back bedroom.  They've never made love 
there.  As they hurriedly undress Jeffrey sees the pointed child's hat 
with the propeller.  He picks it up and spins the propeller.  It makes a 
bit of music.  Dorothy shrieks as she lurches toward Jeffrey grabbing his 
hand, stopping him from turning the tiny propeller.  She gains some 
control of herself.  Jeffrey releases the hat into her hand.

					DOROTHY
			It used to make me laugh .but.

					JEFFREY
			I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.

					DOROTHY
			Yes. Frank-

					JEFFREY
			Frank is coming?

					DOROTHY
			No. how could he?. Don't go. You think
			I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.
					(crying)
			. don't hate me.

					JEFFREY
				   (very nervous)
			I sure don't hate you.

					DOROTHY
			I'm not crazy.
				     (thinking)
			I know the difference between right 
			and wrong.

					JEFFREY
			That's good.

Jeffrey moves to get out of bed.

					DOROTHY
				    (she poses)
			Do you like my body?

					JEFFREY
			Sure I do.

She moves closer to him, towards his back touching it with her tongue.  
She gets down in a pose and holds it.

					DOROTHY
			I'm a statue. you can feel me.you
			can do anything you want.

Jeffrey's hands find her flesh and move about.

									DISSOLVE TO:

Jeffrey and Dorothy are making love in her bed in almost total darkness.

					DOROTHY
				     (dreamily)
			What do you want to do?

					JEFFREY
			I'm doing it.

					DOROTHY
			Are you a bad boy?

					JEFFREY
			Whatiya mean?

					DOROTHY
			Do you want to do bad things?
				   (very dreamy)
			Anything. anything.

					JEFFREY
				  (whispering hot)
			What do you want?

					DOROTHY
			I want you to hurt me.

					JEFFREY
			No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you.
			I want to help you. I think I know some of
			what is happening to you. 
				  (she doesn't react)
			. Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son.
			Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do 
			something Dorothy. go to the police.


					DOROTHY
			No police!!!.
			 (pushing herself back against
			  the headboard; then frantic)
			No police!!

Suddenly, Dorothy gets very odd.  She turns into a little girl.  She has
a frightening little girl smile.

					DOROTHY
			You like to open me. don't you?

					JEFFREY
			Yes.

					DOROTHY
				(thinking with a grin)
			What if I told Frank that you opened me?

For just one quiet moment we see the stairway to Dorothy's apartment.  
It is empty.  Then back to Jeffrey and Dorothy.

					JEFFREY
			That wouldn't be too good, would it?

					DOROTHY
			Frank would open you.

					JEFFREY
			Okay. I know you've been scared. now you
			want to scare someone.

					DOROTHY
			    (smiles very strangely)
			Does that scare you?

					JEFFREY
			Shut up.

					DOROTHY
			Beeeee careful.

					JEFFREY
				  (scared and mad)
			Come on Dorothy.

					DOROTHY
			What if Frank came over here and found us?

The curtains in the kitchen bellow out with an eerie gust of wind.

					JEFFREY
			Look, snap out of it, will ya?

					DOROTHY
			Kiss me.

They kiss.



					DOROTHY
				    (continuing)
			Do you love me?

					JEFFREY
			Do you love me?

					DOROTHY
			I asked first.

					JEFFREY
			Sometimes I think I do.

					DOROTHY
			And sometimes you think you don't?! Well,
			get away then!

She bolts up.

					JEFFREY
			Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For
			cryin' out loud!

					DOROTHY
			Just get outta my bed.

She hits out at Jeffrey and strikes him in the face.  Jeffrey struggles 
with her to keep her from hitting him again but she breaks loose and slams
out at his face again.  He pushes back hard and her head actually hits the
wall.  She smiles through the pain.

					JEFFREY
			Oh God. are you alright.

She falls on him and smothers him with kisses.

					DOROTHY
			See. see how you hurt me? Now. Open
			me. enter me.

Jeffrey moves on top of her in the darkness.

We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper
into it.

					DOROTHY
			I love you Don with all my heart.

					JEFFREY
			No. it's not Don.

But he can't stop himself or her from making love.

					DOROTHY
			Come inside me. Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.
				   (very frantic)
			Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.

The movement subsides.  There is silence in the room, except for breathing.

					JEFFREY
			I didn't mean to hurt you.

					DOROTHY
			Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.

					JEFFREY
			You. what?

					DOROTHY
			You put your disease in me. your semen.
			it's hot and full of disease.

					JEFFREY
			There's no disease, I can tell you.

					DOROTHY
			Men are crazy. then they put their
			craziness into me. then it makes me
			crazy. then they aren't so crazy for
			awhile. then they put their craziness
			in me again.
				  (starts crying)
			. it's burning me. but I love you. I
			do, I do. Did you know that? Did you
			know that I love you?

					JEFFREY
				 (very apprehensive)
			I'm glad you do.

					DOROTHY
			There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in
			so much darkness though with things moving.
			there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing
			me and darkness is entering me. in every
			hole. It's opening me to a death.

					JEFFREY
			Dorothy. no!

					DOROTHY
				    (whispering)
			If I die, then they'll be free. It's 
			getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's
			a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm
			then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it 
			getting cold.

					JEFFREY
			You called me Jeffrey.

					DOROTHY
			I did. are you?

					JEFFREY
			Yes.

					DOROTHY
			Why are you here?
				(Jeffrey gets on top 
   				 of her again)
			Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.

					JEFFREY
			No. not really.
			     (they kiss - very hot)
			but also because I really want you 
			to be alright.

Dorothy stops and looks at him - she holds his face.  She starts to cry.

					DOROTHY
			You do .you really do.

She continues holding his face - looking in his eyes crying openly.  
he pulls him down to her.

					DOROTHY
			Jeffrey. Jeffrey. Jeffrey.

Jeffrey smiles.

					JEFFREY
			I guess I should go.

					DOROTHY
			I want you to stay with me.

					JEFFREY
			I think I better go.

146. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Later.  Jeffrey is dressed and Dorothy comes out of the bathroom in her 
robe.  She is combing her hair.  One or two lights are on now.  She looks 
at Jeffrey and smiles, brushes some of his hair back from his face.

					DOROTHY
			You're my special friend, aren't you?
				     (whispers)
			I have you inside of me still.
				     (big smile)
			It helps me. I need you.

Jeffrey doesn't know what to say.  He starts walking toward the door with 
Dorothy beside him.

					JEFFREY
					(lying)
			I'll call you.

					DOROTHY
			Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?

					JEFFREY
			What?

					DOROTHY
			I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.

					JEFFREY
			You look beautiful to me.

She pats her hips.

					DOROTHY
			Right in here. fat, fat, fat.

Dorothy takes the chain off the door and opens it.  The hall is empty.  
There is some noise on the stairs.  Suddenly, Frank and TWO FRIENDS of 
his come into view on the stairway.

					JEFFREY
				    (to Dorothy)
			Oh no.

					DOROTHY
			    (her eyes glaze over -
        		     she's gone again)
			No. 
				(calling out to Frank)
			Hi baby.

					FRANK
			Who's this fuck?

					DOROTHY
			He's a friend. from the neighborhood.
			we were just talking.

					FRANK
				   (to Jeffrey)
			From the neighborhood?
				     (slowly)
			Shut the fuck up.
				   (to Jeffrey)
			You like telephones? Huh?. You wanta go
			for a ride?

					JEFFREY
			No thanks.

					FRANK
			No thanks. what does that mean?

					JEFFREY
				 (very carefully)
			I don't want to go.

					FRANK
			Go where?

					JEFFREY
			On a ride.

					FRANK
			A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay,
			let's go. Hey, let's go.

Frank grabs Jeffrey and pulls him along.

					FRANK
			     (continuing to Dorothy)
			Come on. We're goin' for a joy ride.

147. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Frank takes Jeffrey on a wide-eyed terror walk down the stairway.

									CUT TO:

148. INT. FRANK'S CAR/CITY STREETS - NIGHT

Frank and Dorothy are in the front seat.  Jeffrey is sandwiched between 
two very dirty strange guys in the back.  Frank is driving very fast and 
very crazy.  Sitting next to him on the front seat is a police radio which 
periodically blares out police reports.  At the lights, when they turn 
green, Frank lays rubber.

					FRANK
			Where you wanna go? I know!. We gotta see
			Ben. We gotta, right?

					PAUL
				   (laughing)
			Yeah. we gotta see Ben. 

The car roars through a seedy street lined with bars and clubs.  Liquor 
and sex shop signs glow in hot neon colors.  They are blurred visions 
because of the speed of Frank's car.

Driving music plays.
Frank careens dangerously down various narrow streets, just barely making
turns.  The Ford bounces off several curbs.  Dorothy occasionally steals 
a glance back at Jeffrey.  She squeals out loud - sometimes with glee, 
mostly in fear.

Raymond and Paul laugh with Frank, yell out or light cigarettes.

149. EXT. "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT

Frank finally gets to where he's going - a corner bar - and skids to a 
hault.  They all pile out.  Frank grabs Jeffrey.

					FRANK
			Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine.
			Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.

					RAYMOND
			Okay Frank.

					FRANK
				   (to Jeffrey)
			What kinda beer do you like?

					JEFFREY
				   (just says it)
			Heineken.

					FRANK
			FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!

He grabs Jeffrey and pushes him into the bar.

150. INT. "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT

Moving fast now, they go through this dark frightening place.  Frank has 
Jeffrey by the neck forcing him faster.  In the back there is a black man 
fondling a white girl near a doorway.

151. INT. BACK ROOM - "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT

They go through the door to a back room.  A few naked girls are there near
beds with curtains around them.  One girl lies on her bed with dried vomit
around her head and pillow.  Suddenly Frank spots his friend Willard.  
He runs toward him violently and grabs him by the throat.

					FRANK
			Hey shithead. that's the last time I get
			you high and watch you freak out - 
			motherfucker you tore my coat and I lost
			my lucky piece of blue velvet, man.

152. 	INT. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS' STUDY - NIGHT

Frank pushes him down on the bed with the dried vomit whore.  They leave 
Willard.

154. INT. STAIRS AND LANDING - BEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

... and go up a flight of dirty wooden steps.  Frank bangs on a door at the 
first landing.  Raymond joins him with a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer.

					FRANK
			Hey Ben. OPEN UP. It's Frank.

A tall, slender man with a smoking jacket and a mustache opens the door.  
It's BEN.  His voice is very horse from years of smoking.

					BEN
				(very gracious)
			Frank. Come in.

					FRANK
			Hey, I brought some friends. and some
			beer.

					BEN
			Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.

155. INT. BEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The apartment is very large.  All the furniture is over-stuffed.  In 
the room there is a very much over-weight WOMAN dressed in black and a 
greasy-looking COUPLE.  On the couch, a YOUNG WOMAN plays with a large 
doll.

					FRANK
			   (getting higher all the time)
			Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker.
			You want some beer?

					BEN
				    (smiling)
			Certainly Frank.
				 (to the fat woman)
			Darling, get some glasses. We'll have 
			some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?

Everyone kinds of mills around.  Paul sits down in a chair and starts 
laughing at some private joke in his head.

					FRANK
			Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?

					BEN
			Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?

					FRANK
			Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know
			this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing,

			this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand
			fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.

					BEN
			Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh.
			here they are.

The Big Lady brings the glasses in and sets them on the card table.  
She looks worried.  She gives a helpless pleading look to Ben.

					FRANK
			Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?

					RAYMOND
			Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?

					FRANK
			No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes.
			pour the fuckin' beer.

					RAYMOND
			There ya go.

					FRANK
			Good, let's drink up.

					BEN
			To your health, Frank.

					FRANK
			Shit. let's drink to something else.
			let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's 
			to your fuck Frank.

					BEN
			If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck.
			cheers.

Frank's friends, Paul and Raymod, laugh.

					FRANK
				  (laughs loud)
			Cheers. Suave man. you're so fuckin'
			suave. WE LOVE BEN! Here's to Ben!.

Frank slaps Jeffrey in the face.

					FRANK
			Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.

					JEFFREY
			    (stunned, grabbing his face)
			Here's to Ben.

					FRANK
			Do you see, Ben?. I can make him do
			anything I fuckin' please.

Ben goes to Jeffrey.

					BEN
			Thank you neighbor. let me see your
			face. did he hurt you?

Jeffrey shows him.

					BEN
				  (continuing)
			Oh. my.

Suddenly Ben slugs Jeffrey in the stomach.  Jeffrey doubles over.

					BEN
				(continuing again)
			Is that any better?

Frank almost dies laughing.  Everyone else joins in.  Ben turns to Frank.

					BEN
			Frank, I have something for you. Excuse
			us everyone.

					FRANK
			EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see
			her kid.

As Jeffrey tries to catch his breath, he sees tremendous emotion fill 
Dorothy's face.  She rushes forward.  Raymond grabs her by the arm and 
takes her into another room.  Jeffrey hears her crying out.  He hears a 
small boy.

					DOROTHY (V.O.)
			Donny, oh my Donny.

					DONNY (V.O.)
			Mommy!

155A. INT. BACK ROOM - BEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dorothy is sobbing and clinging to Donny.  He is crying and gripping her 
like a small monkey would grip its mother.  Suddenly Donny breaks away, 
screaming.

DONNY
			Mommy. You left me. you stopped loving me.

					FRANK
			  (coming back into Ben's living room)
			Okay. let's hit the fuckin' road. we're
			givin' our neighbor a joy ride. let's get
			on with it. Bye, Ben. Ya wanna go on a 
			joy ride with us, anyone? You?
				 (looking around)

Dorothy rejoins the group.  She's in a state of shock.  Frank pinches her
cheek.

					FRANK
				   (continuing)
			No smile for Frank? No? Okay, fuck it.
			Let's go. Oh you wanna come with Raymond?

Raymond has picked up the greasy girl.

					BEN
			See you Tuesday, Frank.

					FRANK
			Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck
			anything that moves.

156. EXT. "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT

They leave and pile back into the car.

157. INT. FRANK'S CAR/CITY STREETS - NIGHT

Now there are four in the back.  Raymond starts necking with the Greasy 
Girl.  They speed on into the night.  Frank drives through various dark 
streets.

158. INT. FRANK'S CAR/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

. then out onto a highway and goes over 100 mph down a two-lane highway.

					FRANK
				   (to Jeffrey)
			Hey? . You like to walk.

					JEFFREY
			What?

					FRANK
			Let's take our neighbor out. Let him
			fuckin' walk back.
				     (laughs)

As Frank is driving Jeffrey sees Dorothy nervously look at the road and 
surrounding countryside, then questioningly at Frank.  She senses something
about where they are going.

					DOROTHY
			Where are we going, Frank?

					FRANK
			Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to 
			the country. maybe something for you too.

					DOROTHY
				   (very anxious)
			Frank?

					FRANK
			You want to see him too, right?

					DOROTHY
			Yes, but.

					FRANK
			Then, shut up!

Frank sees Dorothy look back at Jeffrey.


					FRANK
				   (continuing)
			Hey. What's this fuck got to do with
			anything.

159. INT. FRANK'S CAR/DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

Frank angrily swerves the car off onto a small dirt road bouncing down 
it, screeching to a halt near an orchard of trees.  He turns violently 
around to Jeffrey.

					FRANK
			What are you lookin' at?

					JEFFREY
			Nothing.

					FRANK
			   (locks eyes with Jeffrey; 
      		    long pause)
			Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see
			the whites of the eyes.
				(takes helium)
			You like me?.

Jeffrey is quiet.

					FRANK
				 (still high voice)
			Look at these. What are these?

					DOROTHY
			Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.

Frank is doing something to Dorothy's chest but Jeffrey can't see.

					FRANK
			Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE
			THESE?

					DOROTHY
			Those are my breasts.

					FRANK
			Can I feel 'em?

					DOROTHY
			If you want to.

Frank takes helium.

					FRANK
			Baby wants to pinch 'em.

She winces and tries to pull away.

					FRANK
				   (continuing)
			What's the matter? Give 'em back. They're
			just a little red, that's all. let me feel
			'em again. Come here.

Frank pulls her over and starts to pinch her again.  It really hurts her 
and she is frightened and in pain.

					JEFFREY
			Hey. leave her alone.

Frank pretends not to hear Jeffrey and pinches Dorothy's breasts real hard.
She stifles a scream.  Jeffrey gets mad.  He hits Frank hard in the face. 
Everyone is deadly silent as Frank turns to Jeffrey.  Frank stares at 
Jeffrey.

					FRANK
			NEXT! . out of the car fuck. HELP HIM
			OUT, RAYMOND!!

160. EXT. FRANK'S CAR/DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

Frank gets out and presses his face against the rear window.  His distorted
face is hideous.  He opens the back door.  Raymond and Paul grab Jeffrey 
and pull him out of the car.  The Greasy Girl laughs nervously.

					DOROTHY
			Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him
			alone. come on. He didn't mean it.

					FRANK
			Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.
				    (takes gas)
			. Hey, pretty, pretty.

Dorothy doesn't move fast enough so Frank dumps her whole purse out on the
front seat and grabs the lipstick and a flashlight.  He puts lipstick 
heavy onto his lips.

While Raymond and Paul hold Jeffrey.  Frank kisses Jeffrey all over the 
mouth.  Jeffrey tries to hit Frank and pull away, but Raymond and Paul 
have a hold of him.  Jeffrey looks very strange with these big blotches 
of red lipstick on his face and mouth.

					DOROTHY
			LEAVE HIM ALONE!! FRANK!!

Frank slams the front door shut to muffle Dorothy.  He grabs Jeffrey and 
presses his frightened face against the front window.  Then, the back 
window.  Then, he flops Jeffrey up on the hood with Paul's help and presses
Jeffrey's face against the rear window.  Inside the car, this show is 
crazy and scary.  Then, Frank takes Jeffrey over to the side of the car 
again.

					FRANK
				   (to Jeffrey)
			You're fuckin' lucky to be alive.
			LOOK AT ME!

Raymond pulls Jeffrey's face back so he's looking at Frank.  Dorothy and 
the Greasy Girl watch in terror.



					FRANK
			Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm 
			gonna send you a love letter. straight
			from my heart, fucker. You know what a 
			love letter is? It's a bullet. straight
			from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love
			letter from me, you're fucked forever.
			Understand, Fuck?

					JEFFREY
			Yes.

					FRANK
			I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!

Frank takes a small square of blue velvet out of his pocket and begins 
feeling Jeffrey's face with it.

					FRANK
			 (continuing; breathing heavily)
			You feel good. feel my muscles.

Raymond makes Jeffrey raise his arm and Jeffrey feels Frank's biceps.

					FRANK
				  (continuing)
			You like that? 
                     (to Raymond and Paul)
			Hold him tight for me.

Suddenly Frank starts hitting Jeffrey in the face.  Dorothy screams at the
car window.

CUT TO BLACK:

NO SOUND. THEN A MOAN.

JEFFREY'S P.O.V. of rocks on the ground.

He slowly picks up and looks around.  The car is gone.  He is swollen, 
bloody, and covered with lipstick.  His pants have been pulled down and 
"FUCK YOU" has been written with lipstick on his legs.

He struggles to his feet and pulls his pants up.  He fastens his belt 
and begins limping up the dirt road highway.

He rounds the corner and steps inside the office, when he stops short with
fear.  Detective Williams is not there, but sitting at a desk next to 
Detective Williams' desk is the Yellow Man.  Their eyes lock.

Jeffrey freezes.

					JEFFREY
			Excuse me.

Jeffrey turns away as quickly as possible and goes over to a water cooler
and gets a drink, keeping his back to the Yellow Man.  He shakes with 
fear.  He slowly turns around.  The Yellow Man is studying some papers on
his desk.

Again the Yellow Man looks up.  This time he is slightly suspicious and he
cooks his head.  Jeffrey cannot move.

Finally, Jeffrey is able to step away.  As he leaves the Yellow Man's line
of sight, Jeffrey catches the names on the door.

179. EXT. WILLIAMS HOME - NIGHT

Jeffrey walks through the darkness, carrying the photos.  He stops in 
front of Detective Williams' house and hesitates.  Jeffrey's face has a 
troubled look.  He approaches the front door.

He hesitates again before finally knocking.  Detective Williams answers 
the door.  Sandy is in the background.  When she sees the look on Jeffrey's
face, she knows why he's there.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Jeffrey! Come on in.

					JEFFREY
			Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you,
			but I've got to talk to you.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a 
			bad face lift.

					JEFFREY

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Okay?

					JEFFREY
			Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered
			some things. .Anyway I have to show you
			some pictures and tell you some things 
			about them. The first picture is this.

He shows him the picture of Frank and studies Detective Williams' face as 
he sees it.



					JEFFREY
				    (continuing)
			This is Frank Booth. His address is on
			the back of the photo. He, in my opinion,
			is very sick and dangerous. This photo 
			here is of Frank with another man as they
			went into Frank's apartment.

Jeffrey casually hands the photo over and watches Detective Williams' face 
extra carefully.  Detective Williams doesn't flinch, yet his eyes slowly 
glide upwards to meet Jeffrey's.

					JEFFREY
				    (continuing)
			And that man came out with a third man - 
			this well-dressed guy. here's the photo.
			I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is
			in trouble with these people. I think
			Frank has taken her husband and her son.

					JEFFREY
				    (continuing)
			I have no hard proof of any of this. Her
			address is also on the photos. I think
			these people are involved with drugs. and
			murder. I think Frank is killing drug
			dealers and.
			     (he decides not to tell Detective 
  				Williams everything)
			. and somehow Frank is getting all their
			drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly
			more involved in this than you wanted me
			to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to
			tell you about these things in case it 
			could help.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get
			so involved?

					JEFFREY
			I can't tell you the whole story. I. I
			took it upon myself. I can't say more.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Is Sandy part of this?

					JEFFREY
			No. not at all.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
				    (referring to the photos)
			Who knows you have these?

					JEFFREY
			Only you. and the photo lab.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			You're all through with this now?


					JEFFREY
			Yes sir. I sure am.

Detective Williams studies Jeffrey, then the photos.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			For now. Alright. you better be. And
			Sandy better not be involved with this,
			I can tell you. Be prepared to come in 
			for further interrogation on this later.

					JEFFREY
			Yes sir.

Jeffrey leaves the study.

182. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

In the living room, Jeffrey looks at Sandy.

					SANDY
			Everything okay?

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him
			some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?

					SANDY
			You didn't tell him about me?

					JEFFREY
			No.

Detective Williams comes out of his study and sees the two of them talking.
He sees some nervousness.  Sandy quickly changes the subject.

					SANDY
			I should never had gotten you going on this.
				(changing, smiling)
			Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!

			Okay. great!

Jeffrey is driving over to Sandy's.

He has to park across the street because a police car is sitting in front
of the Williams' house.  Its lights are slowly revolving on top. The engine
idles. a Man is inside. his head down, studying some papers.

Jeffrey barely notices all this, as he heads for the door.

Mrs. Williams answers the door and Sandy is behind her in the dining room.

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			Hello, Jeffrey. Come in.

187. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey enters and crosses the room to Sandy.

					JEFFREY
			You all set?

Detective Williams comes in arranging some papers which he begins placing
in a briefcase on the dining room table.  Just then a man comes up to the
door which is still open.  Jeffrey turns to see.  It is Detective 
T.R. Gordon, the Yellow Man.  All the color instantly drains from 
Jeffrey's face.

					YELLOW MAN
				    (yelling inside)
			Hey John - get a move on!!

Detective Williams turns.  He sees Detective Gordon.  He turns again.  He 
sees Jeffrey's expression.  Sandy hasn't seen it yet.

Detective Williams goes to Jeffrey.  He looks him straight in the eye.  He
also positions himself between Jeffrey and T.R. Gordon.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Easy does it Jeffrey. Behave yourself.
			don't blow it.

Sandy becomes curious and moves over to Jeffrey and her father.  Jeffrey 
decides to trust Detective Williams.  The Yellow Man (T.R. Gordon) yells 
again.

					YELLOW MAN
			Come on John, get it in gear pal!

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			So long Jeffrey. You two have a nice
			night, okay?


					JEFFREY
			Okay.

					SANDY
			What is it?

					JEFFREY
			Just some fatherly advice.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			That's right.

Jeffrey and Sandy head for the door.  The Yellow Man's and Jeffrey's eyes
meet once more.  The Yellow Man cocks his head. thinking.  No recognition.

					SANDY
				 (to her mother)
			Goodnight mom.
			     (to the Yellow Man)
			Goodnight Tom.

					T.R. GORDON-YELLOW MAN
			Goodnight, Sandy.

188. EXT. WILLIAMS HOME - NIGHT

Jeffrey starts the car and pulls out.

					SANDY

			It's good to see you.

					JEFFREY
			Where to?

					SANDY
			Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista.
			It's not far. Can you tell me any more
			about what you learned?

					JEFFREY
			I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell
			you about it sometime.

					SANDY
			It's okay.

					JEFFREY
			... You look beautiful.

					SANDY
			Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the 
			evening?

					JEFFREY
			I like that idea. that's a real good idea.

									CUT TO:

190. INT. PARTY BASEMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey and Sandy go downstairs to a basement which is dark and crowded 
with kids dancing and talking.  Jeffrey and Sandy are holding hands.  
Jeffrey feels a little out of place.

A COUPLE OF GIRLS raise their eyebrows and give approving looks to Sandy.
The music is loud, fast dancing music.

					SANDY
			You want to dance?

					JEFFREY
			I can't dance fast.

					SANDY
			Really?

					JEFFREY
			Really. you want to dance with someone
			else?

					SANDY
			NO.

					JEFFREY
			Let's wait for some slow one.

					SANDY
			Just a minute.

Sandy leaves Jeffrey for a moment and Jeffrey watches her make her way 
through the crowd to a GIRL by the record player.  Sandy confers with the
girl.  Sandy comes back to Jeffrey.

					SANDY
			Don't worry. I took care of it. You
			want something to drink?

Just then, the music goes slow.

					JEFFREY
			You want to dance?

					SANDY
			Okay.

They begin to dance.  At first, further apart, then, they make the mistake
of looking in each other's eyes and they move very close together.  
They move around to another look.  Then they kiss.  They kiss for the 
entire rest of the song.  Between songs and during the entire next song.  
They finally, as they say, come up for air.

					SANDY
			I love you, Jeffrey.

They kiss again.  Then they dance and look at each other.  Then they hug
each other.  As they hug, Jeffrey closes his eyes.

					JEFFREY
		               (inner voice)
			I really do love you.

									DISSOLVE TO:

191. INT. PARTY BASEMENT - NIGHT

Later.  Jeffrey gives Sandy a little kiss while they're over by the cokes.  They're having a drink.  Sandy introduces Jeffrey to some of her friends.  She is very proud of him.  They are both very happy.  They look at each other and kiss again.

									DISSOLVE TO:

193. INT./EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

Later.  The party is breaking up.  Kids are beginning to go upstairs and go out the front doors to their cars.  Jeffrey and Sandy are coming up stairs arm in arm.  They say goodnight to the PARENTS in the living room and leave through the front door.  They can't take their eyes off one another.  They are totally oblivious to the THREE GUYS in a car across the street.

As soon as Jeffrey gets Sandy and himself in his car, he starts it and moves off.  

194. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

The dark car comes to life with a loud low roar and peels out with a 
scream.  It follows Jeffrey and Sandy for a way, then it roars up behind 
them swaying back and forth, honking its horn and trying to ram Jeffrey's 
car in the rear.

Jeffrey looks frantically in the rear view mirror.  Sandy turns around in
fear.  Jeffrey guns his car and races down the street.

					SANDY
			Oh my God. What's wrong?

					JEFFREY
			Frank!!

He swerves around the corner.  Up ahead, a car is pulling out of a 
driveway.

					JEFFREY
                     (continuing; referring 
                      to the car ahead)
			Come on. MOVE IT!

Jeffrey swings hard around another corner and heads up a dark street, 
passing "Lincoln St."

					JEFFREY
			I can't outrun this guy.

He floors the car and flies down another street very fast.

					JEFFREY
			My father has a gun at home.

					SANDY
			No.

					JEFFREY
			Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise
			you.

Sandy turns back to take a look.  Jeffrey swerves the car again; he bangs
it off a curb as he rounds a corner.  A hub cap goes flying off rolling
noisily down the street.

					SANDY
			Try to get to my house. then my father
			can.

CLOSEUP ON JEFFREY

195. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

FLASHBACK

He remembers Detective Gordon, the Yellow Man, at Sandy's house.

196. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

					JEFFREY
			No!!

Jeffrey floors the car again. but the car behind him is fast and gains 
on him.  It swerves back and forth in the rear view mirror.  Now it 
swerves and roars up alongside Jeffrey's car.  Sandy screams.

					SANDY
			It's Mike! It's Mike!

Jeffrey looks over.  It is Mike.  Out of enormous sense of relief he 
starts laughing.  He slows instantly and so does Mike.

197. EXT. BEAUMONTS' HOME - NIGHT

He pulls slowly up in front of his house, his head back laughing.  Mike 
swerves his car in front of Jeffrey's and jumps out.

					MIKE
				(out of the car; very drunk)
			Hey come here, you stole my girl, you
			bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right
			in front of your stupid house.

					SANDY
			... Stop it Mike.


					MIKE
                           (to Sandy)
			You shut up. nobody's talkin' to you.
			Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?

Everyone turns and looks.  Slowly out of the darkness comes a nude woman.  It is Dorothy.  She is totally in shock, bloody saliva is dripping from her mouth.  She is bloody, swollen and bruised all over.  She is totally different, drained of her sexuality.  She has been ravaged.

					JEFFREY
			Dorothy! ... Dorothy!

					SANDY
			Dorothy Vallens?

					JEFFREY
			Yes.

He jumps out of the car, gets a hold of her and helps her back.  Mike 
comes after him.

					MIKE
                        (going for Jeffrey)
			Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!

					JEFFREY
	                  (pushing Mike off)
			Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone
			who's hurt here, in case you haven't 
			noticed.

					SANDY
			Mike, go home.

Mike's friends are dazed, watching Dorothy staggering beside Jeffrey.  
Mike steps back as Jeffrey puts Dorothy in the car.  Jeffrey stands back
up and glances at Mike.

					MIKE
                       (dull, very drunk)
			Hey, I'm sorry. Hey.

Jeffrey gets into the car.

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. okay, Mike.

Jeffrey shuts the door.  Dorothy is sandwiched between him and Sandy in 
the front seat.

					SANDY
			Take her to my house. My dad can get an
			ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have
			anything to put around her?

					JEFFREY
     				  (starts the car)
			No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at
			your house?

					SANDY
			Probably not. no. Why?

					JEFFREY
			OK. Let's get her over to your father's.

					SANDY
                   (looking quickly from 
                    Dorothy to Jeffrey)
			Right. Watch out for Mike, there.

Mike and his friends are getting in Mike's car.  Mike is trying to start 
the engine.  He does and clumsily throws the car in reverse.  He screeches
out and screeches to a stop.  Then he guns away forward and shoots crazily
down the road.

					JEFFREY
			Here we go.

They drive off.

198. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

					DOROTHY
				   (looking over)
			Oh God. Jeffrey is that you?

Sandy looks at Jeffrey questioningly.

					JEFFREY
			Yeah, it's me.

					DOROTHY
			Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.

Sandy is confused. how do they know each other?

			Is Dad home?

					MRS. WILLIAMS
				    (shocked at sight)
			No.

					SANDY
			You better call him and get an ambulance
			too.

Dorothy is clinging to Jeffrey.  Mrs. Williams goes to call.

Sandy moves closer.  Jeffrey looks at Sandy and she returns the look.

					DOROTHY
				      (crazy)
			Where have you been?
				     (screams)
			Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey,
			Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. 
			Oh God.

					JEFFREY
			It's okay. it's okay.

					DOROTHY

			My secret lover.

Mrs. Williams comes in.

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			The ambulance will be here in a minute. 
			I left word for John. The police are on

					DOROTHY
                             (screams)
			Don't get the police. Oh God, ...Jeffrey
			I CAN'T STAND IT!! STOP IT. STOP IT.
			LOVE ME,

She looks up at Mrs. Williams.

					DOROTHY
                            (continuing)
			I opened myself to him. He put his 
			disease in me.

She presses herself tight to Jeffrey.

					DOROTHY
                            (continuing)
			Tell me its okay. I opened myself to
			you. Okay, okay, okay, okay?

Mrs. Williams watches with confusion and worry for the hurt this is 
causing Sandy.  Sandy is crying now and turns away.

					JEFFREY
			Sandy? ...Sandy, please.

					MRS. WILLIAMS
			I'll get a coat for her. 

She leaves the room hurriedly.

					SANDY
				     (crying)
			Jeffrey? .What's going on?


					JEFFREY
			Shh. I'll tell you.

					DOROTHY
				     (quietly)
			They hurt his head.

					JEFFREY
			Who, Dorothy?

					DOROTHY
				     (whispers)
			Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!

A huge, roaring wind sound comes up.

Dorothy starts screaming.

201. EXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE - NIGHT

The SCREAMS DISSOLVE INTO a SIREN as it roars to a stop in front of the 
Williams' house.

202. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Dorothy clings to Jeffrey.  Her eyes are turning a dull, milky white.  The
effect is horrifying.  She is in shock.

Sandy is still crying, while she moves back and watches Jeffrey.  Jeffrey
turns to look at Sandy.

					SANDY
				     (crying)
			I still love you Jeffrey.

Mrs. Williams comes to put a coat around Dorothy.  Mrs. Williams is 
shaking.

The Paramedics enter the house.

									DISSOLVE TO:

203. EXT. WILLIAMS' HOUSE - NIGHT

The PARAMEDICS are loading Dorothy into the ambulance on a stretcher.  
Dorothy is moaning.  A sickening, warm wind comes up and howls through the

					SANDY
			Go ahead.

					JEFFREY
			... Sandy?.

					SANDY
			Go ahead!

Jeffrey turns slowly and gets into the ambulance.

INT. AMBULACE - NIGHT

Jeffrey's head is very close to Dorothy's.  Dorothy is saying something, 
mumbling.

					DOROTHY
			Hold me, Don.

					JEFFREY
			Don?. Where is he?

                      focus on Jeffrey)
			HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!

					JEFFREY
			I promise, Dorothy. I promise.

					DOROTHY

She bolts up screaming directly into Jeffrey's face.  Her beaten face and milky eyes are a study in horror.

Driving through the night.

208A. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jeffrey arrives at Dorothy's apartment building and pays the driver.  
He gets out of the cab and looks around.  No police.  Quiet.  The 
building looks just the same standing there in the dark.  The dim lights 
in the front entrance.  Jeffrey moves up to the front doors and enters.  
No one.

									CUT TO:

209. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS' STUDY - NIGHT

Sandy is trying to get her father on the police radio.

					SANDY
				 (over the radio)
			No. he only wants my father to come over.
			It's very important. he said someone was
			hurt and he wants Detective Williams there.
			well, find him!!

210. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jeffrey slowly climbs the stairs.  His shoes squashing the carpet make 
mall crushing sounds as he climbs higher into the building.

He arrives at the Seventh Floor and stops.  A high-pitched whine can be 
heard faintly.  It gets louder as Jeffrey crosses to Dorothy's apartment 
door.  He gets his key out and inserts it.  Turns it.  With a loud click 
the door swings open and the high whine becomes piercing.  He sees 
something and jumps back.

211. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

It is Detective Gordon, the Yellow Man, standing in the center of the room.

FLASHBACK

He plays the look into the apartment again in his mind and again.

CLOSER ON DETECTIVE GORDON

Something is wrong with him.  He is bleeding from the head.  He stands 
almost motionless. in shock.

Jeffrey peers into the room again.  He enters carefully and lets the door 
close behind him.  He very cautiously moves forward into the room.  Slowly
he moves closer to a hideous sight.  Standing in the middle of Dorothy's 
apartment is T.R. Gordon, the Yellow Man.  He is in an extreme state of 
shock.  He is bleeding badly from a huge wound at the top left of his head.  His eyes focused on something only his twisted inner mind see.  Sitting in one of Dorothy's chairs is a dead man with no ears. only half-healed bloody wounds at each side of his head.  A bullet hole in the center of his forehead.  The T.V. is crushed in but it is turned on and it is the television that produces the high electrical whine.  Jeffrey moves forward again and kicks the television cord out of the wall.  The high whine stops instantly.  Silence except for the Yellow Man's labored breathing.

Suddenly there is a loud "radio voice" coming from the Yellow Man's police
radio which is turned "on" in his jacket pocket.  Jeffrey's heart leaps 
and just as suddenly the Yellow Man throws his arms out wildly knocking a 
floor lamp to the ground and crushing out its light.  Jeffrey's heart goes
wild at this sight and he jumps back but the Yellow Man is silent and 
motionless again.  The radio talks again.

					RADIO VOICE #1
			Get back and stay down.

					RADIO VOICE #2
			. It's apartment eight.

Music. LOVE LETTERS STRAIGHT FROM MY HEART. begins to play.  
Jeffrey watches the Yellow Man and listens to the radio.

					RADIO VOICE #2
					 (continuing)
			I'm sending Jack and Pete to the roof.
			It's.

					RADIO VOICE #1
			Hey.

Sounds of shots.

					RADIO VOICE #1
					 (continuing)
			He's shooting. from the second window.

					RADIO VOICE #3
			Stay in place.

					RADIO VOICE #2
			Jack. get up there quick. can return
			fire?.

					RADIO VOICE #3
			I think he's alone. but return fire to
			second window only.

Many shots.

We see Jeffrey's face in CLOSEUP.

									CUT TO:

212. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT

The real scene is before us.  Police cars line the street along with a 
huge fire truck and several ambulances.  Special police marksmen are 
crouched behind cars and behind a stone wall opposite Frank's building.  
Screams are heard from within and police radios blare.  Shots are being 
fired into a black window.  Once in a while a shot is returned.  Two 
policeman are dead and one is being loaded onto an ambulance.

					POLICEMAN #1
			He hasn't fired a shot for six minutes.
			maybe we got him. get on the radio. get
			Detective Williams. ask him if we can
			rush the son of a bitch.

A policeman runs off. more shots are fired into the building but none 
are returned.  The policeman comes running back.

					POLICEMAN #2
			It's in the works already. we're in 
			there. they're goin' down the back stairs 
			now. It won't be long. and they'll have
			us rush 'em from here. one whistle and
			we go.

Suddenly there is a long barrage of gunfire into Frank's apartment.  
Then a loud whistle.

					POLICEMAN #1
			That's it. let's go.

Police race across the street to Frank's building.

213. INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Police kick the door in and rush into the apartment.  It's empty excpt for
a large dog which has been shot.  The dog growls and cowers back in a 
corner.  Every now and then it limps on bloody legs back and forth.

214. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey hears the radio.  He hears the policemen talking at Frank's place.  He hears that Frank is gone.  He decides to leave Dorothy's apartment.

					JEFFREY
			 (speaking to T.R. Gordon who doesn't
			  hear him because he's almost dead)
			I'm leaving now. I'll let them find you
			all on their own. find all this horror
			on their own.
				     (whispers)
			Good bye.

He goes out and closes the door.

215. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The door clicks shut.  He makes his way quietly down the hall to the 
stairway. thinking.  He starts down the stairs.

					JEFFREY
			So. Frank escaped.

He rounds the corner on a landing on the stairway and goes down another 
floor. and another.  At the next landing, something out the window catches
his eye.  He notices a man get out of the car.  He recognizes the man.  
It is the well-dressed man he saw with the alligator briefcase.  Jeffrey 
watches the man come toward Dorothy's building.  Then his eye goes back 
to the man's car.  It is Frank's car.  He notices the man is carrying a 
police radio.

					JEFFREY
				    (to himself)
			Frank's car. Is this man a cop? He has a 
			radio!. So did Frank though and he's no
			cop. that's for sure. and he's driving 
			Frank's car. who is he?

The man enters the building at the front entrance directly below Jeffrey.

Jeffrey starts climbing back up the stairs. thinking faster.

					JEFFREY
			What happened that day?.

216. EXT. FRONT STREET - DAY

219. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

					JEFFREY
			and out came. No it couldn't be. But I
			think it is!! It's Frank!!

Jeffrey runs like mad up to Dorothy's apartment.  He looks back once and 
sees the well-dressed man hurrying up the stairs.

CLOSEUP on well-dressed man's face. It is Frank, underneath a very good 
disguise.

Jeffrey has trouble getting the key out of his pocket.  He fumbles with it
and it drops to the floor.

Frank climbs the stairs.

Finally the key goes in and Jeffrey frantically opens the door.  He rushes
into the room.

220. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The horror and strangeness of the scene within strikes him again.  He 
rushes to the Yellow Man and takes the police radio out of his pocket.  
He runs into the back of the apartment - to the back bedroom where he 
crouches down behind a double bed.

					JEFFREY
				  (into the radio)
			Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
				         (over radio)
			Detective Williams here. Is that you,
			Jeffrey?

					JEFFREY
			Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up 
			to Dorothy's apartment.
			     (thinks; hits himself in the
                              forehead; inner voice)
                        Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing
                        everything we say!!
			      (thinks some more - fast)
			Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the 
			apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back
			bedroom.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			We're ten minutes away and moving as fast
			as we can.

221. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

Sandy runs frantically down a dark street.  We see a street sign which 
says "Lincoln."

222. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey drops the radio under the bed and runs back to the living room.  
He leaps safely into the closet just as Frank opens the apartment door and
enters.  Jeffrey freezes with fear in the darkness of the closet.  Frank 
is smiling.

					FRANK
			 (calling pleasantly in the direction 
  of the back bedroom)
			Hey neighbor. shit for brains. You forgot
			I have a police radio. I know where your
			cute little butt is hiding. Here I come!
			Ready or not!

He starts down the hall to the back bedroom.  The police radio which 
Jeffrey planted under the bed and Frank's radio both start broadcasting. 
Frank turns his radio off - now only the one under the bed plays.

					FRANK
			Hey fuck. I can hear you radio! .Hey
			you stupid fuck. you got about a 
			second to live.

Jeffrey watches Frank reach inside his coat for his gun.  He watches Frank
sneak to the back bedroom area.  Jeffrey turns and looks at the Yellow 
Man.  He gets an idea. He quickly rushes out of the closet - feels inside 
the Yellow Man's coat for his police gun.  It's there.  He gets it but it 
causes the Yellow Man to moan and leap some in another almost death-spasm.  Jeffrey takes the bloody pistol and races back inside the closet frantically catching his breath.  Just then he hears Frank in the back room.

					FRANK (V.O.)
			           (helium voice)
			Hey pretty pretty.

Jeffrey then hears three or four shots - deadly sounding coming from a 
pistol with a silencer attached.

					FRANK (V.O.)
			Hey fuck, where are you?

Jeffrey sees a furious Frank come storming out of the back room and come 
slowly up the hall - directly toward him.

Jeffrey raises his pistol - very slowly.  Frank enters the living room.  
He looks around.  The Yellow Man moans.  Frank makes a face and blasts the 
remainder of the Yellow Man's head away and this time the Yellow Man falls
dead to the floor.  Jeffrey tenses in the silence which hangs in the air.  Frank looks to the kitchen. all around the living room.  He looks at the closet.  He smiles - he slowly goes right toward Jeffrey - smiling.  Jeffrey points the pistol.  His finger moves to the trigger.  He squints his eyes.  He doesn't want to kill a man. any man.  Frank comes right to the closet door and throws it open, when Jeffrey hears Sandy scream.

					SANDY (V.O.)
			Jeffrey!!

Frank and Jeffrey lock eyes as Jeffrey pulls the trigger.  He yells Sandy's
name and Frank's head is blown off.

We see Sandy's frightened face.  We see policemen racing up the stairs in 
Dorothy's apartment.

223. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

We see cop cars with lights revolving, radios blaring.

224. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

The large room is crowded with policemen and members of the F.B.I.  
Everyone is talking excitedly.  Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting by Detective
Williams in wooden chairs near the center of the room.  We hear bits of 
conversation.

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
				         (to Jeffrey)
			Because of your information I alerted
			internal affairs to check out Detective
			Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as 
			if nothing was different.  He slipped 
			off on his own when he found out we were
			going to raid Frank's place.

					 JEFFREY
			Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?

					DETECTIVE WILLIAMS
			Not yet.

					JEFFREY
			Oh my God. Is her son OK?

					F.B.I. MAN
			We're looking for him. In your opinion,
			why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and
			husband?

					JEFFREY
			He became obsessed with her. She hated
			him. He had to have her. He kidnapped
			them to control her. to make her do 
			things. Then she wanted to commit 
			suicide so he started cutting off ears
			as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm
			not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue
			velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause
			her whole life was blue.

					F.B.I. MAN
			You seemed to see some very interesting
			things on your little escapade with 
			Dorothy Vallens.

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. I guess I did.
				 (He turns to Sandy
  with a worried look)
			What's going to happen to me?

					F.B.I. MAN
			We're going to leave that up to Detective

			okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.

					JEFFREY
			Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how
			many more are out there?

FADE TO BLACK - DARKNESS

225. EXT. BEAUMONTS' BACK YARD - DAY

A huge low roaring sound comes in.

SLOWLY WE COME UP OUT OF A HUGE DARK HOLE. We see we are rising out of an 
ear but still among the crevices.  They look enormous.  We move up and 
float above the ear and traverse across a cheek to an eye.  Jeffrey's eye. 
His face is bathed in light.

All sorts of springtime-in-the-garden sounds are heard.

We suddenly see that Jeffrey is sleeping in his back yard. Detective 
Williams is with Mr. Beaumont working in the garden in the distance.  
The sprinkler is turning.  Sandy comes out on the back porch and calls.

					SANDY
			Jeffrey. Lunch is ready.

Jeffrey opens his eyes.  He looks around confused for a moment.  He sees 
Sandy.

					JEFFREY
			Okay. I'll be right in.

Sandy goes back inside.  Suddenly, a big red ROBIN chirps loudly above.  
Jeffrey looks up at it sitting in the cherry tree.  The Robin and Jeffrey 
seems to exchange a special look.

Jeffrey smiles up at the fat bird.

He gets off the lawn chair and walks away from us toward the back door of 
the house.  As he passes his father and Detective Williams:

					JEFFREY
			How ya doin' Dad?

					MR. BEAUMONT
				     (distant voice)
			Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.

					JEFFREY
			Good deal Dad.

He and Detective Williams share a smile.

226. INT. BEAUMONTS' KITCHEN - DAY

Jeffrey enters the kitchen and sees Sandy standing with Aunt Barbara by the
kitchen window.  Beyond, in the living room Mrs. Williams and Jeffrey's 
mother turn toward the kitchen when they hear the screen door slam.

A large Red Robin has just flown down to the window still carrying a big 
bug in its mouth.

					SANDY
			    (Referring to the bird)
			Look Jeffrey.

					JEFFREY
			  (As he joins Aunt Barbara and
			   Sandy to look at the robin)
			Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe
			the robins are here.

					AUNT BARBARA
			I don't see how they do it. I could
			never eat a bug.

					JEFFREY AND SANDY
				          (smiling)
			It's a strange world, isn't it?

									CUT TO:

227. 	EXT. FLOWER GARDEN - DAY

Yellow tulips sway in a warm afternoon breeze.

									DISSOLVE TO:

228. EXT. SHADY STREET - DAY

A bright red gorgeous fire engine is moving very slowly down the street.

We MOVE IN to see the happy face of a FIREMAN.

									DISSOLVE TO:

229. EXT. CROSSWALK - SHADY STREET - DAY

A very clean uniformed, smiling POLICEMAN with arms outstretched allows 
clean happy SCHOOL CHILDREN to cross the street safely.

									DISSOLVE TO:

230. EXT. TREE - DAY

A songbird SINGS in a tree.

We are in a beautiful park.  Slowly we move down and a little hat with a 
propeller comes into view.  The hat is on the head of a small child who is
dancing slowly toward Dorothy.  She is laughing.  When the boy gets within
arms reach they embrace.  We move close to Dorothy's smiling face.  Tears
of happiness come into her eyes, but there is still a distant look as we 
hear Bobby Vinton sing the last lines of his song.

"and I still can see Blue Velvet through
 my tears."

Blue Velvet dissolves in and takes over the image.

               DARKNESS. THE SOUND OF WIND AND SPRAY.

               MUSIC. TITLES.

               EXT. OCEAN -- NIGHT

               The darkness is actually water. A SEARCHLIGHT arcs across 
               heavy ocean swells. Half-a-dozen flashlights -- weaker beams -- 
               racing along what we can see is the deck of an aging FISHING 
               TRAWLER.

               FISHERMEN struggling with a gaff -- something in the water --

               A HUMAN CORPSE.

               EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- NIGHT

               THE BODY sprawled there. The Sailors all talking at once -- 
               three languages going -- brave chatter to mask the presence 
               of death --

                                     SAILOR #1
                         -- Jesus, look at him --

                                     SAILOR #2
                         -- what? -- you never saw a dead man 
                         before? --

                                     SAILOR #3
                         -- look, look he was shot --
                              (nudging the body --)

                                     SAILOR #1
                         -- don't, don't do that --

                                     SAILOR #2
                         -- he's dead, you think he cares? --

                                     SAILOR #1
                         -- so have some respect -- it's a --
                              (stopping as --)

               THE BODY MOVES! -- convulsing -- coughing up sea water -- 
               the Sailors -- freaked -- jumping back -- standing there, as --

               THE MAN begins to breathe.

               INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- NIGHT

               A wreck. Too small for all the people in here right now -- 
               SAILORS sweeping off the table -- rough hands laying THE MAN 
               down --

               THE CAPTAIN -- brutal and impatient -- watching from the 
               door as --

               GIANCARLO tears through the clutter -- searching for a medical 
               kit buried in the shambles. GIANCARLO is sixty. A bloodshot 
               soul.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         -- it's here -- hang on -- it's here 
                         somewhere -- give me a minute -- get 
                         some blankets -- get some blankets 
                         on him --
                              (finding the kit --)
                         -- here we go -- here it is --

               GIANCARLO with an old trunk -- just getting it open, as --

                                     THE CAPTAIN
                         Giancarlo.
                              (Giancarlo turns back --)
                         We pick him up? Okay, we have to 
                         pick him up. But that's as far as it 
                         goes.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         He needs a doctor.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Fuck that. He lives? He dies? I don't 
                         care. We've wasted two hours on this 
                         shit already. You do what you can, 
                         but we're not going back.
                              (pure steel now)
                         You understand me?

                                     GIANCARLO
                         Yes, sir.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (to the rest of them)
                         Let's get back to work!

               GIANCARLO watching them run out. Snagging a quick pull on a 
               pint of rum he's got stashed and --

               INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAWN -- TIME CUTS

               Transformed into a makeshift operating room. A light swings 
               overhead. THE MAN layed out across the table. Sounds -- groans -- 
               words -- snatches of them -- all in different languages.

               GIANCARLO playing doctor in a greasy kitchen apron. Cutting 
               away the clothes. Turning THE MAN on his side. Two bullet 
               wounds in the back. Probing them, judging them.

               Now -- GIANCARLO with a flashlight in his teeth -- TINK -- 
               TINK -- TINK -- bullet fragments falling into a washed-out 
               olive jar.

               Now -- something catching GIANCARLO'S EYE -- A SCAR ON THE 
               MAN'S HIP -- another fragment -- exacto knife cutting in -- 
               tweezers extracting A SMALL PLASTIC TUBE, not a bullet at 
               all, and as it comes free --

               THE MAN'S HAND SLAMS down onto GIANCARLO'S and we SMASH CUT 
               INTO A --

               FIRST PERSON POV -- we are staring up at --

                                     GIANCARLO
                         You're awake. Can you hear me?
                              (we're blinking --)
                         You've been shot. I'm trying to help 
                         you.
                              (we're trying to find 
                              our voice --)
                         You were in the water. You've been 
                         shot. It's okay now.

                                     THE MAN
                         Where am I?

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (switching to English)
                         You're American. I thought so. From 
                         your teeth -- the dental work --

                                     THE MAN
                         Where am I?

                                     GIANCARLO
                         You're on a boat. A fishing boat. 
                         Italian flag. We're out of Vietri.
                              (he smiles)
                         It's the cold that saved you. The 
                         water. The wounds are clean. I'm not 
                         a doctor, but the wounds, it looks 
                         okay. It's clean.

                                     THE MAN
                         How did I get here?

                                     GIANCARLO
                         You we're lost at sea. They pulled 
                         you out.
                              (we say nothing)
                         Who are you?
                              (still nothing)
                         You were shot -- two bullets -- in 
                         the back. You understand me?
                              (we try to nod)
                         Who are you?

               Long dead pause.

                                     THE MAN
                         I don't know.

               EXT. OCEAN -- DAY

               The Trawler plows through heavy seas.

               INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAY

               GIANCARLO is hunched over a desk -- tweezers and flashlight -- 
               busy working at that strange plastic tube that came out of 
               THE MAN's hip.

               THE MAN is bandaged. He's sitting up, and it must hurt like 
               hell, but physical pain is not the thing troubling him right 
               now. He's staring around the room -- at his body -- at the 
               walls -- haunted --

                                     THE MAN
                         What if it doesn't come back?

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (still working that 
                              tube)
                         I told you. You need to rest.

               Silence. THE MAN can't rest. Too busy trying to make sense 
               of all this.

                                     THE MAN
                         I can read. I can read that sign on 
                         the door. I can count. I can talk...
                              (focusing now --)
                         What are you doing?

               GIANCARLO rummaging around -- finding a magnifying glass --

                                     THE MAN
                         What is that?

               INSERT -- MAGNIFIED POV -- a slip of plastic from the tube -- 
               written there -- 000-7-17-12-0-14-26.  GEMEINSCHAFT BANK, 
               ZURICH.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         It came from your hip. Under the 
                         skin.
                              (turning back --)
                         You have a bank in Zurich.
                              (waiting)
                         You remember Zurich?

                                     THE MAN
                         No.

               GIANCARLO staring at him now. Different suddenly. Suspicious.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? 
                         I'm an engineer. Whatever this is, 
                         it's not for me to be involved, okay?

                                     THE MAN
                         I don't remember Zurich.

               GIANCARLO pulls his pint. Takes a hit.

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (offering the bottle --)
                         You drink rum?

                                     THE MAN
                         I don't know.

               EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- NIGHT

               THE MAN stands at the rail, staring out to sea. So lost. He 
               turns to head inside -- there, a surfcasting rod propped 
               against a locker.

               THE MAN picks up the rod -- flips the bail -- traps the line -- 
               now he's casting far out into the darkness. And for the first 
               time, he smiles.

               INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT

               A ratty old espresso machine. THE MAN standing there, staring 
               at the thing like it's a test. Then his hands begin to move -- 
               trying to pack a grind -- trying to fit it in -- turning on 
               the steam and --

               The whole thing explodes.

               EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- DAY

               THE MAN alone doing chin-ups on the deck rail. He's still 
               bandaged and the wounds must hurt like hell, but he's pushing 
               himself. Using the pain -- bathing in it -- maybe even hoping 
               that it will hold some answer for him.

               INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT

               A chess board. Wooden pieces jumbled in a box. THE MAN 
               hesitates -- takes a black knight from the box -- lingers 
               for a moment -- and then places it on the board. He's off 
               and running. He knows this. Placing pieces faster and faster -- 
               still setting it up, as we --

               INT. FISHING BOAT HEAD -- NIGHT

               One of the ugliest bathrooms on the planet. THE MAN standing 
               before a pitted, tarnished, cataract of a mirror. Staring at 
               himself.

               And then he speaks.

                                     THE MAN
                              (in perfect French)
                         I don't know who I am. Do you know 
                         who I am? Do have any idea who I am?

               And then he stops. Blinks. Wipes away the perspiration just 
               beading on his forehead.

                                     THE MAN
                              (in perfect Dutch)
                         Tell me who I am. If you know who I 
                         am, please stop fucking around and 
                         tell me.

               No answer. Just that face. His face. Who am I?

               And what else is inside there?

               EXT. FISHING BOAT -- DAY

               SAILORS hauling in the nets. THE MAN -- still bandaged, but 
               healing -- working beside them. Earning his keep. Getting 
               healthy.

               EXT. ITALIAN COASTLINE -- DAWN

               A small, colorful fishing village. The trawler motoring in.

               INT. THE FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- SAME TIME

               THE MAN buttoning up borrowed clothes. GIANCARLO pulling 
               some cash from his pocket --

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (offering the money)
                         It's not much, but it should get you 
                         to Switzerland.

                                     THE MAN
                         I won't forget this.

               GIANCARLO gives him a look. Shakes his head, and --

               INT. POKEY ITALIAN TRAIN STATION -- DAY

               The ticket window. THE MAN and a TICKET AGENT.

                                     TICKET AGENT
                         Una sola via?

                                     THE MAN
                         Si. One way. Una sola via.

               EXT. TGV -- DAY

               A HELICOPTER SHOT -- a bullet train speeds through snow- 
               capped Alps. We move in on a window -- and staring out is...

               INT. TGV TRAIN -- DAY

               ...THE MAN. People all around him -- families -- businessmen -- 
               normal people going about their lives. THE MAN turns back to 
               the window, but he's not watching the scenery -- he's looking 
               at his reflection. So lost. His face suddenly plunged into 
               darkness as the train bombs into a tunnel...

               EXT. TRAIN -- NIGHT

               ...and out of the darkness into night and the HELICOPTER 
               SHOT, as the train races toward ZURICH.

               INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               A VIDEO MONITOR -- FULL FRAME -- meet WOMBOSI. He's an African 
               ex-dictator, think Idi Amin crossed with Mobutu. He's in 
               some sort of throne room. And he's angry. Bodyguards and a 
               translator hovering nervously around him. What this is, is 
               NEWS FOOTAGE -- an interview conducted by a German TV station.

                                     WOMBOSI
                              (he speaks english)
                         ...no, no, no -- the time is not 
                         right, my enemies are too strong. 
                         I'm telling you to wait for this, 
                         you understand? I'm telling you this, 
                         and I'm making a warning to all those 
                         peoples out there that think that my 
                         powers have become so weak that they 
                         can play with me as they wish. You 
                         will see -- I will tell you when the 
                         evidence is clear. Then you will 
                         have a story. My old friends will 
                         hear about themselves.
                              (stopping, freezing 
                              on that image, and --)

               MARSHALL, a CIA bigwig has the remote control. And the floor.

                                     MARSHALL
                         That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in 
                         Paris the day before yesterday. I'm 
                         sure most of you have a passing 
                         knowledge of Mr. Wombosi. Some of 
                         you on the African desks have worked 
                         with him over the years. Some of you 
                         very closely...

               TWELVE CIA MANDARINS sitting around the table like kids in 
               detention. We will tour the faces as MARSHALL continues, but 
               the guy we're interested in is named WARD ABBOTT. Picture a 
               sawier, slicker John Poindexter.

                                     MARSHALL
                         ...He was an irritation before he 
                         took power. He was a problem when he 
                         was in power. And he's been a disaster 
                         for us in exile.
                              (the tape --)
                         Wombosi likes to send us messages 
                         through the European media. This is 
                         an interview we pulled down from a 
                         local German television station in 
                         Dresden. We've been getting these 
                         little broadsides every couple of 
                         months. He knows this -- he knows 
                         that -- he's writing a book about 
                         the Agency's history in Africa -- 
                         he's going to name names. It's 
                         basically a shakedown...

               ABBOTT'S FACE says this is news to him. HIS HANDS suggest 
               otherwise.

                                     MARSHALL
                         This interview -- and I'll make the 
                         tape available for anyone who wants 
                         it -- he goes on to claim that he 
                         has just survived an assassination 
                         attempt. He says it's us. He says 
                         he's got proof.
                              (beat)
                         The overwhelming negative 
                         ramifications of this should be 
                         obvious.
                              (hard and dry)
                         The Director wants to know if there 
                         is any possible shred of truth in 
                         this accusation.

               Long pause. No hands go up.

               INT. ZURICH TRAIN STATION -- NIGHT

               THE MAN wandering through the terminal. Passing A PIZZA PLACE 
               closing up for the night.

               THE MAN checks his funds. Just enough for one cold slice.

               EXT. ZURICH STREETS -- NIGHT

               THE MAN walking aimlessly.

               EXT. ZURICH PARK -- NIGHT

               THE MAN trying to get comfortable on a bench. It's chilly 
               but this will have to do until morning.

               Just settling in, when --

                                     ZURICH COP #1 (O.S.)
                              (authority German)
                         Can't you read the signs?

               THE MAN turns. TWO ZURICH COPS coming toward him.

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                         On your feet. Let's go. Right now.

               THE MAN makes his feet. They're on top of him now.

                                     ZURICH COP #1
                         The park is closed. There's no 
                         sleeping in the park.

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                         Let's see some identification.

               THE MAN not sure what to do. Eyes moving. Mouth shut.

                                     ZURICH COP #1
                         Come on. Your papers. Let's go.

                                     THE MAN
                         I've lost them. I've...
                              (German now)
                         My papers. They are lost.

                                     ZURICH COP #1
                              (not sympathetic)
                         Okay. Let's go. Put your hands up.

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                              (pulling his nightstick)
                          -- come on -- hands up -- up --

               THE MAN raising his hand slowly -- ZURICH COP #1 reaching up 
               to pat him down --

                                     THE MAN
                         -- look, I'm just trying to sleep 
                         okay? --
                              (German again)
                          -- I just need to sleep --

               ZURICH COP #2 has heard enough -- giving a sharp poke with 
               the nightstick -- into THE MAN's back -- and that's the last 
               thing he'll remember because --

               THE MAN is in motion.

               A single turn -- spinning -- catching COP #2 completely off 
               guard -- the heel of his hand driving up into the guy's throat 
               and --

               COP #1 -- behind him -- trying to reach for his pistol, but 
               THE MAN -- still turning -- all his weight moving in a single 
               fluid attack -- a sweeping kick and --

               COP #1 -- he's falling -- catching the bench -- trying to 
               fight back but -- THE MAN -- like a machine -- just 
               unbelievably fast -- three jackhammer punches -- down-down- 
               down and -- COP #1 -- head slammed into the bench -- blood 
               spraying from his nose -- he's out cold and --

               COP #2 -- writhing on the ground -- gasping for air -- 
               struggling with his holster -- THE MAN -- his foot -- down -- 
               like a vise -- onto COP #2's arm -- shattering the bone -- 
               COP #2 starting to scream, and then silenced because --

               THE MAN -- he's got the pistol -- so fucking fast -- he's 
               got it right up against COP #2's forehead -- right on the 
               edge of pulling the trigger -- he is, he's gonna shoot him --

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                              (gasping, pleading)
                         -- no -- please God no -- please 
                         don't -- please no -- my Go

               -- stopping as --

               THE MAN slams the gun against his temple and --

               This fight is over.

               THE MAN standing there. In the silence. Two unconscious cops 
               at his feet. Blood on his pants. What just happened? How did 
               he do this? And there's THE GUN in his hand. And God, it 
               just feels so natural -- checking it -- stripping it down -- 
               holding it -- aiming it -- like this is something he's done 
               a million times before...

               This is something he definitely knows how to do.

               And then he stops cold. Throwing down the gun. Running off 
               into the darkness --

               INT. TREADSTONE -- DAY

               A deep, inner office. An ops office. Operations. Unlabeled 
               and anonymous. A backwater project center hidden deep within 
               the Langley facility. Utilitarian. Several rooms linked like 
               a suite.

               Small staff. SEVERAL TECHNICIANS. One or two for 
               communications. A couple for research. People are at their 
               posts. And it's all quiet. But they are busy. Quietly urgent. 
               This is a place under siege.

               ZORN is the number two here. Brilliant bloodless lapdog. 
               He's coming through the suite. Coming through quickly. Heading 
               toward the boss's little office at the back --

               jaw. Everything tucked away. But there's tension in the air.

                         Abbott wants to talk.

               ABBOTT with coffee. CONKLIN not lingering.

                         Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It 
                         looks like rain and I don't have a 
                         thing to wear.

                         I don't know what we're talking about.

                         We're talking about Marseille. We're 
                         talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And 
                         I'm asking you if this abortion in 
                         Marseille has anything to do with 
                         Treadstone.
                              (silence)
                         Was this Treadstone?

                         You're asking me a direct question?

                         Yes.

                         I thought you were never going to do 
                         that.

               Silence. Pressure drop.

                                     ABBOTT
                         They're putting together an agency 
                         oversight committee. They're going 
                         to look through everyone's budgets. 
                         Treadstone is a rather sizable line 
                         item in my ledger.
                              (beat)
                         What am I going to do about that?

                         You'd want to make that go away. 
                         You'd want to remind them that 
                         Treadstone is a training organization. 
                         That it's all theoretical. You'd 
                         want to sign off on that.

                                     ABBOTT
                         And what if I couldn't do that?

                                     CONKLIN
                         Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. 
                         And you'd have to explain how you 
                         let me get this far.
                              (silence)
                         Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, 
                         does it?
                              (Abbott staring)
                         We'll clean up the field. You clean 
                         up your budgets.

               EXT. ZURICH -- DAY

               Morning in the financial district. Upscale. Uptight.

               GEMEINSCHAFT BANK just one of many elegant fortresses on 
               this street. Everything just now opening for business. TWO 
               GUARDS unlocking the front door and --

               THE MAN across the street. Tucked in the shadows. Checking 
               for cops and trouble. Looks clear. He's walking and --

               INT. BANK RECEPTION AREA -- DAY

               Ornate, formidable and tech at the same time.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Can I help you?

               THE MAN standing before her. Looking very out of place.

                                     THE MAN
                         I'm here about a numbered account.

               THE RECEPTIONIST nods. Pulls a pen and bank card.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                              (instant English)
                         If you'll just enter your account 
                         number here I'll direct you to the 
                         appropriate officer.

               THE MAN takes the pen, as we --

               INT. BANK SECURITY CHECKPOINT -- DAY

               A BIO-METRIC SCANNER. A piece of ultra-tech amidst the 
               Baroque. TWO SERIOUS BANK GUARDS manning the equipment.

               THE MAN standing there, staring down at this machine. 
               Something ominously decisive about this. What if it's him? 
               What if it's not?

                                     BANK GUARD #1
                         They've been waiting your hand, sir...

               THE MAN focuses. Here we go -- BANK GUARD #2 guiding his 
               open palm onto the mirrored scanning surface.

               THE MAN catching his reflection for a moment before a wave 
               of white light passes beneath his hand and now --

               INT. BANK HALLWAY -- DAY

               THE MAN being led by A THIRD GUARD to a special elevator.

               INT. DEEPER INSIDE THE BANK -- DAY

               Elevator doors open. THE MAN steps out. MR. APFEL -- anal 
               Zurich banker -- waiting there.

                                     APFEL
                         Good morning, sir. I assume you're 
                         here about your box.

                                     THE MAN
                         ...yes...
                              (what now?)
                         The box.

               APFEL nods. Gestures down the corridor --

               INT. BANK SAFETY DEPOSIT VIEWING ROOM -- DAY

               Sterile and kind of odd. But total privacy. THE MAN sitting 
               there, as A DEPOSIT GUARD places a large SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX 
               before him. THE GUARD leaves the room. Closing the door behind 
               him.

               THE MAN is alone. And there it is, right in front of him. 
               This is it. Here are the answers. He lifts the lid.

               THE BOX. There's a shallow tray on top. In this tray: a beat-
               up passport in the name of Jason Bourne. A French driver's 
               license with a Parisian address. Credit cards for Jason 
               Bourne.

               THE MAN. Holding these objects close -- as if by holding 
               them he might absorb their essence. Forcing himself to 
               believe. This is him. His picture. There it is. He's Jason 
               Bourne.

                                     BOURNE
                         My name is Jason Bourne.
                              (sounds good)
                         Hi, I'm Jason. Jason Bourne. Jason 
                         Bourne, nice to meet you.

               BACK TO -- THE BOX -- the shallow tray on top. There's 
               Kleenex. Several sets of contact lenses. A knife. A comb. 
               Three sticks of gum. A ring. A pair of sunglasses. A Rolex.

               BOURNE setting these things aside.  Lifting the top tray.  
               Staring into THE DEEP BOTTOM TRAY and --

               First of all...

               MONEY. Lots of it. Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds. 
               Lots of them. Close to a million dollars. There's A GUN. A 
               very good gun. Several clips of ammo. And...

               FIVE MORE PASSPORTS. All clean. Crisp. Brand new. All with 
               his photo inside. Five different names. Three different 
               Countries. Each one of these pristine passports clipped to a 
               piece of card stock that says:

               NAME: 
               NATIONALITY: 
               PLACE OF ISSUE: 
               SIGNATURE SAMPLE:

               And a bar code. 
               Two Dutch passports. A French. A South African. A Belgian.

               And...

               There's one piece of card stock still with the paper clip in 
               place. And no passport. This card reads:

               NAME: John Michael Kane 
               NATIONALITY: U.S.A. 
               PLACE OF ISSUE: Paris, France 
               There's a signature sample. 
               And a bar code. But no passport. This one is missing.

               BOURNE sitting there. Trying to push his confusion away.

                                     BOURNE
                         Bourne. My name is Jason Bourne. I 
                         live at 121, Rue de la Jardin, Paris.

               But there's something hollow about this. He came looking for 
               one identity and now he's faced with six. The money... The 
               gun...

               Suddenly, it's all fucked up.

               BOURNE into gear. Looking around the room -- there -- there's 
               a pile of red canvas burn bags in the corner. BOURNE grabbing 
               one -- stuffing everything into it -- everything except...

               The gun. He doesn't want the gun. No guns.

               INT. BANK SAFETY DEPOSIT OUTER AREA -- DAY

               BOURNE is done. Handing the box back to THE DEPOSIT GUARD --

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm trying to think how long it's 
                         been since I was here.

                                     DEPOSIT GUARD
                         I'm not sure. Must be three weeks.

               EXT. STREETS OF ZURICH -- DAY -- VARIOUS SHOTS

               BOURNE exits the bank. The red bag full to its limit. He's 
               walking briskly now. Looking for a taxi. Nothing in sight.

               BOURNE crossing the street. Shit, there's A COP on the corner -- 
               turn -- change pace -- make it look natural --

               BOURNE around a corner. And it's looking good for a moment -- 
               but only a moment -- TWO MORE COPS walking a beat -- walking 
               this way -- turn -- cut -- cross the street --

               BOURNE heading down a boulevard. Trying to look small. Pulse 
               starting to race. Fighting the paranoia. Where the hell is a 
               cab? Turning back fast as A SIREN starts bleeding in from 
               behind him --

               It's just an ambulance.

               BOURNE turning back. Forcing himself to focus. And fuck -- 
               there's A METER MAID, and she's stopped writing up a ticket -- 
               she's staring at him and --

               BOURNE trying not to panic -- don't run -- smile -- stay 
               small -- get to the corner -- scan the options -- but --

               THE METER MAID -- she's watching him go and she's pulling 
               her radio and --

               BOURNE hitting this next corner -- banging a right -- forcing 
               himself not to run -- glancing back and --

               THERE'S ANOTHER COP -- but this one is jogging -- searching -- 
               he's got his radio out and --

               FINALLY TO --

               BOURNE bailing on the street -- disappearing into --

               EXT. U.S. EMBASSY COMPOUND -- DAY

               Big gates. Speed barricades. SEVERAL U.S. MARINES standing 
               guard near a gate house. An American flag. Lots of people 
               coming and going. BOURNE playing it as normal as possible as 
               he heads for the entrance.

               INT. U.S. CONSULATE ZURICH -- VISA ROOM -- DAY

               The passport and visa office. Big room. No windows. Unpleasant 
               on purpose. Two lines: A short one for U.S.  Citizens, a 
               marathon for everyone else. CONSULATE CLERKS stationed in 
               open cubicles along the back wall. And it's a zoo. American 
               tourists who've lost their passports. Foreigners looking for 
               visas. Asylum seekers. Everyone here has a problem.

               BOURNE on the U.S. line. Standing there trying to think. 
               What's he gonna say? What can he say? With the cops outside, 
               and the incident in the park, then the bank...

                                     MARIE (O.S.)
                         -- no, this is not my current address. 
                         It was my current address two days 
                         ago when I started standing in line 
                         outside --

               A NEARBY CUBICLE. Meet MARIE KREUTZ. German. Big energy. 
               Real beauty hidden beneath the armor. And armor it is, because 
               this is a warrior in full, crisis battlemode.

                                     MARIE
                         -- and so now I lost my apartment, I 
                         have no address, and I have no visa, 
                         and you keep telling me how much 
                         help you cannot give me!

               A CONSULATE CLERK caught in her headlights.

                                     CLERK
                         Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna 
                         have to ask you to keep your voice 
                         down.

                                     MARIE
                         All the papers -- all the papers 
                         they asked for -- I brought all the 
                         papers --

                                     CLERK
                         Miss Kreutz, excuse me, but you 
                         entered into a fraudulent marriage 
                         in an effort to circumvent the 
                         immigration laws of the United States --

                                     MARIE
                         You only know that because I told 
                         you!
                              (she's incredulous)
                         Ask the case officer -- find his 
                         name -- it's on the papers -- I told 
                         him all this myself! --
                              (tearing through the 
                              papers now --)

                                     CLERK
                         -- it's not the source of the 
                         information that's important here --

                                     MARIE
                         -- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid 
                         him four thousand dollars -- my last 
                         four thousand dollars to marry me, 
                         okay? -- I told this to the case 
                         officer last week...
                              (she's found it --)
                         ...here -- Mr. Thomas. I told Mr.  
                         Thomas I didn't know this guy was 
                         already married -- I admitted this!

                                     CLERK
                         -- Miss Kreutz, please --

                                     MARIE
                         -- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- 
                         not you -- not the United States 
                         government -- me -- I'm the one being 
                         ripped off!

                                     CLERK
                         So now you're asking for a student 
                         visa?

               That shuts her up. Yes. Today she's a student.

               INT. CIA OFFICE COMPLEX -- NIGHT (BUT SAME TIME)

               Motion -- CONKLIN racing down a staircase -- ZORN chasing 
               after --

                                     CONKLIN
                         -- and they're sure it's him? --

                                     ZORN
                         -- he accessed the account --

                         -- yes, sir, it's confirmed --

               INT. U.S. CONSULATE -- VISA ROOM -- DAY

               BOURNE on line. Fear meter rising by the minute.

               BOURNE'S POV

               Scanning the room -- the perimeter -- the people -- A TURKISH 
               MAN almost in tears as he tries to explain his case to a 
               DESK CLERK -- TWO AMERICAN BACKPACKERS that have lost their 
               passports -- MARIE still in the midst of her madness -- A 
               SECURITY CAMERA high on the wall capturing everything -- 
               lots of data -- too much going on and --

                                     MAN ON LINE (O.S.)
                              (from behind him)
                         You're up.

               BOURNE comes to. Shit. It's his turn.

               A WOMAN CLERK waving him forward. BOURNE trying to think -- 
               what the fuck is he doing? -- what's he gonna say? -- now 
               he's at the window, and if he was looking for a friendly 
               face, he came to the wrong place --

                                     WOMAN CLERK

                         You're a U.S. Citizen?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes.
                              (pause)
                         I mean, I think so. Yes. Yes...

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                         Well, either you are, or you aren't.

                                     BOURNE
                         Right.

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                         You have your passport?

                                     BOURNE
                         I have a passport. I've got...
                              (the bag there, but...)
                         Actually, it's a little complicated.

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                         Do you have your passport, sir?

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, maybe I should just...

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                         Sir, you waited on line.

                                     BOURNE
                         Yeah, I know...

               But he's already bailing, walking away from the woman, the 
               window, the room -- he's out of here --

               INT. U.S. CONSULATE LOBBY -- DAY

               BOURNE on the move -- hustling back toward the lobby -- trying 
               to snag a view out to the street -- there's a window just 
               ahead and --

               BOURNE'S WINDOW POV -- ZURICH COPS -- outside -- on the street -- 
               half-a-dozen of them lingering around the entry gate and --

               BOURNE stalled for a moment -- options dwindling -- he can't 
               go back to the passport office -- he can't go out the front 
               and --

               The lobby looks tough -- there are two other points of entry 
               into the main building, but they're both guarded by MARINES 
               and METAL DETECTORS --

               As he gets closer -- it gets worse --

               A ZURICH POLICE INSPECTOR near the door, in deep conversation 
               with TWO MARINES and THE EMBASSY SECURITY OFFICER and --

               BOURNE trying to burrow through the human traffic -- trying 
               to get to THE LARGER OF THE TWO ENTRY GATES -- this one the 
               farthest from the front door and the passport office corridor, 
               and it's the most crowded -- A COUPLE PEOPLE lined up here -- 
               waiting for one of THE THREE MARINES STAFFING THIS POST to 
               check their bags and pass them through a metal detector and --

                                     SECURITY CHIEF (O.S.)
                         -- stop! -- stop right there! --

               BOURNE turns back -- as does everyone else in the lobby --

                                     SECURITY CHIEF
                              (from across the lobby)
                         -- YOU -- red bag -- the red bag -- 
                         stop right there! -- hands up! --

               BOURNE glancing back -- ONE OF THE GATE MARINES BEHIND HIM -- 
               the guy's raising his M-16 --

                                     GUN MARINE
                         -- you heard him -- let's move it! -- 
                         down -- let's go! --

               BOURNE nodding -- total compliance -- starting to drop -- 
               but only starting, because now --

               He's swinging the backpack and --

               THE GUN MARINE -- nailed -- blind-sided -- no chance and --

               BOURNE -- all motion -- all forward -- all perfect -- vaulting 
               the metal detector even as he pulls ONE OF THE PEOPLE ON 
               LINE around to shield his back and --

               ANOTHER GATE MARINE -- right there -- trying to grab him -- 
               making his move -- BOURNE -- almost an afterthought -- his 
               boot -- like a knife -- out of nowhere -- SNAP! -- the guy's 
               arm just shattered and --

               THE SECURITY CHIEF -- freaking out -- TWO MARINES WITH HIM -- 
               they're raising their weapons and there's people in the lobby 
               and --

                                     SECURITY CHIEF
                         -- no -- no -- hold your fire! --

               BOURNE -- landing hard on THE GUN MARINE -- rolling away 
               from the gate -- into the building now -- coming up with the 
               backpack and --

                                     SOMEONE SCREAMING
                         -- he's got a gun! -- he's got a 
                         gun! --

               And he does -- BOURNE with the M-16! -- coming up with it -- 
               coming up on the move -- swinging it around as he searches 
               for an escape route and THE GUN -- it's like a magic wand of 
               hysteria --

               PEOPLE IN THE LOBBY -- SCREAMING -- diving away -- everyone 
               dropping for cover and --

               BOURNE -- bailing -- on the run -- sprinting down a hallway -- 
               tossing away the M-16 as he sprints into the building --

                                     THE SECURITY CHIEF
                              (frantic on his radio 
                              now --)

               INT. U.S. CONSULATE OFFICE HALLWAY -- DAY

               Quiet for a second -- offices on either side of a carpeted 
               hallway -- BUREAUCRAT-TYPES doing their thing, when suddenly --

                                     BUREAUCRAT #1
                         Excuse me?  Can I help you?
                              (but backing up as he 
                              says it, because --)

               Here comes BOURNE -- coming fast -- and he definitely does 
               not belong back here --

               INT. U.S. CONSULATE LOBBY/SECURITY GATE -- DAY

               Panic -- people fleeing the lobby -- MORE MARINES hustling

               BOURNE -- dangling fifty-feet above the stone courtyard! -- 
               he's gone out the window! -- hanging there -- hanging with 
               one hand -- one hand clutching the corner of a ledge and --

               INT. U.S. CONSULATE MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               Utter confusion -- SECURITY CHIEF -- FIVE -- SIX -- SEVEN 
               ARMED MARINES all piling in -- ready to rock but there's no 
               one to shoot -- no target --

                         -- check the closets! -- get those

                         kitchen back there -- go! -- go! -- 
                         go!

               TWO MARINES -- scanning the windows -- looking down and --

               MARINE POV -- all clear -- no way he went down there and --

               EXT. U.S. CONSULATE BUILDING WALL -- DAY

               BOURNE still hanging there -- looking down -- up -- there's 
               no choice -- he has to go down --

               BOURNE finding a toehold below him -- reaching -- touching 
               down -- it gives way -- crumbling and --

               BOURNE hesitates. Does he know how to do this or not? Stalled 
               for a moment, then...

               BOURNE starts climbing down. And this is all one shot. No 
               cutaway. No cheating.

               We are watching a master at work...

               Handhold to a drain pipe. Swinging to a better ledge.

               Dropping to an air-conditioner. Grabbing a window frame just 
               before the air-conditioner gives way. Teetering there. Now 
               he's on the fourth floor.

               Below, there's an open window on the third floor. Struggling 
               to keep his balance, he reaches behind him to shift the weight 
               of the bag, and as he does --

               THE RED BAG falls. Thump. Into the courtyard. Forget the 
               open window. Now he's got to go all the way.

               Timing his next move and --

               He's pushing off -- reaching -- there's another drainpipe 
               and he's snagged it -- he's got a dragline now -- starting 
               to fall -- straining to hold the pipe -- slowing his descent -- 
               the drainpipe pulling away from it's housing and --

               BOURNE letting go -- just before he falls backward -- one 
               last grab -- catching a gutter -- holding it just long enough 
               to slow his fall and --

               Letting go for the last fifteen feet and --

               A LITTLE RED CAR. A beat-to-shit Euro car. A shitty little 
               red car angled in beside a dumpster with a big red Zurich 
               parking ticket on the windshield.

               MARIE grabbing the ticket -- tearing it up -- tearing the 
               shit out of it -- blind with misfortune -- throwing the pieces 
               on the ground and stomping on them and then --

                                     MARIE
                              (looking up --)
                         What are you looking at?

               BOURNE standing across the car -- on the passenger side --

                                     BOURNE
                         I need a ride.

                                     MARIE
                         What?

                                     BOURNE
                         I need a ride out of here.

                                     MARIE
                         Oh, Jesus...
                              (backing away and --)

                                     BOURNE
                         Please. I don't want to scare you.

                                     MARIE
                         It's a little late for that.

                                     BOURNE
                         I've got a situation here and --

                                     MARIE
                         Get the fuck away from my car.

                                     BOURNE
                         I'll give you ten thousand dollars 
                         to drive me to Paris.

                                     MARIE
                         Great. You know what? I'll give you 
                         ten gazillion dollars to get the 
                         fuck away from me before I start 
                         screaming my head off.

                                     BOURNE
                         You don't want the police any more 
                         than I do.

               BOURNE tosses cash -- a stack of hundreds -- across the car 
               into her hands -- she catches it. Looks at it.

                                     MARIE
                         Jesus...

                                     BOURNE
                         Get me out of here. Please.

               MARIE looking at him. At the money. Back at him, and --

                                     ZORN
                         Zurich police are looking for an 
                         American with a red bag. Apparently 
                         he put two cops in the hospital last 
                         night.

               Silence. Like the floor just fell away. So heavy.

                         Maybe it's a game. Maybe he's trying 
                         to send us a message.

               The little red car parked. MARIE pacing around. BOURNE poring 
               over a map spread out over the hood.

                                     MARIE
                         So what's in Paris?

                                     BOURNE
                         I want to go home.

                                     MARIE
                         For twenty thousand dollars.

               BOURNE looks back from the map.

                                     BOURNE
                         I said ten thousand.

                                     MARIE
                         You have blood on your pants.

                                     BOURNE
                         Okay.
                              (beat)
                         Twenty thousand. Ten now. Ten there.

                                     MARIE
                         No. No, that was too easy --
                              (pacing away --)

                                     BOURNE
                         Wait up --
                              (after her now --)
                         -- just wait up --

                                     MARIE
                         -- get the fuck out of here -- all 
                         this money, this crazy offer, I mean 
                         give me a fucking break with this, 
                         this is --
                              (stopping because--)

               BOURNE just grabbed her. Both of them shocked that he's done 
               this. He immediately pulls back.

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, I want a ride to Paris.
                              (wide open now)
                         That's all I want. I swear.

                                     MARIE
                         You swear?
                              (cold here)
                         That's great. I feel so much better 
                         now.

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't want anything but a ride. 
                         All I want to do is go home.

               Silence now. She looks back. Measuring him.

                                     MARIE
                         You could buy a car for twenty grand. 
                         You could buy this car.

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't want to go alone. I want you 
                         to drive me to Paris. Like we're a 
                         couple. Like we're a couple and we're 
                         travelling together. That's all we're 
                         doing.

                                     MARIE
                         And I don't get hurt. I get twenty 
                         thousand dollars and I don't get 
                         hurt.

                                     BOURNE
                         I won't hurt you.

                                     MARIE
                         What if I say no?

                                     BOURNE
                         Then I'll find another ride.

               Darkness -- a key turning -- door opening -- light goes on 
               to reveal CASTEL standing there and we're in --

               CASTEL'S STORAGE UNIT. What's in here? Like nothing. Like a 
               stack of old newspapers in the corner. Some mildewed books 
               piled along one wall. Some shitty plastic chairs.

               QUICK TIME CUTS

               CASTEL working fast. Closing the door. Moving to the pile of 
               books. Taking the top book off. Opening it.

               INSIDE THE BOX -- a timer. A small bomb. A booby-trap. An 
               LED light stops flashing as CASTEL'S HANDS code in his 
               password and --

               CASTEL moving to the newspapers stacked in the corner.  
               Pulling away the top pile and --

               A METAL LOCK BOX. Hidden here. CASTLE pulling it out. Opening 
               it. An empty tray on top and --

               CASTEL taking off his watch. Taking off his rings. Taking 
               out his wallet. His Spanish passport. Emptying his pockets. 
               All of this goes into the empty tray and --

               CASTEL lifting away this top tray -- setting it aside and --

               THE METAL LOCK BOX -- there's more -- a much larger bottom 
               compartment -- and it's deja-vu all over again -- we're 
               looking at the identical contents we saw Bourne find in the 
               Zurich safe-deposit box.

               First of all...

               MONEY. Lots of it. Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds. 
               Lots of them. A GUN. A very good gun. A dozen clips of ammo. 
               And FIVE MORE PASSPORTS. All clean. Brand new. All with his 
               photo. Five different names. Four different countries. Each 
               one of these pristine clipped to a piece of card stock that 
               says:

               NAME:

               The little red car driving through The Alps.

               INT. THE RED CAR -- DUSK

               BOURNE staring out the window. MARIE driving. Long silence 
               until --

                                     MARIE
                         Just so you know, if you're gonna 
                         burn me on the money, you might as 
                         well kill me.
                              (Bourne looks over)
                         I was supposed to have this car back 
                         three days ago. It's not my car.

                                     BOURNE
                         I know that.

               MARIE staring at him -- glancing back to the road -- just in 
               time -- almost rear-ending a slow moving truck --

                                     MARIE
                         Shit --
                              (trying to settle)
                         Can I tell you how much you're 
                         freaking me out? Okay? Because you 
                         are -- you're completely freaking me 
                         out.

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm sorry. Really. What do you want 
                         me to do?

                                     MARIE
                         I don't know. Smile. Sneeze. 
                         Something. You've got a bag full of 
                         money and a ride to Paris. Fuck it, 
                         I don't know...
                              (the radio)
                         What kind of music do you like?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.

                                     MARIE
                         What does that mean?

                                     BOURNE
                         Listen to what you want.

                                     MARIE
                              (out of nowhere)
                         Who pays twenty thousand dollars for 
                         a ride to Paris?

               There it is. And she wants an answer --

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know. I don't know who I am.

                                     MARIE
                         Yeah, well, welcome to the club.

                                     BOURNE
                         No. No, I mean, I really don't know 
                         who I am. I can't remember anything 
                         earlier than two weeks ago.
                              (it's not flying)
                         I'm serious.

                                     MARIE
                         What? Like amnesia?

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, go ahead... put the radio on...

                                     MARIE
                         Amnesia?
                              (total incredulity)
                         You're saying you don't remember 
                         anything that happened before two 
                         weeks ago?

                                     BOURNE
                         That's what I'm saying.

                                     MARIE
                              (German)
                         Give me a fucking break.

               BOURNE staring at her. She's furious. She's downshifting -- 
               she's accelerating -- pulling out to pass the truck on a 
               blind turn, as we --

               EXT. ZURICH BANK -- DAY/DUSK

               APFEL emerges from the bank. Leaving work. Turns the corner 
               into a quiet side street and --

               Up ahead, here comes another guy in a suit. It's MANHEIM 
               walking toward us, deep into a cell phone conversation. Barely 
               noticing Apfel as they get closer and --

               As they pass -- MANHEIM -- it's completely out of the blue -- 
               he's jabbing the cellphone down into Apfel's shoulder and --

               APFEL -- no clue -- already clutching at the coronary 
               exploding in his chest -- dead before his body hits the street 
               and --

               MANHEIM -- still walking -- he's never broken stride -- and 
               as he goes he's fiddling with the cellphone and --

               INSERT -- THE CELLPHONE -- MANHEIM'S HANDS working to retract 
               a syringe into the device and --

               MANHEIM striding away. Disappearing into Zurich...

               INT. PARIS MORGUE -- NIGHT

               Not the best morgue in town. Cold tile. A wall of freezers. 
               Death lighting. Now add some color. Meet NYKWANA WOMBOSI in 
               the flesh.

               Meet HIS ENTOURAGE -- eight or ten of his thirty children -- 
               two of his wives -- three of his bodyguards -- the whole 
               crew spread out in this horrible basement room. THE WIVES 
               are chatting. THE KIDS are playing, fighting and eating candy.

               THE BODYGUARDS -- three of them here -- are white. These 
               guys are French/Corsican mercs. Not quite the A-Team. The 
               guy in charge of this ugly little unit is named DEAUVAGE. 
               Into it. Too into it.

               TWO MORGUE ATTENDANTS hanging back. THE MORGUE BOSS -- who's 
               clearly suffering this for a bribe -- moves to one of the 
               freezer lockers...

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                              (French)
                         Okay, Monsieur Kane... number 121...

               And he pulls open FREEZER #121. And thank God we can't see 
               it, because whatever's inside there is clearly horrible. THE 
               MORGUE BOSS barely takes a glance, standing back as quickly 
               as possible.

               DEAUVAGE -- lead bodyguard -- moves to clear a zone for his 
               boss --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Get the fuck out of my way --
                              (pushing Deauvage 
                              aside --)

               WOMBOSI moves to the freezer box. Stares down. As if it were 
               nothing. He's seen -- he's made -- much, much worse. And now 
               he reaches down into the box -- hands on -- literally feeling 
               around this dead, awful corpse with his bare hands -- feeling 
               around for something -- feeling and feeling and not finding --

                                     WOMBOSI
                              (turning to Deauvage --)
                         It's not him.

               DEAUVAGE looking pale as WOMBOSI slams shut the freezer.

                                     WOMBOSI
                              (quiet hard fury)
                         So who's crazy now?

               EXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT

               A MINI-MOTORCADE driving towards Neuilly. Two security cars. 
               A van full of kids and mothers. And one big Mercedes stretch.

               INT. THE MERCEDES STRETCH LIMO -- NIGHT

               WOMBOSI alone in the back. Looking haunted.

               INT. TRUCKSTOP CAFE -- NIGHT

               It's a weird spot. Open all night. But Euro-style. Quiet 
               tonight. A few Alpen-truckers chowing down. A local or two 
               at the bar and --

               BOURNE AND MARIE at a back table. Drinking coffee. He's got 
               the red bag open. All the passports -- the personal junk -- 
               the money -- all the shit from the Zurich bank box -- he's 
               been showing it to her --

               And he's got her attention now.

                                     MARIE
                         And you have no idea -- not a clue -- 
                         what came before that?

                                     BOURNE
                         No.

                                     MARIE
                         When you think of it, before the 
                         ship -- before you wake up on the 
                         ship, what do you see?

                                     BOURNE
                         Nothing. It's just not there.

                                     MARIE
                         Well, this is great.
                              (she sits back)
                         I'm sick of myself and you have no 
                         idea who you are.

                                     BOURNE
                         I kept trying things, I thought if I 
                         could find all the things I could 
                         do, I could --

                                     MARIE
                         -- you could put it together --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- which was okay for a while, I was 
                         okay with it...
                              (hesitating now)
                         But then -- there's all these other 
                         things -- all these other things I 
                         know how to do -- and this -- this 
                         stuff from the bank and...
                              (suddenly flat out --)
                         I think something bad happened.

                                     MARIE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.

                                     MARIE
                         Sounds like you were in an accident 
                         or something.

                                     BOURNE
                         I was shot twice in the back.

                                     MARIE
                         Okay, so you're a victim.

                                     BOURNE
                         There was a gun. Who has a safe 
                         deposit box with a gun and all this 
                         money and all these passports?

                                     MARIE
                         Lots of people have guns. You're 
                         American. Americans love guns.

                                     BOURNE
                         I fought my way out of an embassy.  
                         I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- 
                         I went out the window and I was doing 
                         it -- I just did it. I knew how to 
                         do it.

                                     MARIE
                         People do amazing things when they're 
                         scared.

                                     BOURNE
                         Why do I? -- I come in here -- 
                         instinctively -- first thing I do -- 
                         I'm looking for the exit -- I'm 
                         catching the sightlines -- I know I 
                         can't sit with my back to the door --

                                     MARIE
                         You're paranoid. You were shot. It's 
                         natural.

               She's not listening. He leans in. Flat out now.

                                     BOURNE
                         I can tell you the license plate 
                         numbers of all three cars out front. 
                         I can tell you that the waitress is 
                         left-handed and the guy at the counter 
                         weighs two-hundred and fifteen pounds 
                         and knows how to handle himself. I 
                         know that the best, first place to 
                         look for a gun is the cab of that 
                         grey truck outside. I know that at 
                         this altitude I can run flat out for 
                         half a mile before I lose my edge. I 
                         knew that you were my first, best 
                         option out of Zurich? How do I know 
                         all that? How can I know all that 
                         and not know who I am? How is that 
                         possible?

               Long dead pause.

                                     MARIE
                         God, you're not kidding, are you?

               INT. TREADSTONE RESEARCH DESK -- DAY

               BOURNE'S FACE -- a video image frozen on A COMPUTER SCREEN -- 
               it's Bourne looking at the camera -- Bourne looking up at

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               HALF A DOZEN COMPUTER MONITORS -- and lots of shots of Bourne -- 
               twenty angles -- twenty different locations -- twenty candid 
               perspectives of Bourne and his mad scramble through the 
               consulate --

                         What do they have on the streets? 
                         The area. They must have something.

                         Abbott. He knows about the embassy. 
                         He's coming down for a show and tell.

                                     CONKLIN

                                     CONKLIN
                              (turning back --)
                         What's that?

                         It's an angle of the street -- some 
                         sort of alleyway -- you can just...

                         Enhance it.

               INSERT -- THE MONITOR -- as the image enlarges to fill the 
               screen. And there's Bourne. And the little red car. And Marie.

               EXT. ZURICH AIRPORT HOTEL -- NIGHT

               A drone barn. Practically on the runway.

               INT. ZURICH AIRPORT HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

               One of those rooms. Just a plain functional box. MANHEIM 
               laying on the bed. Fully dressed. Suit and tie. Just laying 
               there, staring at the ceiling. Who knows how long he's been 
               like this.

               Just waiting.

               ON THE NIGHTSTAND -- A gun. A knife. His e-phone pager. His 
               fresh credentials. And a photo of Jason Bourne.

               INT. WOMBOSI'S PARIS COMPOUND -- NIGHT

               Quick orientation: Picture a heavily-walled palace just off 
               the Bois Du Boulogne. But once inside you could be back in 
               Brazzaville. It's just a buffet of oddness. Home to fifty 
               children and nine wives. The decor blends money and nouveau 
               riche materialism with a hard, back-home tribal esthetic. 
               It's a visual treat. Not condescending or stupid, but flat-
               out strange and menacing.

               It's late. And the palace is dark and sleepy now, but carry 
               all that through this next series of quick shots --

               WOMBOSI HOUSE SECURITY STATION

               Just inside the door. BODYGUARD #1 slouched before a bank of 
               SECURITY MONITORS.

               WOMBOSI MAIN HALLWAY

               Littered with toys. Children's crap everywhere. BODYGUARD 
               #3. Snoozing on a Louis Quatorze chair draped with African 
               cloth.

               WOMBOSI THRONE ROOM DOORS

               DEAUVAGE -- head bodyguard -- posted outside this imposing 
               set of doors. He's trying to stay awake. Reading a spy 
               thriller.

               FINALLY TO

               WOMBOSI'S THRONE ROOM

               And there he is -- the emperor himself -- WOMBOSI on his 
               throne. Except the room is dark and empty. And he's sitting 
               there by himself. A king without a country.

               Sitting there. With a gun in his lap. Drinking hard from a 
               bottle of Jack Daniels.

               Stewing.

               EXT. FRENCH ROADSIDE -- DAWN

               Beautiful morning. The red car parked along the road. BOURNE 
               alone in the passenger seat. Deep asleep. Nestled there.

               And then, he wakes suddenly. Starts. Freaked for a moment. 
               Instantly feeling for the red bag. There it is in his lap. 
               He looks around and --

               MARIE sitting away from the car. She's got a loaf of bread. 
               A soda. Smoking a butt. Same clothes, but her make-up's been 
               washed away. Clean. Simple. Gorgeous.

               BOURNE steps out. Morning legs.

                                     MARIE
                         I needed a break.

                                     BOURNE
                         Where are we?

                                     MARIE
                         We're about an hour away.

                                     BOURNE
                         I can't believe I slept.

                                     MARIE
                         You were tired. Here...
                              (bread and soda --)
                         For twenty-thousand I like to throw 
                         in breakfast.
                              (he takes it)
                         So what do you dream about?

                                     BOURNE
                         I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm 
                         asleep and I can't wake up.
                              (he takes a hit from 
                              her smoke and coughs --)
                         I don't think I smoke.

               Another silence. She's watching him.

                                     MARIE
                         You ever think maybe you have a 
                         family?

                                     BOURNE
                         I thought about it. I don't know.

               She looks away. Was she hoping for another answer?

                                     MARIE
                         I guess it's like Christmas every 
                         day for you, huh?

               INT. TREADSTONE CONKLIN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               MARIE'S FACE -- A PASSPORT PHOTO -- she's eighteen -- she's 
               smiling -- really alive and fresh and --

               CONKLIN behind his desk. ABBOTT staring grimly at the picture --

                                     ABBOTT
                         Who is she?

                                     ZORN
                         Marie Helene Kreutz. She's twenty- 
                         six. Born outside Munich. Father was 
                         a welder. He died in '91. We don't 
                         have the mother. There might be a 
                         step-sister, we're trying to track 
                         that down.
                              (apologetic)
                         It's tough. She's a wanderer. She 
                         pops up on the grid here and there 
                         but... I mean, the last time she 
                         paid an electric bill in Europe was 
                         '94. No taxes. No steady employer. 
                         She's got three arrests. Two 
                         shoplifting cases, one in Spain, one 
                         in Germany. And she actually did 
                         three months in an Italian detention 
                         center for credit card fraud.

                                     ABBOTT
                         No political affiliations?

                                     CONKLIN
                         She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's 
                         a great one.

                                     ABBOTT
                         I'm assuming we're exploring that 
                         possibility.

                                     CONKLIN
                         We're exploring every possibility.
                              (tighter by the moment)
                         We are in pursuit. How much more do 
                         you want me to tell you?

                                     ABBOTT
                         Pursuit would indicate that you know 
                         exactly where he is.

                                     CONKLIN
                         No. Pursuit ends when we know exactly 
                         where he is.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Yes, well, I think we need some fresh 
                         eyes on this problem. I'm bringing 
                         in some people from upstairs.

               CONKLIN hesitates. Inside he's screaming.

                                     CONKLIN
                         We've been down here for two weeks 
                         banging our heads against the wall. 
                         We've been sleeping down here. We 
                         just got our first lead fourteen 
                         hours ago, and now? -- now that we 
                         finally have something to work with -- 
                         you want to bring planning personnel 
                         down here?
                              (real steam)
                         I'd rethink that.

                                     ABBOTT
                         I want a second opinion.

                                     CONKLIN
                         This is an operations desk.

                                     ABBOTT
                         I'm not asking.

               EXT. PARIS STREET NEAR BOURNE'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               THE LITTLE RED CAR cruising through town.

               INT. THE LITTLE RED CAR -- DAY

               MARIE driving. BOURNE checking building numbers as they pass --

                                     BOURNE
                         Slow down. No, don't stop. Just...

                                     MARIE
                              (looking over)
                         That's it? Is that it?

               AN APARTMENT BUILDING. Big building. Elegant but cold.

                                     BOURNE
                         Four-fifty. That's the address...

                                     MARIE
                         Looks familiar?

                                     BOURNE
                         No.
                              (staring back as they 
                              pass --)
                         No. Go around. Keep going...

               MARIE pulling up -- turning a corner -- watching him as she 
               does. But he's pre-occupied -- eyes scanning -- taking it 
               all in --

                                     MARIE
                         Where?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yeah. Pull in here. Park it.

               MARIE angles into an alleyway. Cuts the engine.

                                     MARIE
                         So this is it, right?

                                     BOURNE
                         I guess.

               Dead pause. She's waiting. He's still scanning the street.

                                     MARIE
                         I should go.

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't remember any of this.

                                     MARIE
                         Jason...

               He turns back. She's staring at him.

                                     BOURNE
                         Sorry. The money, right?

               Before she can say anything, he's digging in the backpack. 
               He pulls out another stack of hundreds. Hands it over. She 
               takes it. It's not what she wanted, but she's used to being 
               disappointed. Fighting it.

                                     MARIE
                         Okay, so...

                                     BOURNE
                         Thanks for the ride.

                                     MARIE
                         Anytime.

               Silence. That moment. He focuses. Getting it.

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, I don't know what's up there.

                                     MARIE
                         You got me pretty fucking curious.

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, you could come up. Or you could 
                         wait if you want. I could go check 
                         it out. You could wait.

                                     MARIE
                         Nah...
                              (hide the pain)
                         With you, I mean, you'd probably 
                         just forget about me, right?

                                     BOURNE
                         How could I forget about you?
                              (he smiles)
                         You're the only person I know.

               MARIE smiles. We've never seen it before. Worth waiting for.

               INT. PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING FOYER -- NIGHT

               BOURNE and MARIE standing at the directory. Five apartments. 
               One per floor. Five names. A buzzer. An intercom. There it 
               is.

               J. Bourne.

               BOURNE presses the buzzer. After a moment, he presses again. 
               Nothing.

                                     MARIE
                         I guess you're not home.

               BOURNE checking the door. How to pop it open? Just about to 
               get into it, when --

                                     CONCIERGE (O.S.)
                              (from the shadows 
                              inside --)
                         Monsieur Bourne...I'm coming...

               THE CONCIERGE is sixty. Plump and proper.

                                     CONCIERGE
                              (opening the door --)
                         Mr. Bourne, there you are -- I was 
                         wondering -- I haven't seen you --

                                     BOURNE
                         Here I am.

               THE CONCIERGE looking at BOURNE like maybe she's never seen 
               him look like this before. And she's looking at MARIE like 
               here's the reason her tenant looks like such shit.

                                     BOURNE
                              (he tries a smile)
                          I seem to have lost my key.

               THE CONCIERGE nods. Instant chilly disapproval.

                                     CONCIERGE
                         I've been ringing your bell. It's 
                         good you were away. We had some 
                         trouble with the hot water. It's 
                         been repaired.

                                     BOURNE
                         Great. We could use a shower.
                              (they look like shit --)
                         It was a long drive.

               THE CONCIERGE steps aside and --

               INT. PARIS APARTMENT FIFTH FLOOR LANDING -- DAY

               BOURNE and MARIE at the apartment threshold. He has a key 
               now.

               Turning it. And the door opens...

               Nothing...

               No bombs. No wife and kids. No one.

               INT. PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY

               A huge, rambling flat. Large entry hallway. Large rooms beyond 
               that. It's obviously expensive. But cold. Completely 
               impersonal. No photographs. No mementoes. No human history.

               WE'RE MOVING NOW

               THE LIVING ROOM

               BOURNE and MARIE exploring.

                                     MARIE
                         It's big.

               BOURNE silent. Struggling to get a feel for the place.

                                     MARIE
                         This is like a real apartment.
                              (she likes it)
                         This is really yours?

                                     BOURNE
                         I guess so.

               MARIE taking it in fast. BOURNE seems paralyzed. Trying to 
               soak it all in. Willing himself home. Touching things as he 
               passes. As if a texture, a smell -- something will become 
               familiar. He's deep into this as we go to --

               THE BEDROOM

               MARIE in the doorway. Checking it out. It's so clean and 
               simple. But it's not the decor she's most interested in...

               MARIE opening an armoire...

               Nothing but men's clothes. No competition. She's feeling 
               better by the moment as we go to --

               THE KITCHEN

               Like a stage set. Lots of props and no sign of food. BOURNE 
               picking up a frying pan.

                                     BOURNE
                         This is my frying pan.
                              (and then --)
                         This is my spoon.
                              (trying harder)
                         I'm Jason Bourne and this is my 
                         kitchen.

               THE MASTER BATHROOM

               MARIE still on the prowl. Mirror city. Big tub. One 
               toothbrush.

               AN OFFICE STUDY

               There's a desk. Chair. Phone. Basic. BOURNE with a folder in 
               his hand. Staring at the bookshelves. Binders, reference 
               materials and hardbound volumes -- all of it about maritime 
               law. Ship schedules. Registry catalogs. All about boats.

                                     MARIE
                         This is your office?
                              (from the doorway)
                         God, you live like a monk...

                                     BOURNE
                         All this stuff -- it's all about 
                         boats.
                              (looking up)
                         I think I'm in the shipping business.

                                     MARIE
                         See. It's starting to come back, 
                         yeah?
                              (he sort of nods)
                         You mind if I take a bath?

                                     BOURNE
                         Go ahead.

               MARIE backs out. BOURNE alone again. Standing there for a 
               moment. Dealing with it.

               And then he sits down in a chair.

               BOURNE sitting there. Staring. The room, the desk -- it's 
               all so devoid of personality. And then, something catches 
               his eye and --

               INSERT -- THE DESK TOP -- a faint silhouette through the 
               dust and grime. Outlines of where a computer used to sit.

               BOURNE reaching suddenly under the desk. Bingo. Pulling out 
               a retractable computer keyboard tray. But it's empty. No 
               keyboard. Now he's really confused and --

               INSERT -- A PHONE/ANSWERING MACHINE -- BOURNE pressing the 
               playback button and --

                                     PHONE MACHINE
                         "You have no messages."

               BOURNE leaving that for a moment -- about to anyway -- and 
               then he turns back -- new idea -- pressing for the speaker 
               phone -- and then hitting redial and --

               THE PHONE stars dialing...

               RINGING and...

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         Bonjour, Hotel Marboeuf...

               BOURNE quick grabbing the receiver. Taking it off speakerphone 
               and --

                                     BOURNE
                         ...yes -- oui -- uh...

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         Yes, sir. Hotel Marboeuf, Paris.  
                         How can I direct your call?

                                     BOURNE
                         Paris?

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         Yes, sir...
                              (switching to English, 
                              thinking that's his 
                              problem --)
                         How can I help you?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason 
                         Bourne.

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         One moment, please...
                              (a long pause, and 
                              then --)
                         I'm afraid, I have no one by that 
                         name registered, sir.

                                     BOURNE
                         D'accord... Merci.
                              (about to hang up--)
                         Un moment -- un moment --

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         -- sir? --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- hang on -- I need you to check 
                         another name for me -- hang on -- un 
                         moment, s'il vous plait --

               BOURNE grabbing the backpack -- tearing through it -- where 
               is it? -- where is it? -- shit and money falling out and --

               There it is -- from the safe-deposit box -- that piece of 
               card stock -- the one with no passport attached to it --

                                     BOURNE
                              (reading it)
                         Kane. Do you have Mr. John Michael 
                         Kane?

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         One moment, sir.

               BOURNE waiting. And then there's muzak -- holding music and --

               THE MASTER BATHROOM

               Water running in the tub. MARIE pulling off her boots. 
               Checking the temperature.

               THE OFFICE STUDY

               Bourne still on hold. And then --

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                              (a new voice suddenly)
                         Bonjour? Monsieur? Allo...

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes, I'm here...

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         You call about Monsieur Kane? John 
                         Michael Kane?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes. Is he there?

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         You are a friend of his?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes.

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         I have some very bad news for you, 
                         sir. I'm terrible sorry to have to 
                         tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has 
                         passed away almost two weeks ago...

               Silence. BOURNE is rocked. But the Manager, it's natural, he 
               interprets the silence as grief...

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         There was an accident. On the 
                         motorway. Apparently, he was killed 
                         instantly. Really, I'm terrible sorry 
                         to be the one to tell you this...

                                     BOURNE
                         ...I understand...

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         ...we actually, we were unaware for 
                         several days that this had happened. 
                         When they came for his things, it 
                         was made known for us, you see?

                                     BOURNE
                         Who? Who came?

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         His brother. You know his brother?

                                     BOURNE
                         Right. Yes. Of course.

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         It's very bad this. Terrible sad. 
                         Such a young man.

                                     BOURNE
                         Do you -- his brother -- do you have 
                         a phone number?

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         I think not...
                              (quick French to 
                              someone in the office 
                              there --)
                         No, I'm sorry. It was very sudden. 
                         He was here very briefly.

               BOURNE just hands up the phone. Just like that. Not even 
               goodbye. Standing there frozen. Stunned. John Michael Kane 
               is dead. And he had the passport.

               Suddenly, everything's changed. They shouldn't be here. This 
               is bad. Danger.

               THE MASTER BATHROOM

               MARIE playing with her hair in the mirror. Checking the water --

                                     MARIE
                              (calling out to him --)
                         She wasn't kidding about the water. 
                         It's freezing.

               THE OFFICE

               BOURNE frozen there. On alert. He forces a smile. Decoy mood.

                                     BOURNE
                         Hang on. I'll check the kitchen...
                              (moving out of the 
                              office --)
                         Maybe it takes a while to get all 
                         the way upstairs.

               THE KITCHEN

               BOURNE moving to the sink. He's smiling. Upbeat. But it's an 
               act. His eyes are everywhere. Turning on the water. But 
               ignoring it. What he's really doing is searching out a weapon. 
               Pulling A KNIFE very quietly from behind the stove. Holding 
               it. Feels pretty comfortable. Hiding it down by his side. On 
               the move again, now --

                                     BOURNE
                         Yeah, it's cold in here, too...
                              (calling to her as he 
                              goes --)
                         Let's give it another minute.

               BOURNE like we've ever seen him. Like an animal. Every sound -- 
               every breeze -- everything carries information.

               Standing still. Taking it all in.

               Real quick layout -- there's big windows along one wall that 
               face out to the street below. The hallway to the bedroom and 
               bath feeds into the living room from one side. There is a 
               large frosted airshaft window along that hallway wall. Simple 
               furniture.

                                     MARIE
                              (suddenly --)
                         -- omigod! --
                              (she's behind him --)
                         -- what're you? -- no -- no --

               MARIE backing away -- completely freaked -- BOURNE standing 
               there with the knife in his hand and --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- no -- Marie -- no! -- it's not 
                         like that --

                                     MARIE
                         -- please -- Jason -- omigod --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- quiet -- quiet --

               MARIE -- frightened -- confused -- paralyzed for a moment --

               BOURNE glancing back -- a curtain fluttering behind him -- 
               motioning for MARIE to get down -- do it -- now -- down!

               MARIE hesitating and --

               BOURNE -- what's he doing? -- he's unscrewing a lightbulb 
               from a lamp beside him and --

               MARIE about to say something -- he shakes her off --

               BOURNE -- knife in one hand -- lightbulb in the other -- 
               putting his foot on a chair in front of him and --

                                     MARIE
                         ...what are you doing?...

               BOURNE waving her to shut up -- crawl -- now -- back up -- 
               get under the window -- go! --

               MARIE -- he seems so sure -- it's weird, but she's doing it -- 
               she's under that frosted window -- down below the sill -- 
               looking back -- what the fuck is he doing now? --

               BOURNE -- the lightbulb -- he's tossing it across the room -- 
               over her head -- into that frosted window and --

               As she ducks down --

               As it SHATTERS --

               EVERYTHING STARTS HAPPENING AT ONCE

               PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT! -- silenced automatic 
               weapons fire -- raking into the apartment and --

               THE FROSTED WINDOW peppered with holes and --

               MARIE on the floor as THE WINDOW SHATTERS above her and --

               CASTEL -- he's in the airshaft! -- hanging from an abseil 
               rope -- but off guard -- FIRING BLIND -- strafing the 
               apartment and --

               BOURNE kicking that chair across the room and --

               CASTEL reacting -- instinct -- moving target --

               THE CHAIR just strafed to shit and --

               BOURNE rolling away and --

               CASTEL -- he's coming in -- last pieces of window frame 
               CRASHING AWAY as he swings into the apartment and --

               MARIE -- right below him -- shit raining down as he flies in 
               and --

               BOURNE throwing the knife and --

               CASTEL -- turning -- too late -- the knife catching him in 
               the neck and --

               BOURNE -- in motion -- attacking and --

               CASTEL -- knife impaled in his neck -- clawing for it with 
               one hand -- trying to get off a shot and --

               APARTMENT WALL -- PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT! -- gunfire 
               tearing wildly around the room and --

               BOURNE -- full-stop -- kicking the gun -- kicking it up -- 
               ROUNDS TEARING ACROSS THE CEILING and --

               MARIE -- SCREAMING NOW -- trying to crawl away and --

               CASTEL -- no chance -- off balance -- BOURNE -- his open 
               palm driving up into CASTEL'S JAW -- the body wants to fall 
               backward, but BOURNE has the guy's arm in his free hand -- 
               jerking it like rope -- tearing it from it's socket and --

               THE GUN CLATTERING FREE across the floor and --

               BOURNE -- his knee -- like a piston -- hard into CASTEL'S 
               GUT -- and then down -- his foot -- down into CASTEL'S KNEE, 
               shattering it and --

               CASTEL is on the floor -- stunned -- wiped -- knife pouring 
               blood from his neck -- arm hanging like a rag doll -- bone 
               torn through his pant leg above the knee and --

                                     MARIE
                         omigod -- omigod -- what're you doing? -- 
                         what're you doing? --
                              (incoherent fear and 
                              confusion, German 
                              and English and--)
                         -- what is he? -- what've you? -- 
                         omigod -- what is this? --

               BOURNE ignoring her -- grabbing the guy's backpack --

                                     MARIE
                         -- what're you doing? -- Jason, 
                         please, tell me what's happening!

                                     BOURNE
                         Open it --
                              (tossing Castel's 
                              backpack behind him --)
                         -- do it -- what's he got in there?

               CASTEL -- eyes wild -- tries to make his feet --

                                     BOURNE
                         Who are you?
                              (kicking him down--)
                         -- who are you?

               CASTEL -- crablike against a wall -- bloody hands leaving a 
               mess as he struggles to get to his feet --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- who are you? -- tell me who you 
                         are -- who sent you? --
                              (bearing down)
                         -- what is this about? -- YOU'VE GOT 
                         TO TELL ME WHAT THIS IS ABOUT! --

               CASTEL -- staring back -- eyes wild -- mouth shut -- his 
               expression -- is it terror or pure steel? --

                                     BOURNE
                         WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?

                                     MARIE
                              (suddenly from behind)
                         ...omigod, no...

               MARIE -- the guy's backpack -- something in her hand -- and 
               as freaked out as she was a moment ago -- this is worse --

                                     BOURNE
                         What? -- what? --
                              (attention split --)
                         -- what is it?

                                     MARIE
                         ...this is my picture... he's got my 
                         picture --
                              (holding it up, in 
                              horror --)
                         -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- 
                         this... this... this is yesterday --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- just --

                                     MARIE
                         -- where does this come from? --
                              (to Castel)
                         How do you have my picture?

                                     BOURNE
                         Marie, just --
                              (waving her back --)
                         -- just stay there! -- just --

                                     MARIE
                         -- he's got my picture! -- this is 
                         yesterday! -- this is me! --
                              (out of control now --)
                         -- where did you get my picture? --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- let me do this, okay? --

                                     MARIE
                         -- do what? -- what are you doing? -- 
                         he's got my picture --
                              (just apoplectic --)
                         -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- 
                         he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- 
                         look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- 
                         omigod --

               Now there's KNOCKING AT THE DOOR and --

                                     THE CONCIERGE
                              (muffled but urgent)
                         Mister Bourne! Mister Bourne! What's 
                         going on? Is everything all right in 
                         there?
                              (-- and she keeps 
                              banging and --)

               MARIE is past the point of rationality and CASTEL is bleeding 
               and shaking and BOURNE is trying to think and it's just 
               impossible and --

               Suddenly -- CASTEL is moving! -- and fast -- it's superhuman -- 
               unbelievable -- just enough spring in his good leg and --

               BOURNE bracing himself but --

               CASTEL isn't attacking! -- he's running away -- he's crossing 
               the living room -- but there's nowhere to go -- absolutely 
               nowhere -- except --

               THE WINDOW

               CASTEL hurling himself into the glass and --

               EXT. THE PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY

               WINDOW SHATTERING! -- CASTEL -- in a cloud of broken glass -- 
               sixty feet above the street --

               Falling and falling and...

               IMPACT! -- landing on the roof of a parked car and --

               INT. THE PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY

               THE APARTMENT -- BOURNE in motion -- five things at once -- 
               checking the window -- kicking the gun away -- grabbing the 
               red bag -- grabbing what he can -- no time to spare and --

                                     THE CONCIERGE
                              (still outside the 
                              door--)
                         --I'm calling the police, Mr.  Bourne -- 
                         you give me no choice -- I'm calling 
                         them right away! --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- your shoes -- Marie! -- where? -- 
                         where are your shoes? -- Marie --

               MARIE standing there in utter shock -- paralyzed -- the 
               picture in her hand -- the broken glass -- all of what just 
               happened --

                                     MARIE
                         He's dead isn't he?

                                     BOURNE
                         Marie -- look at me -- there's no 
                         time for this --

                                     MARIE
                         He went out the window -- why? -- 
                         why would someone do that?

                                     BOURNE
                         -- we can't stay here -- I can't 
                         stay here -- it's not safe here --

                                     MARIE
                         He came to kill us.

                                     BOURNE
                         -- we can go -- I can get us out of 
                         here -- but we have to go now --

                                     MARIE
                         You knew he was coming.

                                     BOURNE
                         No.

                                     MARIE
                         I trusted you.

                                     BOURNE
                         You're wrong. I didn't know.

                                     MARIE
                         I don't trust anybody and I trusted 
                         you!

                                     BOURNE
                         I didn't know this would happen.

                                     MARIE
                         He had my picture! He knew I was 
                         here! He came here to kill us!

                                     BOURNE
                         And where is he now?
                              (that gets her quiet)
                         You believe what you want, but I'm 
                         telling you the truth -- I never 
                         would have brought you here if I 
                         thought it was dangerous.

                                     MARIE
                              (totally overwhelmed)
                         Oh, Jesus...

                                     BOURNE
                         You stay -- if you want, you stay -- 
                         it's okay -- it's better -- maybe 
                         it's better -- I don't know --
                              (starting to back 
                              away --)
                         But I can't stay here. I can't.

                                     MARIE
                         But the police --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- there's no time --

                                     MARIE
                         -- we'll explain it --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- how? --

                                     MARIE
                         -- there's two of us -- we'll tell 
                         them -- we'll just --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- forget it --

                                     MARIE
                         -- we'll tell them what happened --

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know what happened!
                              (huge here)
                         I don't know who he is! I don't know 
                         what he wants! I don't even know who 
                         I am! The only thing I know is that 
                         if I stay here, I'm never gonna find 
                         out!

               BOURNE -- that's it -- grabbing the backpack -- pulling it 
               on -- just about to make his move --

               She's standing there. Just utterly swamped. Lost.

                                     BOURNE
                         Come with me.
                              (she turns back, he's 
                              waiting --)
                         I can get us out of here. I know it. 
                         Then we can think. Then we can work 
                         it out. We'll explain it then.  Once 
                         we're safe.
                              (rock solid)
                         I can protect you.

               EXT. THE PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY

               A CROWD is gathered around CASTEL'S BODY. Rubberneckers and 
               people pointing up to the broken window -- THE CONCIERGE 
               running out to the street and getting the news and THE SOUND 
               OF SIRENS bleeding in from the distance and --

               THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO FIND

               THE LITTLE RED CAR pulling out of the alley. Turning away 
               from the scene. Disappearing into the streets of Paris --

               INT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND MAIN HALLWAY -- DAY

               THRONE ROOM DOORS flying open -- WOMBOSI exploding out into 
               the hallway --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- No! -- I say, no! -- they go this 
                         far -- out a body in the grave -- 
                         another body! -- no! -- this isn't 
                         over -- these people are not finished -- 
                         nothing will make them finish until 
                         they have Wombosi! -- the real Wombosi -- 
                         until I'm the one in the box! --

               SIX KIDS -- TWO WIVES -- THREE BODYGUARDS -- all startled by 
               this steamrolling mass of energy and paranoia --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- what are you doing? --
                              (bearing down on 
                              Bodyguard #2 --)
                         -- sleeping? --
                              (to Deauvage --)
                         -- he's sleeping! -- this man is 
                         sleeping at his post! --
                              (kicking the chair 
                              out from under him --)
                         -- I've had men killed for this! --
                              (but he's still moving --)
                         -- you think these people? -- these 
                         people who come for me -- you think 
                         they sleep? -- they never sleep! -- 
                         they spend all the day -- all the 
                         night -- all time thinking about how 
                         to put Wombosi in that box! --
                              (he's just gonna keep 
                              going, and we're 
                              into--)

               A MASSIVE ONE-TAKE TRACKING SHOT

               DEAUVAGE on his feet -- racing to follow -- KIDS scattering 
               out of the way -- THE WIVES completely unfazed and --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- there is no box for Wombosi! -- 
                         they don't have a box that can hold 
                         me! -- I know these people -- I know 
                         they never sleep! -- I know they 
                         never stop! -- they never stop until 
                         the knife is at their throat! --
                              (suddenly distracted --)
                         -- what is the window? -- this window 
                         is open! -- who leaves this open! --
                              (before Deauvage can 
                              possibly respond --)
                         -- this is a war, you fool! -- you 
                         think these people are like you? -- 
                         you think this is stupid people? -- 
                         careless people? -- these people see 
                         an open window, they reach in with a 
                         big hand and grab your heart until 
                         you die! --
                              (still rolling as--)

               WE'RE HEADING DOWN TO THE POOL

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- and it won't just be me! -- they 
                         don't just want Wombosi now! -- they 
                         want my babies -- they want my 
                         children! -- and I say no! --
                              (grabbing Deauvage --)
                         -- you leave that window open again, 
                         you better pray they kill me --
                              (something's caught 
                              his ear in the 
                              distance and now 
                              he's trying to get 
                              there --)
                         -- everything changes here now! -- 
                         everyone is a soldier here now! -- 
                         this is a fortress now! Are we clear 
                         with this?

                                     DEAUVAGE
                         Yes, sir. All clear.

               WOMBOSI stops to look at DEAUVAGE. In the background, we can 
               hear A CHILD CRYING by the pool --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         This man is out there. Kane is out 
                         there. And they pretend he's dead. 
                         That means he's coming back.

               WOMBOSI moving quickly now and WE'RE STILL TRACKING -- taking 
               him into --

               THE POOL AREA

               FORTY KIDS going nuts in the water. ONE KID crying. WOMBOSI 
               like a shot -- picking the kid up -- drying his tears -- 
               making a funny face -- getting a smile as --

               AN ELECTRONICS CONSOLE. Super-tech. Meters -- LEDs -- wave-
               form analyzers -- audio spectrum filters -- all of this gear 
               dancing and responding to every nuance of --

               BOURNE'S VOICE -- OVER SPEAKERS -- we're listening to a 
               recording of the call he made from the apartment to the Hotel 
               Marbeouf Paris --

                                     BOURNE/TAPE
                         "Okay. Merci."
                              (pause)
                         "Un moment -- un moment --"

                         another name for me -- hang on -- un

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               A secret studio buried deep in the Langley facility. Equipment 
               up the ass. Five people in this darkened room: AN ENGINEER 
               working the board. CONKLIN looking sour. ZORN in the shadows. 
               ABBOTT sitting there waiting for analysis from --

               MRS. DOYLE. She's late sixties. A long-time spy shrink. An 
               eminence. A diamond-hard, seen-it-all intelligence.

                                     BOURNE/TAPE
                         "Kane. John Michael Kane."

                                     OPERATOR/TAPE
                         "One moment, sir."

               MRS. DOYLE nods to THE ENGINEER. She's heard enough.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         He's not lying. He's very highly 
                         stressed, but he's not lying. He's 
                         confused. He's aggressively searching 
                         for a way out of the chaos. This 
                         conversation, the video from the 
                         consulate -- the body language, vocal 
                         pattern -- it's my sense he's really 
                         lost here.
                              (beat)
                         I think he snapped.

                                     CONKLIN
                         Is that a medical term?

               She turns. Battle lines drawn.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         You want clinical terminology? It's 
                         called, "conversation hysteria."
                              (to Abbott now --)
                         I don't know exactly how you train 
                         these people. I'm not sure I want to 
                         know. I'll take a guess there's some 
                         extremely rigorous behavior 
                         modification going on here.

               Silence. The idea dangling for a moment.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Let's assume that's true.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         You can only wind people so tight. 
                         Even machines break down.

                                     CONKLIN
                         This unit has an unblemished record 
                         of success.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         Then I guess I'm in the wrong meeting.

               EXT. BELLVILLE CAR PARK -- DUSK

               BOURNE and MARIE stashing the red car.

               INT. CIA HALLWAY UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY

               ABBOTT and CONKLIN walk and talk. They want to get loud, but 
               they can't. Too many people passing by --

                                     CONKLIN
                         That was two hours -- two hours to 
                         get a second opinion -- and nothing 
                         changes. He's loose. He's out of 
                         control. It's very clear what needs 
                         to happen.
                              (point blank)
                         I have work to do.

                                     ABBOTT
                         What if he is working for someone 
                         else? What if he turned?

                                     CONKLIN
                         Turn? To who? Where does he turn? 
                         What does he have to offer? He's got 
                         nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece 
                         of equipment for crissake. Where's 
                         he gonna turn?

               EXT. HOTEL DE LA PRIX -- NIGHT

               Funky. Out of the way. Cash and carry. No-questions-asked 
               kind of flop. Our establishing shot somehow includes THE 
               PROPRIETOR and HIS DOG.

               INT. THE HOTEL ROOM BATHROOM -- NIGHT

               HAIR DYE washing down a rusted drain. It's MARIE alone in 
               this crappy little bathroom. Jeans and bra. All of it soaking 
               wet.

               A new hair color.

               A MIRROR. There she is. Her turn to stare at herself and 
               wonder.

               And then she smells something. Smoke...

               INT. THE HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

               It's a shitty little room. BOURNE sitting on the bed. And 
               the smoke is coming from...

               HIS PASSPORT -- the Jason Bourne passport -- on fire. BOURNE 
               holding it as it burns away. Bourne's face -- melting -- 
               bubbling -- finally disappearing, -- BOURNE letting go just 
               before it burns his fingers and --

               BOURNE sits back. And there's MARIE standing there. And she's 
               holding out her passport --

               He looks at her. Big moment.

                                     BOURNE
                         No.
                              (he won't do it)
                         You know who you are. You know what 
                         that's worth? That's everything.
                              (pause)
                         I can't live like this. I can't do 
                         anything until I know who I am. 
                         Believe me, you don't want what I 
                         have.

               He looks away. Silence. And then, she touches him. His 
               shoulder.

               BOURNE almost recoils. Almost. He doesn't know what to do. 
               Doesn't know how to react.

               MARIE in front of him now -- she's taking his hand -- and he 
               hesitates -- looking at her -- is this happening? -- she's 
               taking his hand -- moving it down her body -- staring at him -- 
               both of them silent -- his hand -- her skin -- his mind racing -- 
               he wants this -- wants it in every way -- but it's 
               overwhelming -- when was the last time something like this 
               happened? -- he can't remember -- he doesn't care -- he's 
               pulling her toward him -- and they're kissing -- and you 
               know the rest...

               INT. CDG AIRPORT -- NIGHT

               THE PROFESSOR arriving in Paris.  Coming through the terminal 
               as his pager goes off -- never even stopping as he reads and --

                   ...................................................

               HOTEL SEQUENCE -- SKETCHED ONLY

               HOTEL MARBOEUF PARIS. This is the place that answered the 
               phone when Bourne hit redial in his apartment. This is the 
               place that John Michael Kane was staying when he "died."

               And so begins, the investigation...

               Now, since the presence of danger -- ie Wombosi's guys and/or 
               Treadstone -- is still up in the air, and since this scene 
               could either play very quickly or very long, and since we're 
               not exactly sure where we stand with page count -- this scene 
               is not finished.

               The rules of the scene, however, seem to be thus: Bourne 
               would have to be very nervous about being recognized. If he 
               was Kane and Kane stayed here, he's not the guy to do whatever 
               "social engineering" needs doing.

               Long version? Bourne sets the table and Marie gets the goods. 
               Somehow there's a threat from Treadstone or Wombosi.

               Fast version? It's all results -- we see them execute a plan 
               rather than work it up. MARIE is already in the hotel. In a 
               hotel uniform? Posing as a guest? In any case, she looks 
               very much different than we've ever seen her before.

               She gets close to the office. Hides. Waits. BOURNE calls the 
               desk from a pay phone. Asks for something. We see that some 
               sort of improvised booby-trap has been set inside the hotel 
               to start a fire. In the confusion -- MARIE -- very bravely -- 
               gets into the office. We do a quick cut outside to Bourne 
               waiting and --

               EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE HOTEL MARBOEUF -- DAY

               Walk and talk. BOURNE and MARIE leaving the hotel fast. He's 
               on alert -- always on alert now -- making sure they're not 
               being watched. And she's excited and pumped -- she did it! -- 
               she's got the hotel record in hand --

                                     MARIE
                         You stayed there five times in the 
                         past six months. But I didn't have 
                         time -- I could only get the bill 
                         from the last stay -- you were there 
                         for two days. Some room service -- 
                         there's half a dozen phone calls 
                         here so that's someth--

                                     BOURNE
                              (cutting her off)
                         Who paid the bill?

                                     MARIE
                         It's a company... MPG Capital.

               INT. AN EMPTY OFFICE SUITE -- DAY

               Vacancy wasteland. Dead phone lines hanging. Carpet pulled 
               up. Completely stripped out. BOURNE and MARIE standing there 
               staring.

                                     MARIE
                         This can't be it.

               She turns around -- and what's he doing? -- BOURNE with a 
               piece of paper and pencil -- or something/anything resourceful 
               and handy -- maybe it's carpet lint -- maybe it's breaking 
               the glass on the door and holding it up to the light -- or a 
               rubbing -- anyway, he's doing something ingenious with the 
               glass door --

               And as he's doing this, we're hearing --

               We're watching the MPG LOGO emerge and seeing BOURNE and 
               MARIE react, as we hear --

               BOURNE on the pay phone. MARIE behind him at the bar. He's 
               got a pad and paper. This is all business.

                                     BOURNE
                         Well, where are you? Where am I 
                         calling?

                         -- this is a tire dealership, right?

                                     TELEPHONE VOICE

                                     BOURNE

               Meet RAWLINS. He's a young, jolly Brit -- pink and overfed -- 
               and quite shocked to see...

                                     RAWLINS
                         Mr. Kane...

                                     BOURNE
                         Thanks.

               BOURNE just trying to feel his way through this...

                                     RAWLINS
                         Well...
                              (really thrown)
                         I must admit, when my assistant told 
                         me you were here I was, really -- I 
                         was quite -- I was surprised.

                                     BOURNE
                         Really.

                                     RAWLINS
                         We thought you were gone for good.

                                     BOURNE
                         Did you?

                                     RAWLINS
                         Well, I mean it's a tough business, 
                         isn't it? Cutthroat.

               A long awkward beat. Neither of them sure where to go.

                                     RAWLINS
                              (finally)
                         Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- 
                         but definitely at the high end of 
                         competitive -- when we didn't hear 
                         back from you, we did some re-analysis 
                         of the numbers, and honestly, we'd 
                         really like a chance to do a bit 
                         better.
                              (pitching now)
                         I'm assuming you're still in the 
                         market. It's the same vessel?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes.

                                     RAWLINS
                         We just picked up a job quite like 
                         the one we were bidding for you. 
                         Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- 
                         five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think 
                         we learned a few things that might 
                         allow us to make our proposal for 
                         your job, as I said, a bit more 
                         competitive.

                                     BOURNE
                         Okay.

               Another beat. Rawlins holding back until now...

                                     RAWLINS
                         Was it the break-in?

                                     BOURNE
                         Excuse me?

                                     RAWLINS
                         We also thought we hadn't heard from 
                         you -- we've had a bit of a publicity 
                         nightmare, people have been talking.
                              (the meat)
                         Our offices were broken into -- 
                         vandalism mostly -- shortly after we 
                         last spoke.

                                     BOURNE
                         I hadn't heard.

               RAWLINS smiles. Reset. Sales mode.

                                     RAWLINS
                         Let me get you a new copy of the 
                         proposal.

                                     BOURNE
                         That'd be great.

               BOURNE entering. And there's MARIE in the back working a 
               payphone -- waving for him to sit -- she's onto something.

               BOURNE sits. Pulls out the Alliance Security Brochures and 
               literature. Flipping through it. Boats. Water. He's getting 
               closer. Pictures of yachts and various security blurbs and a 
               list of references for huge yachts -- jobs they've done in 
               the past...

                                     MARIE
                         I found it.
                              (standing there)
                         It took six calls.
                              (she's creeped out)
                         I found Kane. I found the body.

                                     BOURNE
                         Let's go --
                              (already standing --)
                         We got to get away from this phone.

               INT. PARIS MORGUE FRONT DESK -- NIGHT

               THE TWO MORGUE ATTENDANTS watching BOURNE put down a hundred 
               dollar bill. MARIE standing a little off -- she will not be 
               comfortable in the morgue.

                                     ATTENDANT #1
                              (picking up the cash)
                         What was the name again?

                                     BOURNE
                         Kane. John Michael Kane.

                                     ATTENDANT #2
                         It's number 121.

                                     BOURNE
                         I want to see the body.

                                     ATTENDANT #1
                         Our boss could come back. We're not 
                         supposed to.

               BOURNE pulling out another hundred and --

               MORGUE FREEZER ROOM

               It's showtime. MARIE back by the door. BOURNE right on it. 
               ATTENDANT #1 pulling open the freezer and...

               BOURNE sags. ATTENDANT #1 looking baffled.

                                     MARIE
                         What?

               INSERT -- FREEZER #121 -- it's empty.

                                     MORGUE BOSS (O.S.)
                              (from behind them --)
                         What the hell's going on here?

               Here comes the boss back from his break -- a little drunk?

                                     ATTENDANT #1
                         This guy, he came to see the American, 
                         but the body, it's missing.

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         They came last night.  His brother.

                                     ATTENDANT #2
                         It's not in the book.

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         Who are these people?
                              (now English to Bourne)
                         Who are you? What's going on here?

                                     BOURNE
                         Where did this body go?

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         I said, someone came last night --
                              (big attitude now)
                         Look, this isn't a carnival -- people 
                         call and they make an appointment 
                         and they follow the rules -- everyone 
                         signs in and out -- this is a serious 
                         place -- serious work -- it's not 
                         just to come in whenever you like --

                                     BOURNE
                              (like a shot)
                         Shit, we didn't sign in.

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         So get the hell out of here.

                                     BOURNE
                         Fine. But I'd like to sign in. In 
                         fact, I insist on it. Where's the 
                         book? I gotta sign in --
                              (off and running now --)

               Everybody following -- all of them confused -- and into --

               FRONT DESK AREA

               BOURNE there first -- all forward motion here -- balls out --

                                     BOURNE
                         Is this it? --
                              (the book)
                         -- this is it, right? --

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         -- slow down -- you can't just take 
                         the book like that --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- don't sweat it, I have a pen -- 
                         no problem -- just let me find the 
                         page --
                              (then quick to Marie)
                         -- honey, why don't you wait for me 
                         outside, okay? --

               MARIE trying to take the hint, but she's curious what he's 
               doing --

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         -- we have rules here, this is a 
                         very serious place -- I'm the one 
                         who decides who gets in here, okay? --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- what do I? -- I put the name of 
                         the person I came to see? --

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         -- this is serious business down 
                         here and we cannot have people coming 
                         and going --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- here we go -- I found it --

               But he's not writing -- he's ripping -- tearing the page out 
               of the book --

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         -- what are you? -- what are you 
                         doing? -- you crazy fuck -- you ripped 
                         the book! -- you stupid fucki--
                              (no chance to finish 
                              this, because --)

               BOURNE just slammed him against the wall. Hard. Like a tractor 
               hit him. And fast.

               And that shuts up the room.

               THE TWO ATTENDANTS rushing to help their boss --

               BOURNE grabbing MARIE and pulling her out the door --

               EXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT

               Moments after the morgue. BOURNE striding away. MARIE 
               struggling to keep up. And BOURNE is different now -- zoning 
               in -- he's close -- he's hardening --

                                     MARIE
                         What are you doing? --
                              (he's scaring her)
                         -- Jason -- stop -- talk to me...

               BOURNE ignoring her -- ripping through the Alliance Security 
               brochures -- scanning them as he walks --

                                     MARIE
                         -- I don't know what you're doing 
                         and you're scaring me -- what are 
                         you looking for? -- what just happened 
                         in there? --

                                     BOURNE
                         Nykwana Wombosi.
                              (he stops, holding up 
                              the brochure --)

                                     MARIE
                         What is that?

                                     BOURNE
                         It's a name. Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty 
                         million dollar yacht. He's the proud 
                         owner of an Alliance Security package.
                              (handing her the 
                              brochure --)
                         He also paid a visit to the morgue 
                         to see John Michael Kane.
                              (the ripped-out page --)

                                     MARIE
                         What does that mean?
                              (but he's walking 
                              again --)
                         Jason, what does that mean?
                              (she's trying to catch 
                              up, but he's walking 
                              really fast --)
                         Jason, please... who is he?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.
                              (he's not turning 
                              back again --)

                                     MARIE
                         So what are we doing?

                                     BOURNE
                         Go back to the hotel.

               MARIE just stops. Reeling.

               BOURNE walking away. Into Paris night and --

               INT. CONKLIN'S TREADSTONE OFFICE -- DAY/NIGHT?

               ABBOTT alone here. On the phone. Looking up to see --

                         They found him. They found Bourne.

               ABBOTT jumps off the call. Eyes never leaving ZORN.

               EXT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND -- NIGHT

               BOURNE live. On the street. Bathed in a streetlight. Staring 
               up at a security camera.

               Total hero moment.

               I'm here. I'm waiting. I know you're watching.

               EXT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND -- NIGHT

               Confusion to say the least -- WOMBOSI -- pistol in hand --

               Uglier by the second -- desperation madness --

                         the job. Maybe he's working for 
                         Wombosi. Maybe they want to go on TV 
                         together. Every possibility sucks --

                         Is he here?

               DEAUVAGE doesn't answer -- spinning BOURNE around -- they're 
               really going over him --

               INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM -- NIGHT

               CONKLIN on his feet -- ABBOTT beet red -- this is getting 
               loud --

                                     CONKLIN
                         You don't have the stones for this. 
                         You people come down here and wink 
                         and whisper and we send these guys 
                         out and get it done. And you're clear. 
                         And the guys upstairs get what they 
                         want. And the whole bunch of you are 
                         so stuffed on deniability it's coming 
                         out of your ears.
                              (gauntlet)
                         Well, you know what? You're here 
                         now. What do you want to do?

               ABBOTT just shaking his head no.

               And CONKLIN snaps -- suddenly he's over the console -- there's 
               the button -- and he's pressing it and --

               EXT. NEUILLY ROOFTOPS -- NIGHT

               THE PROFESSOR in position -- roof of the house next door -- 
               hum -- hum -- hum --

               It's the E-PHONE PAGER -- he's just been activated and --

               INT. WOMBOSI'S COMPOUND HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               BOURNE being marched toward the throne room doors -- DEAUVAGE 
               and BODYGUARD #1 flanking him -- KIDS and WIVES staring as 
               he passes -- the way you'd look at a prisoner on the way to 
               the gallows --

               THE BIG DOORS thrown open wide and --

               WOMBOSI on the throne.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Come in.
                              (an imperial gesture)
                         Please...

               BOURNE steps up to the plate.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Did you bring investment advice for 
                         me tonight? It was tax shelters, 
                         wasn't it? Swiss debenture-swaps.

                                     BOURNE
                         MPG Capital.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         I think investment advice from a 
                         dead man, it's a bad idea.
                              (beat)
                         How does it feel to be dead?

                                     BOURNE
                         It's a lot more stressful than I 
                         thought.

               KIDS have started sneaking into the room -- DEAUVAGE is trying 
               to scoot them out but --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- no -- no, let them in! -- let 
                         them in.
                              (to the kids)
                         Come in -- on y va -- come in...
                              (to Bourne)
                         I think everyone wants to see the 
                         dead man.

               BOURNE watching the kids -- they are all staring --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         What do you do?
                              (on his feet now --)
                         You get an appointment with me? You 
                         make sure it's on the boat? You come 
                         visit me -- you pitch me this bullshit 
                         investment package. You drink my 
                         water -- eat my bread -- play with 
                         my children -- and what? -- two nights 
                         later you come back and you put this 
                         death --
                              (slamming something 
                              down onto the throne --)
                         -- you put this in my engine room!

               There is A BOMB on the throne now.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         So this is a different kind of 
                         meeting.
                              (steam building)
                         Maybe now we talk some truth, okay? 
                         One dead man to another.

               BOURNE -- caught off guard as -- WOMBOSI suddenly rips away 
               his jacket -- so hard that he tears straight through to the 
               shirt --

               BOURNE'S BACK -- bare -- two bullet scars -- still raw --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         You see this?
                              (calling to Deauvage --)
                         I told you my shot was better!

                                     DEAUVAGE
                         He went in the water -- how did he 
                         live?

                                     WOMBOSI
                         No, no no...
                              (and he means this --)
                         This is a strong killer. This is a 
                         crazy strong killer. Oh, yeah...
                              (circling)
                         To make a killer that looks like 
                         you? This young? This face?
                              (he means this)
                         It's bloody fucking amazing.

               BOURNE imploding -- this news -- the kids staring at him -- 
               the bomb -- it's all getting loud around him --

                                     BOURNE
                         Who do you think sent me?

                                     WOMBOSI
                         I know who sent you. I don't know 
                         why.
                              (this could get 
                              physical at any moment 
                              now --)
                         I learned many, many things from the 
                         CIA. Many things. I learned the way 
                         they think.
                              (beat)
                         Was the bomb on my boat supposed to 
                         go off or not?

               BOURNE distracted by the kids -- these faces -- it's...

                                     WOMBOSI
                         You didn't set the bomb. Why?

               BOURNE not sure -- about any of it --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Was this a game or a fuck up?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Get the kids out!

               He doesn't have to say it twice -- they know the drill -- 
               they're gone.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         And the door.

               DEAUVAGE closing the doors and as he does --

               THE PROFESSOR ATTACKS...

                   ...................................................

               THIS SCENE HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN

               It's a shootout.

               The Professor is infinitely more talented at this than the 
               bodyguards.

               Bourne needs to get out of there -- without looking wimpy --

               No children are harmed.

               As the Professor rallies -- he will shoot Wombosi -- he will 
               find Bourne's jacket left on the floor (in which later he 
               will find a clue leading him to Belleville) and last but 
               hardly least, he will take a parting shot at the bomb still 
               sitting there on the throne.

               There will be a huge, trailer-worthy explosion.

               This might not want to be very long. There is an extensive 
               action sequence just around the corner.

               So Bourne escapes. Physically he's just weary. Emotionally 
               he's fucked.

               All of that happens and we cut to --

                   ...................................................

               INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT

               CONKLIN flipping out -- THE PROFESSOR is not responding --

                         sir, it's not the unit --

               ABBOTT looks like he might puke. ZORN watching his career 
               burn to the ground around him.

                                     ABBOTT
                         What are you doing?

               CONKLIN grabbing shit -- like a madman --

                                     CONKLIN
                         I'm going to Paris.

                                     ABBOTT
                         No you're not. You're not going 
                         anywhere. I'm shutting this down.

                                     CONKLIN
                         You're not doing shit. You're so 
                         scared you can't even think.

                                     ABBOTT
                         You just blew up a house in Paris! 
                         This program is over. Call it off.

                                     CONKLIN
                         I can't call it off. He's not 
                         responding. Get out of my way.

               CONKLIN splits and --

               INT. THE HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

               It's really late. BOURNE enters the room. MARIE in the corner. 
               Smoked out. Cried out. Lifed out.

               Silence. Not a word.

               His shirt is torn to shit. He scraped-up -- blood here and 
               there. He moves past her into --

               THE BATHROOM

               His hands shaking as he tries to wash them. He bags it.

               THE ROOM

               BOURNE comes out. And there's a long silence until --

                                     MARIE
                         It doesn't matter who you were before. 
                         It's who you want to be. That's all 
                         that matters.
                              (is he listening?)
                         We have this money. We have what we 
                         have. I had nothing before and now, 
                         I don't know, maybe I have more, 
                         maybe it's nothing, but...
                              (he looks over)
                         I say we leave here. We leave this 
                         place. We go until we can't go 
                         anymore.

                                     BOURNE
                         You could do that?

                                     MARIE
                         Yes. That's who I want to be.

               BOURNE nods. Turns off the light. Takes her hand. And they 
               lay in bed. Just laying there.

               INT. PARIS SOMEWHERE -- NIGHT

               THE PROFESSOR cooping somewhere. Tending to his wounds. 
               Ignoring his pager. He's slipped off the grid.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM -- DAWN

               BOURNE and MARIE packing up to hit the road. Together.

                   ...................................................

               DOUG'S ROUGH DRAFT OF THE BIG ACTION SEQUENCE

               INT. HOTEL DE LA PAIX -- LOBBY -- DAY

               MARIE dropping off the key. Hope hangs in the air --

                                     CLERK
                         xxxxxx...

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               BOURNE enters. He's got the black duffel. Car keys.

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx.

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               And now they're headed for the door. Something doesn't feel 
               right for BOURNE -- and then he notices --

                                     BOURNE
                         Stop where you are.

                                     MARIE
                         What?

               Bourne turns back to the CLERK.

                                     BOURNE
                         Where's the dog?

                                     CLERK
                         My husband's out looking for him.

                                     BOURNE
                         He run away often?

                                     CLERK
                         That old beast? Miss his breakfast? 
                         Not a chance.
                              (returning to cleaning)
                         It's always something, right?

               Suddenly -- just like that -- everything's different --

                                     BOURNE
                         Get in the basement.

                                     CLERK
                         What?

                                     BOURNE
                              (to Marie)
                         Get everyone down in the basement.

               Now MARIE doesn't need a second warning --

                                     CLERK
                         What the hell're you talking about?

                                     BOURNE
                         You're in danger. All of you. I have 
                         no time to explain.

                                     CLERK
                         Wait a minute --

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm sorry.

               -- those words -- the way he said it -- she's grabbing her 
               purse, clearing out of the room. Slamming the door behind 
               her -- click -- it's locked.

                                     MARIE
                         Jason...

               No answer -- too busy -- reaching under the check-in desk, 
               coming up with -- A SHOT GUN, an old one, but nonetheless a 
               gun --

                                     MARIE
                         Who is it? Who's out there?

               And now BOURNE is moving, pulling open a drawer.  A box of 
               shells. Filling his pockets.

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         I won't let that happen.

               And he is moving down the small hallway.  Away from the front 
               door -- towards the back door under the stairs.

               EXT. HOTEL DE LA PAIX -- COURTYARD -- DAY

               THE HOTEL BACK DOOR -- kicked open -- BOURNE coming out of 
               the house -- coming hard -- and --

               The small courtyard is empty -- but now the ALARM is going 
               off -- and BOURNE turns back to MARIE -- races to grab her 
               as --

               RATATATAT -- The FRONT DOOR -- WINDOWS -- ARE SHREDDED and -- 
               here comes the PROFESSOR.

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               And now they are running, across this little courtyard. To a 
               wall -- BOURNE is up, on it -- reaching down for MARIE -- 
               grabbing her -- swinging her over the wall as --

               ABM!!! The PROFESSOR SHOOTS.

                                     BOURNE
                         Go!

               MARIE takes off running. BOURNE leans over the wall, FIRES 
               BACK TWICE -- RATATAT -- The WALL IS SHREDDED. BOURNE takes 
               off running -- reloading on the fly.

               Rounds a bend, is chambering two rounds when he sees -- a 
               WOMAN is in her kitchen -- staring at him -- no time to 
               explain -- he turns back --

               The PROFESSOR is just vaulting over the wall. BOURNE FIRES 
               TWICE -- BAM! BAM! But the spray is too wide from this 
               distance. Windows are shattered to both sides of him but -- 
               the PROFESSOR stumbles but keeps going -- blood on his face 
               now -- RATATAT --

               BOURNE has to move. Reloading his almost useless gun. Reaching 
               MARIE -- facing a choice and they climb a wall -- FLOWER 
               POTS EXPLODE around them but they make it -- now --

               RUNNING IN A LABYRINTH -- right -- then left -- through a 
               small staircase. LEAPING a wall -- landing on a STEEP ROOF -- 
               sliding, falling, crashing to the ground in --

               A SMALL COURTYARD -- steep walls on all sides. But there's a 
               large window -- and it's open. And they step through and 
               find themselves --

               INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- BATHROOM -- DAY

               They close the window behind them -- catch their breath --

                                     MARIE
                         Did we lose them?

               BOURNE shakes his head. Tucks the gun under his coat.

                                     MARIE
                         Who is it?

                                     BOURNE
                         We have to keep moving.

               And now he is opening the door -- they step into --

               INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- DAY

               STARTLED KITCHEN WORKERS stare as BOURNE and MARIE calmly 
               walk out of the bathroom and head towards the front door of 
               the empty restaurant. Quiet.

               And then they open the door to the street and --

               EXT. BELLEVILLE -- COMMERCIAL STREET -- DAY

               The first thing we notice is noise. The street is burgeoning 
               with life. The second thing we notice are SIRENS. POLICE 
               CARS approaching. BOURNE and MARIE head down the street, 
               blending in.

               Up ahead -- TWO POLICE CARS snaking through traffic. BOURNE 
               steers them off this crowded street.

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               EXT. BELLEVILLE -- QUIET STREET -- DAY

               And BOURNE and MARIE are hurrying down this street when -- 
               BAM -- The PROFESSOR comes out of a building -- across and 
               down the street. No time to hide -- he's seen them -- he's 
               FIRING.

               BOURNE tackles MARIE to the ground behind a car. RATATAT -- 
               The PROFESSOR is literally shredding it. And now BOURNE is 
               moving --

                                     MARIE
                         What are you doing?

               And BOURNE is on the offensive. BAM! BAM! Moving towards the 
               PROFESSOR who is ducking behind cars on the other side.

               They are shredding the street -- FIRING ruthlessly at each 
               other and -- NOW THE POLICE ARE HERE -- BLOCKING both ends 
               of the street. GUNS are drawn -- BOURNE's vulnerable on two 
               flanks. The COPS are YELLING. And now --

               THE PROFESSOR BLASTS the COPS -- And now things have changed.

               THREE WAY FIREFIGHT and BOURNE grabs MARIE and they dive 
               into --

               INT. SMALL EPICERIE -- DAY

               And the PROFESSOR shreds the store as BOURNE attemps to fire 
               back. SHIT flying everywhere in here -- hard to see and -- 
               The PROFESSOR is advancing on them -- cops are no match for 
               his fire power. They move to the back -- kick open a door --

               INT. HIGHWALLED COURTYARD -- DAY

               BOURNE and MARIE cross this small courtyard, the PROFESSOR 
               is right on their heels. CRASH through a door -- and now 
               they are in --

               INT. SMALL SWEATSHOP -- DAY

               COUPLE of ASIAN WOMEN sewing in here. One MAN in charge -- 
               and BOURNE and MARIE charging through -- the MAN about to 
               say something -- but now the PROFESSOR is on their tail and --

               INT. SMALL AFRICAN SHOP -- DAY

               Making god knows what in here -- vats of something. Small 
               grouping of workers -- BOURNE shutting the door behind him -- 
               it's shredded with BULLET HOLES. BOURNE and MARIE racing to 
               the next door as -- BAM -- the PROFESSOR kicks the door open -- 
               BOURNE about to fire -- but there is a WOMAN right behind 
               the PROFESSOR! Can't do it -- turns to run as -- RATATATAT --

               The PROFESSOR FIRES as BOURNE and MARIE dive into --

               INT. LIVE POULTRY SHOP -- DAY

               And now CHICKEN feathers are flying everywhere -- the glass 
               at the front of the door is shattering. BOURNE and MARIE 
               make it through the gauntlet.

               EXT. BELLEVILLE -- STREET -- DAY

               And BOURNE and MARIE are running. And he is reaching into 
               his pocket -- fishing around -- and just as he pulls out the 
               car keys -- we recognize this as the street they parked their 
               car on and --

               BY MARIE'S CAR

               BOURNE unlocks the door -- pops MARIE's open. And --

               THERE'S A COP -- yelling at them and -- BOURNE hits the gas -- 
               they fly out of their parking space -- BAM!! The COP fires, 
               shattering their windshield and there -- up ahead -- THE 
               PROFESSOR coming out -- about to FIRE -- BOURNE aims for him -- 
               forces him to dive out of the way and -- ONE QUICK MOVE around 
               a TRUCK and they are free.

               INT. THE LITTLE RED CAR

               BOURNE and MARIE looking back nervously -- so far all over --

               ON THE STREET

               The PROFESSOR looking around. PEOPLE staring at him -- covered 
               in blood -- the COP racing up -- yelling -- not yelling for 
               long because the PROFESSOR is firing at him and --

               Now the PROFESSOR is moving -- not running -- just a swift 
               walk and now he's past the truck -- and --

               A MOTORCYCLIST comes flying down the street -- oblivious -- 
               going way too fast for these streets and -- the PROFESSOR 
               swings his gun stock like a bat -- takes him out -- clean 
               and smooth -- bike crashing to the ground and --

               The PROFESSOR grabs the bike and takes off -- SHOOTING at 
               TWO POLICE CARS just racing to the scene and we are into --

               EXT. BELLEVILLE BLVD -- DAY

               HIGH SPEED CAR CHASE. And BOURNE better do some fancy driving 
               because here comes the PROFESSOR -- and he's a lot faster -- 
               much better armed.

               INT. MARIE'S CAR

               BOURNE driving. MARIE looking back -- seeing the PROFESSOR 
               gain on them --

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

               And -- THE PROFESSOR FIRES -- SHREDS the back off their car --

                                     MARIE
                         Give me the gun --

               And now she's got his shotgun, leaning out the window.

                                     BOURNE
                         Wait 'till he's close.

               BOURNE swerves, up on the sidewalk back onto the street -- 
               slaloms through the traffic -- racing towards an intersection 
               and --

               IN THE INTERSECTION

               CARS coming the other way, BOURNE just makes it through -- 
               the PROFESSOR tries to squeeze through -- skidding and --

               CRACK! The PROFESSOR hits the front of a car sideways on his 
               bike -- he is THROWN clear through the intersection, right 
               into the windshield of an oncoming car and --

               He gets up, grabs his gun and works his way towards his bike 
               and now we see --

               EXT. VARIOUS SHOTS AROUND PARIS -- DAY

               COPS are mobilizing -- swarming into this area and --

               BACK TO THE CAR CHASE --

               BOURNE and MARIE pick up a few cops on their tail -- shed 
               all of them -- the last car goes into an EXPLOSIVE FLIP -- 
               the PROFESSOR is now right behind them. And now we are into --

               CRAZY CAR CHASE WITH COPS RIGHT ON THEIR TAIL

               BOURNE, MARIE and the PROFESSOR leave a trail of totaled 
               cars that the cops have to try and navigate through -- finally 
               saying fuck it and hitting a few cars themselves and now we 
               are into --

               CAR CHASE THROUGH NARROW STREETS

               MARIE'S CAR and the MOTORCYCLE can pass where the police 
               cars cannot. BOURNE may be able to shed the cops, but not 
               the PROFESSOR. And now one quick move and they are --

               EXT. QUAI -- DAY

               Racing against traffic up the Seine. Past the Louvre. COPS 
               pursuing on the other side of the river. BOURNE and the 
               PROFESSOR leaving behind a trail of carnage. And now --

               The PROFESSOR is pulling up along side them -- one lane over.  
               Both swerving to avoid oncoming cars and --

               MARIE FIRES -- TWICE -- TAKES out a few windshields. The 
               PROFESSOR fires at the same time -- MARIE'S CAR DOOR -- GONE -- 
               she's totally exposed but --

               THE PROFESSOR -- his BIKE is SPOUTING GAS -- one of the 
               pellets nailed his tank.

               BOURNE AND MARIE --

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               THE PROFESSOR --

               No problem -- he's unwrapping a piece of duct tape from the 
               barrel of his gun -- two seconds and the hole is patched and -- 
               BOURNE AND MARIE -- the side of the car is completely gone -- 
               the PROFESSOR is gaining -- across the river dozens of police 
               cars are racing alongside. Many more can be seen on their 
               side -- a road block ahead -- running out of options and --
               BOURNE turns hard -- crashes over the sidewalk and flies 
               down a side street. A POLICE CAR pulls out behind them -- 
               the PROFESSOR can't stop -- skidding hard, turning the bike 
               sideways, skidding out -- sliding across the ground and 
               BAMMM!!! SMASHING into a GLASS PHONE BOOTH which shatters.

               And he's up -- lifting up his bike and --

               BOURNE AND MARIE

               SIX POLICE CARS on their tail -- more joining. Every street 
               they look down has POLICE CARS racing in parallel. Running 
               out of options and in the background --

               THE PROFESSOR is back in the game -- passing the police cars 
               and up ahead --

               THE ROAD IS BLOCKED. POLICE ROAD BLOCK -- cops with guns. 
               Gotta act quick and -- BOURNE turns hard left -- there's a 
               metro staircase -- only way out and --

               THEY BOUNCE down the stairs. CRASH through the doors down 
               below.

               THE FIRST POLICE CAR -- no way he's following. SLAMMING on 
               his brakes. SKIDDING to a halt -- SKIDDING sideways -- gonna 
               stop in time -- just at the edge of the steps and then --

               THE SECOND POLICE CAR isn't braking -- T-BONES the first car -- 
               BAM!!! -- sends it rolling sideways down the steps until it 
               crashes to a halt at the bottom -- upside down.

               THE PROFESSOR -- he's turning -- heading for a different set 
               of stairs. BOURNE AND MARIE -- crashing through the turnstiles -- 
               people diving out of their way and --

               AT THE STAIRCASE -- THE WINDOW of the POLICE CAR is kicked 
               out and -- TWO VERY ANGRY COPS emerge -- pull their guns out -- 
               head into the station. BOURNE and MARIE's world just got a 
               lot more dangerous and --

               THE PROFESSOR is racing down the other staircase -- an up 
               escalator -- people diving out of the way as --

               BOURNE and MARIE slalom through the station -- suddenly -- 
               there's the PROFESSOR -- parallel corridor -- metal barricades 
               keep them separated. PROFESSOR FIRING.

               UP AHEAD -- a horizon line -- BOURNE guns it -- a steep 
               staircase and -- THEY FLY down the steps -- landing on --

               THE METRO PLATFORM

               The PROFESSOR lands on the other side -- both racing down 
               the platform -- PROFESSOR tearing up the wall behind them 
               and -- HERE COMES A TRAIN -- on BOURNE and MARIE's side -- 
               travelling the opposite way -- temporary refuge. Not for 
               long -- there's no way out on this end of the platform. They 
               skid to a halt -- just as --THE TRAIN DOORS OPEN -- STARTLED 
               STRAPHANGERS stare at BOURNE and MARIE as they stop onto the 
               platform -- take off running.

               THE PROFESSOR has to turn his bike around. He's quick -- but 
               it gives BOURNE and MARIE a two second head start.

               BOURNE AND MARIE almost at the other end of the platform -- 
               gunfire ripping up the windows behind them. Gonna go for the 
               steps -- but here come --

               THE ANGRY COPS -- remember them? -- the ones who took the 
               ride down the steps -- they're firing now and --

               BOURNE AND MARIE turn back -- the PROFESSOR is firing and 
               there is only one option --

               INT. METRO CAR -- DAY

               BOURNE and MARIE into the conductor booth. People diving off 
               the train as BOURNE hits the YELLOW BUTTON and -- the TRAIN 
               STARTS ROLLING -- doors still open -- they disappear into 
               the protection of the tunnel walls -- then BOURNE hits the 
               button to close the doors and -- THE PROFESSOR -- watching 
               the trains accelerate out of the station -- and now he's 
               racing his bike down the platform -- opposite the motion of 
               the train and -- here comes the end of the train and --THE 
               PROFESSOR throws his bike into a skidding 180 and skids off 
               the platform all in one move -- landing hard on the tracks 
               but facing the right direction and now he's accelerating 
               towards the train -- just as an oncoming train is racing 
               into the station and -- HE LEAPS onto the back of the train 
               in the nick of time. His GUN CLATTERS to the tracks.

               IN THE LAST METRO CAR

               The window is shattered and the PROFESSOR lets himself in -- 
               wind whipping through his hair from the shattered windows.  
               And --

               IN THE FIRST METRO CAR

               BOURNE and MARIE finally getting a breather. BOURNE keeps 
               looking back -- nothing -- the train is deserted. Finally --

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

               And ahead -- daylight -- the train tracks go above ground 
               and as the train hits daylight -- we see the PROFESSOR 
               directly behind BOURNE on the other side of the glass and --

               CRASH! The PROFESSOR grabs BOURNE through the glass, ramming 
               his head into the metal as --

               BOURNE grabs the knob, swings the door open and CRUSHES the 
               PROFESSOR -- CRUSHES him again and now he is free and --

               BOURNE turns, pulls up the shotgun and -- the PROFESSOR kicks 
               it out of his hands -- it clatters to the ground and now we 
               have a beat -- THE TRAIN CAR races across the Bir Hakeim 
               bridge -- all of Paris laid out behind them. BOURNE and the 
               PROFESSOR squaring off -- both looking at the gun -- realizing 
               there's no chance for either one of them to get it and --

               A BRUTAL RUTHLESS FIGHT breaks out. BOURNE's motivated -- 
               the PROFESSOR's crazy -- makes it a pretty even match. Looks 
               like it could go on for a little while when suddenly --

               BAM!!! The PROFESSOR drops to the ground -- behind him -- 
               MARIE wields the shot gun.

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

               And BOURNE takes the gun from her -- standing there -- 
               reloading -- both barrels -- raising the gun -- aiming it --

                   ...................................................

               INT. MOVING METRO CAR -- DAY

               THE PROFESSOR sitting there. Like a dummy. Like a puppet 
               that's been propped up. He's fucked -- his whole side ravaged 
               with shot -- his arm shredded -- hand barely there -- blood 
               flowing fast --

                                     BOURNE
                         Who else is coming?

               THE PROFESSOR staring up at the gun. Stunned. Doomed. Mouth 
               dry. Eyes struggling to make sense of the chaos.

                                     BOURNE
                         I won't ask again.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         I work alone. Like you...
                              (confused beat)
                         ...we always work alone.

                                     BOURNE
                         What do you mean?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Who are you? Rome? Paris?
                              (Bourne is just staring --)
                         Treadstone... both of us... I was 
                         warned but...

                                     BOURNE
                         Treadstone?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...which one are you?...

               BOURNE lowering the weapon -- head swimming --

                                     BOURNE
                         Paris. I live in Paris...

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...headaches... you have that... I 
                         get such bad headaches...

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...it's a problem...

               He's losing blood fast -- things inside him seizing up --

                                     BOURNE
                         Treadstone.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...or in a car... when it's dark... 
                         something with the headlights...
                              (circuits exploding)
                         ...pills, right? Treadstone had those 
                         pills...

                                     BOURNE
                         What is Treadstone?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...what did you do?... you must've 
                         really fucked up...

                                     BOURNE
                         I think so.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...someone said caffeine -- for a 
                         headache... doesn't seem...

                                     BOURNE
                         What do they want me to do?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...they won't let you go...

                                     BOURNE
                         Why?

               THE PROFESSOR -- coughing -- a spasm -- helpless --

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Look at this...
                              (all the blood --)
                         ...least you have a woman....

               And he's gone. Like that. Sitting there. And BOURNE looks 
               paralyzed too. Kneeling there. Stalled out.

                                     MARIE
                         Jason...

               BOURNE doesn't answer -- can't, because there's this sound -- 
               this pulsing hum -- BOURNE reaching into THE PROFESSOR'S 
               POCKET and --

               INSERT -- THE E-PHONE PAGER -- covered in blood -- hum -- 
               hum -- hum -- BOURNE'S HAND wiping at the blood that covers 
               the display --

               BOURNE staring at it. Very familiar to him.

                                     MARIE
                         We've got to go.

               INT. METRO CAR -- DAY

               BOURNE and MARIE racing back through the cars -- away from 
               the scene of the crime and --

               EXT. ABOVE-GROUND METRO PLATFORM -- DAY

               THE SHATTERED TRAIN pulling into the station -- doors opening -- 
               SCREAMS ECHOING through the station from up the platform and --

               BOURNE and MARIE getting off the last car and --

               EXT. STREET/ALLEY NEAR THE PLATFORM -- DAY

               Two minutes later. BOURNE and MARIE -- exhausted -- beat -- 
               Everything all at once --

                                     BOURNE
                         Take this.

               She turns. He's holding the locker key.

                                     BOURNE
                         Take it.

               But she doesn't move.

                                     MARIE
                         And that's it?

                                     BOURNE
                         If you're lucky.
                              (it's hanging there)
                         Take it.
                              (beat)
                         There's enough in there to make a 
                         life. Any life. Just get out now. 
                         Get low. Stay low.
                              (beat)
                         Take it.

               She takes it. Staring at him. Simply refusing to cry.

                                     MARIE
                         What was I thinking, right?

                                     BOURNE
                         I can't protect you anymore.

                                     MARIE
                         What about you?

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm gonna find the end of this.
                              (beat)
                         I can't protect you.

               MARIE takes one last look. And she's running --

               BOURNE hangs there a moment -- listening to her go -- and 
               then he pulls out THE E-PHONE PAGER. And it's pulsing like 
               crazy.

               BOURNE flips open the shell. There's a keypad in there.

               Holding it. Like a missing organ.

               INT. THE ZURICH AIRPORT MOTEL ROOM -- DAY

               Remember MANHEIM? He's still there waiting. And his pager 
               goes off, and --

               INT. TREADSTONE PARIS -- NIGHT

               A safehouse -- CONKLIN filling a burn bag -- racing -- 
               everything's going --

               EXT. TREADSTONE PARIS -- NIGHT

               CONKLIN done with the dirty work -- out into the street --

               As he's about to leave -- he hears a sound -- a familiar 
               sound -- hum -- hum -- hum --

               He cross the street -- looks down to the Quai below --

               Holy shit -- there's one of his E-PHONE PAGERS --

               He goes down -- picks it up --

               And now --

                                     BOURNE
                         What did you do to me?

               CONKLIN wheels around. There he is. Right behind him.

                                     CONKLIN
                         What did I do? What've you done? Do 
                         you have any idea? Any conception? 
                         What you've destroyed? Do you have 
                         any idea how much time and work -- 
                         how many people have their lives 
                         wrapped up in this?

               So now you know.

                                     BOURNE
                         Are you Treadstone?

                                     CONKLIN
                         Am I Treadstone? Me?
                              (peering at him closely 
                              now --)
                         What the hell're you talking about?

               BOURNE showing nothing -- or is he trying too hard not to?

                                     BOURNE
                         What did you do to me?

                                     CONKLIN
                         What did I do? I spent thirty million 
                         dollars on you. I spent three years 
                         finding you -- four years training 
                         you --
                              (incredulous)
                         What did I do?
                              (staring now)
                         What in the name of God have you 
                         been doing, Jason?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.

                                     CONKLIN
                         They're right about you, aren't they? 
                         You're fried.
                              (on it now)
                         You really don't know what's going 
                         on, do you?

                                     BOURNE
                         I know you've been trying to kill 
                         me.

                                     CONKLIN
                         Of course. We had to try. We didn't 
                         know what was wrong.
                              (warming to this --)
                         We didn't know you were in trouble.

                                     BOURNE
                         So now you know.

                                     CONKLIN
                         So it's time to go home.

                                     BOURNE
                         That's all I get?

                                     CONKLIN
                         We'll make you better. We can put 
                         the pieces back. We can do that.

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't think so.

                                     CONKLIN
                         We have to go home, Jason.

                                     BOURNE
                         Jason Bourne is dead.

                                     CONKLIN
                         There never was a Jason Bourne.
                              (that gets him)
                         You have to come with me. It's the 
                         only way. We can give it back to 
                         you...

                                     BOURNE
                         Keep it.
                              (and he's walking --)

                                     CONKLIN
                         Jason...
                              (trying to follow --)
                         They can't let you go...

                                     BOURNE
                         That'll be their second worst mistake.

               And with that, BOURNE scrambles up a wall -- like it's nothing -- 
               CONKLIN just left there -- on the Quai -- in the dark --

               EXT. BANKS OF THE SEINE -- NIGHT

               BOURNE walking away -- faster and faster --

               EXT. BANKS OF THE SEINE NEARBY -- NIGHT

               MANHEIM -- A CAR PARKED IN THE DARKNESS -- sitting alone 
               with his briefcase. Opening it. There's his gun.

               BOURNE -- walking -- deeper into the darkness and --

               MANHEIM -- in the dark car -- loading the weapon -- calm -- 
               steady -- methodical and --

               BOURNE -- walking and --

               MANHEIM -- stepping out of the car -- closing the door quietly -- 
               deep in the shadows and --

               BOURNE -- still coming -- the darkest part of the path just 
               ahead and --

               MANHEIM -- raising the gun and --

               THE CAMERA SPINS TO HIS TARGET AND --

               IT'S CONKLIN! -- just climbing back up from the Quai --

               MANHEIM -- the gun -- phftt -- phftt -- phftt --

               CONKLIN -- three holes -- head -- heart -- gut -- his body 
               dropping like a stone beside his car.

               MANHEIM walks over. Looks down. Point blank -- phftt -- that 
               makes it four and --

               INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT

               ABBOTT and ZORN alone in the dark. As a red light begins 
               pulsing on the console.

               That red light means Conklin's dead.

               After a moment, ZORN moves to the console and shuts the light 
               off.

               EXT. BANKS OF THE SEINE -- NIGHT

               BOURNE still walking. And he's just gonna keep on going, as 
               we --

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CIA OPERATIONS CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               MARSHALL at the head of the table. A cadre of INTEL HONCHOS.

                                     ABBOTT (O.S.)
                         The Treadstone project has actually 
                         already been terminated. It was 
                         designed primarily as a sort of 
                         advanced game program...

               ABBOTT in the hot seat. ZORN right there beside him.

                                     ABBOTT
                         ...We'd hoped it might build into a 
                         good training platform, but quite 
                         honestly, for a strictly theoretical 
                         exercise, we thought it was far too 
                         expensive. The cost-benefit ratio 
                         was just too high. It's been all but 
                         decommissioned at this point.

                                     MARSHALL
                         All right, what's next?

               ZORN handing ABBOTT the next hundred pages.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Okay, this is Blackbriar. Blackbriar 
                         is a joint, DOD, communications 
                         program that we really feel has good 
                         traction to it.

               ABBOTT is just gonna go on and on and on.

               EXT. MARTHA'S VINEYARD -- DAY

               Gorgeous Summer day. A SCOOTER RENTAL SHACK near the beach.

               SIX MONTHS LATER

               MARIE coming out of the shack with two helmets. Handing them 
               to A HAPPY COUPLE waiting there on their scooters.

               THE HAPPY COUPLE rides off.

               MARIE turns back and --

               There's BOURNE. A new look. A smile.

                                     MARIE
                         Can I help you?

                                     BOURNE
                         This your store?

                                     MARIE
                         Yes.

                                     BOURNE
                         Think I could rent a scooter?

                                     MARIE
                         You have ID?

                                     BOURNE
                         Not really.

               Beat. He smiles.

                                     MARIE
                         It's not a problem.

               Her turn to smile. And we...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
